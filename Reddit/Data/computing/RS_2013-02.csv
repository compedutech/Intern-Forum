I landed an IT internship in the summer and need some advice on how to get more prepared for it. 

I know that internships are there to help gain experience and to have you learn the ropes with real systems, but I feel like I need to grow my knowledge so I can integrate with the company quickly and not dissapoint.

I'll be doing projects for the most part, and a little bit of support. I do have the LPIC-1 certification (mainly got it to help learn linux more intimately) but I don't often practice sysadmin type projects at home because I never felt that I needed to.

Any advice on how to be a better intern? I'm focusing on Linux but any advice is helpful"

I know a handful of languages well (Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby, various web design) and have a good GPA, but have had no professional experience programming and want to get started asap so I can possibly get a better internship next summer when I have more experience.

Anyone know any good ones locally that I can get my foot in the door with? Maybe even within GMU if that exists. Also I'd love to at least get paid but I'm not sure if that's pushing my luck. "
17p194,11,2013-02-01,I'd like to hear your professional stories. How did you end up where you are?,ExplosiveHippo,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17p194/id_like_to_hear_your_professional_stories_how_did/,"Hi /r/webdev. I'm currently a university student (almost a senior) and my ultimate goal is to become a web developer. I thought it would be interesting to see how others got to where they are now. I guess it wouldn't be fair if I didn't share my story.

I started out around 14 or 15 I think, playing an online game. I eventually became a moderator on the forum for the game and many of the other moderators where heavy web geeks. That inspired me to start messing with HTML and CSS. I did a bit but never really got super heavy into it. 

I knew I wanted to do something with computers but I figured I'd want to repair computers or help set up systems. In my junior and senior year of highschool I went to trade school half day for computer repair and networking. I ended up getting my A+ certification but by the time I finished the program I'd really lost interest in fixing computers. It was really the same thing over and over and I required something a bit more creative.

I ended up going to a community college for web technologies and finally got a good grasp of HTML and CSS. I then starting taking classes in Javascript and Java and had some serious doubts in my ability. I just wasn't getting it and got very discouraged. I ended up getting through community college with pretty decent grades but felt like I really lacked much knowledge outside of being able to Google everything. I ended up getting an internship as a web designer and developer (developer as in HTML/CSS and jQuery plugins) which I worked at through my whole community college degree. This really helped me get a better grasp on my skills and I learned a ton. It was great.

I kept my head up though because I really enjoyed it when it worked. I then started to attend a real university. A highly established tech university in my state. Once I got in it gave me a big confidence boost that I *could* do this. I finally dedicated myself to it and I had matured a lot since community college. I'm now finally starting to feel like I can definitely do this as a career. I've finally started to break through the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" phase and it feels great. This past Summer I co oped at a large supermarket's corporate office as primarily a web designer (I've always loved the design aspect of it too and I'm fairly good at it) with some development stuff on the side.

I'm finally in my last year of college and will be doing another co op this Summer and by next Summer I'll be graduated and be searching for full time work. I'm hoping everything works out but I have high hopes!

So, webdev. How did you get where you are? Is there anything you wish you had done differently. Any advice for us younger guys (and gals) getting in the business? (Sorry for such a long post!)"

17ophe,1,2013-02-01,I still love her and only time will tell.,AsWeWalk,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/17ophe/i_still_love_her_and_only_time_will_tell/,"I am a guy and I met her freshman year in college and for a year it was amazing. Then we got to that point where neither of us had ever gotten to in a relationship before. The time after the initial ""honeymoon"" stage. We struggled and I thought she wanted to end it. So after a couples weeks of struggling, her attitude toward me made me feel like she wanted it to be over and I felt like it would be best to give her that. So I decided to confront her and tell her that it feels like she just wants this to end, so I said I would do it for her.

After a week, we both had ended up making out with friends that we both had been attracted to during our relationship. We both had different reactions to this. When we had our experiences, neither of us knew of the others. After my experience, I missed her way too much and decided to tell her that. After hers and me telling her how I felt, she was conflicted. She hated what she had done but she couldn't decide if she wanted to be with him or me. Eventually, we both severed ties with our friends and got back together.

This new relationship lasted 3 weeks and she broke it off. She said she loved being single and missed it. Needless to say I was devastated but I saw the signs leading up to it, so I had braced myself for it. Over the next month we tried to be friends and I tried to adjust but it still haunted me. I wanted to be with her. So I told her and she blew me off for a week by not responding to anything I messaged to her. She just thought in order for us to get over each other, we had to just not talk or see each other. At the end of that week, I begged her to just let me talk to her once. She agreed. After talking, we rekindled our friendship (which was more like best friends). This lead into summer break after sophomore year.

About 2 weeks into summer break we met up, since we live a good distance away from each other, to see a movie and hang out. After this we realized how much we loved being with each other and got back together. We talked everyday over break, hung out a couple weekends, and couldn't wait to be back at school together.

Everything starts out great back at school. We have fun and it just couldn't be better. Then she just switches to this different person. She stops wanting to hang out as much and keeps giving excuses as to why she can't. Well this goes by for 1.5 weeks and I see her once in that time. It's the night before my 21st and I ask her to talk. She agrees. We talk and I ask her the important question. ""Do you want to be with me?"" She just answers, ""No."" I tell her it's okay, give her a hug, tell her that I understand, and say that I wish she would have just talked to me about it. We both smile and leave her room. She then out of nowhere asks, ""I can't believe you are taking this so well. Wait, is there someone else?"" I was floored, but I calmly say. There is no way that there is anyone else.

We become good friends after this and even become friends with benefits for a while. After the semester we talk about getting back together, but we both agreed it was a bad idea since she was going abroad the next semester. She visited my family for Christmas, but we said we were just friends. We end up talking a lot more than expected while she was abroad and when she gets back we got back together. I told her that I really missed her and we talked about potentially where our future could take us. We both figured at this point our relationship won't end anymore. We couldn't stand being apart for those months without seeing each other.

We were great again, but only up until my birthday...again. The same thing happened where she ignored me, so I talked to her and this break up was just as smooth. (I hated this...) We then became friends with benefits and had fun. It seemed like she loved it more when we weren't attached, but she loved being with me. 

By the end of the semester, I gave her an ultimatum type question. Either I want to be with her or I wanted to stop this and get on with my life. She just responded to the question with I don't know. This really bothered me, so I kind of just quit. I tried to not hang out with her much over the next 3 days until I went to talk to her and told her that I felt that it would be best for us to stop seeing each other because we both had issues we needed to deal with in our own lives.
(I was dealing with anxiety induced by school which led to depression and she did not know this. I felt she couldn't handle a relationship and the stress of her load with an internship, classes, and extracurriculars.)

After that night she just asked one thing of me. That I do not date anyone for the rest of college because it would be too hard to see it. I agreed and asked the same of her. She also agreed.

We still did friends with benefits stuff over the course of the rest of the semester. I then told her that I loved her the day I left for break while we cuddled in my bed. The very next day, she goes on a date with someone. I was devastated.

It has been 2 months since. I am taking this semester off to deal with things and she is now in a relationship with this new guy and completely ignores any attempt I make at trying to be in a friendship.

Throughout this entire experience I have loved her and still do. I wanted to propose at graduation. I still think about her everyday and wish that there was something I could do to make myself forget about her or get her to at least talk to me again. The only thing that makes sense to me is that time heals all."
17opgg,3,2013-02-01,So I am a little confused about the levels of surgeons depicted in Grey's.. Can someone help explain?,blazeofglory94,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/17opgg/so_i_am_a_little_confused_about_the_levels_of/,"Ok so I have been re-watching all seasons and I am a little confused. Grey, Yang, Stevens, Karev and O'Malley started as Bailey's interns. Bailey was a third year resident. That took a year and then they were all second year residents. Little Grey and co were then the second year residents interns.

Burke, Shepard, Montgomery, Sloane are all attendings. They are the bosses of Torres, Bailey and co.

Now.. A few seasons later, we get Robbins (attending). Bailey is promoted and so is Torres. Still no interns for these two.

Last season, our first lot of interns, apply for fellowships, and take them at SGMW. They aren't attendings, but Torres, Robbins, Bailey, Shepard, Montgomery, Sloane are. Torres and Bailey skipped a fellowship? And the others never spoke of anything other than being attendings.

Now that Grey, Yang, Karev, Avery and Kepner are fellows, they have interns.. Again.. Why does little Grey's class not have interns when they begin their second year? Why are big Grey and co the only non-residents with interns?

Also, let's assume when big Grey and Derek met, Derek was a first year attending. They are interns for one year, then residents for 4 more (fifth year res gets chief res) plus a year of fellow? That makes Derek at least 7 years older.. And then Mark and little Grey would be at least 8 but I feel like Mark is older than Derek..

Anyway.. My question is.. If Yang, Grey and co got interns immediately after they completed theirs, where are little Grey's interns? And in this season, Yang, Grey and co are the only 'dark blue scrub' wearing people to have interns..

Can anyone explain why there is this inconsistency in new interns? "

I hate my brother and I hate my mother and I hate everyone. Most of all I hate myself. I hate that I know this is all my fault and that I am the problem.  I wish I could just hate everyone else and not know that deep down its just me who is good for nothing. I wish I could just stop surviving. 

I wish I didn't have an anger problem. I wish I didn't care about anything. I wish I'd stop feeling so worthless. I wish all my hard work and 8 years of schooling would be be so useless. 

I wish I was pretty so that my bf wouldn't stare at my hot friend instead of me. I wish in was pretty so he would want to show me off to his friends. I wish I didn't feel so jealous of all my friends who are either pretty, or doing well,  or both. I wish I had SOMETHING. I wish I wasn't so bad at everything. I know they're talking about me. I can hear them. My mom and my brother. Taking about the outburst I just had right now. They're probably saying how crazy I am. They're probably right. 


I wish I was weak enough to just break already. This barely hanging on is horrible. I wish I wasn't sick so I could just backpack across the country and live on scraps. I wish I wasn't such a goddamn disappointment. 

It's living with them. I need to get out of this house. That's what I need. I'm just a burden - i dont contribute, all I do is create problems and fight. I'm just useless. I'm just stuck. And I can't take it anymore."

TLDR: If you had access to a web app which coherently presented visualized financial data, would you use it? What features/analyses/things would you like to see in an app like this?




Hi all, I'm currently a finance student [~~insert usual stuff about being super motivated, or knowing a lot for my age, or despite being from a non-target with a less-than-stellar GPA I'm a super active networker, or- my favorite- my amazing 999% returns in my paper portfolio~~]
I've came to realize that programming will play an important part in my career, since it's a great way to distinguish yourself and help automate monotonous shit in the office, which is pretty much what you have to deal with as an intern anyway. So the reasoning was - work smarter, not harder. I figure the best way to learn is by doing. I'm working side by side with a programmer who can show me the ropes; meanwhile I'll be educating him on some fundamental finance. 

We're working on a program which would essentially provide visual interpretations of company and stock data. The users will be able to see a variety of charts and other graphics which should be helpful in decision making. Eventually, we expect to also integrate new stories. There will likely be a way to enter your portfolio, and if this really kicks off we would gladly incorporate APIs. 

So, the reason I'm posting this is to see if there would be an interest for a web app like this? I understand there's a plethora of tools available, but from my research I've noticed very few of them take advantage of pre-attentive processing (which makes it almost intuitive) so I hope we can fill that gap.

What are some features you would like to see in this? (Besides insider information haha) We hope to hear back from both long and short term investors

17odth,0,2013-01-31,"Building a Math-related programming ""portfolio"" (Mathematic/Octave/Matlab)",[deleted],math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/17odth/building_a_mathrelated_programming_portfolio/,"Hello!

This is a bit of an odd request but I'm wondering what you guys thought would be good small(ish) projects to have in a Matlab ""portfolio"" (or Mathematica). I'm a first year math major and in order to get some experience I offered my help to a professor of the applied math department for this summer. The university offers some funding to students who wish to apply for it but it's amazingly competitive (4.1+ GPA while I'm probably closer to 3.5) and 2nd/3rd year students are usually a more obvious choice for the department. What I did though is offered to do it for free. I have enough money aside so I don't really have to work this summer and getting this experience would be worth a lot more than 3 months worth of minimum-wage work. 

While I'm still a first year student and my mathematical knowledge can't bring much to the table, I'm pretty confident my CS knowledge is above the average undergrad student in the department (I did do a few years of a CS undergrad before moving to math on top of doing a lot of programming, especially in C since I was in early high school) which I think gives me a bit of an edge. This semester I'm taking a class based around Mathematica and I've been able to pick it up pretty quickly (we're 2 weeks in but I've been able to do last semester's midterm, thanks to the built-in help!) and I used it for a few fun projects at well. My Matlab experience is mostly doing assignments for a friend of mine taking engineering who hates programming as well as messing around with GNU/Octave.

What I'm working on now is a bit of a CV for myself to present to this professor. He wants to know what kind of experience I have as well as see a bit of what I'm capable of (I'm assuming). Unfortunately I don't have a lot of math-related projects on hand (my biggest projects are mostly interpreters/compilers in C) so I thought I'd work on a few diverse projects to have something to show. What do you guys think would be interesting to show? It obviously have to be something complicated enough that it doesn't look like I just Google'd pieces of code and glued them together but small enough that I don't spend the next 3 months on it. Any ideas?

**tl;dr** Basically trying to impress a professor who could consider me for an unpaid internship this summer. I unfortunately don't have much to show him so I'm looking for a few projects I could work on.

Thanks!"

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

A haunting in Taylor’s Falls
By: Josh Stanway 

If you don’t believe in ghosts, don’t worry, I didn’t either. That view may have changed after I spent 5 hours with the Minnesota Paranormal Investigation Group in the Old Jail Bed and Breakfast, a famously haunted building located right in TF. I entered the building to be greeted by  Don Lawrence, the owner of the Old jail, and two of our investigation group, Rocky and Diana. Rocky is a tech expert, while Diana is a medium who deals with the more spiritual side of ghost hunting. 
	
After I had been in the building for a few minutes, don started to tell the stories of his granddaughter always seeing the spirit of a little boy. What was even creepier was that several guests had also documented this same spirit of a young boy, one stating that their child had seen the boy, and that the spirit was upset that the family would be staying in their room. Other potential spirits included: an old steamship captain who would walk from room to room smoking a cigar, an old lady that would sometimes accompany the young boy, and the spirit of a prostitute that would wear chokingly strong perfume and tear down the curtains. 
A few minutes after this, two more members of the group entered, John and his wife Anita. Anita is British, and did tours through some famously haunted castles, including the castle that Henry the eight used as his hunting lodge. We took a tour of the upstairs, including a room that a man had been dead for three days in before he was found. I felt a bit uncomfortable in that room, like I was being watched. After that we toured the other building before the group unpacked all their gear. 	
	
They first set up their investigation gear in the basement room of the B &amp; B, where a cave full of broken glass, bones, and pottery had been discovered. John and rocky set up microphones and night vision cameras, along with an electro magnetic field sensor, which can detect any entity’s presence, visible or not. 
	

John started the session attempting to communicate with the spirits using an EVP sensor, which can detect the voice of a spirit that others around it cannot detect. He started by asking the spirit simple questions.. to hear a spirits voice with an EVP, you need to listen to the playback, but none of those questions had elicited a response. He explained to me that if I were a ghost and a bunch of strangers waltzed up to me and started questioning me, what incentive would I have to communicate with them? I answered none, which is most often true. This is why it can be hard to communicate with an entity that is present.
 
After this, the rest of the group entered the suite, and Diana suggested we use a spirit box to attempt to open communication with them.  Diana explained it to me. “a spirit box is a machine that cycles through radio stations at a hundred stations per second. It allows a spirit to openly communicate with humans in real time” which is more than an EVP can do. We all sat in the corner with the spirit box running, and John and Diana questioned the spirits about all things that could relate to themselves or the building. 

After a few minutes of only static as a response, we moved into a different part of the suite. This time, john also recorded the session of the spirit box with is EVP sensor.  Right away when we started the spirit box, a mans voice said “Talk” with surprising clarity, and I immediately felt uncomfortable. I didn’t say anything and the session continued. We heard several more things, including a prolonged squeal I interpreted as Childs laughter, and “in the other room” which sufficiently frightened me. 

After this we went into the main floor where we were given pizza and the group further discussed the presence of spirits. Then myself, Rocky and Diana ventured upstairs to attempt to “scrye” out the spirits. Scrying is a method of communication with spirits that involves staring at another persons face across a candle. It is supposed to create positive energy between both parties involved, and give their faces appearence of the others past life, and potentially, entities around them. I had believed this to be silly, and I was of the impression that it would not work for me. However, after Diana had scryed with rocky several time, she had me switch places with him. 

I stared at her. She stared at me. In my mind, I knew this was all that was going to happen. But then, her face took the shape of a skull. Yes, a human skull. I was mortified, to say the least. I was shaken and terrified. The skull had appeared so realistic. I didn’t want to attempt it again, but Diana urged me on, and I accepted. This time she turned into a young Japanese girl and then a very old, angry woman. She informed me I had become two different Native American warriors, with similar facial paintings. This made her assume that both the warriors were from the same tribe. No spirits appeared to either of us, unfortunately, and at this point it was almost eleven o’clock, and I had to head for home.
	
I said goodbye to the group and left, but they stayed there for several more hours. I was positive I didn’t believe in ghosts. But now, I’m not so sure.

17rkj5,14,2013-02-02,My sister's stupid fucking wedding,stupid_fucker,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/17rkj5/my_sisters_stupid_fucking_wedding/,"My sister and I grew up together taking care of ourselves. We were poor as shit and our parents had to work many jobs just to have enough to eat. Poor as in sometimes we couldn't afford the $0.40 school reduced cut lunches. My parents worked their way up, sacrificing everything, and now they can afford her a luxury like a fucking $10,000+ wedding.

I am to be her maid of honor, with six other bridesmaids in the party. Then comes the time to buy the dresses, in which she forced my parents to foot the bill for half the dresses. I had to buy my own because she didn't want to ask money from her friends. Whatever, angry time #1. After this, her friend didn't like her dress so my sister GAVE her friend MY dress without asking me ever, forcing me to shell out another $250 for another one.

I've never said anything to her about it, except that I think it's shitty that she let her friend have two FREE dresses and I have to shell out $500 total. I complain and she gets my parents to try to buy me out. I'm not okay with this. I got fitted today and the conversation turned to the old dress again after I found out my mom gave my sister my parent's credit card to spend whatever the fuck she wants, including the alterations to her dress and I had to pay for mine.

I brought it up to her again, not even asking for the money back. All I wanted was an apology and a confession that she continually chooses her friends over her family. She then freaked the fuck out and said that she has been paying for the entire wedding even though she got $3000 from my parents for Christmas just for her reception. I told her that she hasn't paid for everything- or really anything for that matter, to which she started screaming at me in the car with my mother on the ride home telling me that I need to ""shut the fuck up"" and that I need to ""grow up"" and to ""pull over the car, she has to get the fuck out and walk home."" My mother was driving and I was five miles away. When I didn't get out the car to walk home she started to call me names and say hurtful things and about how she thinks family members are more appropriate to foot the bill for her wedding and not her friends.

I wasn't letting up, but I also wasn't being an asshole. I just kept saying I wanted an apology. She then tried to open the car door and jump out to get away from me when we were driving 50 mph on a major six lane road, causing my mother to panic and scream.

My mother has cancer right now and my parents are getting to the age where they need to start thinking about retirement and medical bills. The fact that she did that to my mother is the most abhorrent act I've ever witnessed. My mother who gave her everything.

Combined with the fact that I'm broke as fuck. I only have $4 to my name until next week when I get paid and I'm too proud to even ask for a small trip to the grocery store to eat a normal fucking meal, and not sips of the last almond milk and whatever fucking leftover dried out cheese slices. I want to do it my own way and I don't want my parents to have to sacrifice any more than they already have.

I just don't understand how she can't feel even a little bit guilty about her $200+ trips to Victoria's Secret, her $1000+ shopping sprees, her $20,000 initial wedding reception, but cancelled last minute and lost my parent's $10,000 to have it a year later. Draining their savings, just to give her something they never thought they could.

I'm just so sick of her. I'm sick of her bridezilla bullshit. Her excuse to freak out and try to jump out in traffic going 50 mph, even as a threat. I'm sick of her never talking to me unless it's about her wedding, for over a year now. Her not even trying to apologize. Her throwing tantrums in public. Her shitty and victim attitude. Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her. She's a selfish fucking bully who has tormented me since I was a child. And I have to see her again in a few hours, where I'm sure she'll give me the silent treatment and ruin my dad's birthday party tonight. Fuck her. Worst part is, she's gone through medical school, she's currently living at home rent and expense free for her internships, and still thinks the world owes her something in her late 20's. FUCK."
17rfxd,3,2013-02-02,[C++] Image Processing and memory leaks ,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/17rfxd/c_image_processing_and_memory_leaks/,"Background: Student minoring in Computer Science; internship and way over my head with the project requests....

Unfortunately I won't be able to post any code as it is copyright, but I am looking for any references/advice. All the code is C++ and the IDE I am using is Visual C++ 6.0 (I know this is old but it's what most of the original code was written in). 

I have been asked to add a match value to indicate how similar two images are. Thus far I have been approaching this by trying to binarize an ROI for each image and compare the two using a matlab algorithm. This is where things get rough.... I have been working on this project for a week now and have barely made it anywhere. While I have been able to print out bitmaps of the binarized ROI's for some examples every time I think I fix something it breaks for a different image (often one that used to work). Most of the project relies on using previously written functions but this program is HUGE! I am having a hard time navigating through it, and am approaching the limit of my abilities to debug.

My concerns are as follows: 

-Does this seem like the right approach to the problem?

-I need to learn more about image processing, fast: ROI managing, how bufferes work, how multi-threaded processes initiate, GUI work in C++. Any suggestions?

-There is a memory leak somewhere in the program (one that I probably introduced) but am not sure how to find it. I have two object instantiations on the heap but have made sure to call delete and assign the pointers to null (in that order). Any common places for MEM leaks in image processing? I know some of you will ask: no, I am not sure I need heap allocation but do not understand enough about multithreaded processes so I thought this might be the safer approach? In retrospect that might be a terrible assumption... 


Really appreciate any constructive comments this community could give me. I am working on this project for the most part by myself... Should I possibly post these questions in /r/programming or stackoverflow? I just didn't know where to go as  I said before I won't be able to post code. Sorry for length. "

Being a teenager is tough.  Sometimes you just need to ask some questions, and I know a lot of you will have nobody you feel comfortable asking.  So from the comfortable anonymity of the net, ask away!  

I'm 22 - old enough that I've been through college and gotten a job, young enough that I'm not too far removed from the problems you'll all be experiencing now and in the near future. 

I've had experience with lots of the things you guys are or will be going through, and I'm an open book - nothing you ask will offend or surprise me, and I will respond to everything.  If you don't feel comfortable asking here, pm me and I'll respond. 

Some topic ideas:

- Sex
- Drugs
- College
- Jobs and Internships
- Relationships
- Video games

I can even show you some of my awkward teenage stages if you want."

I try to be brief in my resume (not that there are many items in the first place). I hear recruiters like to see that the student has taken data structure and algorithms, so I include the corresponding classes in there (Program and Data Representation; and Algorithms).

I feel that my not having any personal projects is a big weakness, which I think should be either be bigger in scope, more relevant, more polished, or more unique compared to class projects. As a result, I feel very anxious about looking for an internship. The only source of confidence I have is that in the programming assignments I have had so far, I rarely needed help from the professor or TA, and instead persevered through willpower and good old friend google."

I've been having breast pain for about a month on my left side. It wasn't so bad at first and I just moved across the country to start a new internship 3 weeks ago. Just little twinges here and there and a bit of tenderness. Last weekend it got terrible. Wearing a bra hurts so badly, it's more tender than it's ever been. And it just didn't feel right. So I made myself an appointment at Planned Parenthood. I'd never been there before and the doctor there was such a godsend. She was so nice to me, and the visit barely cost me anything since I only just started working... I swear I'll donate to them every year until I die.

But she felt that my breast tissue had hardened, and recommended seeing a breast specialist. Which all of them around here are in cancer centers. My mom died from cancer when I was two, a very close guy friend of mine just barely beat testicular cancer 6 months ago. I'm so scared. I'm only 21. I called the best looking place I could find on the list she gave me and got an appointment for Monday morning... I don't know what to expect. I don't know what's going to happen.

I had a really hard time adjusting to college work as my high school was really easy to just coast by in. I made it through the first 3 semesters with something like a 3.0 then through some circumstances and stress in the non-academic world basically I fell into a cycle of depression. I dropped most of my classes the 4th semester, failed the other 2. Went home for summer got a job, thought I would be okay, and then failed again the next fall semester. My GPA is now a 2.0, I have no hope of doing computer engineering anymore (I'm not good at the EE) and am transfering to comp sci major. 

I've been going to counseling this semester and the latter part of the previous semester, still have my job (transferred to a store here. it's retail, but i need it to pay the rent) and am doing better now but I'm still struggling to succeed. I really don't expect my GPA to get much above a 2.5 or 2.75.

My questions are basically: 1) What should I be doing alongside making better grades to help me. 2) What can I do to get noticed/get a job seeing as I now will never get those ""Minimum 3.5 gpa"" job/internship requirements I see on almost every posting.

 I sent out some resumes/applications for summer internships around thanksgiving and haven't heard anything back yet.

17tcwr,2,2013-02-03,[QUESTION] Looking for a tablet. Please help out a fellow redditor... :),ICanHandleTheTruths,tablets,https://www.reddit.com/r/tablets/comments/17tcwr/question_looking_for_a_tablet_please_help_out_a/,"Hey guys.

I am sick and tired of laptops as they keep crashing and failing -- not to mention their inherent immobility.

My 800-900 dollar laptop has been bugging out for the last year, and now it is too bad for me to handle. I was thinking about getting a tablet so that I cannot play high-end games so that I can get more work done. I am studying at the university and make a significant amount of projects. Additionally, I am going to China for my internship in autumn, so I would like to use my future tab for work as well.

As such, I am looking for a tab that is sturdy, while being able to play movies, play music, read PDF files, good to okay'ish for note-taking, and good for writing projects.

Now, my projects don't have a ton of visual stuff that would be problematic for a tablet. All that is needed for the project work is the ability to use a keyboard for writing. 

The tab and keyboard should be fairly cheap as I am a student, and money going to this tab will take money from my trip to China. I'm counting on spending about the same amount of cash as the Ipad 2 costs -- not including the accessories, ofc, in case the keyboard isn't part of the product. 
I would love for the capability to have GPS so that I can find my way around Beijing or Shanghai.

Any suggestions? Is it dumb of me to get a tab? I've read about bloggers using their tabs heavily for writing stuff, so it appears to be decent if used with a keyboard. Should I get a notebook instead? even though that won't allow me to be mobile and read on the bus and such. It would really be easier if I had a tab with a keyboard case -- but maybe it is naive or me to think that it will work?

Thoughts?

P.S: If you say that a tab can't be used for writing, please state why. =)"

I am a second-year (out of 3) student in UK, studying Economics in a target university. I'm trying to get into Back office (Finance) position
For the past 4 months I've been trying really hard to secure an internship in IB. Out of 30+ applications I have sent, I only got 4 invites to interviews, all others rejected me instantly.
I built my CV with careers advice staff at university, and there are a few positions of responsibility and finance/research/economics based projects on it.
At this point, I am almost sure that I won't get an internship, and would like to focus on developing new skills that would be useful and would potentially look good on the CV. 
From this subreddit I have found out that learning Excel is always useful and I have recently enrolled in a MS Office Professional training course, someone else also suggested learning a programming language. 
Is there anything else that you guys could suggest ?

P.S. English is not my first language, sorry any mistakes.

tl;dr: I won't get an internship in IB (back office - Finance), would like to learn something (Excel, etc) that would improve my chances of getting in. Suggestions ?"
17su8o,1,2013-02-03,Like that.,Zamaraf,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17su8o/like_that/,"There I am, soon to be hitting that quarter of a century years old, still in the same situation since 6 years. I was accepted a year ago in education at the university, entered with my job experience in a youth center. 

-Prior to that, I was a multiple school drop-out in college, wasn’t able to attend to classes because I was late, or had nada motivation to get to school.-

Went to the local health center last week to get tricks to develop my organisation skills and through that, my motivation, I will have consultations in three month.

From 4 courses, I canceled 3 of them, one was my internship, which is gonna delay my diplomation to 1 year later, more debts, more motivation to build and not drop another time. Much more free time to waste on computer games. I’m a compulsive gamer, I lack that electric impulse in my muscle and brain to make my body stand up from in front of that computer and make something of my life, projects, achieve something once in a while. I’m in the prime of youth, or… well it is getting behind more and more and I am still not… proud of myself. Feeling incomplete, deliberately not using my capacities. But I don’t know how, and don’t know how to snap out of that debilating routine in front of that computer screen. 

Got myself thinking about an incident about 3 years ago when I got backstabbed in the middle of the night for no apparent reason and I got wondering what if that dude succeeded. I guess the response is obvious but still, it lingers from time to time.


UGH, 4 in the morning, we meet again.

17sogv,4,2013-02-03,All I can think about is a rope around my neck,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17sogv/all_i_can_think_about_is_a_rope_around_my_neck/,"It's become less of a thought and more of an urge, again. How it would feel to hang from a rafter, to plunge a 5 inch knife into my neck, just above the jugular, and cut from ear to ear (that one's my favorite), to feel the trail of a bullet trace it's way from my forehead, through my brain, and pop right out the back. 

They're urges that yield results. How do I mean? When I take my fist and push it against my neck, as if I'm holding a knife, and imagine the blade sliding through my flesh, I feel a real sense of relief and satisfaction.

I feel it most every day. From when I wake up to when I go to bed. It makes my legs weak, my chest sink, and creates a sensation as though someone is tuggung on my esophagus. I'm going to puke.

The anxiety hangs behind my eyes, engulfing my senses in a numbness I can't quite push away. It has triggers. Triggers I've taken the time to distinguish, but I have no idea how to deal with them. 

I'm living a good life. Full time student, a good internship, an accomplished and loved local DJ. What the fuck do I have to be depressed about anymore? I guess the last 5 years of my life I spent numb and alone really made a lasting impact.

I don't sleep. I don't relax. I'm stressed 100% of the time.

I thought I was okay. I thought I was getting better, but it's all falling apart again, worse than last time. I don't know what to do."

Ring bearing is hard man.  Not at all. Shit happens. That's why we filmed it. I mean, when things go wrong, it can often times make documentaries more intersting.

Then I remembered I'd met Nick a couple months earlier when he came to visit our office. And Nick was perfect: a talented film professional, a fan of Rooster Teeth, and physically able to do it. Plus he's just an awesome guy. And after realizing all of that, we decided to have a third person come with us on the walk. And that was the best decision we made. -Chris.

[What do you prefer about LOTR in the books and films? Like, what bits were skipped from the books that you liked, and what scenes were better in the films? Also, what do you think about the Hobbit being three movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lx3?context=5)|I love both the books and the movies. I read The Hobbit when I was 12 and then immediately went and bought LoTR (and a map of Middle Earth so I could follow along). When I finished the books and heard they were making movies, I was stoked. I still remember the first time I saw the trailer in theaters. I got goosebumps and my stomach dropped. I was sad the scouring of the shire wasn't in the movies, but as a filmmaker myself, I understand why it wasn't included. I thought it was ridiculous they were making The Hobbit into three movies when I first heard about it, but I also trust Peter Jackson so I'm excited to see the next two. Plus, it means two more movies of Middle Earth. -Chris.
 |I'm a big fan of both. My favorite scene out of the series is coming up, when Bilbo and Smaug first talk in his den. Pretty excited for that. I trust Peter Jackson and I feel like there is enough content to work with, so I'm excited that it's going to be 3 movies.

They thought it was brilliant/dumb. Much like a lot of my ideas as a child. This one didn't end in a hospital trip so that was good.
 |Kerry.
 |Well, you actually see my mom in it but after that skype session she told me how genuinely worried she was. My sister thought I was insane. And I don't think any of them thought we would finish but they were supportive. I mean, they kind of had to be because they knew I was going to do it regardless. - Chris.
[Which prior ideas of yours have resulted in hospital trips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8861zm?context=5)|Deciding that I wanted to use a chisel to make art when I was 4.

That meant working non-stop for 3 weeks and pretty much living in the office. I also developed Bronchitis during the trip so that plus no sleep made post-production almost as difficult as the actual walk. But thankfully editing doesn't require you to move your feet. -Chris.

 |Kerry.
 |I would do it again but take a lot more time with it so it wouldn't be as painful. New Zealand is absolutely beautiful and it was amazing just seeing the country while we walked. That being said, I'd rather attempt a different adventure in the future than do this one twice. -Chris

I hate wall of texts so I'm going to break it down into bullet points.

* Boyfriend and I have known each other since March 2012.  He moved out to New York for the summer and we saw other people.  Have been officially dating since the end of October.

* Recently got cleared to start hiking again (broken ankle) and wanted to go on an extended trip so I went on a 3 day road trip (Friday afternoon-2:30a Monday) with my best friend from college, who happens to be a guy. My friend and I had been talking about going on a road trip for awhile but plans were not finalized until the Monday until before we left. I wanted to invite my boyfriend with but he is in law school, has multiple internships, as well as Arabic classes on Sunday, and I didn't want to pressure him into feeling obligated to go. 

* My friend and I at one point were unsure of our feelings for on another so we went on one date.  It was terribly awkward and we both decided we were better off friends.  This took place 3 years ago.  I had told my boyfriend this, but forgot to include the part that it happened so long ago.  

* While on our road trip we went to visit one of my female friends from high school and stayed at her house.  At no point did my friend and I share a bedroom and my high school friend joined us on all of our excursions.  Boyfriend knew we were staying my high school friend but wasn't aware of the sleeping situation as I can have a tendency to forget to include all the details.

* I texted the boyfriend during periods of cell service, saying things like ""I love you.""  Also called a few times, which were very strained.  Asked boyfriend if everything was ok and he stated he was stressed from school and work.

* On way back home I dropped my friend off at his apartment and then drove over to my boyfriends place to spend the rest of the night.  As we lay down to sleep the boyfriend says he felt very disrespected by my vacation.  He doesn't trust my friend and feels that if we weren't in a relationship that my friend would be trying to sleep with me, obviously finds me attractive, it's not normal for girlfriends to go on trips with guy friends, etc.  We talk, until 5a in the morning, with me filling in the information I forgot to initially include.  He says he feels better but is still wary of my friend, stating that it was disrespectful of my friend to propose a trip to me without running it by him.

So basically, is my behavior out of the norm?  While I do have female friends I have a tendency to be closer to my guy friends.  My guy friends climb, hike, camp, shoot, etc while my female friends like to gossip and watch girly television shows.  

Also, it seems double standard-y since the following weekend he had his female roommate drive him to an important doctors appointment and then spend the rest of the day meeting with her parents (a 14 hour trip overall, that he neglected to tell me about until a few days before hand).

tl;dr-traveling with opposite sex, communication failure, ugh.

PS- boyfriend has been linked post in case I have been overly biased.

**Edit:** Forgot to include that I had asked boyfriend if he was ok with the trip and boyfriend agreed to it and then later said he had reservations but didn't expound upon them.  Partially because I never probed and he didn't want to feel like an overbearing boyfriend.

**Edit2:** Boyfriend says it's not so much he didn't trust him but that he doesn't know him well enough and was operating on limited info and that limited info wasn't very good. Also, he didn't want to say anything while I was on the trip because he didn't want me to worry."

17vfpa,3,2013-02-04,"A really long, rambling writing about my current relationship. Just need to get everything out.",ConflictedDragon,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17vfpa/a_really_long_rambling_writing_about_my_current/,"I honestly don’t really know what I am hoping to gain from writing this. I know that I am doing it at the request of my significant other, and that this is mostly done to appease him. I suppose aside from that, I am mainly doing this as a way to let everything inside my head out. Giving voice to the feelings that I always have to keep a tight rein on might help lessen their influence. 

It’s hard to even think of where to begin. Four years seems like such a short time, looking back at everything, but at the same time, trying to summarize all of the important events that have led to where I am now, especially in reference to a relationship, makes four years seem impossibly long.

Our relationship was really never supposed to happen. We met at a party, and I had every intention of it to be a one-night stand. I had recently moved and started attending college. The relationship I had been in crumbled when my boyfriend said I wasn’t worth moving for. It was too risky for him to quit his job to move with me, and he didn’t want to do a long distance relationship. At the time my 20-year-old self was crushed. I felt so unwanted. I spent the first two months after my move alone, trying to cope with the depression I was feeling. 

It was only after classes started that I began socializing with a few people that I seemed to click pretty well with. One night I was invited to a party, which I agreed to go to completely at random. I had no intentions of finding another boyfriend, I wasn’t even looking for anything sexual. When I started getting hit on by my current partner my first instinct was to leave. Part of me wanted the attention, though. It felt nice to know that I was still wanted and viewed as attractive. That part of me wanted to feel sexy. It was very out of character for me since I am mostly reserved and withdrawn from people, but he ended up coming home with me, and we had an awesome night. That part of me that wanted the attention also wanted to prove that I didn’t need a relationship to survive. I could have sex, and have it just be sex. 

I’m not really sure if all of that back story really matters in the grand scheme of things, but for me it does. My first relationship lasted for 5 years. I was very close to my first boyfriend, and truly viewed him as one of my best and closest friends. We actually still talk to each other, and I have been invited to attend his wedding. In comparison, the interaction that I was having with my current significant other was hallow and empty. There were not emotions invested in what we were doing.

I do not have that closeness with my current partner that I had with my first, and I feel part of that a large part of that has to do with how we met. We never had a foundation of friendship. After the first night it was supposed to be over, and I think it would have been except that he moved in with one of my classmates who lived in the same apartment complex as me, so I saw him fairly often. He would stay over more and more often until he pretty much stopped going ‘home’, and stayed with me as a way to not pay rent to my classmate. It was more out of convenience for him. I never asked for rent money, or help with paying for groceries since he didn’t have a job at the time.  I never nagged about job hunting. I never asked for help taking care of the apartment, or chores, or anything. He pretty much stayed at my apartment all day playing computer games. Looking back on it I feel I put up with that more because of my insecurities. I felt that if I said or did anything that would make him unhappy that I would become unwanted again, and I didn’t want to feel that way. 

There was never love or real affection involved in any of it in the beginning, and while I was ok with that for a while, eventually I started becoming depressed again. I missed cuddling after sex, or having someone who wanted me to cum. Sex was not about pleasure anymore with him. It was about him getting off and that was it.  I missed having someone that I felt I could talk to. Any time he asked for my opinion on something, and if my view differed from his he would run it over with his own view on things and tell me how what I felt or thought was wrong. It made me feel unvalued since I am of the mind set that a different opinion isn’t wrong, it’s just different. 

While for the most part we lined up sexually, I am a submissive as well as a masochist, and there are certain things that I enjoy sexually that most people would find extreme. My current partner, at the time, thought that my sexual wants were signs that I was mentally unstable, and that I needed medication.  I tried to explain my point of view, but he was never interested in exploring a BDSM style relationship, and so I felt a very important part of my personality was withering and dying. 

I had been comfortable with myself, my submission, and my sexual need for pain in my previous relationships. This was the first time that I was being told that I was bad, or ‘fucked up’ because of it. So along with feeling starved of affection, I was also being denied something that I felt I needed. I tried going without the pain and submission because I wanted him to be happy, and because I did not want to be alone, but eventually I could not keep going with it and I kicked him out of my apartment. It was hard for me. It was the first time I had broken up with someone, and I felt like a terrible person. I didn’t do it because I didn’t care for him. I did, but I was unhappy, and he was stagnating in life because I was allowing it. Breaking up would force him to do something for himself, and allow me the space I needed to heal. 

Things went well for about a month. I got over feeling lonely pretty fast, and I started feeling better about myself. A huge part of that had to do with going home for the holiday break. Being around family and old friends really helped me.

When I came back I realized I still had a few pieces of his clothing still mixed in with my stuff. Long drawn out story shortened… We ended up back together.  Not living together, but trying for an actual relationship this time. All of that was pretty much the first year of our relationship.

Our communication got slightly better and I confided in my fears about being incompatible with him. My need for submission and pain had not gone away. They were still part of me, and they were not something that I felt bad about because they were things that he did not approve of. 

When we reached what would have been our one year mark he wanted to do something special to celebrate, which sort of surprised me. With my first boyfriend we celebrated every month we were together. Part of that might have been the silliness of being in high school, but we always remembered to at least say happy anniversary to each other. My current partner never made a big deal about it, so when one year came around I didn’t feel that we had reached anything special. It was never a big deal before, why should it be now? For him, it marked the longest he had ever been with someone. For me, we still had several years to go before it became a recorded. That situation left sore feelings on both sides. 

In all honesty after that things sort of merge together as far as the time line goes. There are a handful of events that resonate very deeply with me, though.

Once we started dating he tried putting in more effort to be accepting of my submissive tendencies as well as my sexual preferences. There were a few times that we went to a BDSM establishment together as a way to ‘play’. However, all of these times ended in emotional disaster for me. One time, after we got home, he told me that part of why he did not enjoy going out to play publicly was because he was embarrassed to be associated with me while I did not have clothing on.  This was shortly after I had started regularly going to the gym.  I was starting to feel extremely good about myself and the progress I was seeing in my body. After that conversation I became extremely depressed, and it was the first time that I was legitimately suicidal. 

There was another time where I asked him what my submission meant to him, to which he replied, ‘It means nothing to me.’

During this time, my lease was getting ready to end. I would spend hours fighting with him about how I did not want to move into his apartment. We had already tried living together, where I was the only one to clean, cook, and maintain the apartment while still maintaining my grades in my classes. And while this time he did have a job, I did not want to go back to that type of situation. I also would not have had my own room, which is something that I desperately need. I am extremely introverted, and having my own room or a ‘safe space’ that I can go to as a way to get away from people is something that I can not go without for very long.

He ended up saying during one of our fights that he posted on 4chan about our situation, and that they replied with how I obviously didn’t care about him since I wanted to pay to stay away from him. I was furious. I cared deeply for him, and still do, and to be told that he was getting ‘advice’ from people that he constantly told me were trolls, and ‘the scum of the internet’ made me absolutely rage inside. 

I ended up moving in with mutual friends. I cannot recall anything else major happening during that time. I gave up on trying to have my BDSM needs fulfilled again. It didn’t seem worth it any more. I knew that it would only lead to me being disappointed or hurt and that it was better to just leave it alone. 

I ended up graduating, but my lease ended before them. As a result I moved into his apartment and took over the room that his old roommate and left. I was very hesitant to do this, but I had lived with him before, so I knew what I was getting into. I started an internship with one of my instructors, which kept me in the area, and since things were still rocky / bad between us I looked for a way out of the apartment, and found one. 

We broke up again, and he moved out of state to live with his family for a while. There is a bit more to it then than, but nothing that I feel pertains to the over all relationship. 

For a while we didn’t talk at all, but eventually we started messaging back and forth online. He moved back to the area, and since we both needed a roommate we moved in together under the strict, mutually agreed to terms that it would be a two-bedroom apartment, that we wouldn’t date each other, and that we wouldn’t date other people while we were roommates; the former because our relationship had not worked before, and the latter to avoid any awkwardness while we were living together. We knew we would end up having sex, since we had always been extremely sexual with each other, but we both felt that we could handle things.

We have been living together for about six months now. 

Now he says that he wants to have a relationship with me, but all I can think about when we talk are the emotional scars that I have now. I do not feel that I am attractive to him because he has stated that I’m not. He does not want to be in the type of relationship that I want to be in, so any relationship we have I feel will be unfulfilling for me. I still do not have the sense of closeness or safeness that I desire with a significant other. For me there are all of these signs that it would be a terrible, horrible thing to try, again. 

We are still having sex, and while that has been good I do not think it is enough. He has been making an effort to be more affectionate to me recently, since admitting to wanting a relationship again, but I feel I am too jaded for it to work. I feel that there is too much history between us for us to ever be able to function properly. 

There is so much more to it than that. And ultimately it comes down to me feeling too hurt and broken to try. There has been so much emotional pain and hurt over the past four years. Pain and hurt that I feel I did not deserved. I never felt listened to, or that my opinions were respected by him in the past, so now that he is trying to make an effort it is hard for me to change my own habits. I have been conditioned to expect my views to be used against me, so I have learned to not share them. 

We communicate in such different ways that even if we did have a relationship I think it would end up failing again. He is of the mindset that yelling and fighting are normal for relationships, where I do not function well in environments like that. 

But at the same time I still have these irrational emotions for him, and part of me does want to try for a relationship again. A part of me wants it to work and to be sunshine and rainbows. I want to believe that I can have the sort of happiness that I had in my first relationship again, but it has been so long that another side of me thinks that I just made those feelings up. That they only ever existed in dreams that were never real. 

I don’t know what to do at the moment. I am not really looking for advice, or help. There are too many things left out of this post to give anyone a clear take on the situation, and even if I had been able to cram four years into a single writing, it is only one side of the story, and as much as I tried to remain detached while writing, it is still a biased take on the situation. I’m sure his side would be much different than mine.  And I don’t mean to make it seem like everything is terrible. We do have really good times, too. When things are good, they are awesome. I wish the good times happened more often, or at least out weighed the bad times, so it felt worth the struggle to achieve them. 

I want it to feel like it is ok to be myself, and to feel accepted and valued for being who I am. I do not feel that I am a terrible person. I feel that I’m actually pretty awesome. I love doing things and helping people out, and making them happy; especially my significant others. I feel I do a lot to make life easier for those around me, and I get satisfaction out of doing it. That satisfaction dies when I feel like my efforts are fruitless and trivial though. And that’s how I feel right now. Cleaning the apartment doesn’t mean anything to him. Packing his lunches doesn’t show that I care. Doing outstanding work at my job doesn’t make me an attractive mate. Even dressing in nicer cloths than my normal baggy, black t-shirts and shorts doesn’t earn me compliments or praise. It just seems like no matter what I do, nothing matters, and it’s hard to want to try when it feels pointless. It’s hard to want to be pretty or attractive on the outside when on the inside I feel like I am slowly dying.

As I said in the beginning, I don’t think I’m really hoping to gain anything by writing this aside from voicing my thoughts. Writing everything out has help to untangle a few knots in all of the confusing emotional threads. I still don’t know where to go from here, but reflecting back on things has helped. 

For anyone that actually read this all the way through; thank you.  Feeling like I have shared these thoughts has made me feel a little more solid and balanced. Huzzah for the Internet.  I also apologize for the typos, if I had gone back to fix them I think I would have lost my nerve to post this.

17vegf,3,2013-02-04,2 Questions: Procrastinating on accepting a job offer? And possibilities of returning to companies after summer internships? ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17vegf/2_questions_procrastinating_on_accepting_a_job/,"I recently received an email saying that I got a job offer for the summer from job A (they recruit early because there's security clearances you need to go through, so the lag time isn't really lag time, it's necessary). It's a GREAT company doing COOL stuff but not my absolute ideal company. However, the ONLY thing I really don't like about it is the location. It's pretty bad.  

Since it's still early, I've filled out dozens of other applications for internships at my ideal location (California) and likely won't hear back from those for a while. I also have 1 other interview lined up (job B) in the coming week for an ALSO GREAT company that's more directly in my line of work AND it's in a better location!  

So here are my two questions:  
1) How long do I have to respond yay/nay to the job A offer? Should I immediately reply to the email I got this morning with some sort of statement? What should that statement even say?  
2) I'm a junior studying engineering in college; what's the likelihood that the internship I take this summer could lead to a full time position post-graduation? I'd LOVE to work full time for job B in the future; it's really the line of work I'm interested in. Job A is pretty great also but I would HATE to be stuck in that location. I'd really rather move to California asap.  

Ty for advice!"

First of all, sorry if I seem naive. Just a quick note; **I live in the UK.**


**Some background first:**


I'm a programmer with a strong background in mathematics. At my current job, I do slot machines maths modelling and verification, so I do a lot of statistics but it's all basic level, it requires thinking a lot but it doesn't require a great deal of mathematical background. Verification is based on coding simulations in C# and checking that my statistics are correct (I guess that's called Monte Carlo simulation)


I want to get into banking, I will be straight honest, it's for the money and the position and because I'm in London so it's the best place (one of) for this kind of jobs. However, I do actually enjoy mathematics and programming mathematical applications, I have always had A* in my mathematics courses, but I studied Computer Science so I didn't do ""Advanced"" level mathematics.


**My situation now:**


I have a **first class degree Computer Science bachelor** from a recognised university but it's not a top-ten one.
I'm going to do Master's soon hopefully, and I thought I will do a course related to the field I want to get into.
Now here is the thing, I don't necessarily want to be a quant, I basically just want to have a job in the financial industry that requires a lot mathematics-oriented programming.


**My options:**


So I have three different courses:


Oxford - MSc Computational and mathematical finance


Imperial London - MSc Mathematical finance


Imperial London - MSc Statistics

One of the tutors at Imperial advised me to do Statistics instead of Mathematical finance because, according to him, it's getting more difficult now to get a quant job and Statistics is broader so I have more options regarding my job perspectives.


**My queries:**


1 - **Which jobs satisfy my needs (mathematical-oriented programming in a financial industry) other than quantitative finance?**


2 - Do you agree with the tutor at Imperial that I should do Statistics instead of Mathematical Finance, the main thing that attracts me to the Maths Finance MSc is that it includes a three months internship (if I can) which is EXTREMELY important in my opinion, but I still want to hear what you think.


Thanks, I tried to break it down to make it easy to read. Cheers, any advice would be appreicated."

I recently got a job at a super-fancy and internationally renowned country club in town making great pay without the killer hours. Obviously I took the job without hesitation, but am starting to regret it.

The chef here is a painfully pretentious CIA grad who worked at Blackbird's in New York and thinks he's God's gift to the kitchen. Sure, it happens, I'm used to it. All the cooks, however, are people who have been here for decades, are lazy, stuck in their ways, and barely listen. So here I am, the culinary student, the young moldable mind, and the kid he's gonna ride relentlessly until I break. I'm singled out for every possible mistake I could make, even yelled at for ""texting"" (I was just checking the time) which everyone does anyway.

The worst kicker, though? At the tail end of a 14 hour day (I intern in the mornings as well), everyone is leaving, and he stops and tells me that tonight I'll be deep cleaning/scrubbing the entire line (which hasn't seen a deep clean in *decades*) So here I am, dead, haven't had a day off in a month, won't have a day off in 3 more months, at the end of the longest day, scrubbing every inch of a decrepit line by myself.

But if I even begin to look tired while he's around, I'm just mocked because, ""how old are you?""

EDIT: Thanks for the support guys, I guess I was just pissed and drained after a long goddamn day."

I've probably also got around 15 D's, F's, W's (more D's and F's), no real relationships with any professors (although I am working on this as well) and I am approaching the end of my education with no prospects for jobs, internships, or any real rewarding life experience ahead of me.


I feel shitty and crappy and wondering why I'm still around. It seems almost selfish this insistence that suicide is bad when people like me could use it to weed ourselves out. I feel like a parasite to my parents even though most of my rage and self-esteem issues come from the years of physical abuse (my dad would use me as a punching bag when my mom wasn't around, slamming me against the elevator walls and I'd have bruises and contusions all around my shoulders and back), the emotional abuse (of being told by my dad that I was a ""good for nothing drug using slut that parties all night ""with my other ""whore friends"" when I was a band track honor student, my mom telling me that I was fat, a slob, my dad telling me that I was ""aggressive"" and no guy would ever want me because I wanted to play the violin when he wanted me to play the trumpet), the sexual abuse (being groped by my dad and told that he ""owned 50%"" of my body and he could do what he wanted with it, having my face slammed into the tile of the kitchen floor and knowing there was no way out). Being told that I'm responsible for the marriage break down and that I contribute to their lives being worse.


But no employer wants to hear any of that. No one (besides my partner) wants to deal with the baggage. They don't want to hear that by the time I got to college I was so angry, tired, pissed off that I had to re-learn what it meant to interact with normal people. That you could constructively criticize an idea without laying in to the person and being called an ""incestuous freak"" they way my dad would call me, because he and my my mom were separated but they had to share the 1 bedroom apartment so that he got the bedroom whereas my mom and I had to share a bed in the tiny living room because he refused to let us get a small cot and out it where he kept his huge drafting board from college that he never used and didn't want to sell because he wanted $25,000 (because that's how much he paid for it 30 years ago) when the going price on craigslist was for $6000.
No one really cares that most of college was spent picking up the pieces especially when I began getting the symptoms for interstitial cystitis and that I had to skip classes because I was in so much agony that I couldn't get out of bed but of course there was no way to prove I was in pain and OSD said ""good luck!"" and professors said ""Too bad"". That eventually I stood up for myself (with the help of my partner) and told them that I was not going to be their Doctor child and that I refused to apply to med school because it was not what I wanted to do.


Because to an employer or a grad program or even the peace corp, I have no relevant experience, no skills, not even grades...nothing to show. I have nothing to contribute. Even though I am back at school and studying as hard as I can, doing great at managing my flare ups, attempting to gain fluency in another language, going to therapy to deal with my mental health, and further trying to improve my interpersonal communication by assisting with the administration of a local book club.....it all seems to mean nothing. And it hurts. I just want it to stop hurting and I want to feel like I can be someone better than this, a happy, confident, sexy example that things can always get better."
17y92f,51,2013-02-05,Job search story from someone not in the upper-crust,StateSchoolScum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17y92f/job_search_story_from_someone_not_in_the/,"You will first need to know my story to understand where I am coming from:

I come from a poor background. In my home town, no one goes to college. Many don't even finish high school because such things have no credence; anyone can get a job in town (as a construction guy, contractor, or gas station attendant) without a high school diploma. I left high school at 16 to work concrete. College just doesn't entire into these people's minds as a possibility. The culture is very anti-intellectual as well. 

I've always liked math and science a lot. I was always described by teachers as a ""gifted"" student in these areas, and I always try to deeply analyze how things work. Eventually I got a PC. Rather than simply say ""that there be one of them magic boxes"" and stab at the power button with my chicken grease covered digits, I tried to figure out how this incredible machine worked. 

I had no idea how a computer worked, but I started to form certain concepts in my mind about how I thought it worked after a while. I knew it wasn't ""magic""; it was a machine. Electricity flowed through it. I had so many ideas (and later on I learned the academic definition for what I was thinking of: finite state machine) and I started going to libraries, old high schools, etc. to find books on electricity, circuits, and anything else remotely related to computers. I learned a lot about capacitors, transistors, cathodes, etc. but never really figured out the operating system part.

Eventually, dial-up internet was brought to my neck of the woods, and man, was I ever fascinated by that. Every spare moment I'd be trying to learn something new on there. I figured out that I was an intelligent person and felt my mind was being wasted stripping roofs and digging holes in the ground. I started to come across the term ""computer programmer"", but I had no idea what that meant, but I very badly wanted to find out. The colors on the screen, the mouse movements, the start-up/shut-down functions, I knew it was all simply the very rapid interaction of hardware, electricity, and something else...which turned out to be code. I read books on C, but was never able to program in it because I had Windows and could not download Linux or BSD on dial-up.

I ended up getting my GED in 2005. I was 22 years old. I applied to the local state college and to my astonishment I was accepted. This is not a very good school at all, and I knew that, but it was better than nothing (at least that's what I thought). I had a big problem though: school costs mucho pesos, which I did not have.

Going to college meant moving into the ""city"" part of the county, so I applied to every job in town. One of these jobs was in a big warehouse so I applied to be a forklift selector. At the HR office, I did something that seemed to shock the HR people: I divided one number by another in my head (they lost the calculator so I just spit the answer out to help them). They asked how I did that, and I explained that division is easy for those numbers and you can just follow a step-by-step process (which I learned later was an ""algorithm"") for arriving at the answer or best approximation. 

The nice ladies of HR recommended me for this other job, in the warehouse offices. It was part data entry, part input-output (print and such), and some other stuff. The computer were all green-screen IBM terminals and the computer system was a mainframe. I'd never heard of one. I just knew I liked Windows better. This job paid like $10 an hour though so I was practically rich. 

I worked overnights and went to school during the day. I was even doing over-time and pulling 60+ hours per week. My life revolved around a series of naps, but I sure was learning a lot. I breezed through the first semester, mostly because I was just having such a blast in my intro to programming and math classes. They weren't hard, but I would read the entire book for a class in the first couple weeks, do all the practice problems, and do well.

I love the programming stuff the most. This was the answer I'd been looking for for a while. You take a language a person can read and create a basic set of instructions that the computer can compile, read, and execute. The logic just made so much sense. In the meantime, my job got moved to a new office because we got a new data center for the warehouse. Now we had Windows XP PCs to work from and everything. They also expanded the responsibilities of the job as the company updated it's technology. I became a helpdesk, network ops, Unix, and mainframe operator all rolled into one, still working full-time and going to school full-time.

As school went on, it got harder. Not unmanageable, but I was getting stressed doing both things full-time. I couldn't quit though, because without the job I couldn't pay for school, and they would throw me out and it would have all just been a waste. As I learned more about the company, I switched majors to Business. 

After three years, I got my Business degree. I took that straight to the HR department at my company. However, these were not the nice old ladies that had hired me. A new crop was put in place. These were young, pretty, and very mean girls. They came from schools like Cornell, and the company paid them top dollar to recruit from top schools in order to bolster the companies profits with top-tier graduates and their Ivy-League intellects. I was told that they don't hire low-tier scum like me and to get back to my till or leave. 

I felt awful. Before, I thought I'd made something out of myself. I really did, and everyone in my department pretty much was rooting for me to move on and become successful. I returned with my head hung low, realizing the caste system I was up against. I stuck around that job for another year or so but ultimately went back to my old habits of studying computer science and mathematics. I signed up at the college again to finish the degree I originally stated.

By that time, I was working second shift at my job and was effectively the lead/supervisor (although I was not being paid for this). I couldn't handle the upper-level classes and the job, so after a month of doing both I had to give my notice. The higher ups were infuriated that their lead was leaving and they had no one competent to replace me. I asked them how long it would take to train someone up to my level, to which they said they would need two years. I said I've given my required two-week notice (I actually gave them three) and I would happily work out my final time training someone else as best I could. They fired me on the spot. 

Unemployed, but now with a good chunk of change saved up, I put my full brain power to work on my final semester of CS. I learned all kinds of interesting stuff like linear algebra, number theory, self-balancing search trees, and cryptography. I started to like Java a lot and made that my main language. I learned everything I could about Java and the VM; whenever something presented itself that seemed like hocus pocus I just learned how it was working, like concurrent threading or how the VM does garbage collection, and what exactly happens to methods on the stack and objects on the memory heap at run time. 

Finally, I got the second degree (not too long ago), and here I am. That's my story. Here's my problem:

I feel like I'm in no better of a position to get a job other than gas pump monkey. Like I said before, this school isn't exactly MIT. Realistically, it's lower than whale shit on the the prestige scale for CS, and I'm still in that lower caste no matter how I rationalize it. I spent approx. $100,000 of my own hard-earned money earning those pieces of paper but I realize they are practically worthless. 

Every day, I get up and apply for jobs online. Sometimes I get a rejection notice, sometimes no reply. I've never gotten an interview. I know I'd make a great business systems analyst or software engineer. I worked along side so many of those Cornell graduates in my time at my company, and let me tell you, those people aren't smarter than me, and they don't do anything that I can't do. 

I see a lot of questions on here about the interview. I know I could impress people given the chance. I know CLRS by heart and have seen every video CS lecture Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT has every put on YouTube (I actually have them all saved on my laptop). It just seems like I can't get there from here. 

I typed out that long story because I feel like there are more people out there like me, just not on /r/cscareerquestions. So many people on this subreddit never had to work a day in their life, then got some internship and were offered high-paying jobs just like that. I'm at the point where I think I should just give up because it won't happen for me. I now live in a big city but I work for minimum wage because it's all I can get.  

Is there anything else I can do besides randomly apply to jobs on Dice? I already know the advice some of you are going to give, which is create some personal projects and/or create an app. Well, I don't want to make apps for a living, and there's no projects a person could possibly create that are going to impress people who work on multi-million dollar software projects with millions of SLOC. 

What do I do? Is this it for me? I went from nothing right back to nothing 7 years later. I feel like I could have taken that $100,000 I spent on school and bought a house instead."

Last Friday afternoon, I had an interview for a summer internship at company A.  I completely choked and didn't solve the question within the allowed time limit. We've all been there.  However, there are some reasons to believe that I may at least still have a shot:

* I successfully passed one technical interview prior to this one, so they know I have some ability.
* I ended up solving the problem about 5 minutes after we concluded the interview, and sent along the solution per the interviewer's request.

However, I haven't heard ANYTHING from the recruiter at all.  After the previous interview, I was notified of another round approximately 1 hour after the interview concluded.  My questions for you:

* Should I reach out and inquire as to what my status is?
* When should I do this?  Only one full business day has passed so far.

Thanks!

Hi all,
I love UX and I love design, but I'm at a crossroads in what to major in at uni. I was rejected from the Informatics major, so I'm looking towards other ways to get into the UX field.
I have a couple development internships, currently doing a program management internship (kind of UX.. right?) and having a blast.
So the bottom line is what major would be a good one for UX?
I think the obvious ones are Computer Science, Informatics, Psychology, but what are some alternatives to that? Sociology?
Just trying to pick myself up after being rejected :).

17xqxp,607,2013-02-05,Don't start rumors about me.,banana-stand45,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17xqxp/dont_start_rumors_about_me/,"This is the story of possibly my greatest revenge on an enemy. During my sophomore year in college, I dated a guy who introduced me to probably the greatest apartment I have lived in to date. Great location, awesome parties, and lovable roommates. Four people lived in the apartment (boyfriend included) and two significant others would stay over frequently (myself included).

For most of the school year, everyone got along fabulously. Unfortunately, drama slowly built up between the other significant other and her partner. This significant other (let’s call her Tina) was overly dramatic, self-absorbed, and extremely two-faced. Around March, her partner figured out Tina was cheating on her and promptly dumped her ass. This became a problem because both had signed on to continue the lease for the next year. Tina kicks her ex-girlfriend off the lease for the following year and throws a hissy fit when we all aren’t moved out a week before our lease ended.

We begged her to let us keep a few pieces of furniture in the house before our next lease began, as we had nowhere to go, but she had no sympathy. She logged into another friend’s Facebook account to tell us off, so it looked like she did nothing wrong. Frustrated, we packed up our shit and got out.

By now, I was beyond frustrated with her, but I decided the best course of action would be to just ignore her and move on with my life.

My junior year rolls around, and I start my second year at an internship on campus in our LGBTA Office. There are about 7 or 8 interns every year working in the same space but with different assignments. Who walks in the first day? Tina. Fuck.

From day one, she started a crusade to ruin my life. Being passive aggressive, she would often leave notes blaming me for things or broadly stating how she hated drama and anyone who starts it needs to find a hobby. Everyone in the office fell in love with her after the first week, which completely got under my skin. What everyone didn’t see was her setting people up to fail so she could come in and save the day, her leading other girls on only to break their hearts intentionally, and her saying incredibly hurtful things to anyone who dared cross her path.

At first, I tried to tell everyone what she was doing and how she hurt people. This led to a meeting between the head of our department, Tina, and myself. I was scolded for spreading hurtful rumors as Tina cried crocodile tears. Later that day, she “accidentally” deleted a rather large Photoshop file I spent weeks on. She must have “accidentally” emptied the recycling bin too, my work was long gone.

I felt defeated. Since the LGBTA community was so tight knit, you couldn’t risk rejection. Otherwise you lose all your friends. By this point, a good portion of my friends weren’t returning calls or texts.

Eventually, she dated a close friend of mine then publicly dumped/humiliated her. My friend comes to me crying, telling me everything that happened. Apparently, Tina started spreading rumors about me throughout our community. She told them I lied because I was still bitter about losing the apartment to her. Finally, I figured out the perfect revenge. 

The Revenge:

The rumors were already out about me, so my credibility was shot. I did the only thing I could think of.

I was nice. Nice as FUCK.

Suddenly, I was friendly with her in the office. I laughed at her jokes, admired her work, and complimented her fashion. When we were out with friends (especially when Tina wasn’t there), I laughed about the good times we shared and how much fun she brings.

Tina had no idea what to do with my sudden kindness, so she started getting nastier in return. While I did not see it, current friends filled me in on what happened when I wasn’t there. Whenever I came up in conversation, Tina would start spewing hate about me and how I’m trying to get back at her. But when they talked to me, I would only sing her praises. During this time, she was also continuing to lead girls on and break their hearts.

Slowly but surely, I regained every one of my friends. After a year, every one of them apologized to me and told me everything she had them believing. The ENTIRE community turned on Tina afterwards. The administration asked her to leave her internship after discovering the mess she caused for me and other interns, all of her previous friends now unfriended her on Facebook, and she ended up leaving the community in a huff.

Best part? She could have prevented all of this if she didn’t try to spread rumors.

TL;DR: Bitchy ex-roommate spreads lies to make people hate me, I’m kind in return, everyone ends up hating her and she loses all of her friends."

I'm going to review c++ and java, is there anything else I can do to prepare? Also, if they don't call me within a certain time should I call them if so how long should I wait before calling?

Ps in case anyone is wondering I got an A in my java class and 1 A and 1 high B in my c++ classes. While I took java last semester I feel especially rusty with c++."
17xe2v,2,2013-02-05,Basic Streaming Specs,Invisisniper,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17xe2v/basic_streaming_specs/,"So, I've been considering taking up streaming as an additional hobby to playing LoL; it seems like something that I would enjoy being able to talk to any viewers while I play the game, and I feel like forcing myself to analyse the game as I play could make me a better player.

The main barrier at the moment is that I simply don't have a setup that could handle even the most basic streams. I play on a 2 year old laptop with reasonable specs; it may be able to handle the stream, but it's been slowing down recently so I couldn't guarantee it. What's more of a problem is that although I run a steady 6 Mb/s download allowing me to view streams, my measly upload speed of 0.6 Mb/s could definitely not handle running my own. Also, whenever I upload anything decent sized, even small youtube videos, my ping spikes to about 1.5k.

Fortunately, I am coming to the end of a summer internship, which should earn me enough to replace my current setup. So I ask you, reddit, what kind of streaming setup options are there, and what kind of specs would I need (both PC and internet speed) to run such a stream? Also, an estimation of cost would be very helpful (note that I live in Sydney, and IT related stuff tends to cost notably more here than it does elsewhere in the world, so cost estimations from fellow Aussies would be more helpful). Any general streaming advice for a new streamer would also be greatly appreciated."
17xe20,3,2013-02-05,Recounts of last night and a reminder to myself that I think I have a problem. ,zerothrowaway1,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17xe20/recounts_of_last_night_and_a_reminder_to_myself/,"I think this post is just to help myself actually recount why I need to stop drinking, or attempt to do more moderate drinking. 

I just could not sleep anymore, recounting yesterday's events just kept pouring into my mind. I just had to get up and try to make sense of things and now writing them down here. 

I am 23, in my senior year of college and the first time I had more than just a sip of alcohol was around 12/13 years old. The first month of the new year alone I have been blackout drunk about 5 times. I have always thought, ""well I am in college, I am just living up my life and having some fun right now until I need to grow-up"". A lot of my closest friends drink with me, while they are far more responsible and do not drink as much, they understand that my tolerance level is higher so they do not question my drinking habits as much. My mother has always been on my case about drinking, more recently my father as well, so I just try to not drink around them as much, or more controlled than usual. My sister and brother-in-law never really had a problem with my drinking, they went to a fairly big party school (OSU) and while they do not live that lifestyle anymore with having a child, they seemed to defend me with the same thing I though ""just living up my life right now"". 

My education while stressful for some (electrical engineering), I have just breezed most of my way and had a very laid back approach to it all. Last semester especially I would just drink and skip class most of the time, basically showing up for exams and such and doing a pretty good job of it. I figured, well I do not drink at or before work (an intern position I held at a prestigious company for over a year) and my schooling is still fine so alcohol can stay in the picture. On the weekends it was especially bad, I could go through a 5L mini keg a night while doing shots and still be ""fine"". While if I had to drive I would generally not touch any alcohol because I knew if I started, I would not stop... I feel this is my biggest issue and the reason I am writing this now. 

Recounting what I remember last night, I had class from 4-8pm but was at school earlier to work on my senior design project. Around 3pm, I send a text message to a good friend of mine for a drink with her and she agrees. The hours go by, I do not even remember how many I had, but I do remember she only had two (she can put back much more but is actually responsible). I do remember having one Narwhal (10%+), and roughly 5-6+? of Wild Black/Blue/Red (8%). This was from 3-~7pm, skipping both of my classes I was supposed to attend that day. We talked a lot, I really like this girl, both as a friend and somewhat of an emotional attachment more than that although she has a good boyfriend. I think this makes me drink more as well, thinking about how I am not with her, just being emotional, so I just drink more to not think about that and stay in a happy mood (another problem I think). I remember bringing up something to her after I have had quite a few and I think this was when she basically said it was time to leave the bar. I do not remember the exact words verbatim, but I basically questioned her fertility... I will not go into details but it was especially hurtful to her because I know how much she wants kids and here I am basically saying how she's getting closer to 30 and with all the unprotected sex she's had how come she has not gotten pregnant yet. I do not remember closing my tab but I have my card back so I must have. I do not remember the walk back to the lounge where I left my stuff. I vaguely remember her leaving me with some of my other friends basically saying for them to watch me and not let me drive yet. I vaguely remember leaving right after she left with my other friends trying to hold me back and reason with me to stay but it is hard for two guys at maybe 5' 5"" each 140/160lbs to hold me back at 6' 230 lbs fairly built. I do not remember the walk to my car, I do not remember most of the drive home. Here is where I scared myself this morning, I remember losing control of my car on the highway. I think I hit a patch of ice/snow on the far left hand lane doing roughly 80-90 (my usual speed so I am assuming I was going this). I crossed all 4 lanes of the highway and hit the other side wall with my car barely (I have not checked my car to confirm any damage). I immediately backup and continue driving and I am damn lucky no one was near me when it happened and no one got hurt. I get home and my parents question why I am home earlier than usual (roughly 7:40 at this time when I have class til 8). I do not remember the conversation after that, and I suspect they knew I was drunk. I immediately go to my room to sleep it off and wake up around 10 that night to eat some food before falling back to sleep. I wake up at 3, craving water, and then can't get back to sleep as I recount what happened yesterday. I finally get out of bed and think that I really need to change my habits, I need to do something, and being an avid redditor I assumed there would be a subreddit for this sort of thing. I look it up and took the AA quiz that was linked and answered yes to all 12 questions truthfully. I never thought of myself as truly and alcoholic, I just played it off, but now looking back at previous experiences... I wonder how I never stopped and did this before...

If you read this or not, it was more for myself but I thank you either way. I do not think I will stop drinking, I feel I need some way of telling myself to stop after 1-2. I look now at my desk where I have easily 100+ bottle caps of various beers littering my desk, and most were not there ~2 months ago. I look at the mini kegs laying around my drum set and recount how I would chug race myself because no one else was fast enough. I am a very competitive person so perhaps it trickles into my drinking habits. 

I want to change, I actually have plenty of people that care about me, they deserve to not see me kill myself on a highway from drunk driving, or even worse killing someone else. "

17wty7,19,2013-02-04,Relatively good life position but totally unsatisfied and just really confused about what to do,theresacatinmyroom,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/17wty7/relatively_good_life_position_but_totally/,"I graduated from college in May with a degree in sports business, interned with a professional sports team for almost a year, had a leadership position with the sports business club on campus, and was a student supervisor of the computer labs on campus. I was unable to get a job in professional sports right away and sort of panicked, so I ended up accidentally landing a job in the IT field. On the first day (orientation notwithstanding) I realized that I made a huge mistake and it's not what I want to do with my career. However, it's a job with health benefits, something way too many people I graduated with can't say (even just the job/career part).  

My plan was this: if I still felt it was the wrong choice in March, I would seriously ramp up my quest to get back into sports or at least marketing or PR. Why March? Because I would earn enough vacation time beforehand to go on a cruise with my family in February.  

Then hurricane Sandy came and changed all of that -- my family lost our house in the storm and we had to cancel our cruise. I lost my car in the process, and I used the insurance money to buy a used car so I could cut a monthly expense out of my life while also drastically lessening my insurance payments. I did this in preparation of taking a lower-paying job (or even a low-paying internship or something) and being able to, you know, live. I also had to move into an apartment because of the living situation and to lessen my commute (save gas/didn't have a car for two months after the hurricane).  

So here I am, almost 100 days removed from the hurricane and about 130 since I started at my job. I still don't like it after almost 4 and a half months. It's not what I want to do for a career. I don't have the charisma or personality to succeed as a salesperson in sports. I understand that if I want to get into sports, I'm going to have to either A. get more experience, whether it's an internship or what or B. become a salesperson. And I don't mean just get a sales job, I mean *become* a salesperson. And I don't think I can.  

I've started to look into the idea of Graduate Assistant position so I can get a monthly stipend and free tuition for a graduate program. I've started to apply for (and interview for) entry level marketing or public relations positions. I've applied for (and had a scheduled interview that got canceled for) sports sales positions.   

1. Grad school / graduate assistant - what happens when I do a 1- or 2-year program? How do I know I can find a full time job once that is over? What if I can't? 
2. Internship - how can I actually realistically afford this, especially when I don't have my parents' house to live at rent-free anymore? How do I know an internship is actually going to help me get hired?
3. Marketing/PR job - A lot of these are temps; what happens if they don't retain me after the 3- or 6-month temp period? What happens if I can't afford to do it?  

I don't know why I'm posting this or what advice I'm even looking for. I'm just really lost and really confused and it's a bad thing. I'm finding myself depressed, and my parents are really pushing me to just get used to my current job because it's a pretty good health benefits situation and there's a pension. But I can't see myself lasting here another year let alone the rest of my life.   

I feel like I was on the verge of great things back in April and May -- I had multiple leadership positions, a year's worth of internship experience, an awesome job interview out in California -- things were generally looking great. Now I'm in a job that I'm miserable at with no other leads, a lot of bills without enough money (paycheck to paycheck, barely surviving right now) and I have no direction or any idea how to get on the right path, or what the right path even is, or am I already on the right path and I just don't recognize it?  

I've started to go to sports networking events and career fairs throughout the area over the last month, just to try and get my bearings set, but even then, I'm doing it without aim. What am I doing? Where am I going?"

What is your personal motivation to apply for the HACU National Internship Program?

What are your academic and/or career goals?

What skills can you bring to an employer and what skills would you like to focus on throughout the internship?

My personal motivations to apply for this internship program include:

• Get professional experience in the fields that I am majoring in (accounting and finance). In this world’s competitive market having experience in my field of study with a very good company before I graduate would make me more appealing to potential employers and put me one step ahead of the competition, therefore increasing the changes that I get to choose which company to work for rather than being pressured on me by lack of opportunities.

• Test how I would cope with being away from my family. Being from a Mexican family where family is pretty much the most important thing, I want to try out for the first time what my mom calls “volar del nido” (to fly away from the nest), and be able to experience firsthand what it is like to live by myself with all the challenges that brings.

• I set a goal for myself to get an internship in 2013 with HACU so that I can get unique insights in my field of study and network with people from other parts of the world, so that I can expand my horizon and get to know how my country works a little better while doing so.

My career goal is to get my CPA and then work as an auditor or financial analyst in the FBI and be able to provide this agency the tools it needs to make its’ job easier and faster. I want to be able to catch people laundering money to contribute my grain of sand to this country which has given me so much. My academic goal is to graduate with a double major in accounting and finance with a concentration in financial analysis with a GPA &gt;3.00 and after that get my CPA certification.

I bring employers a different perspective into problems, which has been shaped by living in a house with a dual culture and being able to see the differences between one another. Other skill I bring to employers is good customer service, that I learned during the two years that I worked in the restaurant industry, where I also learned that being bilingual (like myself) is particularly important and useful specially living in a border town like I do.

During my internship I would like to focus on leadership skills, so that I can easily motivate other people as well as myself. I want to develop critical thinking, or as some people call it the “entrepreneur mind” which is the ability to see one step ahead than other people normally would and make decisions about it earlier and that way stay ahead of the competition. I want to learn how the software my company uses works so that I can troubleshoot problems and provide the clients my company has a superior customer service and support. I want to be able to acquire the skills needed to leave the company that I’m doing my internship with, better than when I first arrived there.

The biggest appeal of going to SFSU is knowing that SF is such a powerhouse of hot start-up companies. I figured that with all these tech companies, SFSU's CS department would try to provide students with a solid preparation for the workforce.

Unless I get accepted to some UC, I will most likely be transferring here.

* Working independently,
* Producing quality work with honesty and integrity,

as well as someone who understands what I need:

* Realistic management that produces realistic goals,
* Resources to help me develop the depth that I lack.

I'm almost shaking as I type this, so please bear with me.

After I graduated with my degree in journalism (minored in new-media), I won an internship at a professional blog in New York.  Well, after this, I don't know how professional they really are.

I've been working as assistant to the chief editor for three months, and I really love the edgy dynamics of our office staff.  It's a paid internship I won during my last quarter, and even though it's a paid internship, I barely make enough to pay for groceries and medicine.  Besides this, I've put up with the money situation because I love the idea of being a journalist and giving the underprivileged a voice on the internet.  Though there are a few assholes at my office, the people here have generally been pretty OK.  Until earlier today.

For the past two weeks, our PR department has been putting together a video package to be released on YouTube. The promotion involves all of the women in the editorial staff walking around in high heels posing posing in front of the camera, sometimes making horrible duck faces to be extra ""cute.""  The video is recorded at double speed with wind blasting on them for this slow motion effect when it's done in editing.  Our marketing guy says this will be dubbed over with a baratone voice talking about making the news ""sexy"" again.

There are so many things wrong with this that I feel like I can't keep it together.  Before I decided to write this post, I spent nearly half an hour sitting on my fire escape staring up in the sky, trying not to tear up. (Life pro tip: it's really hard to cry in freezing temperatures, so if you need to get it together, sitting out in in the cold after dark in New York city during February is a REALLY good way to keep yourself from breaking down.)

Here's what I take issue with:

1) These are not models, they are journalists.  More importantly, these are enlightened women who should be taking themselves more seriously as professional writers.

2) The PR and marketing department should be promoting our site as a NEWS site, showing how intelligent and insightful our writing staff are, both the men and the women.  As a woman who spent four years and a LOT of money studying to be a professional writer, I'd like to think of myself as an intellectual and not some piece of eyebacon for guys on YouTube to gawk at.

3) And this is the part that makes me tremble.  I know what guys on YouTube do, and you know as well.  Hell, look at most of the guys on reddit and what they talk about on /r/videos or /r/pics.  The women in this promotional video were fully clothed and not doing anything OVERTLY sexual, but come on.  Guys will look at this video, see attractive women being somewhat suggestive, and they will be sexually aroused.  As a woman, this makes my skin crawl.  If there's anything the /r/creepshots fiasco taught me (I've been lurking for about a year) it's that guys on the internet will masturbate to ANYTHING, porn or not, as long as the female form is displayed.  I don't want the women I work with and usually respect deeply being gawked at by some greasy redditor or YouTuber while he reclines in his computer chair back just far enough to unzip his pants and touch himself while MY COLLEAGUES make fools of themselves.

I went to the editor chief about this, and he laughed.  He said it's all in good fun, and that I shouldn't worry about it anyway.  All of the women volunteered to be in the video, but he doesn't understand.  He can't.  Until he's stood in front of a video camera in a red flowing dress and high heels, he can't defend this.  He has no idea and never will.

OK, I'll admit it.  I did cry.  I tried not to.  When I came home, my boyfriend Brad tried to make me feel better, but I won't talk to him.  I know he's done it, too.  The only two that can make me feel better right now are my two kitties Doctor and Zoidberg:

http://i.imgur.com/RAbu5Dy.jpg

PS: I know my boss reads reddit, so I am literally freaking out right now.

EDIT: Wow, I really feel so much better after talking to some of you!  You guys are great.  Some of the comments, however, have really made me wonder if someone from /r/mensrights linked to this page to exploit this story and make nasty comments about.

EDIT2:  I was turned away when I showed up to the office this morning.  My editor in chief informed me that my last paycheck will come in the mail next Thursday.  I don't know how to handle this.  Have I just been fired for voicing my concerns about sexism in the office?  I'm literally shaking right now."

I've been reading a lot about America being extremely overworked and in my own life I have seen it. My dad works upwards 50-60 hours a week and only gets 1-2 weeks vacation a year. Almost every person I have come into contact with complains of being overworked.

I live at home because I can't afford a place right now, I'm currently looking for work as a pharmacy technician (I just got my certification), and I'm planning on marrying my fiance sometime in the next 1-2 years.

I have had 2 jobs before now. A part-time retail position and a full-time 12-week internship at a public park. I hated both of them because for some reason I suck at absolutely anything manual labor. I'm fine with working 40 hours a week, but not much more than that.

Overall, I have to say that I just feel depressed. I have no reason to be. But I just feel like this is it. Once I move out, my life will suck forever. All because of the place I was born. You can call me entitled or lazy. I don't care. The fact that I will never have any time to enjoy my life and I'll likely never be able to retire or have financial security depresses me to no end. I value my time. I value my family, my hobbies, traveling the world. And I'll never be able to do that. Yeah, first world problems and all that, but it depresses me all the same.

This leads me to my question. Should I leave America if I'm overworked? Fuck it, I have one life, one chance to do what I want, and I've decided that I will not work myself to death while having enough to live. So if I ever decide to leave America, how should I do it and where should I go if I should leave at all? Me and my fiance of course have family here, there's culture shock, there's financial concerns, all of that. So I don't even know if it's possible. But I will enjoy my life, no matter the cost.

I'm in college, male, about to turn 24 this month, studying game design, asset creation, environment design. I'm currently working on an animated short for one of my classes, which holds a lot of expectations from the 12 of us in it, and I've taken on a fairly large role coming up (If you know what animation rigging is..I have to learn it from scratch because no one knew how to)

It's almost my senior year, I have 3 semesters left after this one, and I know I should probably get working on my capstone this semester because people who don't start early get swallowed up by it...and this is our DEFINING moment of college. It's how we get jobs, and succeed post-academic life. 

Currently looking forward to internships, to help with the big job search after I graduate. Game design internships are not around here, so I have to look out towards Texas and California mostly, and that strings along its own issues (How would I pay rent for my single bedroom here if I'm there for 12 weeks?) but I know I want one..but I don't think I could take one....

My job in the IT call center on campus is soul sucking, and all I want to do is relax and not worry about things when I get home, but I can't afford to get a lower paying job really, and changing jobs is hard to do while in college (I work part time) at my pay level.

I like what I do..I enjoy it when I'm not feeling like this. I just feel like there is too much work, too many expectations, and I feel like I'm falling behind. I'm feeling unmotivated..but when I'm unproductive I just beat myself up and get depressed and I feel worse...I'm terrified of seeing a counselor of any sort...though I know I probably should.

I am a junior in college, and have been having more and more problems with drugs and my mental health since freshman year. My dad has been physically and mentally abusive towards myself, my two sisters, and my mother for as long as I can remember. I have never been able to sit down and discuss this elephant in the room with anyone but my sisters and mom, and that first discussion did not take place until this past December. My mom finally sacked up and threw divorce papers his way while I was home over christmas break. The night after christmas that led to this decision was the worst state I have seen my father in in my entire life. He went from 0-60 in a matter of seconds, next thing I knew he was strangling me while I was fighting him off of my sister and mom, which resulted in the police removing him from our home. This is obviously not an isolated event, and the long term abuse has taken a toll on everyone in my family. 

While I am still not convinced he is a horrible person, two of the three of my half siblings who are all in their 30's and 40's and from his previous marriage, barely keep in touch with him. My half brother maintains virtually no contact with him, or even his younger half siblings, unless begged to come over for holidays by one of my sisters or myself. I have not spoken to my dad since that wonderful night, despite his pathetic attempts to be suddenly interested in helping me find an internship, etc. While I am not ready to speak with him yet, I am seeking out advice from anyone who is from a similar background, a professional (aka doctor, therapist, head shrinker, etc, etc, etc.), or anyone who has managed to fix a seemingly destroyed relationship. At the end of the day, he is still my dad. While I will never forgive him for many of his actions, I am still open to any way to try and mend what he has been broken the best I can. I know that he cannot help his upbringing, what he experience in war, and what it has done to his mental health. What I don't know, is if there is a possibility for me to improve my relationship with him before it's too late. He is turning 70 this year, his health is questionable, and his mental health could take a turn for the better or worse depending on how he deals with his second divorce. Any advice on how to better my relationship with him after this pivotal point as well as how to seek out help for him (although I don't really see him opening up in therapy) would be greatly appreciated. 

This is my first ever reddit post, I hope this subject is not too dreary. I am simply seeking any friendly advice or similar story that can help me improve my mental health as well as my relationship with that man, in hopes that there is some sort of happy ending to all of this."

It's taking me a lot of courage to post here right now. I don't know what to do, and I've stopped looking for relationship advice from my friends and family. I just need you right now.
i've been in a relationship for 4 plus years. It started the end of my junior year in high school and now i am a junior in college. 
He goes to a university 2 hours away, so I get to see him maybe three times a month. I started doing internships and would stay at his place, but now I am taking a full course load and finally able to stay by myself in an apartment...
When he does come over, he stays for around 3-4 days. He doesn't seem to understand that I have a copious amount of homework and papers to write. He constantly bugs me when I am studying, even though he promised to not. He is a slacker, doesn't know where he is going in his life, and very messy when he comes over. He expects me to clean up after him and only buys fast food to eat. He won't eat anything healthy and only eats out. I can't even make food for him, he is picky. He is also on depression medication and dropped two classes because of it. Let's just say, he's turned into someone I don't really find amazing or going somewhere with their life but, reddit, I am terrified. I'm scared. He has been my best friend for four years and really stuck by me. However, he wasn't emotionally there for me when my dad almost died earlier this year and completely ignored the situation. I would learn not to cry in front of him because it seemed like he didn't care....
I feel so insecure. Too insecure to leave him. I look at myself and think, ""who would want this?"" I don't know what to do. All my friends tell me if I'm unhappy I should leave. but I am super feminist (a woman's studies major, and an english major) and it's hard for me to date.
I have had an occurrence recently that really hurt me, too. I went out to dinner with an ex and he basically rejected me, telling me that I was just another girl and that I wasn't special.
I'm just really lost right now. Do I keep my loser bf that understands me in all my quirks and constantly says he loves me? Just give me advice and put me out of my college misery. Another concern I have is that I'm almost done with school and once i graduate (hopefully trying to go to grad school) that i won't have anyone.. 
Thanks for reading.

However, my issue is my grades. Since I've only been here for one semester (16 credits) I can still recover from my abysmal gpa (2.4). My question is what should I do now to pave the road to working for or landing a internship at any of the Big 4 or midsized firms? 

The only firm I am able to apply to intern at would be KPMG as they do not have a minimum grade requirement, although I doubt they would select me as, unfortunately, my resume is not strong either. 

Currently I'm trying to focus on building my resume by joining clubs, leadership positions on campus, and I'm also the treasurer for my fraternity (would that solidify my resume?). 

This summer I will intern at a small local firm with few clients...

I have a question regarding CompTIA A+ Certs. I know there are a ton of them in this sub (I did search) but figured I'd through in my own just to be clear/personalized.

I'm a current IT student (junior year) who has not gotten a cert. yet. I am looking for internships, and figured a cert would help improve my resume (as it's nowhere near jaw-dropping).

While other certs would be more ideal, (Network+ Security+, Linux+) I don't feel prepared for those yet, and figured A+ would be the quickest way to enhance my resume.

I took a PC Hardware class last semester that was supposed to lead up to/prepare for the A+ exams, so i feel with a little brushing up i'll be fine.

My question is this: Since the 700 series is being phased out by the 800 series, any vouchers I purchase will be good for either up until Aug (I plan on taking Feb or early Mar).

The 700 series does seem a bit easier (not as current) while the 800s have some simulations or hands-on from what it sounds like. I thought that while the 800 would be better content wise, the 700s would require less preparation.

Will employers see or care which version you took? As i am a full time student, should i take the 700s just for sake of ease/quickness as either will be valid?

**TL;DR: I can take A+ 700 or 800. Will employers know or care which one? Is one better?**

P.S. - Might as well throw this in here: for those of you in the tech field, any ideas on how to improve resumes for chances of scoring an internship and/or job?

I don't hope to do support/repair as a career, but figure it'd be a good launching point, as it's ""Industry recognized cert."" (yeah, whatever.) Looking to focus in networking and/or security. But in general, how would one go about improving resume for an IT field?

I recently got a part time engineering internship at a place that produces a radioactive compound for medical purposes. Because of its short half life, it has to be made in the very early morning.

Fortunately, I don't have to be there until 6AM on the days that I work. However, I have to wake up at 4 in order to get ready and drive there. This means that I go to bed early the night before, around 9PM.

In my apartment, there are two doors between my bed and the common area. If someone is watching TV or talking, both doors have to be closed for my bedroom to be quiet enough for me to sleep. (I've tried earplugs; I hate them). The first door is my bedroom door: no problem keeping that closed. However, one roommate has to go through the second door in order to get to his room or the bathroom from the common area.

And he left that door open four times last night, and I kept closing it. They were chatting, and the TV was playing the abomination known as ""Family Guy.""

So this morning, when I woke up at 4, I made no effort to be quiet.

TL;DR: Doors aren't for closing to keep sound out, right?



**#2**

On my way back from work this morning, there was a lady in an SUV behind me who kept swerving lanes to try to get past me. At the next intersection, we both turned onto the highway entrance ramp at the same time (there are two turning lanes). Where the ramp narrowed to one lane, she tried to cut me off instead of alternating cars. I sped up, blocked her cut, and forced her to merge the way she should have.

But now it was on. I kept ahead of her, and she got into the left lane to pass. I was in the next lane over and half a car length ahead. And that is where I stayed. Traffic thickened, and we kept pace with each other.

And then the left lane abruptly turned into a Left Exit Only lane. I had to resist the temptation to wave goodbye as she was forced off the highway.

TL;DR: Lady tries to save a few seconds by cutting me off. I cost her a whole lot more than a few seconds by tricking her into getting stuck in an exit only lane."

I'm scared of having to find a place to live next semester/next summer after I graduate. I'm scared of having to find an internship when I go to LA next spring because I'm not good enough for anything. I'm scared I won't be able to find a summer internship/job at all, let alone one that won't make me completely miserable. I'm afraid of not getting a career in the future. I'm afraid of not making enough to support myself/a family, if I'm lucky enough to start one someday.

I'm scared of opening up to other people because I'm afraid they'll make fun of me, and I've been bullied hard in the past. I'm afraid of making friends. I'm afraid of relationships for several reasons; they'll probably regret going out with me so why bother asking in the first place, I can't imagine how anyone would find me worthwhile, let alone attractive, and based on my track record if it's taken me until I'm 21 to even make out with someone then what hope do I have in the long run?

To sum up, I'm afraid of the future and everything that could possibly go wrong, because with my luck it probably will. I'm afraid of life, I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of losing my hair, I'm afraid of bugs (ants I can deal with, but anything larger is a NOPE), and I'm afraid of hot things, which would again explain my luck with girls.

I am 21 years old, a fresh college graduate. I graduated top of my class with a degree in concentrated advertising. I have two top 10 agency internships on my résumé, one of which was in California where things started escalating.

I went to one of the top stoner schools in the nation, Ithaca college. I went here despite knowing that my parents would never be able to pay off my loans at a private school but i just kept saying to myself ""im going to a good school to get a good education so i can get a high paying salary"". The mayor of the city is now known for verbally decriminalizing marijuana for the sense of wasting tax dollars. My whole college career was a joke. I moved into a suite of all sophomores my freshmen year. Living in a building of only suites led me to not make as many friends. Doors were always closed, people already had their groups of friends. I was alone. My roommate was not a pothead but enjoyed smoking on the reg at that period of time. I ended up joining the rowing team to make friends. All was well. My friend group began to get very competitive as you do on sports teams. I was always into working out and was on a minimum of two varsity teams in high school. After a while competing for spots on team got very intense, even after practice my fellow athletes would disassociate themselves from others. With my spot on the team very secure I found myself the subject of hate most of time... It wasn't the best team you could hope for that's for sure. Slowly I started hanging out with my, for lack of a better term, bizarre roommate. I had smoked in high school but nothing more than on weekends. But soon it was everyday. I would be rowing on the lake at 430am staring out of the boat, still coming down from the night before, loving life. Coach would yell at me to look forward when my mind would drift but all I could see is sun peaking over the far mountains. My times still held and he couldn't be mad though.

I found a friend group sophomore year that genuinely cared about each other. I quit crew when my gpa dropped below a 3.0 first semester sophomore and had taken up bodybuilding. I loved weed. It helped me eat, it helped me sleep, it helped me not care as much. I always wanted to make everyone I met happy and this made me realize I could not and just to accept it. But now it has gone the other way. I finally was able to quit weed when I decided to take an internship in California for the semester. I worked on campaigns for high name brand products that you use everyday. Soon work stress started to get too high and I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety to get my medical card. We were ranked top 3 in the world across the board and somehow someone saw something in this disassociated stoner to let me into this world. I guess it's that thought that kept me going. 

Before I left there I was offered an entry level position for 35K a year. I declined. I left the agency of my dreams because I knew I had to pay off 120K in loans plus interest.

Now I am still smoking everyday, I graduated a couple months ago and haven't done a thing to start my job search. I feel more alone than ever before and can't remember who I was before. I have about an eighth of weed left from the mass I bought before I left school. Once that is done I need to try to quit. My loans set in December and need a high paying job immediately. My ""friends"" only consist on codependent relationships. I have many connections but no relationships even with my family. My girlfriend of two and a half year, thank you to her, is the only one who knows me anymore. 

Thanks for listening, it was about time I did this. Having this down I hope will help me realize where I came from and where I'm going. I am disgraced about my four years at college and hope to just bridge the gap from the person I was in high school to the person I am now.

Love and respect to you all and good luck in your journeys."

I finally got my bachelor's degree in the scientific field last summer, but I decided I didn't want to continue in that direction. One very promising and obvious master I could choose was one that combines science and business. 

The first year consists of an 9 month internship I'm running at a science department at the university I'm at, one course and some presentations/report I have to do. 

The second year consists of business related courses, like business economics and finance, and a half-year internship at a business/institute, preferably with a link to science. 

I'm really looking forward to have some practical courses and to acquire skills that gives me a broad choice of a future job, but my academic scientific skills seems to falter: I don't seem to be able to keep up with the level that they're asking from me. 

I'm currently 4 months into my science internship, and it has it ups and downs: I'm pretty sensitive to winter depressions, which had lowered my motivation and performance, and I'm horrible at giving presentations in front of people whom I know that are better educated on the subject that I'm presenting about. After overcoming these hurdles, I got a small boost in motivation, but now I'm suddenly confronted about my underleveled performance. 
It really starts to demotivate me. I also don't seem to be able to mingle with the people there, making it a hostile environment to me. I'm also starting to look around for job openings as a back up in case I decide to drop out, which also doesn't increase my motivation to go on. I'm also not aspiring to get a job that requires an academic education or to a position I can't work myself up to. 
I've had experience with leadership functions, finance, creative/innovative thinking and getting the job done, and I can say I've got a broad skillset, able to learn new skills up to a very functional level (just not able to get it up to an academic scientific level), so I don't think I'm a worthless asset. 

I tried talking to an adviser, but he didn't really help me, just said I have to persevere. I was thinking to go to a psychologist to deal with the motivation issue, but that seemed futile, seeing my current feelings about the matter. 
I'm also scared to tell my parents about these thoughts, although lately they seem to have softened up on this matter due other relatives having trouble with school. 

What should I do?

tl;dnr: Finished scientific bachelor, started science/business master, don't have to motivation for the science part, want to stop and start working. "

Is this a ""preference"" or is it a hard and fast rule?  I have quite a few years until I graduate with a CS degree, but I casually started perusing jobs last night, and it was bleak.

Every single one of them required experience in my hour long search.  Every, single, one.  I understand internships are a good way to get some experience, but this is a tough option.  I financial can't intern too far away.  I live in a part of the country that doesn't have a lot of internship opportunities, and I have a long term girlfriend that wouldn't be stoked about me disappearing for 3 months over the summer.

Am I just aiming too high?  Do most college grads not land programming jobs, software development jobs, etc. out of college?  Do I have to land in a part of the company for which I am over-qualified (in theory) and uninterested in order to work my way up to a position I am interested in?

185dle,2,2013-02-08,I[M21] am unsure if I should leave my GF[F21] of four years because of my identity crisis.,tornbtwheartandbrain,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/185dle/im21_am_unsure_if_i_should_leave_my_gff21_of_four/,"Warning: this will be a lot of text. **A lot**. TL;DR at bottom but it doesn't really do it justice.


Background: My girlfriend and I are both 21, she is in her senior year of college and I am in my junior year. We have been dating for 4 years starting senior year of high school. She is my best friend since preteens. This is my first relationship ever and she considers this the first serious relationship. She has no doubts in the relationship and have spoken of marriage and kids. I thought I had no doubts too but recently my thoughts have changed. We are in a long distance relationship and we see each other on every break and at least once a month. It used to be whether she was away or with me, I was happy. However over the past year, I felt more like the more she was away, the less happy I got. We talk every night and communicate often. We had our ups and downs but for the most part have gotten over most of it.


However, recently I have been depressed. There are a lot of reasons for this. First, I went to a junior college before transferring to a university. I am an introvert so making friends is really difficult for me. Since the transition, I have been more stressed and have no close friends. There are a few but I do not hang out with them often. I also commute to school a long ways (due to financial reasons), so I can't really meet new people per say. This is important because I basically depend on her for social interaction. So recently, I decided I need friends when I realized I don't know who I am. I have no vested interest at all. I like a few things but are not into them. As she describes, the only hobby I have is running, which I consider a chore to stay fit. I feel like I gave up every I was for her. I have no idea who I am anymore.


What do I mean when I say I gave up everything for her? When I was in high school, I was pretty much a nerd. I loved math and physics. I loved watching tv shows and every episode often. I loved watching every movie that came out. I loved playing video games. I was interested in cars so much that I wanted to work on my own. I had a pretty close circle of friends. Then, when we became an item that all slowly went away. First were the friends. This was entirely my fault. I paid so much attention to her because she wanted it and my friends and I drifted. Soon, we graduated and we didn't hear from each other again. I even rarely saw my cousin who I grew up with and is a brother to me. Interestingly he warned me that she was changing me and I needed to be myself and get to know myself better.


My girlfriend and I talk a lot on the phone when we were young since I didn't have texting. I loved playing video games and was somewhat addicted. I would talk to her while playing on the phone. Of course attention shifted from her to video games so she got angry. She wanted me to stop playing while on the phone. So I did. But sometimes I told her I wanted to play instead of hanging out with her all the time. She was visibly upset a lot by it. So, I quit. Not completely her fault as by this time college was starting so I was like, fuck it need to study anyways.


So I spent most of my time watching tv shows and movies and caught up on everything. This became basically my new and only hobby. However, when I was with her, she didn't want to watch certain shows that I loved (stuff like burn notice, community, and others). So slowly I would watch these on my own time, which was very little. Near the beginning of our relationship, since she moved to another state for college, she was lonely and leaned on me to support her so I did. We spent a lot of time on the phone, sometimes not really talking but just on the phone. I thought, okay, she needs me, I'll just watch it later. Later never came, now I watch only a few certain shows that we both enjoy only. We must watch at the same time too or else she'd be upset. Same with movies. But within the last year, when she made a lot of close friends, she would go see movies I would want to watch it without me and told me about later the night when we talk on the phone. She suddenly didn't make a big deal out of it anymore. I decided it wasn't a big deal, she could do that and I didn't care too much. When I have time I'd watch it later or so I thought.


On to friends. When I went to my first college, I eventually made friends. However, she was always mad if they were girls. She trusted me and knew I value loyalty a lot but she does have a jealous side. So she would visibly show she was upset on the phone when the subject came up. Even if I was hanging around them alone at school or gave them a ride. I would never cheat and she knew that. That's fine I thought, I can deal without having girls as friends or put them at a distance, no big deal. However, at the beginning she had a problem with me spending too much time with my guy friends too. Granted she didn't have much friends at the time, she wanted to talk and hang out with me even though it was only on the phone. Eventually she accepted it was healthy and I should be more social. But the damage was done. I decided I rather make her happy and spend more time with her than too much at school or with friends. This sadly included my cousin and sometimes family. When she was home on the weekends, she basically expected I'd be there early to nap with her and leave to go home at my curfew (I live at home and yes I still have a curfew). Basically couldnt leave her side. This meant that every time my best friend cousin or my family asked me to go out with them, I would turn them down cause I knew it would make her happy if I stayed with her. She liked this better because she would rather spend alone time with me instead of with family unless one or both our parents complained. Then we would hangout with them together. However, I always noticed it was always more times with her family then mine. That is part my fault too since I didn't fight it. I was also actively involved in school at that time. I volunteered a lot and got into internships over the summer. I eventually quit my volunteering because she wanted me to stay with her all the time (it was only once a week for 4 hours). I couldn't quit my internship though so I brought her along. She was still alittle upset by this even though she understood this was for my career. 


Then, there's sex. Sex is great and we are both givers for the most part. There was a lot of rough patches as she didn't want to try the things I wanted (no details cause she is very insecure about this). For some reason I cared a lot about this, I really wanted to push this even though I knew she was uncomfortable with it. Eventually, I got my sanity back and stopped pushing. I was more depressed as I felt I had nothing. I didn't feel appreciated. I told her how I felt like she didn't love me since I would do anything for her (which is true) until she eventually gave in. (Yeah I was an asshole at that moment, not proud). Even when she did, I didn't push it any further. I realized I was being a jerk and stopped asking her altogether for any of it. I was fine with the sex anyways. But ever since she ridiculed me about my preferences I was no longer comfortable with telling her any of my desires anymore. Also, I thought, doesn't matter as I'm never doing any of it again. I felt too guilty after allowing her to go through with giving me what I wanted.


Other misc. stuff: She always hinted at changing my wardrobe but my old one didn't really bother her either. It was only when my cousin changed his wardrobe did I change mine. I asked her advice and soon she was picking out my wardrobe. I let her basically go wild and I didn't object. I like my wardrobe now but it has a lot to do with my cousin and her influence. Also, my weight was getting out of control. I was always self conscious about my weight. She told me one day I was chubby and that she loved it but would be nice if I was healthier. Being me, I wanted to look good for her. Set a goal and went from size 33-34 to a 31 now. Huge change. If she wanted to change me I thought it was fine. It was all to make her happy anyways. Anything about my appearance she wanted to change or suggested, I would act on it immediately. Any attitude change she wanted, I acted on it immediately. However, if I ever criticized how she dressed or what to do with her appearance she got offended at first. Now she's okay with it but she drags it out and I believe makes excuses. For example, I was always attracted to blondes, asked if she would ever dye her hair blonde. She said no at first since she has a stigma attached to it (her dad also always believed she should be herself anyways). Then she said she would but only when she was out of her parents house since they would be super upset by it. I told that's fine I didn't mind. I also realized she was right, I shouldn't have asked her to change herself. So I dropped the issue altogether. I used to make a lot of money before I transferred to a university (relatively for a college student). Pretty much all of my money spent on her. I can honestly not remember the last object I bought for myself in the last year or even two. I think the last time I bought something for myself was Starcraft 2 besides food. Every penny I have earned went to buying her gifts (bags, iPad, clothes, etc), going on dates, or big trips like Disneyland, basically everything she ever wanted. Material objects never mattered to me (grew up poor, learned to cherish whatever I had) so she usually gave me sentimental gifts which I loved. However, some of the things I have hinted at wanting, she never did (things mentioned above).


The future seems blurry as well. As of now, it seems like I will have to go out of my state to attend medical school. However, she wants to come back home. She says she will go wherever I go but I feel bad of I have to take her away from home. Although she will be home my senior year and have time to spend with my family and hers, I don't know if she'll want to leave after that.


She is in no way a bad person. She is the most caring, considerate, cute person I have ever met although she can be bratty and selfish sometimes. She saved me from depression before and suicide (I know it's wrong now but I was an awkward high schooler and thought the world was over because nobody loved me, plus some issues with step-parent). As she got more mature, she was has gotten a lot better and tries to urge me to get back my social and personal life. She suggested I meet new people and get a different hobby. She even learns to cook, clean, do laundry, and bake because she feels like she needs to make up for it and since she believes we will be married one day. But honestly don't feel like I can do any of it. I am still in the mindset of making her happy regardless of cost. That all I need is to make her happy. To be honest, I think I would be perfectly fine living the rest of my life with her and making her happy even if it hurts and depresses me and I have nothing. It does make me very happy that she is happy, it is only when I am alone with my thoughts I get this depressed.


On top of this, I'm in college still. Hormones are raging. I see girls I feel much more attractive too (physically as I don't know them, but I do reserve that my girlfriend is beautiful in my eyes). I am essentially very lonely and have no one to confide in. My best friend (cousin) is a reservist and is currently deployed. Stress is high and time is running out. I'm not afraid to be alone but I am afraid I'll never be able to be with her if I leave. Afraid I won't meet someone else, let alone someone as fantastic as her.


I feel like I have lost my identity and don't know if I can get it back if I am with her. My brain says, in order to love someone, you have to be confident, love yourself, and be yourself. You have to have an identity that is not based on her and her influence. You have been sheltered and comfortable too long, haven't experienced life in any extent and need to do some self discovery. If it is meant to be, you guys will make it work after you have found yourself. At the same time, my heart says she is the one. No one else gets you like her, she is your best friend, you have a great relationship with no current problems, why so negative and want to leave? You'll never be as happy as you are when you are with her. Why break two hearts when you are happy? This will destroy both your families. You made a commitment and shouldn't go back on it (parents divorced), you're a man of your word. Love and loyalty are of the upmost importance. You love and care for her, what's more important than that? I am so torn. I have had little to no sleep for the last week being heartbroken.


So wise people of reddit, what should I do? What are your perspectives?


Side Note: sorry for long wall of text but I think it will give the full and better picture. Thanks for staying if you made it this far. If there is anything else you need, feel free to ask as I just spent the last 2 hours writing this and bound to have left something out. Also, sorry for the rant.


**TL;DR I am having an identity crisis as the last four years have been revolved around my girlfriend, which I love, but am very unhappy and can't shake being depressed. Should I break up with her to find myself?**

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.


**Some videos of our recent work:**

**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

I didn't know you 1 year ago. When I dropped out from high school half a year before graduation. I had no future to look forwards to. I couldn't get a job. I couldn't go back to school.

I spent my days home alone looking for someone to take me in. Someone to give me an unpayed internship.

I got one job. One job for one day. It was awesome. I did my best. You were pleased. You told everyone at the office you were impressed. I got to come in 3 more times during 2 weeks. You said you loved how I acted. You hired me when no one else would.

You gave me a future, you took me in and gave me a purpose. You're only 10 years older than me, but you have been more than my boss. You have been my role model. I have cut down on my weed smoking just to make you proud of me, to show the world that you were correct. I'm good for something.

I have worked for you for 1 year now. I have made misstakes but you always shrugged it of and told me to learn from it.

Right before you left the office for the last time today you came to me. You told me that you're proud of me and that you knew you did the right thing when you hired me and that when I'm ready to face the world I will take it by storm.

You took me in when no one else wanted to. I will probably never tell you this but you have probably saved my life. In more ways than one.

I'm sitting at the office place you have given me when everyone else has left for the weekend and I am silently crying. I will miss you."

I am a 3rd year International Media and Entertainment Management student from Europe. In my 4th year (January 2014) I should start writing my bachelor thesis on a marketing topic of my choice while working/doing research in a company. This would be my 2nd and final internship.

As I am very passionate about online marketing and digital marketing trends (which I also blog about), I really want to do some research in mobile marketing (mobile ecommerce). The thing is that I really don't know where I should start looking.


So, having one year left to find an internship, I had the idea to go for the giant companies: Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google and others.
My questions to you:

1.	Do you think it is a good idea to do research/ an internship in such big companies?

2.	Where should I start looking? I know that companies like this rarely reply to emails about positions, which are not advertised...

Thank you very much guys.

Cheers, D.

184e6v,31,2013-02-08,[Dead Space 2] A Business Man,Hugs_of_Moose,LifeasanNPC,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/184e6v/dead_space_2_a_business_man/,"I… I don’t know what to do. I’m a business man, a doer, I make the world go around and yet here I am curled up on the ground staring at a door of my apartment, listening to the muffled sounds of men and woman being slaughtered by those god-damn things! How I survived this long I don’t know. I saw that poor intern girl get cut to pieces right before my very eyes! I didn’t know what to do than either. I just stood there in shock, every cell in me frozen. My mind seemed to be twisting in on its self from exposure to such an instant upheaval of reality. It was searching for an explanation, a foot hold, anything that would work as a jumping point to process this new world. But there was nothing. At one point I managed to look away from her, only to see more of the beasts clumsily charging towards me, taking down whoever was unlucky enough to be within reach of their dreadful blades of bone and flesh. 

I looked down again at the girl, but upon seeing nothing but a mass of red pulp where she had laid I thought she managed to get away. However, the surge of optimism I felt could not have left me any quicker. Upon closer inspection I realized the red pulp I was staring at was her. With that my mind gained its foothold. I was out of that office building and headed for my home, the only place my feet seemed willing to take me.

Running down the blood drenched corridors of that city was surreal. It was as if someone had taken a planetary-sized shipment of paint and started spraying it with a hose on every surface. In the consumer district the doorways and windows of restaurants and shops where piled with bodies. As I ran past these places I’d occasionally slip in pools of blood which had made the metallic ground slick. 

I had almost reached the elevator that would take me from the consumer district to my apartment complex when I noticed something that even now perturbs me. The area was deserted. I was the only living being, man or beast. I stopped running and my eyes started darting around, from shop to shop, window to window, all drenched in red and filled with bodies. In the distance I could hear more people fall to the beasts, and yet here I was, in the most heavily populated area in this sector of the station, absolutely alone. I just stood there; my mind slowly began to twist again. It felt as though I was back at the office, staring at the intern girl being ripped apart by the beasts. I could see her clearly before me, an angelic face staring right at me with a comforting smile. Even the beast that was attacking her seemed to be at peace, each lunge of its blades piercing her side only to have the wound healed the moment the blade left her body; every appendage torn off her fragile figure instantly reattaching only to be torn off again. The beast seemed joyful for having found a companion to perpetually slaughter.

Then I heard a bird. Than another, and yet another until it sounded as if behind me an entire flock of crows had descended upon the consumer district to pick at the corpses. I remained still, afraid that my movement might scare them off, such beautiful creatures crows are. I was brought back to text books I had read as child about the forests of Earth, though I had never actually seen one myself. I had been breed and raised for the city, business was my game, even at a young age, and I never had time for such distractions; though I had always been curious. Eventually I turned, and expecting to see trees my mind completely twisted in on its self upon the sight I beheld instead. I could not understand why the crows looked and behaved so strangely. It was as if they were made of flesh and shaped like two wings without a body. They flew from corpse to corpse, holding them with hand-like talons and a beak that devoured them whole. They would engulf a corpse, and drop it again; moving on to the next corpse, and so on and so on. And after a moment, the dropped corpses would begin to move.
 
These were no crows, they were doves. They were bringing life back to this dead district. 

One approached me, and I let down my defenses. I saw in the wings of flesh the angelic face of the intern girl, however, this time the beast that was over her had a much more human face. The bird crept closer to me, and closer yet, until I could make out the image of the beasts on its wings. It was me. My hands knew nothing but the feeling of warm blood washing down the blades that had replaced my arms. My mind knew nothing but the sweet serenity of oneness with those whose bodies had been perfected along with mine. 

The dove was upon me, engulfing me, and for an instant I let it do its will. And I would have allowed it to change me into one of them had I not remembered the red pulp the beast had turned the intern girl into after its slaughter. My mind once again found its foot hold. Now before me there was no angelic face promising me an eternity, but only the fleshy monster wrapping its self around my head, blood drenched tentacles attempting to force me to submit. 

My hands clawed at the fleshy creature; however, I could get no hold on it. I could feel my body beginning to change, but I could not give up. Even as I sit here in fear, after having thought over the event many times, I do not know what strength of mind possessed me to continue to fight the creature's grasp. There was no hope and I knew it just as much as I know it now. But everything in me fought, almost to the death. 

A bright blast of energy exploded through my fleshy mask, and through the bits of matter and blood dripping from my face I could make out a man in a standard engineering suit, wielding a plasma cutter. He ran up to me, picked me up by the arm and yelled at me to run for it. He took off for the elevator, leaving me shell shocked. I looked down the streets of the district and saw just how many of these beasts had been created, and how many more were still to come. I turned toward the elevator and saw him beckoning for me to join him. I ran the few blocks I had left and gazed backwards, only half-aware, at the hundreds of beasts coming our way.

The doors closed and I pushed the button that would take me to my floor. I looked at the engineer; he was having a frantic conversation with someone, perhaps another engineer. Maybe they were trying to keep life support systems going. It seemed like a noble quest, one fitting of a man of such intelligence who chooses to serve the rest of society rather than rule it. There’s likely not much point in keeping this city alive, but a noble quest none the less.

 I did not speak for fear of interrupting his conversation and train of thought. Once the elevator reached my floor I got off. The engineer stayed behind, hit another button and nodded towards me before the doors closed.

I made my way to my apartment, but before the door opened I sat down. I’ve been staring at my door ever since. I’m tired, and even though the other side of that door has a bed; I’m too afraid to sleep. I’m hungry, and even though the other side of the door has food; I’m too sick to eat. I’m lonely, and even though the other side of that door has pictures of me and an intern girl, who I raised from birth, who I watched grow up; I’m too heartbroken to remember any of it.

I'm debating between a Biology or a Biochemistry degree (there is very little actual difference in course load at my university) while taking a pre-med curriculum. I have enough room to fit in a minor and computer science seemed like a natural choice with my interests. I have also really been wanting a backup in case medical school doesn't pan out, especially since the job market for bio majors doesn't look too good.

However, I don't even know if I could enter the field of computer programming or get internships with just a minor unless I devote myself to becoming competitive outside of school. The minor is 6 courses long so it eats up quite a bit of my schedule for my college years. I could possibly finish my minor at earliest junior year (without giving up too much in my major early on because I need to remain competitive on the MCAT).

It makes me think, while trying to be competitive for medical schools, could I turn my computer science minor into a possible backup career plan? I'm unsure of the ability to get any internships with only 6 CS courses under my belt. The only thing I could think of is maybe mixing the CS and the Bio/Chem and trying to find something at a lab or go back to school and get another degree in CS. I know experience trumps degree but with neither it seems like I would be in the same boat as if I didn't get a minor in CS."

[ of all, I want to extend my sincerest thanks for making it easy to understand the complicated corruption at the highest levels of our political system. I can honestly say that your reporting is the main reason I still have a print subscription to Rolling Stone. Thank you very much and keep it up.

What do you think the average American can do to help change things for the better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azir4?context=5)|Hello, 3rdCulture. A great question that I struggle with a lot -- normally, ""What do we do about it?"" isn't really the province of reporters like me. But in terms of the stuff I cover, the obvious thing that needs to be done is that the banks need to be broken up; all of our major corruption problems stem from the Too-Big-To-Fail issue. How we accomplish that is of course problematic. There are two ways it gets done, legislatively and through prosecutions, i.e. the DOJ could charge a bank with something and then make breaking itself up a condition of its settlement. Or the state could legislate changes like the Brown-Kaufman amendment. Either way we need to elect people who recognize the problem and are willing to take those steps. Sentiment for this is growing.

But Neil Barofsky, author of “Bailout”, former Special Inspector General of TARP and himself hardly a friend of the Too Big To Fail spoke glowingly about Ms. White when her nomination was announced by the President. Any sense of why you two differ so strongly on this nomination? Thank you for your time.”](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azhz4?context=5)|Gruasty, great question. Neil and I talked about that just the other day. He knows Mary Jo, worked with her, she actually hired him if I'm not mistaken. And I trust his judgement about pretty much everything. So this has been confusing to me. One thing we talked about is that in most cases, the switch she's making, from defending Wall Street for millions to policing it, doesn't really work. But he believes she's in the small minority of people who can pull it off. We'll see. I like Neil a lot, he's an honest person, hope he's right. 
[Did you really throw your coffee at Vanity Fair's James Verin when he said he didn't like your book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azl74?context=5)|I absolutely did throw coffee at James Verini, and it had nothing to do with him not liking my book. Let's leave it at that for now. I'll tell the full story someday. 
[Matt, you lived in Russia for a while and wrote about and did a lot of interesting and intense things, like messing with the mob, checking out Siberian prisons, and partying pretty hard. Russia is a place where they kill journalists for merely existing, so my question is: how did you not die? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8aznqo?context=5)|Purely by accident. Honestly, there were some close calls. A lot of bad decisions while I was there, many of them under the influence. One very funny story I've never told: I once worked with a Russian paper called ""Stringer"" to wiretap Alexander Voloshin, Putin's chief of staff. We published a week of his phone calls. I was so afraid of the consequences, I stayed out of the country when we published. Upon my return I was detained at the airport for 10 hours. I thought I was going to jail for life. In fact, the Russians were simply concerned that the lamination on my passport was coming up in one corner. They thought my passport was fake. Once they reached the embassy, they let me go. But that was one scary 10 hours. 
[Did you ever meet Hunter s. Thompson? I know it's been quite a while since he worked for rolling stone. Jw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0bjn?context=5)|Years ago, when I was in my twenties, I was asked by a book publishing company to edit an anthology of ""Gonzo Journalism."" Not long into the project I realized there was no such thing as ""Gonzo Journalism"" as a genre per se, it just meant ""written by Hunter Thompson."" But I was broke and needed the job. So I called Hunter to ask him what he thought. He said, ""That's a shitty assignment."" I told him I probably agreed. He said, ""How badly do you need the money?"" I said, ""Badly."" He said, ""Well, good luck, but I'm not going to help you with it. No offense."" I said none taken and that was it. That was the only time I ever talked to Hunter. It was a funny call, though. 
[Obama just mentioned new rules for taxing carried interest, do you think anything will be done? Do you see him making any drastic changes to Wall St. in his second term?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azjdm?context=5)|Benjamin, hey, thanks for the question, this is a good one to start with. This AMA thing is wild BTW, thanks for being here. On carried interest, don't expect changes. Politics almost annually propose repealing that break. Changes never actually get made -- usually the threat is used as leverage to secure something else they really want. I would bet my house that you won't see major changes to that law. 
[Matt, a line of yours is lodged in my head: ""Organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy."" Unfortunately, while the animosity of Occupy Wall Street is still strong in early 2013, the disorganization of the movement might be even stronger.  So, if you were in charge of Occupy Wall Street, what single achievable goal would you (re\)organize the movement around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azmp3?context=5)|Again, to repeat, breaking up the banks is the big thing. That should be the Holy Grail of activist goals. Everything flows from the TBTF problem. If that can be accomplished, we're off and running. And it's not farfetched. There are a lot of people even in DC coming around to the idea. 
[Matt, huge fan of your writing. In some bizarro alternative universe, you are left as supreme dictator of the USA, but you only get a month, and any laws you implement are now as good as scripture. What are some of the things you do? What would be the first thing you'd fix and how? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azyg8?context=5)|First of all, I'd want my official title to be ""Interior Minister."" I seem to recall that Ivan the Terrible once had a giant frying pan built so that he could roast the captives from a battle in Pskov. The frying supposedly was done in Red Square. I think I might try that with the cast of ""Jersey Shore.""
[Matt, would you ever tip your hat into the political ring? Please think about it, I mean, look what happened for Elizabeth Warren! I think you would have a major populist pull.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azpnb?context=5)|I wouldn't last 10 seconds as a politician. It's a very hard job with a completely different skillset from journalism. Plus, I'm totally unelectable... if you look at some of the early eXile issues, I couldn't win a county dogcatcher race with all that in my past. I wouldn't vote for me. 
[You're often pretty cynical about politics and society from your writing. Having worked in DC politics/journalism for the past 4 years, I often just want to get out. What gives you hope? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azkz8?context=5)|I get accused of being cynical a lot. I would say I'm the opposite of a cynic. A cynic is someone who recognizes that nothing changes. If I didn't think changing things was possible, I wouldn't be such a long-winded bore about the problems.
 |I think writers like David Brooks and Tom Friedman are cynics, even though superficially they're a lot more positive than I am. 
[A lot of people, myself included, are big fans of your writing as a journalist. Whose work do you try to read on a regular basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azkvj?context=5)|I read a lot of odd stuff on the internet. I check on Zero Hedge pretty regularly, love Jeremy Scahill, I read Glenn Greenwald. Drew Magary is my favorite sportswriter. Lawrence Wright is cool (The Looming Tower was fantastic). I reread Seymour Hersh's old books a lot -- ""The Price of Power"" is always in my bathroom...
 |Also read Bill Simmons on sports obviously, we're both from Boston, so there's a mutual-suffering factor there. EDIT: Sorry, I keep forgetting we won all those championships in the last decade. Hard to explain but a Boston sports fan always feels like he's suffering even when he should actually be thanking God on a daily basis that he doesn't live in Cleveland.
[How do you stay refreshed mentally? Does reporting the things that makes me rage quit reading the news for the day give you the lift you need to continue in itself, or do you find hobbies or a different way of recharging and reporting on more?  If I can't even read Greenwald then Taibbi in the same day because I get so outraged, how can you guys write it every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0dmp?context=5)|Chainsaw, I keep my focus extremely narrow and try to avoid upsetting things when I'm not working. That's why I don't even read much about things like the drone attacks or torture -- my head would explode. On the other hand, I could write ten books about the NFL draft. 
[I was wondering if there was a legal reason the SEC or other financial enforcement agencies cannot use some of the settlement/court decision money for their operating budgets, as police do. I don't agree with the incentives law enforcement has to pursue the drug war, but if its happening all the time why should the SEC or FDIC ever have budget problems, wouldn't they be one of the most ""profitable"" branches of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azs3u?context=5)|I believe last year the government claimed it made 15 dollars in fines for every one it spent on enforcement. I'm not sure why there should be a resources problem when it comes to policing Wall Street, big Pharma (which had three monster settlements last year including Abbott and GSK). We have a gazillion police patrolling the streets in bad neighborhoods in all our major cities, where there is very little potential for major economic damage to be done, while there are, what, 1000 SEC agents policing the whole country? There's no reason it should be that way. 
[Thanks for taking the time to pay us a visit, and for your insightful and entertaining work in *Rolling Stone*.  If you were an activist, rather than a writer, what do you think you would be working on now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azjoq?context=5)|The thing is, I'm not an activist. One thing people don't realize is that my primary attraction to the subject matter I write about is that it's so interesting from a literary point of view -- I mean the corruption is just so dark and disgusting, there's something almost humorous about it, I'm very attracted to it as a writer. I also love the labyrinthine complexity of the scams. It's kind of the perfect subject for me. On another level, it outrages my social conscience, but that's secondary, if I'm being honest. So do a lot of other things -- I mean, that business yesterday of the government giving itself the power to extralegally assassinate without evidence is monstrous. As an activist, there's no shortage of crazy things to fight against. But to me, the most interesting problem is this financial cartel issue. 
[Have you ever received a refutation of an account of events you given, specifically from those within finance? I read both your work and mainstream financial publications.  As I am sure you're aware, the authors of the latter do not hold the highest opinion of you or your work.  I am curious as to whether or not this ever plays out directly, or merely in the volley of articles back and forth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1nks?context=5)|I'm very often criticized by people on Wall Street, but I get just as many people from that community contacting me and helping me with what I do. A lot of what people take issue with, when they do criticize me, is the fact that I don't have a background in finance and I'm presuming to have opinions about things they think I don't really understand. But when you ask most of those critics to point out something I'm wrong about, usually what they're quibbling about is a conclusion, not a set of facts. So for instance, when I did my story on Goldman, I quoted a hedge fund guy who said that Goldman selling bad mortgage bonds while it was shorting them at the same time was a classic case of securities fraud – “the heart of securities fraud” was the quote. I had numerous people, like Megan McArdle for instance, jump down my throat about what an absurd notion that was. But it was a view that many people on Wall Street had – I got the idea from a millionaire hedge fund manager. Some people didn’t see anything wrong with what Goldman did, but I did and do. A year or so later, Goldman was facing a massive investigation by both the DOJ and the Senate for engaging in that very sort of activity.
[Stated plainly,  do the people you write about ever send hate mail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1nks?context=5)|Again, almost all of my sources are from the financial world. I’m obviously not going to come into a subject like this that’s so broad and complex and start making wild end-run calls about this or that. I’m listening to people on all sides of the equation and making a decision about whom to trust, whose point of view seems most valid. That’s what journalism is and you always do that, no matter what the subject is. With finance there is a very consistent criticism of the big banks and their misuse of government influence that I hear from all corners and the people who have this view are both very convincing personally and very consistent with each other. So that’s where this critique is coming from. I may not be an economist, but all journalists do what I do – listen to people, conduct interviews, and draw conclusions from what you hear.  
[After ""The Great Derangement"" was released, did any of the people you dealt with undercover in Texas find out about the book? Did any reach out to you/the fake you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azge1?context=5)|Yes, they did reach out. Well, one of the characters did. I haven't been good about getting back to her. I know she's a big fan of Bill MAher, because I always hear from her anytime I do that show. 
[A common criticism of your work is that your colorful rhetoric detracts from your serious and substantive reporting.  Do you see any merit to that critique?  Do you feel the rhetoric is necessary to keep readers engaged?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1k83?context=5)|I think without the color it would be very hard to get large numbers of people to read about credit default swaps and so on. It's a challenge from a writing point of view to creative a narrative about this world that makes the subject matter accessible to people who aren't into it naturally. Again, I find the crazily complex stuff these people dream up fascinating and I'm trying often in my work to let readers share vicariously in the excitement and wonder I feel in learning about it all. I'm sure some people think that detracts from the seriousness, but I feel pretty sure that rhetorically, it's all a net plus. 
[Hey Matt, any good behind the scenes stories from your early mornings on the Imus in the Morning show? I always enjoy your commentary with that crew.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azlpf?context=5)|I love Don. He's always been great to me. One very funny thing is that he dependably reams me out about how much the titles of my books suck. When you see us chatting off camera in breaks, it's usually about that. 
[Hi Matt, I'm a sophomore at Bard College, and I was just curious as to what you thought of Bard as a school.  Also where did you live here anyways? Toasters or Tewks?!  Do you make regular visits to old man Botstein?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0co7?context=5)|Hi Th0rsday. I lived in South Hall. Loved Bard, wrote an article last year about it. 
[If bankers were a particular type of sandwich, what type of sandwich would they be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0ee5?context=5)|Not sure, but I think it would have both Haggis and farina as ingredients. 
[This is a weird question, but did you ever write a piece with a parenthetical about Battlestar Galactica bring one of your favourite shows of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0d8m?context=5)|I definitely did not, because I watched my very first episode of it Monday night. I do like the show, though. I recognize a lot of actors from one of my other favorites, the Canadian cop show ""Da Vinci's Inquest.""
 |Can I ask why you ask? 
[You met me a little over a year ago in a book signing in Brighton right after you signed a magazine for three giggling teenage girls. I'm in that bearded leftist demographic. My question is: You are a regular critic of the entire system of finance, of wars, of lobbyists, and of stuff like Iraq war contracts, but you have never translated that criticism into one of capitalism generally. Indeed, you defend capitalism and assert that these kinds of things are perversions. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1pdw?context=5)|I get that question a lot. My view on this is, if there's something fundamentally wrong with modern industrial capitalism, we'll find that out when we actually see it in practice. But when it comes to modern Wall Street, we don't have the data to make that assessment, because there's so much anti-competitive collusion and intermingling with government power. Anyway those larger questions -- what sort of economic system we should live in -- are kind of above my pay grade. 
[You tackle a lot of contentious issues with powerful people. Have you ever been afraid for your life because of a story you were looking into?  EDIT: Grammar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1y6r?context=5)|Never. When I worked in Russia, I had friends who were Russian reporters who really did have to worry about those things (in fact two acquaintances -- I won't go so far as to say they were friends, but I knew people like Anna Politkovskaya -- were killed). But someone like me only needs to worry about litigation. I really... I get that question a lot, and it seems to me that people misunderstand the risks of reporting in a country like ours. The way to defeat journalists in this country is to ignore them, not kill them. 
[Matt,  What is the single most thoroughly corrupt entity \[institution, person, practice\] you have come across during your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b10s7?context=5)|I had a Russian reporter friend, Leonid Krutakov, who was trying to trace some money that disappeared from the Russian treasury. He followed the cash from bank to bank, transfer to transfer, until one bank listed the destination of the next bank in line as an address on the outskirts of Moscow. Leonid found the address and it turned out not to be a bank at all, but an electrical exchange box on a telephone pole. I'm not sure how they effected the actual theft, but I remember the punch line was that somebody had transferred tens of millions of dollars to a telephone pole. That was pretty much the best corruption story I ever heard. The top 10 are probably all Russia stories. 
[What are the best and worst parts about being on the Bill Maher show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1w2x?context=5)|That show is terrifying to do. Huge studio audience, huge TV audience, and you have to fight to get your comments in. Whatever people think about Bill, when you're on that set, you really appreciate how quick he is to keep that show flowing the way it does. 
[Matt, after reading Griftopia, it became even more obvious to me that right after the bubble burst, you somehow got the money (I'm assuming from Rolling Stone\) to travel as much as you needed to, and spend as much time as you needed to, to interview hundreds of people about it. That you were doing first-hand reporting, at a time when everybody else was just quoting press releases or (if they were really ambitious\) quoting what they heard on CSPAN. It's why yours is the #1 book I recommend on the subject.  But lately you haven't been doing as much of that; the sources you cite lately are (like the hacks back in 2008\) what your sources call you and tell you on the phone and what you see on TV. What would it take to shake loose some more travel expense money so you could do so more first-hand reporting? And if we did, who do you want to interview now that you can't afford the money or time to track down and spend time with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2qje?context=5)|I still travel a lot, as you'll see with my next book. But what you're describing has a lot more to do with time constraints, and age, and being married, than lack of funds. I don't have the ability to go spend weeks at a time in some faraway place anymore. 
[I used to intern at Democracy Now! and I met you once. You still writing that piece on ID's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1gey?context=5)|Yes, I remember you. That will be in my next book I think. 
[How did your father's connections help your journalism career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0v9d?context=5)|I should answer this, since it seems to come up a lot. My father was always supportive of me growing up. But he never once helped me get a job in journalism. My first gig in the business, with the Moscow Times, I actually got through family friends, a couple my parents knew in their college years who had worked with the Moscow Times editor in her previous job in Paris. After the Moscow Times, I worked at the eXile, which I started myself with Mark Ames. While at the eXile, Rolling Stone did a story about the eXile, which is how I met the editors there. So the only time anyone ever made a call for me was back when I was about 22 years old, and even that only got me the opportunity to submit freelance articles for the Moscow Times. Again, it's not that my father actively didn't help me -- he would have if I'd asked him to -- it just never came up. My father's an excellent TV reporter, he's really old school, and he taught me a lot, but our two businesses really don't intersect much. 
[Have you ever felt like your life was in danger because of a story you've written?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2npy?context=5)|It's amazing how often this comes up. Maybe I'm naive, but nobody kills journalists here. They just let them rant and rave and get drowned out by reality shows. Much cheaper!
[Do you interact with the other writes often?  Do you have round table discussions to develop avenues for your stories to follow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0yso?context=5)|Writing is a pretty solitary profession, you don't see writers hanging out a lot -- the best ones are cranks/curmudgeons, I think I'm heading in that direction.  
[Do you do as many drugs as Hunter S. Thompson did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2r96?context=5)|I think Hunter at his peak probably did more drugs in one week than I did in my last five years in Russia. 
[Would You Rather Fight a Horse-Sized Duck or a Hundred Duck-Sized Horses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2ivt?context=5)|A horse-sized duck, no question. And that's probably the best question I've ever been asked. 
[If you had to leave America, which country would you choose to live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1m6k?context=5)|Thailand probably. Great food, excellent people, elephants...
[Don't you feel any need to attempt to be objective in your reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2d8l?context=5)|There's no such thing as objective reporting. All reporting contains a point of view. Even if you're writing in the third person in the New York Times, there's bias in which facts you choose to present, and in what tone you use, what's in the headline... I believe it's better to be up front about the bias and let readers see it. 
[If you have one particular story you are proud to have written, what would it be and why? Thanks for what you do...been enjoying your work for years. I especially love you during election years.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2y1r?context=5)|My favorite piece of all time was something I wrote after New Year's Eve in Moscow called ""10 Seconds in a Moscow Police Station.""

[Hi Congressman McGovern - thanks for the AMA and for your efforts to scale back the Citizen United decision.  Can you tell us how we should interpret PAC contributions to your campaign? For example Norfolk Southern donate the maximum $10,000 to your 2012 campaign. Do they donate because they want access to you or do they donate because they believe in your ideology?  If a PAC donates the maximum $10,000 will they have greater access to you? Do they receive any special treatment when they want to discuss upcoming legislation? Do you think this system of pay-to-play also needs to be reformed?  How do the $10,000 contributions from Raytheon Co, Union Pacific Corp, CSX Corp and others effect the way you govern as a congressman? If these contributions have no effect on you, then why do these organizations take their time and money to donate in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajsno?context=5)|It's a fair question.  I am not going to unilaterally disarm.  The system stinks, but it's the system we have if you want to run for office.  If you want to change it, I hope you'll join with me in the effort to change how we finance campaigns.

I heard about a bill being introduced in Congress but people are saying it won't get very far. What are your thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aitcp?context=5)|I'm looking at legislation that will likely be introduced.  Unclear in a Republican House how much traction it will get, but I'm open to considering it.
[Hi congressman Jim McGovern! Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. What is your stance on gun control? Do you think stricter gun control laws should be put in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aic9j?context=5)|I favor universal background checks, assault weapons ban and legislation to prevent gun trafficking.  I'm hopeful we can at least get something done this year.
[How about term limits for the HoR and Senate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj06q?context=5)|Real campaign finance reform, so that we have a level playing field, is far preferable.  People ought to be able to decide who they want for as long as they want (or as short as they want).  I also support public financing of campaigns.
[Who is the biggest scumbag in congress?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiaul?context=5)|I don't have nearly that much time ... 
[Being in a country with over 300 million people, don't you believe there is a need for massive amount of campaign spending to reach out to these people? A more direct question would be, how would campaigning with less money be more beneficial to Americans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aif2e?context=5)|We need a system with greater access to the public airwaves for anyone who wants to run.  The notion that you are only a serious candidate if you have lots and lots of money seems contrary to who we are.  Members who raise millions of dollars from the oil industry will be influenced by that industry.  We need to empower people, and not Big Money special interests.
[As your last name is McGovern, did you always want to be a politician?  =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajebp?context=5)|No.  I thought I'd probably end up working in my father's package store (liquor store).  But I interned for George McGovern in college (no relation), he became my dearest friend and my hero, and my inspiration.  I was privileged to deliver the eulogy at his funeral.  I was a congressional staffer for 14 years for Rep. Joe Moakley before I ran and won in 1996.  McGovern taught to me to believe that one person can change the world, and Joe Moakley showed me how to do it.   
[Hello Rep. McGovern; thanks for doing this.  How many co-sponsors do you have for your bill?  Is Rep. Shrader (OR\) one of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aij2a?context=5)|12 on each bill.  Rep. Shrader isn't yet.

Thanks for your time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aidjj?context=5)|I spend as little time as possible, much to the chagrin of my campaign staff.  One of the reason i want campaign finance reform is i believe members of Congress spend way too much time dialing for dollars.  This is not a good system.  I have 'dues' for the DCCC that I'm expected to raise. $200K last cycle, and I'm expected to raise $ for other candidates.
[How is it that the House only allows bills to come to the floor if they are supported by a majority of the majority party (currently Republicans\)?  This amounts to rule by a minority of the members.  Why is this allowed?  Isn't there a more democratic (small d\) way of proceeding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj940?context=5)|That's the way the Rules of the House are structured.  The Speaker controls the calendar.  Technically, there is something called a 'discharge petition' whereby if 218 Members sign then a bill automatically goes to the floor, but these are very very rare.  
[Hi congressman. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us here today.  How has the technology available today changed the way in which you approach your role as a congressman?  And how do you see technology impacting the political landscape in the future with services such as Twitter and this Reddit AMA granting easy and direct access between the people and their representatives? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj5wq?context=5)|10 years ago I never thought I'd be doing this.  But I appreciate the fact that technology has made it easier for people to communicate with me and vice versa.  That's a good thing.  One issue, though - I get lots of ""petitions"" here in the office that many people don't even realize they electronically 'signed.' When you had to put pen to paper, it resulted in more thoughtful correspondence.  So I would urge people to take a little time when communicating with their elected representatives.  It goes a long way.
[Hello Jim,  MA resident here.  I was happy to see a resolution to overturn Citizen's United on my ballot this past election.  The resolution passed with an overwhelming majority - i believe about 4:1.  Link to www.boston.com.  How can we translate this momentum into a Consitutional Amendment.  The people clearly want this.  What are the road blocks preventing Congress from adopting your Amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aic7s?context=5)|Big money, big corporations and members of Congress who benefit from the status quo.  One of the purposes of my amendments is to begin the discussion.
[Who is the funniest person in congress?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aicud?context=5)|With Barney gone, I think Linda Sanchez (CA) in the House and Al Franken in the Senate.

Don't let anybody tell you that you can't or shouldn't.  I believe politics can be a noble endeavor.

We need to improve our infrastructure, better support our agriculture and keep moving toward green, clean energy.  Also, a better Red Sox season would be nice.
[Red Sox fan! FTW!  Congressman, what do you think the odds are of successfully overturning ""Citizens United""? Should we be cautiously hopeful that it will happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiadp?context=5)|It's a long road ahead, but I'm hopeful.  Either the SC will overturn its own rulings or the people will demand a change in the Constitution.  We need to fight.

Also, what's your favorite Barney Frank story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aicds?context=5)|I'm encouraged that there is a bipartisan group talking about imm. reform. I'm hopeful, but it has to happen this year before we head into another election season.  I have a million Barney Frank stories.  Most of them aren't family-friendly.  I miss him a lot.

Followup question: what are your favorite pizza toppings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aib1d?context=5)|Burncoat Pizza and the Wonder Bar - both in Worcester -  are two favorites.  Pepperoni, sausage, onions and peppers.
[What are your thoughts on The Peoples' Pledge that Warren and Brown made in the last election that severely limited outside group spending?  Do you think this model could be replicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aihao?context=5)|I thought it was a good thing.  But even with the pledge, Brown and Warren both had to raise about $45 million apiece.  I'm glad Warren run -- VERY glad -- but I'm troubled by all the money that has to be raised to run for Senate.  Or House.  
[Just a question about congress life in general: Do you ever ""hang out"" with your fellow congressmen? If so, does it get awkward when you vote differently on something you both feel passionately about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aihpk?context=5)|Sometimes we hang out.  It doesn't usually get awkward - we try not to talk 'shop' in social settings.  But we're all grown-ups.  We understand that we all have different points of view and different constituencies.
[I am very interested to know of your colleagues who are also involved in this discussion.  What is the interest in the Senate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aimnj?context=5)|Bernie Sanders, Tom Udall are two who have been active.

[Hello Congressman, thank you for doing this AMA. I am also quite upset by the Citizens United ruling and its consequences, but I do have a question.  If the ruling is overturned or negated through an amendment, how do you intend to reconcile the issue of corporations not having necessary rights to conduct business (such as the right to own property, the right to free speech etc\) with your proposed amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiybo?context=5)|Those are two separate areas - property rights are commonlaw rights under state laws.  On free speech, my amendment specifically makes it cleat that people maintain the right to free speech and free press.  But the notion that the artificial corporate entity, created under state law, should enjoy the same fundamental constitutional rights as citizens is just wrong, in my view.  NY Times did a great editorial on this ...
[Hi Congressman I am from Clinton, MA even though you do not represent my district I was curious what you thought about the recent leaked memo about the assassination of US citizens with no due process. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aio25?context=5)|I am deeply troubled and believe that the Administration owes us -- Congress and the American people -- some answers and some clarity on their policy.
[Constituent here, just want to say how awesome you are and how proud I am every time I get to vote for you.  Your speech in Worcester got me off my butt and got me volunteering on the Warren campaign.  Thanks for fighting the good fight for those that can't!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajdzh?context=5)|Thanks for your hard work!

187rnq,0,2013-02-09,Career options. I need your advice.,seldomsage,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/187rnq/career_options_i_need_your_advice/,"I'm graduating in May with a double degree in Finance and Econ. I will likely have employment offers with two firms:

1) Full-time entry-level operations at an insurance asset management firm (Chicago)

2) 3-month internship with a small investment management firm (New York City)

I think the NY opportunity would be a good way to get my foot in the door, and I also think I would have more choices in regard to career options. But again, this might end up only being a 3-month contract in which case I would be out of work if I couldn't find a FT position.

There are also cost of living and tax considerations, as well as the differences between cities in general.

Any and all advice is very much appreciated.

The main things I'm a little lost on are RAM and HDD.  Are the choices I've made in here good ones for the builds?  Also, I've read that the Corsair AX series is really good, but I'm less certain about the Antec I put in the cheaper build.

Is there a huge difference between the 7970's I've selected and the Vapor X GHz edition?  Cause the GHz Edition is like $80 more, and that adds up.  Even with the second build, I'd prefer keeping it under two grand.

Since I'm not buying *right now*, current sales aren't as useful to me.  I really, really hope to buy within the next month.  I *am* considering going ahead and buying the graphics card, so I can get Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite.  I'm not certain yet if I'll actually drive to Microcenter to get anything, it's a three hour drive; might not be worth it.  If it is worth it, though, I will.

Thanks for your help! :D  Really looking forward to building, whichever one I end up with.  I haven't built my own computer in like seven years.

Edit: Forgot to say what it's for.  Will mainly be using it to game and internet, stream to my PS3 and such.  Will likely do some video encoding.  I have two monitors and plan on eventually getting a third.  I know that the second build is likely overkill, but it's been way too long since I've had an overkill machine."
1879lh,26,2013-02-09,What experiences do you have where people have been uncomfortable with your minimalism?,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1879lh/what_experiences_do_you_have_where_people_have/,"For me, I keep a very minimal desk at work. A single pen for my notepad, and my computer. I don't have anything on my walls, although I've thought about it. I had to move desks and it took me less than a minute to grab my bag, pen, notepad and walk over to my new desk and log in.

However, this new desk is used by interns and some part time staff occasionally. I don't mind sharing at all, because although I'm full time, I mostly need to just check email between fabricating things in the shop.

One day, a part-time staffer came in and she was surprised I had moved. I told her I didn't need to use my computer all day, so no worries if she needed it. I come back a couple hours later and she put up drawing and papers all along the walls, changed my computer screen setup, and threw a bunch of pens and pencils and markers into my pen holder. She had all her things spread out, multiple jackets hanging on my chairs, papers everywhere, and so on.

I don't know if she was simply uncomfortable with how plain it looked, or if she was being passive-aggressive, but I thought it was quite odd. Now I'm not sure really what to do. She's only in a couple mornings a week. I can't imagine altering someone else's space, especially if I was temporarily using their space. Ultimately I don't care, but looking at the clutter is bothersome at times. A coworker said ""Why don't you just put some of your things up on the walls as well to make it your own?"" 

**It seems like most people believe the only way to personalize a space is to add to it, whereas I feel most comfortable and expressed through a clean, efficient, open space. That's most reflective of who I am and what I value and enjoy.**

What are some of your odd experiences or encounters?"
186pyf,4,2013-02-09,Secret to getting an Internship?,theBenger,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/186pyf/secret_to_getting_an_internship/,"I am a Junior computer engineering major at Cal Poly Pomona, and even though I have been applying like crazy, I have been unable to land an internship.  I have a good GPA (3.4) and among other things, I am second in charge of the electrical systems on the Rose Float my school builds every year.   Even with all of that I am finding it impossible to get even interviews.  Am I expecting too much or am I missing something?

**EDIT 1:** I have a resume, a cover letter, and a portfolio of projects.  I have attended job fares at my school and handed these out, but the vast majority of my applications have been over the internet.  All of my material has been review by the career fair on campus and a few other people.  I think that my documents don't get across the work I have been doing, especially within Rose Float (I have completed 5 major projects, including making and programming a ""secondary"" animation system to control mechs our primary is unable to)

**EDIT 2:** Just for perspective, the Rose Float program is a massive year round project.  I put 10~20 hours in many weeks, with the 3 weeks coming up to the parade being 14 hour work days with almost no breaks.  It is done in conjunction with Cal Poly SLO and between people who have positions and volunteers, upwards of 200 students work on the project over the course of the year.   Outside of sports, it is the single largest program budget wise on campus."
186mcx,6,2013-02-09,Can I get my Associates and then continue right where I left off for my Bachelors?,chriswilliams54,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/186mcx/can_i_get_my_associates_and_then_continue_right/,"The reason that I ask is that when I graduated High School I wasn't really ready for college. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and I wasn't really mature enough to handle school. So I drifted through school for a few years failing classes(which caused my GPA to plummet.) and changing majors a few times before I finally straightened up. I decided on a degree in Information Technology and everything has been great since. The problem is that I am now 23 and I still have at least a couple of more years of school left before I can graduate. However, I should be able to get my Associates by the end of the fall 2013 semester. I live in rural Oklahoma so there aren't really many jobs unless you want to go work in an oil field (which I can't due to a heart condition). I am still working in retail, and even though I am in a supervisory position, I am barely making above minimum wage. I don't make enough to live on my own so I still live at home with my parents. I am anxious to start working on a ""career"" instead of just having a job. So my plan was to get my Associates degree coupled with as many IT certifications as I can acquire and try and find a job while continuing right where I left off to still get my bachelors. Can I do that or will I have to start over? If it is possible would it be a bad idea if I were to have to relocate for the job, meaning I would have to transfer schools? I looked into doing internships but my (slowly recovering) GPA is a big roadblock for those. So I tried to get involved at school and do the ""College Life"" thing, but living 45 minutes away makes it difficult. Plus now that all my friends have graduated (or are close), I am feeling more and more like Pierce or Leonard from Community everyday. Both at school and at work. And it is only going to get worse as time goes on. So any advice? Is this a dumb plan? Sorry about the wall of text; it's late and I am exhausted.

Thanks for any help."
186hjx,2,2013-02-09,"[MF] ""The Tease/Intern""",eroticwritingac,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/186hjx/mf_the_teaseintern/,"The alarm rings as the clock strikes five a.m. and I slowly rise to my feet to stumble towards the kitchen to start my day as I have for the past year. I've really splurged on today's meal, with eggs and bacon as my main course and a shot of my favorite Orange Juice Vodka to finish it off. Alert as all hell I slip my shoes on, grab my coat and briefcase and lock my door behind me as I start my day. The walk to the train seems to be getting worse, always seems as if some sort of construction blocks the shortest route, turning my once one hour commute into a two hour ordeal to get to work on time. After zig-zagging side streets to find the station I board the train and take a seat. Sure most view the young businessman as a person of enthusiasm and energy, but this is not always so. I feel the touch of alcohol hit my body as I become more relaxed. My senses become dull for the moment and a new euphoria is found. My work is a few stops from my home and plenty of people seem to enter and exit each stop without my notice. Half asleep, I walk off the train and walk two blocks to the building I work at to start my workday and my ""paid time"" as I like to call it. I find my desk and begin to make my calls as I have done for my entire tenure here. 

Suddenly I'm broken from my cycle of mundane tasks by this seemingly angel like female, asking if I need assistance with anything. Surely this is a product of my sleep deprivation right? A few awkward seconds pass and I come to my senses that this female is real and is patiently awaiting my response. I tell this girl to sort my papers between my two active accounts, and she gets straight to work. Its hard not to notice her young body through the sexual clothing the others find as ""suitable business attire"". I strike up some quick conversation to find out a little bit about this angel, asking her what her official position is. Her response wasn't a surprise, ""Intern"" she said. As a recent graduate I knew right where she was, the ready-to graduate student finishing up their intern hours to get their degree. We make plans to meet up for dinner after work, and we split ways til then. 7:30 rolls around and we both arrive at a local place to grab some dinner. Shortly into our evening she asks me to act as her boyfriend, as her ex enters the restaurant. I quickly seize the opportunity by sliding into the bench next to her, and getting a quick feel for what she has got. The man sits down and asks the girl if they could talk privately. She continues by grabbing my hand and leading me to the door. She pulls my arm around her side and we leave the restaurant. Noticing the location of her college I offer to go home with her, as the area is known for crime and this hot body is likely to draw attention. After an hour of walking we arrive at her apartment when things take a turn, for the best. She unlocks her door, guides me inside where we proceed to make out, throwing all belongings to the side and sitting her up on the counter. After ten minutes of provocative kissing we part ways, and I head home. The next day at work we strike eye contact and I know that she's urging for more. That tight ass can't wait and I know it with my gut. An hour passes, and she drops a note on my desk reading ""Let's meet on the corner of fifth and X at 12:30"". 

I don't hesitate by nodding my horny little head and walking there by the specified time. A light hands grasps mine from behind and she leads me down the bustling street. We walk up some marble stairs to a lavish building in the center of the city. We enter the elevator as I question her as to where we are. No response from her, only a guiding hand down a wide hallway. She pulls a mysteriosu key fro mher pocket and opens a large wooden set of doors to a luxurious complex of a downtown loft. I close the door as she reaches into my pant pockets and pulls my phone onto the table. She places both of our devices in the center of the table and removes the batteries from both. She takes me to the main living room where she sits me down on a chair fit for a king. She turns facing the opposite way and slowly removes her winter jacket. Getting anxious I watch as she removes her tight skirt to leave her black lingerie top and bottom to stare at. 


She unwraps her hair, and lets her beautiful long brown hair out as she kisses my crotch. Quickly gaining an erection she slides my work pants off to find an erect cock pressing my underwear skyward. She uses her warm little hands to remove my underwear and stares deeply into my eyes the entire time. She faces the opposite way and presses my hot cock into her perfect ass, with her panties being the only thing to prevent me from going in. She stands only to remove the remaining clothing and proceeds by dropping to her knees, to place her mouth around my pulsing cock. Pushing her face deeper and deeper into my crotch she quickly turns around and presses her tight ass onto my cock. Screaming for mercy she slides my throbbing cock into her anus and continues by making extremely small moves. It's obvious that this is her first time and she blushes only seconds after penetration. We make our way to the shower and turn it to the hottest we can. Her amazing ass rubs against my body as we kiss in the steam. Her medium size chest gives my hands something to play with as my senses explode into a new sort of euphoria I've yet to experience. 

I lay her perfect body onto the floor of the massive shower and cycle between her perfect pussy and asshole. 



She screams in excitement and most likely orgasm. Getting close to orgasm myself, I remove my pulsing cock from her ass and explode all over her long hair. We quickly clean up and head out, promising to keep this our little secret.

This is my first story, I'm not sure whether to be very detailed or not, if you could add insight that would be fantastic. Thanks for reading!"

I'm back again a few months later to say that we're still hiring! 

The company is Fullscreen. We are the #1 independent YouTube Network, with ~1.8b monthly views. In addition to YouTube content, we also work directly with many large brands (NBC, Lexus, Google, Pepsi, American Express, Nintendo, and others) to help them manage and improve their YouTube presence.  

We're hiring both front-end and back-end application developers (JavaScript, Rails).  This time, we're looking for people with experience and/or demonstrable skills.  Rails devs are a bit more self-explanatory, but I do want to point out that we are looking specifically for JavaScript devs who are comfortable developing JS-based web apps and who are at least familiar with using jQuery, underscore.js, and/or CoffeeScript.   

We're also looking to line up an intern or two for the summer.  We want people who are in CS, CompE, HCI, or similar fields and who are capable of cutting code of some sort.  Exact responsibilities would depend a bit on the person and their abilities/experience.  The positions will be, of course, in Atlanta.

Our primary wants:

* You're smart and/or good at problem solving
* You're interested in learning new things
* You can get stuff done without micromanagement.
* You have an appropriate background and experience (Ruby/Rails, JavaScript app dev).  Degree not required.
* You're a good cultural fit.

What you'll get out of this:

* You'll be working on a small team in a startup environment.
* Product ownership. We build out a lot of things. You'll build something, too, and see it through the full product life cycle.
* Learning. We're building products for a market in its infancy. We're constantly doing something new and learning as we go.
* A fast-growing company. We're currently undergoing explosive growth.
* A tech budget. Get some $ to buy the setup you prefer.
* The flexibility that comes with results-oriented development.  We don't have set hours and if you need to work from home sometimes, that's fine with us.  
* Standard company benefits -- competitive salary, health/dental/vision, free snacks and drinks, etc..

For more info, check out our super awesome webpage http://fullscreen.net or email me directly at mitchell at fullscreen.net.  We've had problems in the past with people's emails going to my spam folder, so pinging me here might also be a good idea.

P.S.: If you're interesting in moving to Los Angeles, we have some openings in our main office as well."

189vda,0,2013-02-10,Le Debate,[deleted],hcfactions,https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/189vda/le_debate/,"I honestly do not understand why everyone acts like we are such **god awful** *terrible* people, can someone explain it to me? I'll try to address some points where I think you get it from. 

* **Kick and Kill of ChubbyMoose**

He was [planning](http://i.imgur.com/97Zobrk.png) on betraying us, and we just happened to get rid of everybody we deemed untrustworthy shortly before hand. So don't believe him when he acts all innocent, he didn't smart his way out, he actually got temp-banned for combat logging against us and we got his inventory. He is the only one who got killed.

* **Inviting ""noobs"" over to join us and then killing them**

As many of you know, Reid and I are not the best fighters on the server. If somebody goes and says ""Hey, I have full diamond can I join you?"", we jump on that. We only had four active men most of the time, so we couldn't contest King of the Hill or Palace, and mining is unnecessary. The only way for us to increase coffers is shady tactics like so. I never once said one of these people could join us, I only said that they could trade, or intern with us to have a **chance** to join us. Either way it teaches the valuable rule #1, to trust **NOBODY**.

 * **Killing people who come to trade**

This ties to my last point. We have done this once or twice this map, and its a rather effective tactic. I mean, its a **Hardcore** server, so if someone comes into my base with things I want, should I pay them or just kill them? And onto attacking Zigman, we're on rather shitty terms with Platypus right now. It's hard to want them alive when Smiggyballs tried to get me killed last map, and with them setting us up in a trap this map.

 * **Noobkilling**

We had (1) member on that list. We don't invite noobs over to kill, if we find them in the wilderness we will kill them. Like I said above, we need all the resources we can get. Sometimes we get sticks, sometimes we get four or five diamonds, its a risk. If they aren't in a safe place by the time their protection is out, they need some more practice. Plus, there are **many** other players that are highly regarded on that same list, even higher above. Pikaoku told me I was a horrible noob killer, although Punkrocker, Boweee, and Russian_Roulette are all on the list/in his faction. In the next five minutes, he killed the same unarmed player twice.

 * **Trolling in chat**

This one actually makes me laugh. We play on a server were ""le"", ""x2013"", and ""fite me irl"" is said maybe hundreds of times daily. So what if we say ""u mad"" after a fight, who actually cares? It is a **joke**. Earlier this map I was joking around with the server and y'all freaked out calling me a troll and evil. Seriously, look in a mirror. Some of the people here are actually **bad** people, and everyones okay with them. 


 * **Conclusion**
  
I'd just like to remind everybody that this is a game, which is played to have fun. Albeit more hardcore than most, its purpose is still recreation. This is how we have fun. If we were in a large faction, these wouldn't be our actions, but we aren't and this has been the most fun i've ever had on HCF. I've experienced a mob mentality against my faction for reasons I do not comprehend, and some really mean shit has been said to me. CaptainPaanda said that ""You are worse than Hitler because he eventually killed himself"", that was actually really funny though. Everybody just needs to calm down, and start worrying about themselves.

189fcb,3,2013-02-10,Just venting,DeusExMachina09,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/189fcb/just_venting/,"I've been lurking on Reddit for awhile now and I just need to vent on how the past two months has been for me. Just for background I am a recent college grad with an I.T degree. I am also going to a S.A.T. therapist to work out some compulsive issues that i have.

So to say that I had a shitty past two months would be an understatement. As explained above I am a recent college grad and for the past six months I've been doing a really good internship that had a good chance to be turning into full time position. Last month I learned that I was not going to be hire nor was my internship going to be extended due to ""budget cuts"". I write ""budget cuts"" because I feel like I did not meet their expectations and that they do not want to come out and say that. Needless to say I've been trying ever since to find another job/internship with no luck and I am getting nervous because I moved into the area where the internship was located and now stuck in a year lease.

As I also stated above I've been seeing a S.A.T. therapist for about four months now to work out some issues. The main reason that go me going was my girlfriend( of over four years) wanted to see me get better. Now though my girlfriend is telling me I've been too depressed lately and haven't been talking much lately for her to be happy with us anymore. So two weeks ago we started a ""break"" to try to work through things which I prefer not to but accepted to keep her happy. And now a couple of days ago she ended things with me after coming out and saying that she formed an emotional relationship with a guy friend and is now confused on what she want. We I would been more ok with if we just ended things there. But she is stringing me along to try and see if we can fix things while still talking to the other guy. I  know I am not the boyfriend of the year material but all of these event are happening at the same time and is bring my already low self-esteem even lower. I just needed to vent for a minute so just enjoy your day..

1898di,3,2013-02-10,"Year long relationship ended after she [21F] broke up with me [21M], Here's my story.",Nemesis3137,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1898di/year_long_relationship_ended_after_she_21f_broke/,"/r/breakups, this has been the hardest week of my life. Here is a little background to my story. I met this girl over a year ago at an event with some friends. As soon as I saw her I thought she was amazingly beautiful. I shortly find out that shes good friends with one of my friends so I start hanging out with him more to create a way to see and talk to this girl. (I'm incredibly shy and didn't want to approach her alone). I hung out more and more with this girl and decided to ask her to be my date to a formal student group event. She told me that she'd love to go with me and that's where my memories with her started. I cannot get that out of my head. A couple of days after that date night I ask her to be my girlfriend and she says yes. She also surprises me by saying shes never had a boyfriend before but just did a lot of hooking up in the past. Anyways we create an incredible amount of memories together and after about 6 months i tell her that I love her and she tells me that she loves me too. 

Fast forward to last summer, things start getting more difficult with us. I remained on campus to take summer classes while she went home to work for the summer. The separation bothered me and I did talk to her about it but she seemed like it didn't bother her and that she could handle it well. I remained confident that we could get through it and I got to see her at least every other weekend. 

Fall comes around and she comes back to school but I get a co-op (internship thing). Luckily it is in the same city so I could continue to see her. However, her major starts to get really difficult and she stresses out very easy. She says to me that she cant see me as much as we used to because of how much work she has to do in her design program. This spawned a couple of arguments but I got her to agree spending the night with me at least once during the week and once during the weekend. On top of being stressed out from her school work, she also had to find a co-op job for the spring semester which was very intimidating for her. There were something like 40 jobs and 90 kids in her program competing for them. At the end of fall semester she gets a job but its in a city 4 hours away. I start to stress out as I know as everyday moves by shes getting closer to leaving. I talked to her about my worries and asked her why shes not stressed like I am. She told me shes had an exhausting semester and at this point it doesn't feel real to her. 

Anyways, winter break rolls around but I never got to see her during it because she went away for the entire break. After break I briefly saw her for 2 hours on one day and when i first saw here and went in for a kiss she kinda turned her head like she didn't want to. I found that odd. I thought this was going to be the last time id see her for a while so i wanted her to come over to my place so we could spend more time together but she said shed be back the next day to say her goodbyes to everyone else. I stick with her that next day as she says her goodbyes and I couldn't help but wonder why her goodbyes to other people seemed so much more genuine then ours. Anyways I talk to her before she leaves and she seems optimistic about doing long distance for the semester. I tell her I want to talk every night and she said okay but I have to call her, not always rely on her to call me. She leaves and I begin to miss her an incredible amount. I did call her most nights and whenever I told her I loved her, sometimes she would say she loves me too, some times she would just say you too or me too and that kinda bothered me but i never brought it up. 

Fast forward again to last Saturday, she texts me, ""Hey I decided to come into town this weekend, I want to see you I feel like I need to talk."" I immediately get worried as I don't take that texts last part to mean good things. I ask all my friends and they advise me to stay optimistic but prepare for the worst. Anyways, she finally comes by and i decided to act normal just to see if i was wrong and I knew i wasn't she walked up to me with teared eyes and I hugged and and just said hey..she then asked to go inside and talk. Now for the breakup part, She tells me i'm a great person and i didn't do anything wrong, but her feelings for me have changed and shes not able to say why but this is how it is. She says she loves me and cares about me but she is not In love with me. She then tells me it was since last summer shes been having these thoughts and she wanted to try sticking it out and seeing if they changed but they didn't. She didn't want to break up with me last fall because i was going through a hard time with co-op but she has to now because she realizes there is no good time. Learning that shes been thinking this way for a while struck me hard because I knew i felt her love during the summer and fall and I only felt things getting different when she came back from winter break. Anyways, I did what anyone would tell you not to do and I begged her, told her how much I loved her and how she was perfect for me and I couldn't do being alone now. She was my guidance through my tough times in college and i needed her. She then tells me that I can still call her and talk to her about things bothering me and she wants to be a friend for me but she cant be with me because shes not happy and she cant say the same things i feel about her to me. I beg and I beg and she says she needs to go but mentions something about maybe agreeing to call her in 3 weeks and talk about it again after its sunk in better for me and Ive accepted it. She couldn't look me in the eyes very well during the breakup and I couldnt stop crying on her and I asked her if we could ever be together again and she just shook her head but when i asked more she just said she doesnt know where her feelings will be but right now they are not there so that seems impossible. I also just tried to say that maybe she just needs a break from us and she said no this is a break up and we will not be in a relationship after this. I wonder if theres someone else and i ask her but she said she doesnt have her eye on anyone this is just how she feels and it feels not right being with me. I Finally I just give up. I let her go but made her promise to me that she will think more about it more and come see me again when she comes back into town at the end of march. She says she will but I will have to respect her if her thoughts about me haven't changed. She leaves and I know that's the last time I will see her for a while. 

That was over a week ago and now Ive been going through a terrible week full of what ifs and how can i get back with her. Ive talked with so many people and everyone just says the same thing about having to move on and accept things but I just cant think about that right now. Its different because I think about how my life will be without her. Shes friends and hangs out with a bunch of guys I live with. She also goes to the same events I go to off campus. I know I will see her a lot when she comes back from co-op. I start taking peoples advice and going to the gym to try to feel better that way, of course it doesn't work because my mind has her constantly in my thoughts. I start coming up with my own reasons as to why shes done this and I think about how I can get her to find why she used to love me. I haven't spoke to her since she left and i decided to go NC with her for 3 weeks total (because she said this # during our breakup) to see if that would do anything. I feel like it will help both me and her by giving us both space and maybe space is what she wants. I cant stop thinking about questions that I have like what is she doing? who is she talking to? How does she feel at this point? Does she miss me? Does she ever think for a second that maybe she made a mistake? Is it inevitable for her to miss me? she couldn't possibly break up with me and not miss me..Anyways I have 2 weeks left before I am going to call her and trust me Ive heard from everyone Ive talked to its a bad idea to get my hopes up like this but It just feels like what i have to do. I don't know what im going to do when i talk to her, ill want to say how much i miss her and ask her questions but I don't want to freak her out and ruin everything. So im stuck between wondering if I should make small talk or bring up the relationship. It's very hard for me to be strong and move on because i get attached to people. I would say I have less friends then most people but the people who I call my friends I would do anything for. I'm not the best sociable person but that's an aspect about her that she is incredible in. That's why it felt like we were good together I think, because we complimented each other in so many ways. I see her on Facebook and I just want to talk to her but I cant because I don't want to ruin things..I have my 3 week NC plan and its the only thing that I feel gets me through these days and this stressful difficult semester of classes. 

So I guess Im writing because I want more advice. Especially from this subreddit. Ive been reading stories the past couple of days and just trying to relate. All my friends don't seem to understand but it seems like a lot of you are going through the same depressing thoughts. If you managed to read through this whole thing I thank you so much for giving me time. I just don't know how I should progress if I want this girl back and would do anything for her. There are too many memories for me to simply get over this. Any thoughts or comments or questions are appreciated..thanks. "

**Untitled**

By the time I hear the screaming in Arabic, I have a pretty good idea what's going on. 

We'd be on the tarmac at LGA for three hours at that point, with repeated assurances from the pilot that the ""mechanical concern"" keeping us from taxing up to the gate would be resolved quickly. At least this is what has been explained to me by the marketing executive who stole my window seat. Truth be told, I've barely listened to a word of Don Draper's life story, nodding with feigned interest between Xanax and cocktails. I'd tuned his frequency out almost completely when the words ""security situation"", fully dressed in Texan drawl, pierce their way through my drug-fueled haze.


This is the same haze that keeps me from remembering I am claustrophobic. The same haze that keeps me from remembering the exact materials composing the sardines can in which I am rocketing through the atmosphere. Today, it is also the same haze that helps me forget I will likely be unemployed by this time tomorrow.


I fix satellites for a living. The by-product of a half-decent electrical engineering degree and a summer spent playing office sports at a telecom company in Queens. That latter part is called an internship, so I'm told. My employer, the NRO, is one of Uncle Sam's many little helpers. They tell me I am incredibly gifted in my field, so much so that my reliance on anxiety medication is worth overlooking in the security clearance process. More recently, they tell me I am doing so well that they are adding the words ""Chief Engineer""  to my title. I'm told this is important as well. At the time, I briefly laugh at the idea that this will be added to my birth certificate as part of my legal name. The laughter stops when I remember my employer does things like this before breakfast.


I travel extensively for this line of work. Tinkering on items that don't exist, in places that don't show up on maps, and filing reports to people without real names. We then occasionally send these items into space.


My last tinkering expedition, the one I'm returning from now, was something new. Usually I go to a military base or somewhere with an abundance of gates and incredibly well-painted logos involving eagles. This trip takes me to a warehouse in Sydney. Inside, bureaucrats watch as I re-assemble the surveillance payload provided to me by the liaison team and transmit a written report on-site back to Washington before being whisked back to my hotel, where I will remain under supervision for the duration of the week. I ask no questions of what I am working on or what it will be used for, and the bureaucrats ask none of me.


Several days later, my guard informs me I am being driven back to the warehouse. Another first, as the rule book states I am never to return to the site of an operation once I have finished working, and Uncle Sam loves his rule book.  The bureaucrats are prowling around a hastily assembled conference table like jungle predators when I get there, speaking a language so riddled with profanity I am not quite sure its English. My arrival causes the room's occupants to freeze, and it becomes painfully clear I am the raw meat.


It turns out my surveillance payload was quietly sent into space, and the information it gathered was used to make the decision to send men with guns into a place where Uncle Sam has been explicitly told both men and guns are not supposed to be. It then turns out that this information was wrong because of the faulty work that I did. As a result, several men, and their guns, did not successfully return to the United States. 


""Security situation"". The words pull the Xanax blanket off from over my head again, bringing me back to the plane and keeping me away from memory. Don Draper motions to me to look at his phone, waving it frantically until it is an iPhone-shaped blur in my peripheral. I cave and skim the headline, ""An evolving security situation has been reported on Flight 802 at LGA, the aircraft is being quarantined. More updates to come."" 


I look around for the first time since take-off and see the sharp glow of cell phones against the unlit cabin, hearing the concerned murmuring of one-hundred and six passengers and six crew members. I'm squinting through the liquor when the first wave of panic hits me, as I understand I am now smack in the middle of something alarming instead of watching it happen from a satellite feed. The noises spreading throughout the cabin make it pretty clear I am not the only one coming to this realization.


The drugs are fading now too. Years of operating in a culture of secrecy and paranoia have caused my adrenaline to start flowing early, my stomach churning into battery acid. 


Then, the screaming starts.

188e5c,1,2013-02-09,This is a long summary of my life and why I feel depressed...,grapesarentforyou,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/188e5c/this_is_a_long_summary_of_my_life_and_why_i_feel/,"I'm posting to get a lot off my chest and hopefully get some sort of help. This will probably be long but I just want to tell anyone who'll read why I'm depressed.

I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember. Back in middle school I wasn't popular at all and got made fun of a lot. By the time I was in high school I learned to laugh with the people making fun of me and act like I didn't care about all the jokes even though it hurt badly. After that, I started making some more friends and by the time I graduated ended up ""fitting in"" with the popular kids.

After I graduated high school I decided to go to a tech school for IT, the only thing I've ever been interested in doing for a living. After awhile, I found out the school was shit and dropped out to look for a better school. Around this time I started to get into Christianity (I grew up a Christian) and started going to church again. I made some friends who went to a Bible college and I decided to go to the same college they went to even though they offered no degree that I wanted to study.

I thought ""getting close to God"" would help my depression and make me feel better. One summer break I got the chance to go to Brazil to help build a church and then the next summer I went to China to learn Chinese. I met a girl that I became obsessed with in China and we became best friends. I went back the next summer to do an internship (I had decided to study ESL for my degree) at her school and got to see her again. I decided that I was in love with her and that we were meant to be. She didn't share the same feeling at the time but I made it my mission for her to fall in love with me. A year before I graduated college, I decided that I'd move to China to teach English and start a relationship with this girl. I joined a Christian organization to make getting there easier but their recruitment process is pretty strict. Since I was trying to ""be close to God"" on my application under ""is there anything we should know about you"" I wrote that I was struggling with pornography addiction. That turned into me being turned down by the organization after months of going through the recruitment process and the organization sending me to a therapist for a semester to get help and then try to join again. I went to therapy for a semester and it went great but in the end, they said I wasn't ready... So, after all that, I ended up joining another more relaxed organization and then moving to China.

It took about a half a year but I finally accomplished my goal of getting the girl to start to fall for me. We hung out a lot she stayed over a few times in my room in my friends' apartment. My friends were also Christians but the girl I was in love with wasn't. They got pissed that she stayed over a few times and then another one of my friends found out. Since they didn't like it (or her for that matter; they were never nice to her) I found my own apartment after about a month and she moved in with me. The third friend who found out about is was part of the same organization that helped me go to China and he told them that I was dating a non-Christian girl. That all blew up and became a huge deal. The summer after I went to China I had to go back home for a one-year checkup with the organization and in the meeting they told me I either have to break up with the girl or leave the organization. I chose the girl and said fuck the organization... This whole deal lead to me losing my faith. I've got a lot to say about that but now's not the time. Anyways, a few months after that happened the girl broke up with me. This devastated me. I left an organization for her and then she broke my heart. I went into deep depression and thought about killing myself a lot. I started drinking a lot, smoking, and even had sex with prostitutes. I told myself I'd never love another girl so why not do those things? Well, eventually we got back together but after that it was always on for awhile, off for awhile, and the same thing all over again. Even before we broke up the first time she treated me like shit but I was obsessed with her and made her my life. She found out that I suffered from depression and basically told me that I was crazy and she couldn't be with someone that doesn't have the mind of a ""normal"" person so I had to convince her it was just culture shock.

After awhile, I got a job teaching English. I hated it so much and hated myself for not sticking with an IT degree in the first place but I kept on doing it because it was the only chance I had to be with the girl. After a year of teaching English I told her that I wanted to go back to the states. This was when we were together so she said she supported me. We were doing alright together and we decided if we were really meant to be, being apart would could be a test. If things went well, she'd move to the states and we'd have a life together here. She had to go back to her hometown before I left for America and we constantly had problems. Finally, we just made the decision to just be friends. We knew we loved each other but we just didn't understand each other. (not a language issue; she speaks English and I speak Chinese)

So, now I'm back in the states. I've only been home for almost two weeks but I already feel like shit. The first few days were amazing. I bought a car the day after I got back and got a nice phone as well. I missed home so much. But now, reality is starting to sink in and it's killing me. For the past week, I've thought about suicide everyday. I miss my ex even though I don't want to be with her at all. I always think ""what if this, what if that""... That hurts but the thing that hurts the most is that I'm realizing I've given up a lot to come home. I gave up everything to go to China and now I've given up everything I had there to come back home. Before I came home, I had my own apartment and a high-paying university job. I was respected as a teacher and was actually somebody people looked up to. Now that I'm home, I'm just a loser. I don't have a lot of money saved up. I live with my parents. I don't have a job. I don't have a girlfriend. I've only got one friend. I've been trying to call someone who said could help me get started in the IT field for a week but he won't return my calls even though I've left four messages. I just feel like I've lost everything.

I hated living in China. The culture was interesting to begin with but the interesting stuff got annoying quick. The differences were just too big sometimes. I had a lot of anger issues in China just because I would get so frustrated sometimes. I hated my job too even though it paid well and people respected me. Now that I'm hope, I'm starting to think that living in a place that I hate doing a job that I hate is better than the life I've got here. Everyday I think about dying and feel nothing but sadness. Sometimes the sadness goes away but it makes me feel even worse because when I'm not sad I feel absolutely nothing.

I've left out a lot of details that I think actually matter but since this is already long enough, I'll spare you. Thank you for reading if you did.

tl;dr went to bible college and took a trip to china, fell in love with a girl and sacrificed a career I'd enjoy and two and a half years to be with her, it didn't work, moved home and now have nothing "

I'm sick to death of everything being about you. 

You didn't even cross a line today. Today wasn't even the worst you've been to me. I don't know why today is my breaking point, but it is. 

So yeah. I guess in the long run, thanks for telling me that I look unprofessional today. That my outfit (a fucking grey graphic tee, black blazer, and blue pants - OH HORRORS!) is ""awful"" and ""a big mistake"" - that my t-shirt has ""obviously been washed too many times."" You look like a circus clown from the 60s. Head to toe purple, orange, and red corduroy that you sewed together yourself is also not a good look, you frizzy-headed bitch.

I've put myself out there for you so many fucking times, I can't even count them. I had the best relationship with my boss that a person can fucking have, and I used up my time and energy going to bat for you with her - calming her down when she was pissed at you, planting seads in her head against your enemies, telling her how hard you were trying. When all along, you've just been a selfish, controlling, manipulative bitch. You're almost 60 - when are you ever going to act like an adult!? Why are you so over the top dependent on everyone else, but you go out of your way to make enemies?! None of your shit makes any sense. Thanks a lot for having me in complete tears, by the way, the other week. It was nice of you to tell me off in front of the public and to tell me that everyone hates me. 

When you didn't get this job, because you're too STUPID to fill out a resume and an application properly, and when you stormed out of your internship because of it, I wish to god we had let you go. I wish to god we had let you go on your way. But we're nice. We felt bad for you. We felt sorry for you for spending so much time interning here to not get the job. So we went to bat for you. HUGE MISTAKE. You are just an evil, bad, bad, bad person. I hope that you get alzheimers like your psychzo father. Do you know what it takes for me to wish that on someone after my grandfather had it?!  But you're just the kind of shithead who can make me cross that line, finally, after 3 years of love and patience and training wheels with THIS BULLSHIT IN RETURN. And you want to whine to me about having depression and you CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE DRUGS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY ON?! Yeah, I don't really even believe a word you say anymore. There's just no possible way that you've been picking up a prescription for decades and you don't know what you're taking. It makes me doubt everything you say. About your father, about your life, about your work. 

And speaking of work - since we all went to bat for you those years ago, and since we continue to go to bat for you and forgive you for your NUMEROUS PUBLIC TANTRUMS, could you maybe try to get some work done? I shouldn't have to take time out of my day to double-check and then fix everything you do. I'm not your supervisor! I should LET YOU FAIL! You can't handle the simplest of fucking things. There are so many people out there trying to get good jobs, and you're just ditzing around like a flightly little hell-beast on a drama-fueled rampage. God, just fucking die already. Please. Just go.

Steve Carrell (Michael Scott) left a while ago, Ed Helms (Andy Bernard) was away from the show for many weeks, the writers brought in 3 new characters (the 2 interns and the sound guy).
Personally Im not sold on it. Having worked in multiple office situations over the last few years I have a fondness for the show and how in/accurately they portray the experiences in these situations. However, this latest season has been hit or miss for me. Other shows this year that are ending have been 30 Rock and How I met Your Mother, both of those are finding rather inventive and engaging ways to wrap up their respective series. I feel the writers and actors in the Office are not making this Farewell season do any justice to the previous (in my opinion) fantastic season. If i could ask Steve Carrell his thoughts... i can only imagine what he would say.
How do you feel about the changes and the fact that the show is ending?"

I feel like Reddit is my last hope, as they have been before. So I'll post word for word what I have elsewhere:

""I'm 17, 18 in September. For the past 6 months I've gone to countless fast food joints, retailers, car washes, etc and no one will take me. I even went on Monster.com and sent out hundreds of resumes, even to ones I know I'd never get (because who knows?). I feel so bad because my mom still has to buy me stuff and I feel like I should be helping out since she's a single mother that doesn't make all the money in the world. It makes me depressed and I want to help. Any suggestions?

A few more details:
-I've volunteered at libraries, cafeterias and carnivals.
-I've had no jobs prior besides the volunteering above.
-I am home schooled since 8th grade. Don't know how you'd take that.
-I'm not good at too much, so there's nothing I know of that would stand out of me.
-Out of all the job applications I've never gotten ONE phone call or interview. It makes me so depressed.

One last thing is that my mother and uncle work at the same company and are in VERY good standing there. Both there for 15+ years, barely missed a day of work, and I've met and talked to quite a few people who run things over there. I'm not sure if I'd be able to have any kind of opportunity there, even a internship or something. I would however have to be 18 so even if that was in the realm of possibility it'd be months. That's just me grasping at straws because I have no idea what else to do. I know there's people out there who search for YEARS and don't get anything that will say ""you haven't gone through half of the hardships we have to"" and all that. I realize that, but I just feel bad sitting around like a bump on a log while my mom goes to work and STILL pays for everything I do.""

Anyone have any tips, ideas, etc? The best advice I've gotten is to start my own dog walking/snow shoveling/etc. business which would be great, if I didn't live in a small community where that's already taken care of and there's no snow. I don't know what to do."

[This is it now](http://i.imgur.com/ozKoz4y.png)

My natural color is a dirty mousey blonde, a bit lighter than my eyebrows, but the same sort of tint. I hated it so I don't know if I want to go back to completely natural, bu I want a color that *looks* natural.

I'm wondering what color would suit me, I really have no idea if I want to go blonde, red, brown, etc. I'm very pale with freckles and pink undertones [as you can see](http://i.imgur.com/jviiXgK.png). What do you think??

I'm new to this subreddit, so please be nice =) I'm currently a college student applying to the internship at Riot, as a game designer. For part of my application, I'm working on an analysis on Atma's Impaler. Here's a possible solution I thought of and wanted the communities input on it. Any constructive criticism would be awesome!

So currently, Atma's is one of the least used items in the game, seeing a producation value of .66% in all of LoL. Many say that it's unviable because the stats on it can easily be bought off other, more viable options (such as completing another armor item or buying a bf sword). 

My idea was to make Atma's build from Madred's and be turned into a jungler specific item. the stats would look something like

* **+70 armor** (combining madred's and chain vest)

* **+unique : 2.0% maximum health to attack damage**

* **+madred's unique effects**

**Pros**:  

* rise in carry junglers/decline in support-like carry junglers

* in turn promote more aggressive play

* more build options for junglers

* viable late game option for Madred’s

* junglers would actually upgrade their Madred’s

* bring back Atmogs/Fratma’s Meta

* rise in production of Atma’s


**Cons**:

* if bruisers other than junglers start rushing this, potential Meta shift to fast map objectives
 	e.g. really fast barons, dragons and buff steals

* would need play testing for configuration to keep away from bruisers

 	i.e. increase cost, unique attribute related to smite, etc.	

 		such as making the Unique increase AD percentage by amount  of smites used

* potentially too much armor (might need a different formula instead of chain vest)

that's what I had in mind. what do you guys think? 

edit: for all those down voting, could you state why? I'm open to constructive criticism."

Just when things started to get better, I was just informed this morning that my hours have been cut in half and that the job position that I was guaranteed after my paid internship ended is no longer available because the company is broke at this time.

I've already submitted it, but was curious about how feasible/viable y'all thought the idea was.

Concept: Not many people use Klout on a regular basis. I wanted to make a Klout-oriented product that did provoke more constant usage. This is a business card application that allows you to receive/store virtual business cards, and share your own preset cards with others. Your Klout score could be influenced by who you network with in-person

Notes:
* Handshake shows you people around you with the app, who you can send cards to (after in-person networking). Otherwise, you can search if you want to send your card to someone not near you, or text/email if they don't have the app
* Tilting your device horizontally while on the pile shows you the business card you were highlighting full-screen. The drop down arrow shows you the bottom half.

I can answer any questions about my design decisions but really want some feedback from all of you. Thanks guys :)

I've used Dreamweaver to get these from our local folder and put them into our sites. I'm having difficulty grasping some of the concepts though; my questions are these:

- We are creating PHP pages from our ""dated"" ASP pages. What is the difference between these two and what are some other types of pages? Also, do these relate to other website endings (.com, .net, etc.). 

- I've made a few pages to add to the company's website (not from scratch, I've used other PHP pages as templates and just edited the text and image content). However, I still don't understand entirely what CSS is vs HTML and what alternatives there may be.

Any help would be awesome!"

(WARNING long but hopefully enjoyable read)",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/18e5fc/ladies_imagine_a_somewhat_nasty_breakup_9_months/,"Happy Squeaky Day!!!!
I have a plethora of words. It's never been a problem for me to think of things to say. Whether or not what comes out of my mouth or goes onto the paper should have been uttered at all, is another matter entirely. I'm learning to shutup. I'm sitting in Starbucks to write this. I hate Starbucks. I hate these people. They all go about their daily lives and they have no idea what's going on around them, nor do they care. ""Lemme get a Tall Vagina Latte for Karen!"" Comes the call that shakes me from my moment of self indulgent piteous reflection. I just want to get this over with. I want it to be over. I want this to be the last time your face flashes in my brain and sends butterflies of regret and loss scattering throughout my belly. I want today to be the last day I wake up thinking of you, and last night to be the final time I go to sleep trying to figure out what I could have done differently. I want to relegate you to my past on go on living for my future. I want what you so clearly have. But right now, at this moment, I want nothing more than for Karen to come get her goddamn Vagina Latte, cause I'm sitting right next to the pickup counter and this particular Barista is overly attached to the idea of fast service.

Even with my plethora of words, there is no combination I could string together which would turn back the hands of time. There is no sentence or turn of phrase that will make you forget just how neglectful I was of you. ""Sorry"" is a lovely word, and when paired with true intent, it can be a wonderous thing, but it does not make up for how I acted and it lacks the ability to swallow words that have already gone out to the ether. I think you know I am, so there's no use in saying it here. Tomorrow Laura will come and pick up your painting and some other shit I've been holding on to with the intention of forcing you to see me down the line, after that you will have absolutely no reason to contact me, I guess I'm scared that's what will happen. I have no idea why, as it's what I deserve and for a long time wanted.

I've been in a dark place that has nothing to do with you, and I'm finally coming out of it. When you left I had to take stock in my life, and when taken, what I saw scared me. Here I am at 32 going on 33, just having broken up with a girl who at the time I was glad to see go, but who I always knew deep down was singular in all aspects. A real diamond in the rough. That being said, to not let you go was not an option. How could I? When you were so close to something you always wanted, a chance to travel and to live abroad, a chance to pursue a dream and possibly end up in the exact career you've always wanted. What kind of person would I be, how could I even pretend to love you while at the same time refusing to let you go? This speaks nothing of my inward and outward neglect of you and our relationship, which I'm finally coming to realize was a result of more than one factor, but all of my own doing. The obviousness in hindsight that I had wasted the past year and a half of my life, if not the previous 33 years, on my own, and now had no one to point the finger at. All along the finger should have always been pointed squarely at me, but I was too weak and too scared to acknowledge it. You didn't make me stay in LA, you made me want to, but the choice was mine and I chose it and I would again a thousand times over. You didn't make me keep doing Locations (in fact, on more than one occasion you begged me to quit), but it was a convenient out to say I had to keep doing it to support ""Us"" and infinitely shitty of me to silently resent you for following the dreams I insisted you pursue and fully expected to pay for. You didn't make me smoke weed and play video games nonstop, those were all escapes I invented to avoid looking at the cold hard truth. ""I am unhappy, and nothing I've done to this point in my life suggests that I have the will or the means to change that fact. This is my life now and this is my life forever, I have no one but myself to blame. I am worthless,"" echoed in my head over and over again, every minute of every day, week after week, month after month. With the constant cacophony of negative thoughts and the reality of my situation fully revealed, I'm not too proud to admit, I lost something over those months. I wrongly thought it was you. I now know it was the part of me holding me back.

So I begged and I pleaded, I told you I would change, I told you things would be different. It was a lie. Oh I believed things would be different. I believed if I could only get you to show concern, if I could only get you to care about my plight, that would prove you still loved me, you still cared, but you weren't the problem, I was. If you had done what I so desparately wished, nothing would have changed, cause I would have been the same. Scared of failure, scared of going out on a limb and because of that fear doomed to live in the very situation I never wanted. Besides, and this is the best part, where the fuck do I get off asking you (now my ex) to give me the exact same considerations which I so miserably failed to provide you when you needed them most? Then, to top it all off, I began insisting you return the one thing I provided infallibly (as meager as it may have been) just because I was going through a hard time? Indian givers are the worst with a special place in Hell reserved just for them, and I'm embarrassed to have even gone down that road. I'm shaking my head now, and Karen finally having gotten her Vagina Latte is giving me a strange look as I do so. I can only imagine she's bewildered by the expression on my face. It's a mixture of regret and shame, and it's making my coffee just a tad more bitter. Keep all that I gave you Squeaky, it was given with love and respect, which I also gave and give to you ad infinitum. Should you return it, I hope you will do so in the same spirit, but I will not accept anything but the gesture.
Just a couple more paragraphs, then you will be done reading this and hopefully aware of why I did what I did when I did it. I don't expect you to respond or frankly to care, nor do I necessarily need or want you to. This letter is an attempt to give you and therefore me, some solace about the situation. It is the last and least of all my selfish gestures. To relieve you of culpability. To make me less of an enemy and repaint memories of me in a kinder light if only in my own head, so that I can forgive myself for failing me and by association you. I don't know if it will work, only time will tell, but just getting these things on paper and knowing they'll reach you someday, will hopefully allow me to move on and forgive myself for mistakes I've made but no longer have the right to correct. 

When Joey was little, I'd say about 9-10, he somehow got a copy of The Amazing Spiderman #1. This comic book is worth nearly $25k, but obviously it wasn't worth that back then (sometime in the 70's). To 9 year old Joey, this was just another comic book, to enjoy, to read, to leave on the side of his bed where it dropped from his hands the moment he fell asleep. Essentially, though a great comic book, and in retrospect the first edition of one of the most famous characters in Nerd History, this was just as normal as any Archie or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trash that he got on any other day, and 9 year old Joey treated it as such. Talk to him about it now and you can see him mentally beating the ever loving shit out of his 9 year old self for his lack of foresight, cause 9 year old Joey traded that comic book away once he was done reading it. To him, it was just another comic, because he didn't know what he had till it was gone. If through some trick of Science Fiction present Joey could go back and talk to 9 year old Joey, he would relate to his younger self an appreciation of what he had, to cherish the unique gifts life sometimes presents, and to adore them for what they are. I'm also sure that 9 year old Joey, even armed with that information, would probably treat the comic just as cavalierly. You see 9 year olds lack perspective and describing to them the concept of rarity and accrued value is probably no easy task. To say nothing of the implications to the space time continuum (imagine my nerdy voice here) when one goes back to change even the most insignificant moments in human history. But should he somehow be returned to his specific issue of that comic in the now, he would definitely treat it with the ador and intimacy it deserves, if for no other reason than second chances are rare and he would feel happily obligated to make up for his past neglect. I think the metaphor here is pretty clear, but I do want to put in the disclaimer that I don't expect to get a second chance with you no more than Joey can expect to be walking through a comic shop and happen upon that very same issue of Spiderman. I will get another chance at something special, but our moment has passed. Also just as Joey lost his comic book for a reason, what happened with us was inevitable as our lives were going in different directions and these trajectories were impossible to stop without even more heartache. You needed to find your feet as well as your place in the world, and being with me wasn't allowing you to do that. The joy I felt in having you was masking my dissatisfaction with how my life had turned out to that point and you unknowingly provided the exact kick in the pants necessary to motivate me for change.

The comic book analogy is one of perspective. I want to illustrate to you that I know I was wrong, I know that there were problems and those problems were caused mainly by my dissatisfaction with my own life, but never with you. You were a convenient scapegoat, as others had been before you, but because of you will be avoided in the future. A part of me always realized how special you are, and the weaker part of me allowed the rest of me to be blind to that fact. As illustration of me knowing my mistakes as well as a display of just how much I've thought and been tortured by them, I will list them for you here:

1) I should have gotten you more than a discounted phone for that first Christmas. You never wanted my money, you only wanted tangible displays of my affection and love for you. You would have been more happy with a rock, if it had the right sentiment behind it.

2) I should have made every birthday special. It's your day and you are special. It wasn't and isn't too much to ask that I take one day out of a year to really show you through action and deed that I recognize I am very lucky to have you in my life.

3) I should have taken you places and shown you things. You so desparately wanted that. I was afraid. In the moments of my past where I have been the sole bread winner, I had been taken advantage of. You never did that, but that doesn't mean I was stupidly afraid you would. Not an excuse just a lame, weak reason.

4) I should have quit smoking pot. I have no other excuse other than I am weak, at the very least weaker than you and I was afraid without the weed, life would be boring. Fear should never be a motivation for anything aside from escape from imminent danger. 

5) I should have brought you to NOLA to intern at Tulane at the very least to be close to you. I didn't want that at the time though and I sincerely think it's because I was distancing myself from you because I knew you'd get into Bristol and if you did you would go there. I didn't think you or I could handle that unless I could maintain detachment. Man was I stupid. But now you're happy, so I guess in the end my reasoning was sound.

6) I should have shown you how much I love you every chance I got, but I didn't want to and it was because I was stupid, scared and stupid. I have no other reason.

7) Valentine's Day. Simple. What was important to you, should have become important to me no matter my personal feelings on the stupidity of the holiday.

8) I shouldn't have begged to get you back when I was the one who pushed you so far away. Stupid. Along with that I should have stood by my position that anything I said was yours was yours, and I should never have tried to get it back, no matter what my situation. In reality though it would be of huge help to me, I was doing it only to get a sign that you cared, and it was clear that wasn't going to happen, because I had done nothing to earn your concern.

9) I should have supported you, period. For no other reason than I said I would, and I love you. I instead resented you for what I thought was taking advantage of me because I felt somewhere inside I didn't deserve you.

10) I should have listened .... more .... constantly .... with all that I had. I should have listened.
There's more, and I could and would spend all day going over them in my mind and trying to put them down on paper, but I doubt you'd want to read them (I think I could go up to about 30, I was a pretty neglectful douchebag), so I will spare you all of it. I mention these cause they are the ones that are on my mind currently, but a whole slew of them are constantly swirling around in there. Mistakes, I should mention, that I've learned from and would never make again with whomever would give me the honor of putting me in a position to make them. Lessons that I never would have learned if I never met you, if we'd never been together.

Getting close to the end here. This must seem like an epic letter, it may bring up some emotions, but I doubt many on your end (maybe I'm wrong). I don't mean for the letter to be epic. I'm better now. I'm coming out of a pretty deep and dark depression caused by the many realizations I've had since you left. I have a girlfriend who is awesome, kind, caring, and lovely. I'm volunteering at a Neuroscience Lab at UCLA. I'm working Locations but able to still concentrate on aspects of my life I want to change. I'm applying to Journalism Grad Programs for the Fall of 2014, to pursue my perfect career (Science Journalism, I'm sooooo psyched), the working is so that I'm able to pay for it without taking too many loans. I'm taking sailing and/or flying lessons (starting next week) and I'm finally cognizant of why, for most of my 33 years, I've had a constant undertone of sadness I tried to mask with pot induced distractions and reliance on others. Even with, or in spite of, all these changes, there is something missing, and I guess this letter and returning your stuff is my final attempt to fill in that void, or at the very least do right by you in the end. I want, not need, not demand, just plain want you in my life. In whatever capacity you are able to muster or feel motivated to pursue. I've let go of so many things only to regret the loss later, I'm not ready to let go of you entirely just yet, and I'm hoping you can find it in your heart to accept my ammends and honestly try to stay in touch. That being said, in the end, all I really want is for you to be happy with or without my involvement, and more importantly for me to find that happiness myself. The shortcut to some happiness would be for you to write back and tell me how things are going with you, in whatever depth and fashion you feel is appropriate. Doing so will allow me to forgive myself finally for the mistakes I made, and would be a clear indication that at the very least you value my presence in your life and I haven't ruined whatever value you may have perceived in maintaining a relationship with me. You have my address, you know my email and you will always have my number. I know I've done very little to deserve even this, and am already ok with the idea that I'll never hear from you again, but I'm hoping that won't be the case and wanted to display clearly and openly that I'm here Squeaky now and always without condition. That I will live the rest of my days (ugh so lame and drama filled, but the truth) thinking fondly of you and silently wishing you get all the things your little heart desires. And hoping, every once in a while that I'll get to hear of your successes, and that in spite of it all, you'd like to hear about mine.

 Today is Valentine's Day, which you know I don't care about. Thankfully, Lauren (my new special lady) doesn't care about it either. I was lucky enough to find a girl who shares my particular alternate views on the subject. So with reverence to you and respect to your constanstly ignored wish for me to make it important, I am rebranding Valentine's Day in my own head. For me, from this point forward, it will no longer be a day where I'm forced to buy candy and flowers for whichever girl, present or future, is lucky enough to call me theirs. It is Squeaky's Day, and on this day for the remainder of your days here on Earth keep your eye out, I've missed two already and I don't plan on missing another. Squeaky's Day is so much better than Vantine's cause it's dedicated to you, the truest love I've known and lost to date and I'm determined to never forget that.

I hope this was well received and please take every word for Gospel. I don't expect or demand you respond in any way. I don't expect anything from you except that you live your life and be happy. Like I said I would love to hear from you, when and if you are ready and I would be immeasurably happy just to hear your voice or read your words no matter what they said.

Love in whatever capacity you can accept, now and always,
EDIT: Removed my name

PS Behind the ghoulish cyclists find the red string, pull the string and you will find the first Squeaky's Day tithe. It's nothing huge, and I only ask that you retrieve it on your own, if and when you get back. Just a small surprise to show I'm here. No drama, no expectations just a trinket and a trifle for my one and only Squeaky on the day I have now made for her."
18e5aj,9,2013-02-12,I'd love some feedback on a redesign! Be ruthless.,eminemfunpack,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/18e5aj/id_love_some_feedback_on_a_redesign_be_ruthless/,"Hey, so I worked on this potential Klout pivot/redesign for an internship application I was working on recently. I've already submitted it, but was curious about how feasible/viable y'all thought the idea was.

Concept: Not many people use Klout on a regular basis. I wanted to make a Klout-oriented product that did provoke more constant usage. This is a business card application that allows you to receive/store virtual business cards, and share your own preset cards with others. Your Klout score could be influenced by who you network with in-person

Notes:
* Handshake shows you people around you with the app, who you can send cards to (after in-person networking). Otherwise, you can search if you want to send your card to someone not near you, or text/email if they don't have the app
* Tilting your device horizontally while on the pile shows you the business card you were highlighting full-screen. The drop down arrow shows you the bottom half.

I can answer any questions about my design decisions but really want some feedback from all of you. Thanks guys :)

Here it is: **[Klout Redesign](http://virajbindradesign.com/klout)**"
18dz0y,1,2013-02-12,"Struggling to engage with or get any enjoyment out of life, failing university, feel like I need a break",gourangamanga,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18dz0y/struggling_to_engage_with_or_get_any_enjoyment/,"So despite not having anything particularly substantial to feel bad about, I pretty much feel horrible all the time right now, and think about suicide daily (though I think I'm a long way from actually doing it). I haven't attended university in nearly four months, I've missed all my deadlines and exams and I'm in my final year where everything really matters. 
 
I'm seeing a doctor on Thursday and expect to be diagnosed with depression. I've also started seeing a councillor, though I'm not sure if it's really helping at all. I hope that I will be able to get extenuating circumstances, which will allow me to either sit my missed exams and assignments in August, or else repeat them next year.
 
If I repeat the year, I'll have to spend another year at university, which will cost me - but I'm fairly sure I can actually afford it. Given a full year, provided I can get and stay healthy, I can hopefully get a good degree and be an employable graduate. Alternatively, I could repeat the year, make all the same mistakes again, be in this exact same situation this time next year, but a few grand down. 
 
If I don't repeat the year, I'll have to start studying again, and work hard to catch up. I haven't really done any work in a long time and right now I don't feel remotely capable of doing it. Just thinking about it fills me with an overwhelming sense of dread, despair, regret and self-loathing. Having said that, probably the best outcome would be to do this. I think that if I started working hard tomorrow and kept it up, finishing the work I missed over summer, I could probably graduate with a half-decent degree. But right now that feels impossible, I wish it were as simple as flicking a switch.
 
This makes me more inclined to accept that I'm not well right now, and focus on getting myself better and also figuring out how to stay well (depression's been a recurring theme in my life), before trying to take on anything difficult like getting a degree. 
 
However, a part of me thinks that this idea of taking a break is just a way of putting off work because I'd rather not have to do it right now, and the only thing that will change if I take a year out is that I'll be that much older and poorer. Furthermore, I already have a job lined up with a company I did an internship with, so I'd have to explain to them why I'm not graduating this year and possibly lose the job opportunity, but that's hardly the end of the world.

So yeah, I guess my plan at the moment is to see what my doctor suggests, talk to my university tutor about possibly postponing my studies, and then find something to do to get myself into a good frame of mind again.

Well, thanks for reading, I guess. Any advice?"

18dnto,4,2013-02-12,Need advice as a current doctoral student in ChE,needsChEadvice,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/18dnto/need_advice_as_a_current_doctoral_student_in_che/,"I hate to make a small question so long, but I have to give some background about my situation, and I'm looking for advice regarding a long-standing question that I've been asking myself and others.

I'm a current PhD candidate at a top 20 school [in the US] in Chemical Engineering and I'll graduate in n years, where n&lt;=3 yr.

My issue is the following: my research is entirely computational. I do molecular dynamics simulations.  I don't and will not be able to obtain any graduate experimental experience (I've tried).  I do however have undergrad experimental experience and internships.

I'm curious about the employment options I'll have when I graduate. Many companies do not do molecular dynamics simulations, and I don't even think I want to do that for my entire life.  Ideally I'd like some balance between simulations and experiments.

I've been asking the question of employment possibilities for some time now, and I seem to be getting two types of answers.  The first answer says that it doesn't matter that I don't have any experience on SEM, TEM, AFM, [insert-abbreviation-here] --- that companies are looking for PhDs because of their thought process and problem solving abilities, and that they will train you on whatever you end up doing.  In addition, this answers says that most PhDs in companies do not actually work in the lab themselves but rather run a small group of scientists (and this I totally agree with, I've experienced this in my undergrad days during internships).

The second answer advises me to get my hands on any experimental projects that I can get (although I am unable to get any).  It warns me that I'll have a very difficult time obtaining a job in the future with a purely computational background. 

I just don't want to end up in a situation where I graduate and can't find a job because what I did in my PhD is not very often used in industry.

I've also played around with the idea of doing an experimental post-doc, but here again, I ask myself, what professor would pay to hire me as their post-doc when I don't have any graduate experimental experience?  In addition, if I do end up miraculously finding an experimental post-doc position, would that put me in the academic track, and close the door to industry?

What has your experience been with the hiring process for PhDs?  Are companies looking for specific skills (such as expert on [abbreviation-here]), or do they hire PhDs for the thought process?  Is there anything I should absolutely do now before graduating?

I look forward to any advice you can give, and I apologize this is so long! Thanks!"

We're both in graduate school at the same university and met on our first day.  We quickly became close friends and then began dating.  We moved in together after around 3 months of dating.  
I never thought someone like him would or could have existed in this world.  He made me laugh and think more than anyone I had met.  He was my best friend.  Lately, since we've begun working on our theses, things have gotten a bit tense between us.  We are both extremely stressed out with internships, classes, and our own research.  We made it a point to spend quality time together at least once a week with an extra special date once a month.  Those ideas haven't worked...

A few nights ago I got home after hanging out with some friends.  I told him I was upset that he decided to stay home and play video games instead of spending time with me.  He flipped out on me.  Things escalated and he grabbed me by both of my arms and shoved me across the room.  He left the house and I followed - wanting to get some insight into his mindset.  This was a terrible idea.  The fight escalated even more and he grabbed me by the arms again.  I have bruises now.  

This afternoon, he tells me that he's going to have drinks with a female friend of his on Thursday.  I've never met this girl and she was open about wanting to start something romantic with my SO a while back.  It didn't bother me until I remembered that Thursday was Valentine's Day.  I don't expect anything special for Valentine's Day, but I also didn't expect him to make plans to have drinks with this girl... So, I got a bit upset.  Things escalated again and he left the house.  I followed after, told him I was upset, then went to the gym.  
He texted me to let me know that he thought we were over - that he thought that my emotions were too much for him.  I'm currently sleeping at a friend's house.  

This feels awful, Reddit.  Tell me what to do/think/feel.  

TL;DR
Live-in boyfriend and I fought, been escalating lately.  I'm not doing so well with the idea of breaking up.  "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Does anyone pre-record their performances at the Grammys?  Or perhaps enhance the performance with recordings or electronic aids?  Is it a big deal among musicians to do so?  Are there famous artists who get nervous about a live performance before people who may not be fans?  On the other hand, are there artists who just thrive on performing live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csu9o?context=5)|Yes, but I can't name names.  We never do on principal.  I can say at country awards shows it's usually about 2/3rds pre-tracked except for lead vocals.  It's much less in the rock world.  I've heard only 3 bands are using tracks tonight.
 |Last time we had a show with usher he had tons of laptops running.  3 keyboard players onstage and not even one of them even bothered to mime playing that 2 note intro.
 |Electronic aids is pretty vague.  There are plenty of drum machines playing click tracks in our ears...ear monitors could be considered electronic aid.
 |There's definitely a machismo to playing live as opposed to doing the milli-vanilli.  But pre-recording means you get paid twice...for the performance and the recording, so they kinda win that way.
 |Dave matthews came offstage at an award show and his response when we complimented him was (approximate quote) ""I almost shat my pants I was so scared"".  We thought somebody with his experience still being that moved by it was awesome.
 |Miranda is definitely one who thrives on the performance.  sometimes you have to reassure the producers that it will pick up for the real show.  I feel that for sure.  The stakes get high and I get lost in the fun of the moment.  I liken it to mountain biking.  It forces you to be as focused on the moment as you are capable of.  Seeing Pink doing pushups and jumping around like a badass just before she hit the stage at iHeartRadio was awesome to see.  However you feel about a star's music sometimes you can't deny the energy and entertainment they provide live.
[""I almost shat my pants I was so scared""  He scares easily. I heard he got scared crossing the Chicago river a few years back.  It landed on a boat full of tourists passing under neath.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cvqz3?context=5)|We often get lectured on being careful because we represent Miranda's name...but it truly is funny how much people exaggerate when celebrities have messups.  I have a little inside info on that one:  The driver for one of the crew busses, probably full of technicians that never even interact with dave, decided to dump his toilet illegally...it smells awful when they get full and sometimes the drivers are too lazy to find a truck stop to empty the shitter properly.  Years ago I stepped in a stream of pee from Miranda's bus when her driver dumped on the desert roadside right when I was walking up barefoot to check on another crew member...pee mud, ugh.  I boiled my foot.  Anyways, going over a river on a grated bridge seems like a sneaky place to dump without getting caught.  But the decision had nothing to do with Dave himself...I'm sure he was asleep on another bus miles in front or on a jet.  And I'm sure that driver was a good man who got fired over a careless decision.  Still, it makes fun enough headline that people latch on to and don't care about details.
[Just a wee bit of proof is all we ask, and then I promise the questions will come flooding in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs6u4?context=5)|Everything I've heard about Frank Ocean paints him as one of the nicest people on the planet.  His dressing room isn't far from ours, maybe I'll try for a fiver.  Last time I saw the bieb's he was flanked by 4 bodyguards who tensed up when we said hi.  It's fun being an unknown backstage because the celebrities always say hi back in case you might be somebody they should know.
[Preemptively, will you please kick Justin Bieber in the balls for me? Oh and give Frank Ocean a high-five.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs6u4?context=5)|Edited for proof.
[Who are you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|Chris Kline.
[What are you performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|I don't think I'm allowed to reveal the song but it's a Miranda Lambert hit.
[What's your opinion on the nominations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|I don't really follow award shows, but I heard some people grumbling about album of the year snubs.
[What's your opinion on the current state of music and the music industry? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|It seems like rock is going through an 80's sounding phase but with more modern and tasteful production.  Keyboards are suddenly cool again.  #1 songs may not have an acoustic instrument but they are far from say AHA.  I don't really follow pop though.
[Vertexguy?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8e1fxj?context=5)|Nope...I think of him as the ""more famous musician/programmer named Chris Kline"". I had never heard of him till I won bioshock years ago... imagine my surprise when his/my name came up in the credits!
 |It didn't take much time on YouTube to see he knows his way around a guitar neck more than I do! 
[Being a country fan I was pissed Chief wasn't even nominated...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d716t?context=5)|It was released summer of 2011!  It wasn't eligible for anything ""of the year 2012""...
[Ooooh I love Miranda Lambert! Saw her in concert once, wonder if you were there too… She is awesome live!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d3yo2?context=5)|I you saw her in the last 7 years, then yes, I was probably there!
[How do you feel about the current state of country and western? Has becoming more mainstream been good or bad for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ct120?context=5)|It seems to be going through a hair-metalish phase.  A lotta drop D loaded with distortion.  Country is more rock than it's ever been.  It's growing in popularity and I think that's a good thing.  Good music will always be made, what sells or gets radio play in a given year is not directly related.  I'm a fan of more songwriterish stuff.
[Sounds like my kinda music. I gotta listen to you more often. You're the Chris Kline of ""The Bionic Jam"", right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cszn8?context=5)|No, the Chris Kline of Bioshock fame is not me but I've been meaning to invite him out to a show.  I've seen him on youtube and he is a shredding guitar player.  As a CS major/musician he gives me a nerd boner.  Also I loved bioshock.
 |He's definitely the most famous Chris Kline unless you count Chris Klein of American Pie fame (I've gotten so many funny emails meant for him).  But there are literally hundreds of us on facebook last I checked.
[Maybe you two could start a band and really confused a whole bunch of people :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8e3ukh?context=5)|It's one of those John Smith kind of names... hundreds on Facebook.  There's another Chris Kline I know of who is a drummer.  We grew up in the same city, went to the same college, have the same middle initial... We easily spent 2 decades in the same city and somehow never met.  But I thought it would be cool to track down all the CK musicians and make an album.   Of course, people would just think it's a Hunter Hayes kind of thing.
[If country is getting more metal, then pop is getting more folk. Funny how that goes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cwb4m?context=5)|I just saw this comment ...that's a great way to simplify it!
[Have a good time at the Grammys, and let us know if you see anything gossip-worthy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cwb4m?context=5)|I saw plenty of funny things happen and I love to tell stories, but as a high-school nerd the word ""gossip"" makes me think of degrading somebody for entertainment and I'm really not into that.  As far as fun little details involving celebs: Kelly Clarkson was still going on about getting stuck on Miranda when she made her way back to the dressing rooms just after her grammy.  Miranda later said Kelly was not the first or last person to get stuck on her dress...it was an accident waiting to happen with every hug and many a faux diamond was lost.
[Hey, to be fair, Google's Suggest feature suggests your name as first result, and that's generally a good indication of fame.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d4lw9?context=5)|[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/rnELRxF)
 |Hmm, maybe if I insist on the spelling...and I think that re-ordering is recent, but i'll take it as a good thing! 
[I swear, it wasn't doing that four days ago!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8fmf3a?context=5)|It's all about incognito mode if you want unbiased results, and it still might use your IP region.  The kind of tailor made results and advertising that goes on with your average google search is a little creepy.
[How does it feel? Is it your biggest gig yet? How is the dynamics in the band during the show? Any room for improvisation - not so much melody/chords I would imagine but perhaps phrasing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csg2o?context=5)|We did the grammy's a couple of years ago so not crazy jitters...but we were a little shaky at rehearsals so there is a little danger factor.
 |No...playing a sold out wrigley field with paisley felt bigger/more significant.
 |We are combining 2 bands for a medley,,,lots of musicians onstage who haven't jammed together much playing through quickly built ear mixes.. it's a bit like walking a tightrope together but we try to relax and remember to have fun.
 |I'm playing B3 on a song with no B3 so im completely improvising...I've been changing up some inversions on the fly...just feeling it out.  I'm not the sort of musician who knows exactly what I'm going to play but there's not too much wiggle room when just padding some big chords.
[Will your grammy watch the grammys in her pajammies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs701?context=5)|That is entirely likely.
[Can you punch Chris Brown in the nuts for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d2827?context=5)|That would be very cathartic for the sane people in America.
[Who are you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs33q?context=5)|A musician.  A redditor.  Chris Kline.  You've never heard of me.
[Can you take a picture of Katy Perry's boobs while you're there? We have vast amounts of Karma to share and no one to give it too. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d1g3z?context=5)|Dat dress...  i hope it's not too sexist to recount my most special 53rd grammy rehearsal experience.  We sat out in the empty audience seats while the rest of the bands rehearsed.  Katy Perry had a bubble machine going during the rehearsals which put out smoke filled bubbles everywhere.  They looked really cool, caught the light, and made little smoke poofs when they popped.  But they popped a lot and the dancers started slipping on the pools of soap.  After the song she announced into the mic that it was too slippery and they couldn't dance with the floor that way.  As she demonstrated to the producer how the bubbles made them slip she lost her balance for real... and to catch herself she had to double over in a full forward fold with her ass to the audience.  She was wearing a very short skirt and very thin underwear.  I'll be in my bunk.
[Is Blake Shelton really that awesome??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ct32c?context=5)|He is effortlessly funny.  It's not just for the camera.  He could easily be a comedian for a living in an alternate universe where he didn't play country.  He's a kind soul as well...Its that certain honesty that goes hand in hand with being a comedian.  If he has a bad side I haven't seen it.
[Congrats on the TV gig. How different is it to play a TV gig versus a live show? Is it different playing in front of other professional musicians? Will you be watching the show when you're not playing (and if so, do you have your ""I'm so glad so-and-so bad musician won and I'm on TV"" face practiced?\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csznl?context=5)|Staring at seated celebrities instead of wild fans is way different...and occasionally a camera gets in your face and you have to pretend its not messing with you.  I intentionally don't wear my contacts so I don't space out looking at say Elton John or Jack White.
 |We will be backstage gherming after we play.  We stand by the stage exit and say hi to the celebs as they pass...it's tons of fun.
[I love the fact that you said gherming here... Fellow musician with a lot of Nashville background in my family. Didn't realize how significant this word was until I started spending more time in Nashville. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8de40q?context=5)|I think the word extends to the film world as well...but I had never heard it until I started working around famous people.
[Do you see celebs gawking at mega-stars? I don't care if I'm King of the Universe, I'm gonna gawk at Aretha... :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cw9gz?context=5)|Of course!  I think most stars don't think of themselves as stars unless they buy into the ego trip.  And as much as people love shitting on celebs, the majority of them get to where they are by having an amazing talent.  At awards shows stars bump into each other in the hall constantly and as they are walking away you will hear them saying stuff like ""OMG that was amazing"".  It's kind of a mutual admiration society (older than facebook)... and I think that's half the purpose of putting all the dressing rooms in close proximity.   Miranda loves Beyonce and was giddy to talk to her.  Dierks looked like Mcauley Caulkin saying ""yes"" to himself after talking to Steve Martin at the ACM's, it was sweet to see.  Dave Grohl seemed excited to talk to everybody, but I think he's just the human equivalent of a happy puppy.
[I would space out immediatley after seeing Jack White in the flesh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cxe6g?context=5)|As a band we pretty much did that.  Nobody came up with anything relevant to say besides ""we loved your performance"" so the awkward small-talk came to an end with him walking away saying ""see you around Nashville"".
 |In retrospect some good ice-breakers would have been ""We are guys from the rock world playing in the Nashville scene...we love what you're doing there...You'd be welcome to jam with us anytime (you never know).""...but no, instead we hosted our own little Chris Farley show.
[Can you say hi to Reddit when you're on camera? Something so we know you're acknowledging us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csvtn?context=5)|I doubt I'll get any camera time...and there's no way for me to know if they do have me in a shot.  I wore a reddit pin for many of the country award shows we've done but they are psycho abour not allowing logo's onstage at the grammy's.
[Have you ever sang a Miranda song at a karaoke bar?  May I recommend you get drunk and try it sometime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cuu1s?context=5)|Oh jeez, yes a few times.  Never sober.  Everybody thinks they are clever signing me up for a miranda karaoke song.  The thing is I sing all her songs for soundcheck every day so I'm very experienced with performing them.  But this one time I was in hell when Blake's sister secretly voluteered me to take over for the pianist at a crowded piano bar and play Kerosene.  This was downtown little rock after a concert so it was packed with fans.  I had never actually played the song on anything but harmonica and I was unsure of the chords or how it could even be done with a piano.  I mouthed to Miranda ""help me"" but it was too late to let the bar down.  The bar crowd ended up being so noisy that nobody minded me searching for a few chords and lines...but I still catch flack from Blake's sister for not knowing all the words.  We ended up getting escorted from the bar to the busses later by a team of 4 mounted police.
[I really appreciate the way you elaborate on your answers and tell good stories.  Storytellers like you make for really interesting AMAs even when I'm not familiar with the subject to begin with.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cv9ke?context=5)|Cool, I figured it would be fun and I'm glad you are enjoying it.  I get so much out of this website so it's great being able to contribute.
[Do you have a solo career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csr28?context=5)|Sort of.  I post my new songs to [chriskline.com/mp3](http://chriskline.com/mp3) when I finish them... But I got this gig after I was finally crushed enough by the harsh reality that is the music industry...and started looking for work as a side-man.  I've been kicking around getting involved in the Nashville songwriting scene but I'm mostly a rock guy and the one point everybody makes about country these days is it doesn't need more people trying to dress up rock songs as country songs.
[Do you mind telling what is the harsh reality that is the music industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dabyd?context=5)|Nobody cares about the art you nurture and birth to the world.  Also, nobody will tell you if your art simply isn't original or passionate enough to be interesting... You just get ignored until you can bring warm bodies into clubs or sell records.  Then everybody wants a piece whether it's good or not. Also, it takes money to make money... The day of the starving artist getting discovered is over. 
[What about Carrie Underwood? nobody to huge star in a few years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dc98m?context=5)|Does she write songs?  I'm not saying you can't be a great performer and achieve fame.  She has a voice and show that can sell tickets and albums and so a big label invested in her. 
[Miranda lambert played saxophone in high school.  Why didn't any hot girls play saxophone at my high school?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cuykg?context=5)|I do think girls should find more things like band instruments or science fun, but american culture just doesn't reward these sorts of activities right now...it's all about popularity and fun.  Don't get me started.  But the cool nerd does seem to be making a comeback lately.
[Link to soundcloud.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d5mjs?context=5)|Holy shizzle-fries! That is hilarious and disturbing to hear something I wrote with the voice inside my head spoken in your voice...a professionally smooth voice I might add.
[Can you get me a job with Miranda's crew? I'm really fun to hang out with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cxgat?context=5)|""The hang"" is so important.  And we had so many revolving crew positions when we were a Texas based band... hiring friends and friends of friends to tune the guitars and such...but somewhere between 2008 &amp; 2010 it got so big that we hired mostly nashville professional technicians, which is a professional pool that just isnt as big in texas.  To put it another way, we outgrew the supply of TX touring professionals.   Now we are such a well oiled organization that suggesting a friend for a position would just be laughed off if that friend hasn't already proven themselves in the hellfire that is the touring industry.  There were too many people at the shows to just stop things and say ""sorry, the guitar tech put the capo on the wrong fret"", as happened from time to time in our clubbier days.  People expect a bigger, tighter production once thousands start showing up for the show.
 |It's important to note that the texas region is big enough that it has its own country market that is often at odds with ""nashville country"".  Bigger Texas bands never have to stray far from Texas to make enough money to support themselves.  But if you want to play arenas you have to make it to a national market and Texas alone can't provide that...it's a hard or impossible transition for many southern country/rock bands.  Once you become a nationally famous band the Texas markets might reject you for not being Texas enough.  These are very vague generalizations but my point is that the nashville vs. texas tension is quantifiable.
[Is that a no then? : ( PS Miranda and Dierks did awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d8y1m?context=5)|TL;DR: No.  (Management specifically announced a ""no more hiring friends"" rule years ago)
 |I'm glad you enjoyed the mashup!
[Thanks for doing this AMA. How did you land the job as a musician? Are you a 'studio musician'? What does your job require of you (hours put in, how much creativity, etc\)? What other artists have you worked for? How different is working for a a singer as opposed to being in a band? what education do you have for music/keyboards? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cv1h8?context=5)|No prob...just sitting here otherwise.
 |It's all who you know basically...networking, networking, networking.  Having enough talent only puts you on the field, not in the game.
 |I record my own songs for fun and have the occasional session, but my touring (and insecurity about my skills) keeps me from any regular studio work.  Also, producers in Nashville generally have sets of musicians they prefer working with.
 |Before I moved to nashville, which is geographically convenient, I was gone more days than I was home.  We worked it out to 191 days on the road in 2009.  Now it's mostly Wednesday evening through Sunday morning and back home.  On a normal day I roll out of bed, sing a few songs for soundcheck, work out or work on songs, pretty myself up, then rock out for 90 minutes...and usually have some fun after the show until we roll to the next city in the wee hours.
 |I haven't worked with anybody as big as Miranda except in Miranda-related events.. I got to back up Fogerty when he joined us onstage.  I got to trade vocals with Carrie Underwood while standing in for ML at a rehearsal.  I got to jam with Charlie Daniels once and he tossed me a solo.  Paul Shaffer wanted me to do a solo on Honky Tonk Woman at a Letterman commercial break...but I didn't see his gesture...when he told me later all I could say was ""wow"" and froze up like a giddy little girl.  We have Blake join us every now and then.  Dierks, Paisley, Urban, whomever Miranda happens to be jamming a song with on a given night.  I almost forgot:  I played keys on Will Hoge's latest single [""Song Nobody Will Hear""](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/another-song-nobody-will-hear/id590963757)
 |She treats us like family.  We are a band and we love being that way.  She's said we should get our own name, but we never play as a group without her.  I'm still the new guy after more than 6 years.  She likes us being able to roll with situations on the fly and not clam up when shit goes wrong.  Bands that don't really know each other are more susceptible to train wrecks without that trust.  We've finished out playing unplanned songs, the wrong song we started but played anyways, capo's being in the wrong place so we transpose on the fly, jamming until the microphone can be fixed, or when she wants to talk...that sort of stuff.
 |I had piano lessons as a kid and a teenager but I didn't really fall in love with music until I could learn songs I loved on guitar.  I had the odd guitar lesson here and there but nothing consistant.  University of Texas' music program was very old school: Jazz or Classical only.  But I took studio engineering classes at Austin Community College in the 90's.  I ran a music studio and played with local bands for next to nothing for years until I got this gig.
[What is your favorite Miranda song to perform live? Favorite song of hers that you don't perform in concert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ctmnq?context=5)|In the current set Over You is my favorite because I get to play a prominant guitar part, sing a big harmony, and swell an organ note in and out with my feet.
 |I absolutely love Fine Tune but we never play it because the crowd gives us blank stares.  It's not very country.  I miss Crazy Ex Girlfriend too because the B3 part is wacky but she's been tired of that one for a while.
[How emotional does Over You get? I imagine it's worse for her husband than her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d2mxq?context=5)|She gets choked up and lets the crowd sing sometimes.  It's about the same with House That Built Me...she didn't write it but she's internalized it.  As far as Blake, that's not something I know or would ask about...but I can say he has been side of stage at plenty of shows when she sang it and spoke about it's significance beforehand.
[Is Aden going to rock a mohawk tonight? Tell Miranda to come back to Montana soon!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csubf?context=5)|Aden cut off the mohawk a year ago.  It was a great visual (and networking tool) but after 5 years it had pretty much run its course!
[Will you actually being singing? Or will you be pulling a beyond at the inauguration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cyax7?context=5)|I sang.  I was not as confidant about it as I was at rehearsals...not as clear an ear mix but there are a million possible reasons for that.  Hopefully didn't muff any notes, I haven't heard it yet.
 |Did you mean Beyonce'?  If you're going to pick on an entertainer for prioritizing entertainment over a live display of musicianship then put it in an envelope and mail it to madonna in the 80's...nothing has changed.  Ill bet if Beyonce' thought she could relate more to her crowd by strumming an acoustic and singing with a bluegrass band around a single microphone she could pull it off.  Just my impression of her.  I didn't see the inauguration but I'm guessing it was enough of a formality rather than her regular crowd having a good time that she might have said ""fuck it, let's run the vocal track tonight"".  Or maybe she had a cold.  I don't know why I'm defending her, she just seems like she genuinely cares about music and has talent... and that's good enough for me.
[Are all the performers there already? If so, do you get to walk around and maybe meet a random artist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cuoxg?context=5)|Yes,  Dress rehearsals started at 10amPST and the entire show is run mock live at the same pace.
[Btw, in the very minuscule chance that you see him, say hi to Frank Ocean for me :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cuoxg?context=5)|Absolutely, it's the most fun part.  Last time I got to make a fool of myself with Neil Patrick Harris, Jamie Foxx, Usher, Gwennyth Paltrow, Beyonce', Polly Peret, said hi to the beibs.  I invited NPH to go get ""a sandwich""...I'm pretty sure he was very unamused but he was nice about the gag.  Usher held my hand for about 10 seconds when the crowd pushed in...he looked back and presumably realized I wasn't his bodyguard and let go without any explanation.  Jamie Foxx loves Miranda's music and recognized us from the performance...he approached US which was awesome!  I hope this year is as exciting as the 53rd was!
[Just watched you on the Grammy's.  Good job.  How much can you make a year as a touring musician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cyk11?context=5)|Not as much as I was making at Dell as a web programmer, but I wouldn't trade it for any job!

My question: what is Miranda's phone number?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cyf4j?context=5)|She's had to change her number so many times it's usually different by the one occasion a year I have to call or text her.
 |But sorry no...It doesn't say ""Answer You Anything""!
[How do you even get into the business like that?

His was through the Grammy Foundation i think.
[Are you a session musician?

For the most part the nashville recording clique is seperate from the touring clique.  I haven't tried to break in.  I'm a bit insecure about my abilities in the studio...I lean more towards the showman side.
[What did you do at dell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d13dd?context=5)|It changed a lot over 7 years.  Most of that I was a contractor with no bennies coding in ASP and PHP, but it allowed me to work part time and run my music studio at night.  At first I was contracted to do internal facing customer relationship sites for people who needed inside information but didnt work for dell.  Later I was the junior developer for the Internet Partners Division...which was a specialized arm between small and large business for Dell partners who had few employees and large profits, and offered venture capital to potential companies like that.  Then the big tech bust happened in 2000 and those companies mostly flopped like fish in a dried up lake.  My entire division of about 300 dried up.  First the sales force was redirected to the small and medium business divisions.  Then one by one the marketing executives were either laid off or reassigned.  Before the admin (that's Dell-ese for secretary) knew she was to be laid off she handed me my contract.  She mentioned she had tweaked the employee database to give me a status somewhere inbetween a contractor and direct employee.  Eventually the Director and everybody I worked for was gone and I was left alone in the empty cubicle farm for 20 yards in any direction with no standing orders or responsibilities.  I realized it was some sort of glitch that might soon be fixed so I started wandering around looking for people that needed computer help...excel spreadsheets, mouse ball cleaning, pc load lettering, whatever.  About a month later I was helping somebody and they realized I could edit web pages and shouted to their colleagues ""WE HAVE A WEB RESOURCE!"".  Apparently they hadn't been able to update their web pages since the layoffs.  I handed their admin my contract, which was somehow pre-funded by Intel for keeping their logo on the site, and my job continued for another 6 years...now with flexible hours since I was effectively an independent contractor.  My contracting company had lost every employee but me and gone under...they sold out to another arbitrary entity whom I kept faxing in my hours to and I kept getting paychecks.  I did internal and external coding, photoshop work, copywriting, at my most prestigious point I managed the home page...then I took it a step further and re-did the menu system on the home page.  It was kind of a disaster because I went around the usual dell content and made a javascript system that was only PC compatible, but was there really much business we lost from people on Mac's trying to buy Dell's?  I knew it would be fixed soon enough and i knew I would never again get the opportunity to work on web pages that get millions of hits daily.  I had no more ambition left for the tech industry.  Right about that time Dell started gearing up for the second round of layoffs in 2006...maybe third if you count how many contractors they let go at any given time.  I had been forced to go full time and forced to lead a team of programmers, which was cool but i had turned it down because as a perfectionist it made me want to get there early and leave late to make sure shit got done.  It was a responsibility trap.  I had to escape and my solo music career had fizzled in the last few years.  So I told all my musician friends I was looking for a road gig...I'd even play country..but corporate money is a hard addiction to kick!  Miranda wasn't the first audition to come up but it was the first one I'd leave Dell money for...
[Are you involved with the songwriting process, or are you given sheet music to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dcu7q?context=5)|Miranda's songwriting process? No.  I do hole up in the back lounge and write songs while we're on the road but that's just my own thing.  She gives us rough mixes as the albums are in progress so we can have the songs ready to play before the album is released.  We often make nashville chord charts to get started and Keith always writes drum charts, but the songs are always quickly memorized.  It's all done by listening.  We use our own best judgement as a band on how to translate studio parts to a live performance by a 6 piece band.  We're very against using tracks to have a slick production in the live show.
[I was surprised about your answer that you made more doing Web Dev. Are you going to have to quit in a few years and get a 'real job'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dcu7q?context=5)|Well, nobody can tour FOREVER!  I hope to get involved in the songwriting scene so I can continue to pay my bills with music and not computer skillz...it's just more fun.  Although I do enjoy programming, I enjoy it much more when it's not for a company that I am not attached to..I like hobby programming like VST plugins and the Reaper SWS extensions i'm playing around with.

She will be finishing up a pretty good internship and I am a young professional working in my hometown for the year, so i don't have any bills (only big one is my truck, my parents are awesome) and will have some downtime on my project during that time period.
Neither one of us have ever really traveled and do not really know where to go. I would prefer to take off work up to three days max, i am thinking of flying out early on a Wednesday and coming back on a Saturday. Some places that come to my mind include; Banff Natural Park, San Francisco, San Diego, The Keys, Colorado, East coast somewhere... i am open to suggestions and/or tips for any of these places or other destinations. Any help on picking a place, hotel, flight, etc. is greatly appreciated!"
18cvw9,1,2013-02-11,"I [19M] want to get closer to the girl I like [20F], but I'm afraid that at this I might've burned every bridge for anything to happen... in purpose",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18cvw9/i_19m_want_to_get_closer_to_the_girl_i_like_20f/,"What's up /r/Relationships? I'd like to keep this short, but as many things, this requires some context.

The girl I like used to be my best friend's girlfriend, about say 4 or 5 years ago. At that moment I totally despised her; there was some bad reputation around her because she used to date lots of guys at school, and when things went wrong she was always the ""bad guy"". You know how kids are. So after those two broke up (two times), the contact was basically lost. She was still there in the clasroom, but she was a ghost for me. She was the one who had hurted my best friends feelings.

Time passed by, and 2 years ago I started a internship on some IT enterprise. Fun thing was that she worked there too, on the same conditions as I did. So, eventually, we had to get along. At first there were next to none words, but some months later something inside of me forgave her; maybe she wasn't evil after all. My friend told me it was nobody's fault, relationships are just like that, but back then I saw him so hurted that I just couldn't accept that, she must've been some kind of devil; but we all mature, and started to jag the pieces.

Surprisingly then, around May of 2012, my friend said *""hey, what do you say we invite her to the movies?""*. I was sceptic at first, but after going out some more times I started to accept her. And fall for her as well. My first mistake must've been not telling her my feelings, my first and most important. You could say I was kind of obsessed, waiting for the weekend to go out with her and my friends, stealing hugs from time to time, thinking that she'd catch my stupidly weak signals. I've never been good at socializing, so the ways I had to express my feelings weren't the best, of course she'd never catch what I meant. Of course she'd still think that I hated her.

Anyway, this kept going on, and by that time (August 2012) she was going out with some other guy. I knew it wouldn't work, things weren't going good. My friend told me the same, and that day he told me ""she's more like a woman to you now, huh?"". Welp, he knew. ""I just think something between you two might work, you know? You both are autonomous in several ways..."" and other stuff. You know, everything seems perfect from some perspectives. I guess that was the excuse I needed to actually begin expressing my feelings.

Until one day, when she and my friend came home for dinner and some movies, she fell asleep with me, on some kind of embrace. So when my friend went to sleep, on another room, lots of things started to run through my mind. For whatever reason, damn me, I kissed her on her sleep. From there, say November 2012, things started to move.

I still don't know how she did to forgive me for what I did. She told me she was mad, but I at the same time I wasn't the kind of person that would do that; so she wanted to understand. I told her I liked her, and that if I hadn't told her before it was because she was on a relationship with someone else, and it wouldn't have felt right. As I expected, the same explanation was good for her to reject me, it was true that it wouldn't feel right to accept me while she was going out with someone else, so it didn't happen. Hanging out, though, was a weird experience from then and on, I was waiting for she to break up with him. I couldn't wait to start something with her.

The day finally came, and via my friend I found out had broken up. She wouldn't tell it to me, so everytime we went out was weird, awkward. I knew she was single, but at the same time she didn't want me to know it. Or she knew that I knew, but was afraid of what could happen. I started to become more jealous than before. Whatever, at that time she wasn't the happiest person in the world, breaking up ain't fun for nobody. That and her family problems? Nah, my feelings could wait. So I waited 'til new year to tell her... that I couldn't be her friend anymore, that I wanted something else, something more.

Then we started going out. I felt really happy, she was finally mine. It was a shame that she didn't feel the same, but I wouldn't find out until later. One week later she told me that even though I could've felt happy, she didn't feel the same, not even comfortable next to me. All those years of hate and indifference came up, and it was true that she knew little about me. She recited once and once again, how little we had in common, that she couldn't find something to call this a relationship. Then I took a break. I told her that if I couldn't be that, then I wouldn't be nothing, because I'd end up hurting me, and of course, her.

Idiot as I am, my distance lasted one week. I send her a message so we could meet up and do some chit chat. I told her how even though all that she said might be true, I still thought that it could work, and that I'd do anything for it to work. I said ""well, okay, you don't know me, then let's know each other!"". The idea sounded good, but there was a problem. During that time I wouldn't be more than a friend, or even less than that, because every action that I'd make, it would of course mean something else. I cannot play the friend.

So we started hanging out the two of us, with no one else. It'd be the only way for me to have her for myself. I kept pushing myself, trying to find the line between love and friendship... that didn't end up good. It didn't matter if I pushed further or not, she felt uncomfortable in any way. I couldn't even hold her, knowing that my intentions weren't those of a friend. Last two nights I went to her home. The first one we went to the chinese festival, it was supposed to be the last time we'd go out, since I couldn't go on like that. I tried being a friend, playing her game, not even touching her; we talked a lot. But in the end, I still felt empty. I said goodbye in the morning without saying much, so my mind led me to ask her out once again, promising that this time it really would be the last time.

I did not try to convince her to get away with me or anything, but if it was gonna be the last time, I moved a little further... it was midnight and I wouldn't go home that late, so I ended up at her home again. I knew it was all in vain, but still. I took it easy, with some hugs and stuff, sleeping next to her. She couldn't handle it and went to the couch. It was obvious that she wasn't going to feel uncomfotable. I slept alone. The morning after, she gave me a speech of how dissapointed she was for me, for taking advantage of the situation, for making her let me stay home.

Of course she was right. But I told her how selfish I was, and how if it was gonna be the last time, I would do it without remorse. She said she didn't want to be angry with me, because she respected me, and just didn't want things to end up like that. I asked for forgiveness, not sure of what had happened, and was about to leave, when she said ""one last hug?"". I accepted, and then walked down the road back home.

Hours later I sent her a message telling her why I had done what I did, all the last-time implications and such. That don't want her to be, but I don't have any excuse for her not to, after all I had done all wrong. One last time I told her that it doesn't matter how hard I try, I just cannot be her friend, and even if I could, then it wouldn't be a role I'd want to occupy; so I said I'd, once again, generate a distance.

*And I don't want to go, but I feel like I should...*

My best friend told me how love wasn't always logical, how she is a complicated person. That he thinks that things maybe ain't working out because not of me, but in the way I show who I am. I had already given up. I told him how every way I could have reached her, I threw it all away. Dissapearing would be for the best of me, him, and our group of friends. I don't wanna spend half of my time trying to be what I don't want to be, while hurting myself, but I do wanna be with her.

I'm looking for solutions, for other ways to reach her. I think I won't find much, but I lose nothing by asking.

TL;DR: There's this girl I've known for a while. I used to hate her, but now I realized there's no reason for that; therefore I fell for her and now I love her. Making her understand that I didn't hate her anymore was quite a process, but it finally worked and we tried going out. I thought everything was good, but in the end, she doesn't feel the same and said she wants to know me to actually feel comfortable with me. Thing is that while she learns who I am she wants me to stay as a friend, which of course is painful for me in everyway; so I've decided to take distance. Do you think there's any other solution for us to be without hurting each other like this?"
18ctrh,5,2013-02-11,"My Type 1 girlfriend attempted suicide in the Fall semester, started cutting again tonight",MarshRT,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/18ctrh/my_type_1_girlfriend_attempted_suicide_in_the/,"Hi reddit, I've been lurking for a while and I've seen that people really get results when they ask for help. I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this, but I'll explain for a sec. I've been dating my girlfriend for just over four months - in that time, I've bandaged her wounds from increasingly severe attempts at cutting and stopped her from overdosing on the day after Halloween. She was checked into the emergency room then moved to the Behavioral Health Center at the local hospital, and released after just under 5 days. Since then she's gone to regular psychologist and psychiatrist appointments on campus at our university, been put on 300mg of Seroquel, and has explained bipolar disorder to her parents and gotten their full support with medication and counseling. Her mom was just up visiting last weekend and they really made a lot of progress talking about medication and my girlfriend's disorder, and she was really scared her mom wouldn't accept her for it or be supportive My girlfriend's maternal-side grandmother was also severely Type 1 Bipolar.

I have late classes this semester but I always go say goodnight to her at her dorm on campus, and when I called her to say I was on my way she sounded really distant. She gets very quiet when she's depressed, and I could tell something was wrong when I got there. We sat together and talked about our days and then she said, ""I think it's weird that other people don't cut."" I asked her what she meant and she said it was so normal for her that it was hard imagining what it was like not to. Before I go on, I want to say her room was a mess with her books and clothes all over the desk and floor, and there were open bandage wrappers on her desk that I noticed when I walked in.

I asked if she'd been cutting and she said yes. She had two small cuts on her palm and her wrist, and said she had a much worse one on her leg. I lifted her pants leg at one point and it was caked with dried blood, and she said it'd stopped bleeding and looked much worse than it actually was.

She'd started with little cuts last semester before her attempt and it got progressively worse, and I'm terrified she's going to commit suicide again. She tried by taking handfuls of Advil last time besides the cuts, but with 300mg doses of anti-psychotics in her dorm I'm scared shitless she'll do it when I'm gone, because my schedule is MUCH heavier this semester and I just barely got to her in time to stop her and get the campus EMS last fall. She told me it was okay because the cuts didn't hurt when she did them, and progressively became more distant and groggy as we sat and talked. I wrote a letter summarizing what happened and what I'd said to give her tomorrow if she's more alert, since she has a long history of memory issues that only get worse when she has an episode. She didn't remember walking back to her dorm tonight from dinner or even how long her roommate was gone before she started cutting. There was a stretch of two months she didn't remember Junior year of high school that her best friend helped her through, but her best friend goes to a rival college and has becoming significantly more distant since December. She was also abused for two years by her ex-boyfriend but hasn't gone to victim's advocate yet, and she actually helped me realize and accept that I'd been abused in a previous relationship and helped me more than I can ever credit or thank her for.

She has a psychologist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM - I asked her if she'd talk about this but she kept saying it wasn't a big deal and that she didn't want to. I'm really hoping she'll change her mind tomorrow when she's not feeling slow (her words) and groggy... She has her first internship tomorrow morning observing in a high school and she's looking forward to it but she also gets really anxious about unknown situations.

I love her completely. She explained bipolar disorder to me the night I told her I liked her, and I've read all of the books and articles she's sent me about her disorder. I visited her every day in the Behavioral Health Center and brought her lunch, clothes, and whatever belongings they'd let her keep in her room. She means everything to me and I want to help her through this.

Her parents are supportive but they said they'd immediately pull her out of college if a situation like last semester happened again. I want to help her, she just got back on track and changed her major and she's going to be a math and science teacher (and a damn good one, too). I know she needs help and I'm terrified, I don't want to derail her from school again but I don't know if she can handle being by herself. She told me that whatever bad things she did weren't meant to hurt me, that she was sorry and she loved me, and that we'd talk about all this in the morning. I'm just hoping we can get her help before this spirals into another attempt and she's pulled out of school permanently.

I don't know what I'm asking for, maybe just for any helpful advice or any approaches I can try taking with her that genuinely help and won't alert her parents... She's medicated and going to counseling and if this is something we can work through together and with her counselor and psychiatrist instead of hospitalizing her I'd love to hear whatever you all have to say."

I'm a senior math/CS student (graduating in May, whooo!), and through a combination of not knowing what I want to do with my life and general anxiety about working in the real world, I didn't do any internships during my undergrad.  Now I'm faced with the reality of applying for jobs, and I'm freaking out because I feel like an idiot for not doing an internship.  (If I could do undergrad over again, I would have definitely done some kind of internship.  I feel like a dumbass.)

So I feel unprepared for a full-time job, but I know that internships are typically for current college students.  Is it a faux pas to apply to both an internship and a full-time position at the same company?  I aim to be applying to programming jobs/internships.

For further background, I go to UT Austin (a top 10 school for CS, whatever help that is), with a decent GPA and a heavy tutoring background.  I've had the same tutoring job for 3 years, and it was a long-semester only job.  I've had jobs during the summer, but they were mentoring/tutoring jobs with extremely flexible hours.  I want to stay in the Austin area after graduation if possible.

Thanks in advance!"

Any career advice you could give me Reddit?",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/18h8vu/two_potential_summer_internships_not_sure_which/,"I'm a Business student concentrating in Information Systems and Computer Science at a fairly well known Top 30 University.

I haven't had an internship before and this is my last summer before graduating. As it stands I have two options.

1) A position in the Technology division of an Investment Bank doing most likely software development. My title would be that of an Analyst, and I'd be in the same New England city as my school which would be nice.

2) A position in Miami in the IT division of a Fortune 100 company, in a group overseeing the international IT operations of its foreign subsidiaries. The role would be more about strategy, and management. It's also paying 50% more than at the Investment Bank. That said, although it's closer to home, and I have some family there, I don't really have any friends in the area. Although I considered maybe going there after Graduation because of the more agreeable weather.

I know career advice is difficult to dispense without my career goals, so here it goes:

Long term I would like to open my own business in the country I'm from, or to be CIO of some company. I enjoy business problems more than I do coding. I enjoy development and programming and I'm pretty good relative to my peers, but I feel I'm not as good as other people out there and I won't ever be ""top of my field"". I always considered Project Management to be my eventual destination, and coding as more of a step in that direction. 

I've been leaning towards the bank despite this though, just because i feel an Investment Banking internship is more prestigious, and I feel I can leverage that better than I do this position.

I'm talking with the career center at my school but I just wanted other people's thoughts on the matter.

Thanks!!!"

I came in late, only heard the last 5 minutes of their presentation, and talked with one of the presenters asking her questions about the company/product. She was very attractive, seemed very intelligent and kind of nerdy from my meeting her. After reading a brochure on the company, when I got home, I realized the company's product could be used for an idea for a website I have, the biggest problem is data collection/analysis. Anyways, I emailed her to see who I could talk to, she said she'd be glad to answer any questions. The next day, one of the interns (female) who also attended, asked me if I was trying to get a date, told her I wasn't, I was trying to find out more about the company. But the intern then tells me that the woman mentioned I was cute. So here's my question.

How would you feel about a man asking you out for coffee, but if he also had legitimate reasons for talking to you about your company? I don't want to come off sleezy/like I'm bullshitting her to get her out, the company really does have a product I'd be interested in using, but I'd like to get to know more about her. Is this a one or the other scenario? Or can I find out about the company, then ask her if she'd like to meet up for coffee? Any input is appreciated.

Unfortunately, it seems like I have a real possibility of not getting accepted anywhere.  So far I've received 2 rejections, and 7 other schools have already sent out offers. I'm still waiting on 3 schools, but I'm not very hopeful for those.

I should also mention that I only applied to top-20 schools in theoretical CS, and this is probably a big reason why I didn't get accepted anywhere.  In my defense, I kind of bought into my professors and friends telling me I'd probably get in places, but in any case it's too late to do anything now.  I mostly just want to know why I'm not getting in anywhere, and how I can fix that when I apply to graduate schools next year.  I would really like to be competitive for the top schools, and even if I'm not able to, I think it's a reasonable goal to have.

So yea, here's my profile.  Just FYI, I'm going to include some identifying information, and I'm fine with everything I post here.  However if by chance you recognize me, it'd be great if you didn't mention anything I don't list here (not sure if that's reasonable or not).  And sorry in advance for the length -


Undergraduate Institution: MIT, majoring in Mathematics with Computer Science (18C)

GRE: 169/161/4.5 Q/V/AW, did not take the subject test

GPA/Coursework: 4.83/5.0 overall, 4.93/5.0 in just math and computer science courses

In particular, I've taken 5 (+1 in progress at the time of application) graduate courses in theoretical computer science, 3 undergraduate courses in computer science, 2 undergraduate courses cross-listed in computer science and math, and 5 (+1 in progress at the time of application) math courses.  Among these, my only B was in Real Analysis freshman year.

Research Experience: 1 semester in a computational biology group freshman year that was only mentioned in my resume, 1 summer in a mathematics REU that resulted in two poster presentations at undergraduate conferences, 1 summer doing mathematics research in my school that resulted in a single author publication that's in submission, and 1 summer doing theoretical computer science research in my school where I only got small results, but was acknowledged in a paper for ""helpful conversations.""

Recommendations: 2 recommendations from my research advisors from the past two summers, and 1 recommendation from the professor I took a graduate course with (unlike other grad courses, this one had a midterm along with a research oriented final project).  All of them seemed positive about me applying, and all well-known theoretical computer scientists.

Personal Statement: To be honest, I didn't spend as much time on this as I should have, and this is definitely something I need to be better about next time around.  I just wrote that I liked theoretical computer science, about my research experiences, and a customized paragraph for each school that mentioned a few professors I would be interested in working with.  I didn't include any ideas for research projects, or grand reasons for going to grad school.  I did not mention anything about my pre-college years.

Random Extras that may or may not matter: I got top 500 on the Putnam last year, one of the surveys I wrote for a final project for a grad course turned into a publication in an undergraduate expository journal, have written a few articles in a mathematics magazine for middle school students, have graded for various courses in mathematics and computer science, have done two winter internships in finance.

Thanks in advance to everyone who got through that."
18gyep,22,2013-02-13,"CS student here. Depressed. Under qualified. Confused. Desperately need your help, Redditors. ",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18gyep/cs_student_here_depressed_under_qualified/,"Background:
--------------
I will be graduating next year from a CS program from one of the top 5 universities in Canada. Its depressing for me to say that despite having a really good cumulative average in my program, a relatively decent grasp of the theoretical concepts we are taught in school, and a 16 month internship experience with a multi-national software firm, I don't think I'm worth anything and so will not be able to find a job after I graduate.

Let me clarify what I've said above: 
1) While its one of the top 5 universities in the country, apparently all the universities in that list have the same quality of education or 'training' that they impart to undergrads.
2) Yes, I have been a lazy bum when it comes to talking to professors about research opportunities they could provide me with, or in general networking with them - learning more about the course outside of the curriculum. I am not a scholar. Not one who'd think about going to grad school and doing research. I am one who sticks to school curriculum, does well, and parties the time he's left with. I realize that this habit of mine is possibly one of the bigger reasons or probably THE reason, why I think I'll be a failure after I graduate.
3) The 16 month internship experience I've had with the software firm has been that of a Test Associate intern. This is one of the decisions I regret most in my life until now (I know there are many more to come). I was offered 4 developer position internships and 2 test associate internships. I chose the internship of the testing position because of the money and the name of the software firm. And believe me when I say this, I really needed the money (no, not for parties. for family related issues). When I was deciding on which internship to choose, I knew I should go with the developing positions, but should I have gone with them, I wouldn't have been able to finish school.

I believe that internships are the best way to start off your career and a great opportunity for those who can get these. I faltered here big time. 

Now, coming back to my original point: 
--------------------------------------------
I'll be graduating in slightly over a year. And I believe that 1 year can be a relatively long period of time to set things right if one really wants to.

But here's my problem, I don't know how to do this. I know what I want. I want to be able to sell myself in a year from now to potential employers on how I could make a difference to their firm. Basically, get them to hire me. 

I'm not great with any particular technology. I have had some experience with a few of them. Nothing that would dazzle anyone. I know people without CS degrees have better experiences and work than I do.

Under web development, I have come across technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL. My experience here limited to creating a simple website I made.
Under core development, I have come across technologies such as Java, Python, C++. But my experience here is limited to school assignments extending up to a writing a few classes.
Under app development, I have developed a couple android apps. No exposure to iOS.
Under testing practices, I have written a few shell scripts and dealt with some automation testing. Nothing useful here.

I haven't ever worked with Open Source. Never had experience with GIT and open source projects on github. This, I hear is a very good way to expose yourself to real world problems and real world programming. However, I really don't exactly know where to start with this. Which projects to contribute to. How to contribute. I know what you're thinking.. its sad, I know. But that's why I need your help..

I have heard and read a lot about TopCoder. Apparently, you do well in topcoder competitions, gain a good rating and you can easily get hired by some top software firm. I don't know if this is really true. The problems on top coder are based on your knowledge of algorithms. I don't know if this is really worth the time and effort that will be put in to it. If just having a good rating, which obviously isn't guaranteed before hand, will do it for you.

I don't know if I should go about making some kind of web app or a phone app myself and bank on that.

TL;DR
-------
I don't know how I should spend the last year before I graduate to make myself sellable to firms, so that they hire me. I have no experience with open source, top coder. Don't have any fancy projects. Don't have advanced development experience. Just whatever one learns in school curriculum. These days, that doesn't seem to be enough.

Please tell me whether putting all my time in Top Coder can be worth it. Why? 

Or please tell me if I should start contributing to Open Source projects. If so, how? And what I can gain from it. 

Or please tell me if I should disregard the previous options and go about making some personal project of my own. If so, please tell me which technologies should I look to be working with? As there seem to be countless of them out there!

OR what would you do, if you were in my place facing the situation I am."
18gpgw,14,2013-02-13,Transitioning from engineering,Rossoneri,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/18gpgw/transitioning_from_engineering/,"I'm currently working on my MS in Aerospace engineering and have always had an interest in finance.  Managing my own investments and learning about investments in general.  I have a few internship interviews coming up in the next week, but most of the financial institutions at which I applied only liked me for tech type positions (software development) and the like.  Which is understandable as I have a large coding background.

My question is whether after I complete an internship in something like financial software development, could I potentially easily transition into a quantitative analyst position once I graduate or will I end up limiting myself to software type roles?

EDIT: I should add I've taken some economics courses and in the Fall I'm planning to take some heavy math based finance courses (stochastic processes in finance, numerical methods in finance, and design/implementation of systems to support computational finance)"

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it. 

http://imageshack.us/a/img803/5234/accountdecay.jpg

I am sorry if I am being vague, confusing, or am unable to accurately describe what exactly I am looking for from Reddit, but I was hoping to just bounce some ideas around for sure. I really appreciate you guys reading. Thanks!"
18gorr,141,2013-02-13,I saw something on FB today that hurt me so badly it actually made me cry and I don't know who to rant about it to because I can't tell anyone who knows me why it hurts so much.,evasive_owl,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18gorr/i_saw_something_on_fb_today_that_hurt_me_so_badly/,"**DISCLAIMER**: I have to get something off my chest and I think this would be a good place to put it. My heart has been aching today and I have a lot to say. If you don't want to read a wall of text, venture no further. 

This is my throwaway because a lot of people, including immediate family members know my username, and I am about to divulge personal information I have never told anyone. The only other person that knows this information is my SO. 

I'm 21, and I'm a junior in college. I've been dating my boyfriend for exactly 2 years and 6 months Friday. We have great, awesome sex, and a lot of it. In the early fall of 2010, when we first started dating, I lost my birth control pill pack and I ended up getting a new pack after skipping 4 pills. I got pregnant. We had been dating for two weeks when this happened, so naturally, I got an abortion. I love kids and I have wanted to be a mother since I was 5 years old. I have the names of my children all picked up and lined out. I browse /r/BabyBumps all the time because I love seeing women become mothers. Am I weird? Maybe. 

Long story short, it broke my heart to get an abortion. Not only because I love kids, but that I was so careless about sexual protection that it got to the point where I needed to have one. I don't regret the abortion at all, but I do regret my choices concerning protection that led up to. I think about the ""what ifs"" if I hadn't had the abortion. I think about the adorable child my boyfriend and I would have made. 

I was a freshman in college when I got pregnant and he was a junior. We decided to have the abortion immediately after I discovered I was pregnant. We knew that our hopes, dreams, and aspirations would go down the drain if we had not. And two years later, we are closer than ever to achieving those dreams, and still together. I couldn't be happier.
He now has a wonderful, wonderful job in engineering, and I am graduating early next year with a 3.8 gpa from one of the highest ranked public universities in the United States. I have a solid internship, and a job offer for when I graduate. I'm applying to grad schools in Europe, because my SO and I both have dreamed of moving to Europe since we were young. He's taking me to the Bahamas in March for my Spring break. We love life, and we are making the most of it. I am in the best shape I ever have been: I work as a spinning instructor, and I'm running a marathon in March. We share a cute apartment in city my school and his job are located in. If I had not had the abortion two years ago, *none* of this would be happening. I am so thankful I live in a country where no one can deny me access to abortion. 

Of course, there are some of you who would indeed carry the child full term, and either put them up for adoption, or raise them on your own. To you, I say, you are brave. I give you props for going through 9 months of judgement, stares, and ridicule, and putting your own life aside for a baby. (I am sure that not all of you did in fact get ridiculed, but that seems to be the common trend with the girls I know who are young mothers)

For me, I knew that neither of these possibilities would work. I was (and still am) not ready to be a mother. I'm still a kid! I spend my nights partying, drinking, and getting high with friends when I don't have to study, and during the summers, I work and travel as much as I can. I am an athlete, and I did not want to sacrifice my body with pregnancy, because it is impossible to bring yourself back to the point you were at before. Maybe I'm selfish, but this is my life. I couldn't bear the thought of bringing a child into this world, and giving them up for adoption as soon as they were born. I tear up just thinking of how painful that would be. I can't even imagine what it would be like to go through that, and to those of you who have, you are so brave to have gone through with that. 

I was browsing my facebook newsfeed, when I stumbled upon a link to [a facebook page](http://imgur.com/a/93cvc) (I've taken screen shots and uploaded them to imgur, so the link won't bring you directly to the page) one of my facebook friends shared. I was immediately confused when I saw it bore the title ""I am for women, I am for children, I am for life."" When I read the description, my confusion turned to rage. The description is written by a male. I am not at all saying men shouldn't be allowed to have an opinion on abortion, but the campaign claims to be ""For Women"".

How can this campaign be for women if the person running it isn't even a woman? He never had to experience an abortion procedure with his own body. He never had to experience the terror and sickness one feels when sitting in a stall in dorm building's communal bathroom and staring at the little pink plus sign of the 7th stick they've pissed on to confirm their pregnancy. Maybe he has impregnated a woman who then got an abortion, but from how he worded his essay, he hasn't been. Regardless, the fact remains, until you've been impregnated at 18 years old by a 20 year old college kid you've only been with for two weeks, or until you've been any woman who has ever experienced an unwanted pregnancy for *any* reason, you can't claim your pro-life campaign is ""For Women"".

Campaign away for pro-life causes, I don't care! But don't mask a freaking campaign for pro-life under women's rights and ""liberation from the choice to end a life"", because that is where I begin to have a problem with you.

&gt;I guess I'm talking about this for a couple reasons. For one, the only people we hear from on this issue are women and priests. Well here is an average guy saying something now, and hoping other average guys will come out of the woodwork despite the fear of being ""that person on Facebook trying to push an agenda."" This is not politics. My father has told me my entire life that a true man is one who takes responsibility. Men: step up and show your girlfriend, wife, family and friends that you will say something, too. A society like ours is proud to be founded upon accountability in the vain of justice. This is justice. Simply saying ""I wouldn't, but its not my place to tell others not to"" like I once did is a cop-out. There is surely a place for tolerance in our world--we all come from different backgrounds, different religions, different upbringings--but as human beings, isn't it a given that we should all take a stand for humanity? As Americans, if we see injustice, especially pertaining to life or death, we do something. Let's be courageous men and women and stand up for real and true lives being ended. If we ALL wouldn't do it ourselves, then isn't something wrong?""

Maybe the reason you *only* hear it from women is because it's an issue about the biological female's body. And guess what, I have news for you. I have never said ""I wouldn't do it, but it's not m place to tell others not to"", because I HAVE done it, and I WOULD do it again if I got pregnant at an inopportune time. This is not justice. This is an ill-informed campaign run by men to stop women from making a very personal, private, and difficult choice that the majority of human beings are lucky enough not to have to make. The only thing WRONG here is your campaign and your bold claims, sir. 

Love,
An actual post-abortion female who doesn't regret it.

**How do I record my microphone/guitar/preamp with my computer?**

If you're here you most likely want to record yourself or others onto some storage medium.  Computers provide a convienent, flexible, low-cost medium (compared to tape, et al) for recording audio.  For analog audio signals to be converted into digital signals that can stored and manipulated on a computer it must undergo the process of analog-to-digital conversion and for you to be able to listen it again, it must be converted back to the analog domain through a digital-to-analog converter.  Any computer soundcard contains these converters (known as ADCs and DACs), though for recording purposes a profesional device is typically used.  The professional converters we are interested in here are called 'audio interfaces', which is what we call converters that have some method of interfacing with a computer.  They can come in two forms: internal cards (PCI, PCIe) or external interfaces (USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt).

These interfaces vary wildly in their features and cost, typically in number of channels, how many of those channels have microphone preamps, if any have hi-z inputs for direct recording of guitar/bass, additional digital inputs, and internal hardware routing and effects.  Some will even operate independently of a computer in a 'standalone mode.'  External interfaces are increasingly common, with them being included in many low-cost mixers as well (though frequently only a 2-channel stereo interface on cheaper models), and performance of reasonable quality can be had rather cheaply.

**What kind of computer do I need for recording?**

This is not a computer-focused sub, posts regarding building a pc will be removed.  Post questions about building computers in [/r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc).  That said, a recording PC is not very different from a gaming PC, minus the need for a fast graphics card.  A quality motherboard, power supply, and fast CPU are pretty much essential.  8-16GB of RAM is a good idea, more if you're going to be running large multisampled software instruments like orchestra packs.  Two hard drives, one for your OS/applications and one for recording/sample libraries is also a good idea (required for PT) to avoid underruns due to hard disk paging.  The internal graphics in the newer Intel and AMD CPUs are fine, a graphics card isn't going to make your DAW run better.  In fact, high performance graphics cards can be a source of interference and noise.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that PWM fans may be a source of interference as well, but I don't use them myself so I can't test that theory.

**How do I soundproof my dorm/bedroom/apartment?**

The first thing you should know is that sound proofing is not acoustic treatment.  Soundproofing is a method of reducing sound transmission between the studio and outside the studio.  Acoustic treatment aims to treat the studio so that the acoustics are better for recording.

Unfortunately it is very difficult and expensive to effectively soundproof an existing structure. Another factor to consider is that if you are renting or otherwise do not own the property it may be against the terms of your lease to modify the space in any meaningful way. As well, soundproofing is effective only in certain frequency ranges, with cost and difficulty inversely correlated with frequency; that is, it is more difficult and costly to soundproof against low frequencies versus high frequencies. The following links describe soundproofing and acoustic treatment in the context of small spaces in more detail.

**What DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, ie recording software) should I use?**

*This is not an exhaustive list of DAWs or their capabilities.*

The answer to this question is highly dependent on your situation. You don't 'need' Pro Tools to do professional-sounding work; in fact many pros use DAWs such as [MOTU Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/) or [Steinberg Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html).  Pro Tools has become something of a de-facto standard in commercial studios due to a variety of historical factors (not the least of which is [vendor lock-in] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) and familiarity for outside engineers, however many have moved away from Pro Tools for some of those same reasons.  Other popular DAWs are [Cockos Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)(very affordable, lots of functionality), [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com)(focused on live performance of electronic music), [Apple Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/logicpro/)(popular in audio post circles).  [Cakewalk Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/products/sonar/), [Presonus StudioOne](http://studioone.presonus.com/), [Image-Line FL Studio](http://flstudio.com), [Steinberg Nuendo](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/nuendo.html), and [Propellerheads Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/) all have their devotees as well.  Nearly all of these products have free trials available, so feel free to try them out and see what works for you.

###Some advice to follow before posting a thread about noise or other problems

*******

**Basic Troubleshooting**


Before posting questions about problems, please follow these steps for basic troubleshooting.

Many of these may seem illogical, but many implementations of technology are more involved than they may seem.  Basic troubleshooting typically involves replacing components with 'known good' equivalents and seeing if it makes a difference.  For example, noise in a vocal recording:  replace the microphone cable.  If that fixes it, the microphone cable is bad.  If it doesn't fix it, try another mic, different preamp, etc.  

http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/index#wiki_basic_troubleshooting




**I'm getting noise in my recordings, help?**


Before posting about a noise problem, please make a recording of the noise. It is impossible to properly diagnose the source of the noise through colorful language. Words like ""static"", ""buzzing"", ""clicking"" can all mean different things to different people. Buffer underrun sounds different from cellphone interference, however both could be described as clicking, buzzing, or stuttering.  Also provide a complete description of the signal chain from beginning to end, type/model of computer if there's a computer involved, and pictures of everything (including where cables are going) if possible. What may seem unrelated or insignificant to you may in fact be the source of the problem. Help us help you.  [It's also worth noting you may be experiencing *mechanical noise* rather than *electrical noise*.](http://recordinghacks.com/2013/02/18/fixing-microphone-hum/)

It is also FAR more preferable to re-record the source than trying to remove noise after the fact.  Audio never comes out the other end unscathed. 

*****
Some examples of common noises:

[Cellphone/GSM noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1mlponX_jw)

[Buffer Underruns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Ysh7Y9_bI)

[Ground Loop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSA2F1AwboU)

There isn't much you can do about Cellphone/GSM noise other than banning cellphones from the studio.  In my experience the noise doesn't travel all that far, though, so if you get them several feet away, you may be OK.  YMMV.  Even if your entire signal chain is balanced, the voice coils and/or internal wiring of your monitors can still pick it up.  If anyone has a better solution, let me know.

Buffer underruns can be fixed by increasing the size of the hardware buffer on your interface.  How to do this varies with different software and hardware, check your manual on how to do this.  Note: Increasing your buffer size will increase the latency in the audio path, not generally a problem during mixdown but it can cause major issues for artists/talent during recording.  In general, it is best to keep latency low during tracking and try to minimize the use of plugins during tracking to reduce load on the system.

Ground loops can be some of the most difficult problems to fix in the studio.  The recommended method of fixing a ground loop is through an isolation transformer or using a 'ground lift' IN THE AUDIO PATH.  FOR YOU OWN SAFETY, DO NOT LIFT THE POWER GROUND.  IF AN INTERNAL FAULT OCCURS WHILE THE POWER GROUND IS LIFTED THE CHASSIS MAY BECOME LIVE AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL VOLTAGES CAN BECOME PRESENT ON THE CHASSIS OF THE GEAR.

18fkq0,6,2013-02-13,Academic Suspension to Dean's List to Job at a Fortune 500 company,frenchybrown,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/18fkq0/academic_suspension_to_deans_list_to_job_at_a/,"I had a previous post this summer about my trip from academic suspension to dean's list [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/togf6/my_story_of_academic_suspension_to_deans_list/). 

But now I have an update:

I had committed to and signed a lease for this year, but had no plan to pay for it. I had unsuccessfully searched for internships during the year but failed on every single one, so this left me starting the summer with $500/month for rent and utilities and no way to pay for it. I went job searching like crazy, got a shitty job working for a paper mill making $8/hr and working 10+ hour days. I quickly decided this sucked and applied to and got a job at a Car Rental Company at the nearby airport. I had applied to a basic position but was promoted during the interview and I cannot stress enough how much of a blessing this job has been. I can't think of many college kids who have made just shy of $20,000 in about 8 months of my senior year, this allowed me to stay debt free for school and housing!

Once the fall semester opened I finally had basically had it with the drinking and not caring scene to the fullest and decided that I would not fail in getting a job before graduation, no exceptions. I immediately starting applying to jobs and going to information sessions, writing cover letters, sending follow up e-mails. I wasn't perfect and definitely missed many application deadlines and had to work during some info sessions, which was a downer, but by October I had 4 interviews lined up!

Now I was understandably nervous that my GPA would hurt me in these, but again, it didn't matter because I told myself I wouldn't fail. Meanwhile none of my friends were really even looking, they commented on but weren't really interested in me heading out suited up with portfolio in hand, I think they just thought I would fail and jobs weren't worth trying for.

Well first interview went awful, she asked a lot of questions I wasn't ready for, she had me scrambling to answer and honestly we both came to the conclusion that I was neither right for the job nor did I really want it, regardless it was a crushing blow. Next interview I knocked out of the park! I had the good fortune of interviewing with someone I had previously met at an info session and had talked to her and her boss for about 10 mins at the info session. Interview went great, I had excellent answers for everything they threw at me, but the dreaded question of GPA came up and while I feel I handled it well, no doubt that hurt me. Finally, my last two both went excellent. 

Over the next 2 weeks I got several e-mails about how it was so nice to meet me but there were other more qualified candidates and I was freaking out, but I got one second round at the company's corporate campus. Although I knew I couldn't fail, only having one option...especially after I thought I had done so well really scared me. The interview was an all day affair with several panels and even a test. But three weeks later in mid november, I got the best call in the world, $50k a year and now while everyone else is scrambling I can rest easy and count down the days.

Even right now, my friends who have no idea, lead or anything towards a job are out celebrating fat Tuesday while I do homework. So long story short, nothing beats perseverance, not your past or others thoughts, nothing.

I'm an economics major, so i like to put everything in those terms, so remember, everything you've ever failed at in your entire life is a ""sunk cost"" nothing you can do, will change or remove the time, effort and opportunities you've lost, so stop thinking about how they're holding you back and just don't take no for an answer.

Hope this hits home to some of you who were/are in my shoes. There was a point when I thought I blew it, but now I can sit back and relax, knowing that I turned things around. Nothing would make my day more than to help anyone out with any questions or advice on righting the ship or looking for jobs, I left out a lot of details on what I did. It was about 2 months of non-stop class, homework, work, applying for jobs, sleep and repeat it's not easy but it is possible."

18fegs,1,2013-02-12,Last Tuesday,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/18fegs/last_tuesday/,"	Harry woke up last Tuesday morning. This wasn't a particularly unusual event, as he had woken up every morning in a similar manner for thirty-five years. He had developed the habit of turning the alarm off several times before crawling out of bed, and Tuesday was no different. He stumbled to the bathroom, scratched his stubble and emptied his bladder. All typical morning activities. He made his coffee, smoked a cigarette, and thumbed through the paper. Nothing atypical.
	He took a shower and pondered his existence. While this may have been an ordinary action at other times, Harry had come to a new conclusion: his life was no longer worth living. 
	Harry was a thinker, and knew to take each thought with care. He kept this thought and studied it. There was validity to the thought. Harry's life was never really worth living; but, it wasn't really worth dieing for, either. He was typically caught in a penumbra of apathy.
	He finished his shower, and returned to his newspaper. Another school shooting. At a preschool, this time. The culprit was a war veteran. He unloaded his fully automatic assault rifle into the kids while they napped. The teachers were unharmed; they were fucking a few blocks away in a rented car.
	The shooter then walked down the street to a retirement home where he murdered three elderly women who were sitting on their porch. On Mondays, they liked to drink tea and knit. They found it quaint. The veteran found killing innocent people quaint. It takes all kinds.
	In his final act, the armed man walked into the main office and pulled the pin on a grenade. Twenty-five people died that day. Twelve children, ten adults, and three old ladies. But who's keeping a tally?
	Harry didn't finish the article. There had been another shooting a week ago. And another not too far beyond that. Harry had become numb to the slaughter. He grabbed his coat and drove to work, at a minor chemical manufacturer. He was a bench-chemist. He mostly cleaned glassware for people who stayed in school longer than him. But it was a job, thankless and hopeless.
	As Harry swirled a dilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate solution in an erlenmeyer flask, his earlier idea bubbled back into his brain. His life really wasn't worth living. The other people in the lab weren't particularly friendly. They all had families and friends and things to do. Harry often wished he had things to do.
	He wasn't an unattractive individual, but he wasn't attractive either. This enabled to go through life practically invisible. Most people never knew he was ever around. Even as a child, his family barely acknowledged his existence. He'd often have to walk home from practice or work or school simply because his parents had forgotten they had had three children.
	Once, Santa forgot about him on Christmas. He never forgave Santa. Another time, his family celebrated his birthday three weeks early. No one could remember when he was born.
	While he was studying chemistry, his parents divorced and remarried. His cousin had over-dosed on benzos. Three friends committed group suicide. His mother suffered a mental collapse and was beaten to death by her abusive meth-addicted second husband. His older brother got married, had children, and got a divorce. Harry didn't learn any of this until five years ago. It took his extended family over ten years to realize they hadn't told him.
	Harry didn't care much about his family. He was disowned by his father when he was sixteen because he smoked pot. 
	Harry knew he had a gun at home. He'd stick the barrel to the side of his head and throw in the towel.
	As Harry finished his work and walked to his car, a stranger followed him into the parking lot. When Harry unlocked his car, the individual stuck the barrel of his gun to his ribcage and demanded all of Harry's possessions. Clothes, car and all.
	Harry laughed. ""I'm going home to kill myself. Shoot me if you have to. You'll only hasten the process and preserve a shred of my dignity."" The man shot him in the abdomen and fled. A woman heard the blast and came over to investigate.
	She saw Harry slumped on the ground, next to his car. She called an ambulance. She walked  next to Harry as he groaned. He was bleeding, as one could expect. She sat down and held his head. She stroked his hair. She said everything was going to be okay. She told him her name was Maggie. Well, Margaret, actually, but that's the name her mother used to call her when she was in trouble. Maggie didn't like that name.
	The ambulance arrived and Maggie rode with him. She lied and said she was his wife. Harry had never even been in a relationship longer than a week. Easy come, easy go.
	Maggie waited with Harry until someone close to him showed up. She was sure he had someone who would care if he got shot. Doesn't everybody?
	Nobody came asking for Harry.
	She stayed overnight, and read out loud from the book she had on her. She loved reading books out loud. Still no one arrived looking for Harry.
	Luckily, the bullet had missed the vital parts of Harry, and he was in no mortal danger. He was wounded and sore, certainly, but a far cry from dead. He woke disoriented and vaguely coherent. 
	Harry wasn't a religious man, but he thought he had reached the equivalent of an after-life. He saw Maggie. An angel, certainly. The rising sun silhouetted her frizzed hair giving the illusion of a halo. Harry was glad to have seen her. Harry liked seeing beautiful things.
	""Where am I?"" He asked towards Maggie.
	""The hospital.""
	""Oh.""
	Harry relaxed into his bedding and closed his eyes. 
	""Is there anyone I should contact for you? I'm sure someone's worried sick about you.""
	""Nope. What you see is what you get.""
	Maggie moved next to Harry and held his hand. ""I'm Maggie. It's going to be okay.""
	Harry smiled. Maybe things were finally turning for the better. ""I've got to go to work. I'll be back this evening."" She left, and passed a medical school student on her way in.
	The medical school intern stared at a chart, then looked at the name on Harry's chart. 
        ""Harry is like Barry. It must just be a typo."" The intern thought to herself. She attached the I.V. line into Harry's arm.
	Harry died later that afternoon. He had a major allergic reaction to the penicillin that the intern had pumped into his arm. Easy come, easy go."

[Hey Burkie, how did you feel about JVR toe-dragging Luke Schenn last night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dumii?context=5)|I was out scouting the Beanpot last night. Had to find more talented young players to keep our playoff streak alive. 
[Why do you think hockey and soccer are the first two professional sports to create You Can Play videos? Is there something intrinsic to those sports that makes them more open to LGBT rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dujgb?context=5)|Hockey and soccer (in the US, at least) do seem to be leading the way on this issue. I think the international diversity of the leagues help (Canadians tend to be very gay friendly, for example). There's almost certainly a large number of socioeconomic factors at play as well. It's an unfortunate truth that minority groups (whether based on racial, religious, economic, etc) tend to have different attitudes towards the LGBT community. We've tried to emphasize adding LGBT people from those groups who can really target our outreach.
 |Esera Tuaolo, for example, is a gay ex-NFL player who is religious and also Samoan. He's helping us as Special Advisor on Faith and Religion, and will also help with outreach to the many Samoan NFLers out there. Wade Davis, another gay ex-NFL player, works at the Hendrick-Martin Institute, working with inner city LGBT youth. He has tremendous, tremendous insight into how to reach inner city athletes, and will help us on that front. 
[Thanks for doing this AMA and for your amazing work with YCP. I recently attended an Invisible Athlete Forum where you touched on the fact that you set up YCP as an 8 year project because you think that the work will be done in that amount of time or less (I hope you're right!\). Can you expand on how/why you picked that time frame? Do you think that homophobia in sports can ever truly be completely eliminated? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duxrj?context=5)|8 years is the amount of time it takes for a high school freshman to graduate college. That's why we picked that time frame. Give a kid who was getting out of the 8th grade in 2012 a full 8 years of YCP before he gets out of college.
 |It's never going to be completely eliminated. Like racism, sexism, or any -ism. Unfortunately hatred and ignorance will always be able to find a home. I firmly believe in 8 years it will largely be a non-issue, however. We will have openly gay athletes in every major male team sport, and it will be common place. Athletes coming out will be a non-story, and openly gay youth athletes will be drafted into pro leagues. At that point we'll have to re-visit YCP and see what we want to do.
 |I never had any intention of making this my life's work. I do this to honor my brother, and to try to do my best to do some of the work I think he might have done. I do this to give back to the LGBT community who was so good to my brother, and has been so good to our family. I do this because I love sports, and I want everyone to have the chance to experience the joy that I find in the game. I do this because kids are quitting, kids are being beaten up, and kids are dying from this. And I think I'm in a position where I have a story, a voice, a message, and a personality that lends well to being effective at reaching athletes. But my life before my brother's accident consisted of drinking beer, working out, watching hockey, and chasing women. I would very much like to fix this bullshit so I can get back to that. 
[Hey Patrick. Great cause. I love telling people about this project, especially when they inquire about my You Can Play tshirt.   There seems to be less of a stigma for female athletes who are out. I see that a big part of your poject has your message coming from male athletes. Is You Can Play more interested in getting the message out through male athletes or are you looking for female athletes to partnership with too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duk6k?context=5)|We've made female athletes a priority from the start. We're official partners with the CWHL (professional women's hockey), which was our first official league partnership. Our advisory board has many strong female voices. And we've made a priority to emphasize the voices of female athletes in our speaking engagements and videos. Our college videos prominently feature female allies and lesbian/bi/trans athletes. Too many people think it's a non-issue in women's sports, and it's really not. There's still a lot of work to be done. 
[Why is it so hard for athletes to come out of the closet ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud9i?context=5)|There's a variety of reasons. Some guys don't want to be first and have to deal with all the media attention. Some guys don't want to be a role model. Some guys just want to play sports and not be a ""Jackie Robinson"" for gay rights. Some are nervous about their teammates' reaction, or about their job security, or about the fan reaction. There's dozens of reasons that may keep a professional athlete closeted, but I think we're rapidly seeing those reasons disappear.
[Also, what's your new favourite NHL team now ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud9i?context=5)|I work for the Philadelphia Flyers. So, them. 
[Do you actually know gay NHLers ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dugks?context=5)|We have a no comment policy on that one. 
[If you're curious, Chris Kluwe is also a big Reddit user over in /r/nfl.  They say if you say his name three times, that he'll appear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvxcw?context=5)|I follow Chris on twitter and check in on him on Reddit at times. Really good guy. Funny as hell. 
[I know I've already asked a question, but I'd love it if you had some perspective on this for me: what's the best way to support a family member who's closeted?  It's still a secret to almost everyone, obviously, but I don't want him to feel like it's taboo either.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duk84?context=5)|Be respectful of them. Mind your language. Find ways to be LGBT-supportive. It's a tough line to walk, because every closeted LGBT person has their own journey they have to take before they come out, and it's not up to us to force it. 
[Hey Patrick, I'm a big supporter of the project. Have there been any NHL players who have refused to support the cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dudv0?context=5)|We have a no-comment policy on whether or not athletes respond. We do not want any athlete to ever feel pressured to participate. Same thing for the teams. We've been asked to endorse email campaigns or Change.org petitions, and we always refuse. I don't want athletes who were guilt tripped into this. I want athletes who are excited about it. 
[Do you think when sports teams receive negative publicity because a single player said he would not be comfortable with a gay teammate, that that response helps reinforce your message? Cam Jansen or that 49ers player who said he would not feel comfortable with a gay teammate come to mind.  What the hell is going on with the Capitals, and what do you think GMGM is going to do between now and the trade deadline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud40?context=5)|I think that the responses from the sports world towards comments like Cam's or Chris Culliver's illustrate how far we've come. Ten years ago, those comments would have been shrugged off with no response, or even endorsed by people. Now they're being critiqued and analyzed. It's very encouraging to see. 
[What should I tell people that are hateful towards homosexuals and attribute it to their religion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dufcq?context=5)|I wrote this in response to Torii Hunter's quotes about being uncomfortable around gay teammates because of his religion. Long story short, if you're trying to emulate Jesus, there's no justification for being an asshole to anyone.

[What's your favourite memory from your time in Vancouver with your Dad?  And, can you still recognize Henrik and Daniel after all these years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duj3i?context=5)|I could never tell Hank and Daniel apart. No one could. One of them had a chipped tooth for a while, and everyone was thrilled because they finally knew who was who.
 |I really loved Vancouver. I was there from 87-92, roughly. The best memory of that time was Gino Odjick scoring on a penalty shot against Calgary. To this day, that was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium. I'm pretty sure he injured himself celebrating. 
[Do you think the flack Tim Thomas received for not going to the White House with the Bruins hurt your cause at all?  The guy basically 'came out of the closet' as a right-wing conservative and a lot of people feel that it was a huge distraction to the team.  You've proven the players will support their team-mate, but do you feel that the media reaction (even if positive\) might be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dujpe?context=5)|No. Most professional athletes are conservative, politically. Tim's actions had no affect on what we were doing, it simply underscored why we never take on any political issues. They're too divisive. Why give a player an excuse not to join you? We don't endorse candidates, we don't campaign on issues, we don't say or do anything political. The most right-wing athlete in the world can feel just as comfortable working with YCP as the most left-wing athlete in the world.  
[Is the point of YCP more about tolerance or acceptance- because if it's just tolerance, that stance totally makes sense. If it is acceptance, are you working first towards tolerance and then acceptance?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dwt5i?context=5)|I'll take tolerance to start. Then we keep moving. If we could get every athlete in the world to say ""I'll support an openly gay teammate"" and eliminate homophobic slurs, (which would be the basics for ""tolerance""), I'd be pretty happy. 
[What do you think is the proper punishment for athletes who use homophobic slurs in a game? I feel like Kobe's punishment 2 years ago ($100,000\) was a bad idea just because the fine only teaches him not to use the words BUT not why not to use them. Do you feel that sports leagues need better punishments for those that use these slurs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dupit?context=5)|Education. I don't care at all if a player is fined, suspended, whatever, as long as there is mandatory, EFFECTIVE, education. Not just some token, bullshit gesture to make it all go away, but real work, with real LGBT athletes.
 |That said, there should be discipline. My feeling is that as long as the leagues are going to regulate what players can and cannot say in terms of racist/sexist comments, comments about officiating, comments about fans, comments about league officials, etc., then the LGBT community deserves that same protection. If the leagues ever wanted to say ""We no longer police anything our players say on or off the field, on any issue, at any time,"" I'd also support that. Because it would be entertainingly chaotic and a total disaster for everyone. 
[Would you like to see players start to police themselves in this regard--so that using a homophobic slur was a reason to drop the gloves even if it wasn't directed at you? How much do you think those slurs are accepted/shunned right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvv7x?context=5)|I have no doubt that will happen once the first players start coming out. Someone's going to say something stupid and get the crap beat out of them. 
[What steps do you take to get a team to take the pledge? Do they come to you or do you pitch it to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8due68?context=5)|Teams have generally come to us. The Toronto Marlies (AHL) originally reached out to us to have a speaker come in and address the team. So I went in alongside Scott Heggart, a gay goalie. We talked to the team for 30 minutes or so and then bounced out. Scott was amazing, as he always is. Afterward the team asked if they could do something more than just make a video. So, we drafted the Pledge for them. The Pirates and the Providence Bruins heard about it, and both called me asking for information. Now Hamilton is filming theirs for release soon. Wilkes-Barre, same thing. AHL teams are really excited about this. 
[You're a scout right?  Who would you take 1st overall in the 2013 draft if you had to decide right now?  What about 1st overall in the 2014 draft if you had to decide right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dumx4?context=5)|I'm a pro scout, so I don't do the amateur side of things. I haven't seen those top amateur guys. I would recommend trusting Bob McKenzie on that stuff though- he's pretty plugged in at the scouting level. 
[Hey Patrick, you're the president of You Can Play, you're going to law school, and you're a scout for the Flyers. That sounds like a ridiculous work load, how do you balance everything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dunq8?context=5)|I train for the Boston Marathon. Keeps me sane. We'll be making that a fundraiser soon, I think. 
[As a Hockey Enthusiast and fellow Runner trying to qualify for Boston (3:18:38, so close\), I'm glad to hear you raise money for this event!  I'd love to donate to your fundraiser when it comes up or (Even better\) run Boston for the cause!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvg2a?context=5)|I'm just trying to finish the stupid marathon. The first guy who ran this distance died, and then other people went ""I bet I wouldn't die doing that!"" It has to be the dumbest thing I've ever done while sober. 
[Have there been any times where you've had trouble recruiting a particular athlete or team to support the cause? If so, how did you handle it? Were you able to change their minds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duhju?context=5)|We've had overwhelming success recruiting athletes. It's reached the point with hockey players where we no longer really recruit guys- they just call me and ask how to get involved.  We have a pretty easy message- support any teammate that's good enough to help you win games. It's something that's very simple for athletes to understand and endorse. 
[Hey Burkie.  I know you've got a lot (all?\) of the AHL teams on board with the project, how long do you think it will be before you get an NHL team (officially\) on board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv5hs?context=5)|I think we can count some of the teams as officially on board at this point, even if they never signed anything. The Canucks marched in Vancouver Pride with me this summer, as an official team event (and my thanks again go to Manny Malhotra, Jason Garrison, and Fin, the mascot, for showing up). They had several players express support for YCP publicly, they ""dyed"" their rink purple for Spirit Day, and they recently did a feature story on a transgender goalie. The Leafs regularly run our PSAs in-arena and have been working behind the scenes on some LGBT outreach as well.  
[My question: there was  a scandal with the SF 49ers the week before the Superbowl, when it turned out that 2 of the 4 players who appeared in an ""It Gets Better"" video had no idea that it was to end bullying specifically of LGBT teens (because LGBT teens have a 3-4x higher rate of suicide than other teens, among other things\).  Their responses to a reporter's question indicated they may not have done the video if they had known it was targeted to LGBT teens.  The video was subsequently removed from the ""It Gets Better"" site.   Watching it, I can see that neither of the two make any reference to LGBT status; and I can well imagine that a team PR guy put them in front of a camera, had them read a sterile script, and they had no idea what the recording was for.  This made me feel like my rights are being used for sports PR, and that the people there don't really stand behind what they are saying.  It makes me question every single ""It Gets Better"" video, and also the ""You Can Play"" videos.  So: what re-assurance can you give that the players who appear in ""You Can Play"" project videos know that it is for gay players specifically, that they back that cause, and are not embarrassed about speaking for equality of gay players?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvhzt?context=5)|I spoke with every player that appeared in the original NHL videos and they were aware specifically what it was for and what it was about. In our first couple videos, we did not push the players to say the ""magic"" words- gay, LGBT, homophobic, etc. This allowed guys to get their feet wet a little bit and allow the league to be comfortable with the idea that NHL players were standing up for gay rights. Now we ensure that athletes are saying gay, or LGBT, or homophobic, or otherwise making a specific reference to the gay community in the videos. There's no doubt about what our athletes are appearing for. If you don't want to take my word for it, here's part 1 of a 3 part series of NHL athletes being quoted on YCP.
[I love the fact that Brooks Oprik is the NHL representative in commercials for YCPP.  Do you have any relationship with Brooks?  Keep doing what you're doing.  Great cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8ducqk?context=5)|Brooks is good friends with my brother-in-law Jared. When we approached NHLers, we already had Tommy Wingels and Andy Miele on board, but Brooks was the first non-Miami University guy to respond. He became a bit of a pied piper for us. I could go to other guys who might be hesitating or confused and say ""Brooks is doing one."" It helped a lot of guys realize they wouldn't be the only one out there talking about this. We've incredibly grateful to Brooks (and his lovely wife Erin!).
[Hi Patrick - firstly, Sorry about your loss. Brendan seemed like a truly wonderful person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvnug?context=5)|No. He had talked about doing some outreach, and had given a couple speeches, but the idea for the campaign had its genesis after the accident, in an article I wrote for Outsports.com.  Actually, what we had talked about was Brendan speaking on gay rights, and me speaking on mental health. I had a long bout with depression that I had to overcome, and we thought going into high schools and sharing our stories might be useful.  I put some of that aside in order to focus on YCP in his honor.
[Was YCP something you and Brendan had thrown around prior to his passing?  What has been the biggest hurdle you've faced as an organization? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvnug?context=5)|The biggest hurdle has been the political, turf war bullshit that goes on behind the scenes with fundraising, advocacy work, speaking opportunities, etc. I don't have the patience for the type of crap that goes on behind the scenes. I don't want to get famous, I don't want to throw parades, I don't get paid for any of this. I want to do the work. Put me and my speakers in front of athletes and let us do our thing. Someone else can take credit, I don't care. I'll be the GE Coors Light NBC Universal speaking bureau if people let me stop playing politics and let us do what we do best- real, effective, practical, outreach. 
[What is your position on transgendered athletes playing in their own gender (sorry, the terminology gets confusing for me\). That is, someone who is born a man but identifies female. They theoretically have a physical advantage playing in a women's league. Is that fair? How is this issue handled? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dxio1?context=5)|Good question. I'll give you a overly simple response, with the notation for anyone reading this that it is an overly simple and not at all in-depth look at trans issues. We recently added Christina Kahrl to our Advisory Board to help on trans issues.
 |First, since everyone only seems worried about male-to-female trans athletes, I'll say this: the hormones taken during the transition period mean that transitioning athletes are actually at a disadvantage within a few weeks of starting their transition. It's harder for them to recover, to retain muscle mass, and to be an elite athlete. This is not Ladybugs, where Johnathan Brandeis puts on a wig and is a women's soccer star. This is an intense, deeply personal, and physically trying medical and psychological procedure. The competitive argument simply doesn't hold water.
 |Second, are we really, really worried about this? I'm pretty competitive. I've been in fistfights over Monopoly games. I once broke up with a girlfriend of three years because she beat me in bowling. I was that kid in gym class who tried too hard. Let's say you came to me and said if you cut off my finger, I could win a Stanley Cup. I'm in. Now let's say you came to me and said you could cut off my dick, but I could win an Olympic Gold Medal in women's soccer. Do we really think there are elite athletes out there saying yes to this idea?
 |Trans athletes should be able to play their sport as their identifying gender. And they deserve our support to do so. 
[1\) Do you find certain sports are more receptive to talking about homophobia, admitting it's rampant, etc. than others.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|At the college level, every athlete listens and responds well to us, regardless of the sport.
[2\) Do you find certain areas of the world respond differently?  A baseball played from PR vs a hockey player from sweden?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|There are absolutely cultural differences for international players. We learned that with Yunel Escobar and his discussions with us about Cuban culture.
[3\) (multiquestion, sorry\) Has Moneyball changed hockey scouting at all?  Do you use advanced metrics, or is more your eyes than anything else.  I know in baseball there was a lot of pushback between what eyes were telling people and what computers were telling people.  How do you attack the game (other than being where the puck will be\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|I know some teams that use advanced stats, but unlike in baseball (where each individual play is a set event), the chaotic nature of hockey tends to limit their value. And the ones that I've looked at tend to do a poor job translating from CHL-AHL-NCAA to the NHL. In addition, our game is so emotional and based on passion, work ethic, and desire. Different players serve different roles on a team, and building a great NHL team for an 82 game NHL season and 25 game playoff run isn't as simple as finding 22 guys with great Corsi or whatever. 
[, thank you for your work with You Can Play. I'm also in law school so I can't imagine how busy you must be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv4rc?context=5)|There's some overlap, obviously, between LGBT issues and sexism issues. Pro sports definitely has a sexism problem, and it trickles down to lower levels. I'd support a charity that wants to take that on- I've got 4 sisters who I love more than anything. But it's not really what we're geared up for.
[My question: Do you have any plans to discuss sexism in pro sports? I'm a big sports fan (especially NHL hockey\) and I often find the sexism to be really frustrating. It's so normalized that most people don't seem to even question it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv4rc?context=5)|That said, we do our best to take stands on it when possible. We amplify voices of strong female athletes, media members, and front office members whenever possible. We try to do real work with women's sports leagues and groups. We've refused to work with certain pro athletes who have done some of the more egregious examples of sexism.  I'd love to see women get more opportunities in front offices, coaching staffs, scouting staffs, even media roles. But it's just not what we're built for. 
[Do you think the increasing acceptance of the You Can Play pledge by NCAA and AHL teams will help encourage NHL, NFL, and other major sporting league clubs to make their own organization wide commitments to YCP and LGBT rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duo6m?context=5)|I think that at the one-year mark we've shown that the other leagues can trust us, if they choose to. Things like the Pledge give teams an easy and effective way to hop on board. We've shown we can handle crisis situations like Yunel Escobar or Cam Janssen. We've shown we can handle the PR side of things, the fan relations side, the media side, and- by far the most important- the athlete side.  Addressing athletes isn't easy. You have to be a part of their community before they take you seriously. I've seen some LGBT speakers doing sports outreach who aren't sports people, and it drives me fucking crazy. Some aren't even fans! And you listen to them talk about sports and it sounds so forced and unnatural. They try to make jokes about sports related things, or talk about the locker room culture, and it's just...off. You have to be part of the culture before athletes will listen to you. And with the background our advisory board has, and with my background growing up around the game, athletes relate to our speakers. It's effective because they feel at home. 
[Congratulations on the great work with You Can Play!  During the last year, what defining moment made you realize people were really embracing the movement or that you had such a hard road ahead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dusqw?context=5)|The day we sent the emails out to every NHL GM. I was sitting there watching the emails go out one by one and was just thinking ""Holy crap...if this doesn't work, I'm going to be the laughing stock of the NHL."" There was no turning back, really. If the GMs backed us, we would be off and running. If they thought I was an idiot, I was going to have to try a new line of work. Thank god they backed us. 
[Just wanted to say thanks for all you have done. I have some friends in the LGBT community so this is a cause that hits close to home. I feel like the hockey community is the perfect sport for us to have our first openly gay athlete.  With comments like that of Chris Culliver in the NFL driving home how far the gap still is. Have you been in contact with the NFL or other leagues to try and get this initiative to the other big sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duqil?context=5)|We've spoken with every major professional sports league about getting involved. I think you'll see each league start picking how they want to do their involvement (whether through us, or GLAAD, or Athlete Ally, or StandUp, or GLSEN, or some combination of all of us).  I think the first hang-up we encountered was that the other leagues don't know me. So a 28 year old NHL scout who's still in law school walks into your league offices and says he can run all your LGBT outreach and education initiatives. When I did that with the NHL, our guys knew I wouldn't screw it up. When I did that with the other leagues, it was kind of ""Wait, who the hell are you again?""
[How'd you go about becoming a scout?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv5bw?context=5)|I started breaking down games with my Dad when I was like 6. When I was 12 I realized I wasn't good enough at hockey to be an NHLer. So I told my family I wanted to be a GM. I started to try to watch games as a scout and analyze players. When I got to college, my Dad put me on to help out in the midwest as a ""bird dog"". I got fifty bucks a game. So all through college I gave up my Friday and Saturday nights and went to watch games- ND, Michigan, Michigan State, Bowling Green mostly. I sent email reports to the chief scout for him to critique. I also spent time in the front office with the Capitals, working a bit with the coaching staff for the Portland Pirates when Kevin Dineen was there, and I spent a year with the New England Patriots as their chief legal intern. Long story short, I had an in because of my last name. That cracked the door open for me. Then I worked my ass off for the last decade to make sure I didn't waste any of that advantage. 
[Hey Mr. Burke, how do you personally feel when guys like Culliver from San Fran, and Torri Hunter from Los Angeles Angels (now Tigers I guess\) make homophobic remarks using the public platform.  I know you, or anyone, can't control this...but how do you feel it affects what you and others are setting out to try to accomplish?  And does it anger you, or do you just want to try to help those individuals get past their closed minded ignorant ways?  For my hockey specific question...do you agree with me that young d-men with potential are the trade chips in the league at the highest premium? And if you do agree, do you expect that to be consistent looking into the future? Or will there be a changing of the guard in that accord? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv2mf?context=5)|I get angry, I get annoyed, and then I move past that and start working on finding a positive outcome. Some players are actually homophobic. Most players are actually just uneducated or unfamiliar with the issue, so they say stupid things some times. As a group that works on educating those athletes, I can't hold grudges. I have to give the athlete the benefit of the doubt and work with him to talk him through the issue, then set him to work making things right. Anger is unproductive. I constantly try to remember the quote by Lincoln- ""I destroy my enemy by making him my friend.""
[Where/when did you decide ""I'm going to do something about this"" in regard to homophobia? Alot of people just ignore or complain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvr33?context=5)|My brother's wake.

We have too many guys who are loudmouth, cheap shot, dirty players and don't back it up. Too many guys in our game treat the linesmen like the Grinch with the Whos- they hear them coming and their heart grows three sizes.
 |Two ways to fix this. One is a modification on the instigator penalty to allow for guys like this to get the crap beat out of them. Almost certainly never going to happen. I'd like to see some sort of Cumulative Asshole Penalty. Right now guys have figured out they can be a little bit obnoxious after every whistle as long as no one act reaches the point of a penalty. I'd like to see referees empowered to give an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for actions that build up over the course of the game. Either that or hire slower linesmen.

Ducks, meanwhile, are ferocious as hell even at their size. And assuming, arguendo, that the duck retains the ability to fly for this fight, I can't imagine why anyone would ever choose to fight a horse sized duck.

I forget what day they go, but we've had tremendous buy-in from them.  2) No, because nothing we do contradicts any mainstream religious teachings. We don't do any work on things like marriage equality, for example. All we ask is for athletes to say they will treat their teammates with respect whether they're LGBT or straight. Kind of tough for religious groups to argue with that. We also make sure we are always, always treating religion with respect. We recently added Esera Tuaolo as Special Adviser on Faith and Religion to make sure that we are respectful and inclusive of the many Christian athletes out there.

18ewz9,38,2013-02-12,"Well 2X, she's pregnant.  We probably won't keep it.  How can I support her through this? [long]",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ewz9/well_2x_shes_pregnant_we_probably_wont_keep_it/,"My wife and I eloped last Friday. Her period was supposed to happen right around our wedding day. It didn't come. She kept thinking it would come any day now, since she'd had some spotting. She picked up a pregnancy test just to ease her mind.

She walked out of the bathroom white as a sheet. I immediately knew I couldn't freak out.

""We're pregnant?"" I asked her, seriously.

""I... I didn't think it was really possible.""

She walked over to the counter in our kitchen and sat there. She started to cry and tremble. She was totally unprepared for this. I tried to comfort her as best I could. I told her that I loved her no matter what, that we would get through this together, and that no matter what, it would be okay.

She wanted to use the other test in the pack (came with 2), so I got her a glass of water. Her hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the glass. I made her something to eat since we'd just gotten home and we sat down and ate for about 10 minutes.

I came over to where she was sitting on the couch and rubbed her feet while we talked to try to keep her calm. She told me that she felt like this was the worst possible time. She's in her last semester of graduate school, and there's no way she'd ever get a job if she was pregnant. My income can't support 3. We struggle with just 2 people. She told me she wanted a family, she wanted to have children, but this didn't seem like the right time. She wanted a career too.

I told her that I agreed. She has a fantastic job, a fantastic internship, and her degree is really valuable. I told her that I wanted a family too, but maybe this was the wrong time.

My family has always disliked her, and she started crying again when she thought of when we'd tell them about the pregnancy. My father has made *horrible* comments about her (she's trying to trap you with a baby, she just wants to get married and take all your money, she's low-class trash). I can't even imagine the smug satisfaction they'd put on us if they found out we eloped and she was pregnant. It was just one more thing that upset her.

I want to stand by her, but I don't know what she's going through. She wants us to make this decision together, and she's conflicted about what she wants. She had a miscarriage a few years into our relationship. We had broken up at the time, and she never told me she was pregnant until it happened. She's scared that she's getting older (28) and won't be able to have children. Maybe it will never be a good time start a family and we should just do it?

I would deal with it if she wanted to keep it, but I think this is the worst possible timing for us. I'd get another job, find a better job, something. I'd make it okay. I don't want to tell her what to do with her body. She wants to make the decision together, and since she's of mixed mind and I think we should get an abortion, she's said that she'll probably get the abortion. She doesn't want to ""force you into that situation.""

I feel horrible. I feel like I've bullied her into giving up her control over her body. I don't want to make the decision for her, and I feel like that's what I'm doing.

She took the second test and it was positive as well. She's going to get an appointment with a doctor ASAP to get a blood test and confirm, then look into appointments with the local women's clinic for an abortion.

I simultaneously want to cry, punch the wall, and hug her. I love her so much, and I want to support her every step of the way. I feel like I don't understand what she's going through. What can I do to help her? What can I do to make her feel supported in this decision?

**tl;dr: Oh shit, she's pregnant. Probably going to get an abortion. How can I support her while we deal with this?**

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the comments. I really don't think I have the strength right now to respond to everyone, but waking up to this helped a lot. We're going to get through this. I'm just freaking out in my own way.

**Edit 2:** Dropped her off at work. She cried in the car and apparently didn't sleep a wink last night. I spent ten minutes sobbing in my car outside of work once it all caught up to me. Today is off to a stellar start. I feel unimaginably terrible."

I currently live in New England and have been to NY plenty of times before. I graduated from college this past May.

I don't have a job yet, but I have a paid internship lined up right in the financial district.

I need to find a place and was hoping if any fellow redditors could offer any advice. I'm currently using Craigslist, but was looking into other alternatives as well. I have friends in the area, but none who are looking for housing. So I am looking for randoms or a one bedroom place.

I'm a pretty active guy, like to go out to bars and such on Weekends. Love going to sporting events and anything of that nature.

Does anyone have any areas and websites they could recommend to help me on my search? I have a budget of $1,200 a month at most. I'd also like to be within a reasonable commute from Manhattan (If I can't find anything there) as that is where I hope to be working.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I'm a Business student concentrating in Information Systems and Computer Science at a fairly well known Top 30 University.
I haven't had an internship before and this is my last summer before graduating. As it stands I have two options.

1) A position in the Technology division of an Investment Bank doing software development. My title would be that of an Analyst, and I'd be in the same New England city as my school which would be nice.

2) A position in Miami in the IT division of a Fortune 100 company, in a group overseeing the international IT operations of its foreign subsidiaries. The role would be more about strategy, and management. It's also paying 50% more than at the Investment Bank. That said, although it's closer to home, and I have some family there, I don't really have any friends in the area. Although I considered maybe going there after Graduation because of the more agreeable weather.

I know career advice is difficult to dispense without my career goals, so here it goes:

Long term I would like to open my own business (leveraging software and technology) back in my homecountry, or aim to be CIO of some company. I enjoy business problems more than I do coding. I enjoy development and programming and I'm pretty good relative to my peers, but I feel I'm not as good as other people out there and I don't see myself ever being ""top of my field"". I always considered Project Management to be my eventual destination, and coding as more of a step in that direction.

I've been leaning towards the bank despite this though, just because i feel an Investment Banking internship is more prestigious, and I feel I can leverage that better in the future.

Any thoughts?"

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it.

The first time was when I was 20 and was living in a new city. I didn't have any friends yet and tended to self-isolate, which led to pretty severe depression. I came out of it for a while once I moved back home, but then underwent some major stress (working 3 jobs, finishing my degree) about a year later, and experienced major anxiety/depression again. 

After barely finishing school (I was a straight A student until the final semester, where I missed classes/assignments and bullshitted my way into good grades, I decided to take some time off at the advice of a counsellor, live off my savings for a while (Canadian here, apologies to student loan sufferers). I made lifestyle changes. I have always been healthy, but I cut out sugar from my diet, taking supplements, forcing myself outside every day and started exercising A LOT (I found 1 hour a day minimum basically eliminated my anxiety). 

I got a great internship, which led to a 1 year contract in an extremely competitive career. I felt like everything was okay, but recently I've been unemployed and I've realized that I may have just been masking my depression with being busy. 

I'm now more depressed than ever and have decided to completely cut out all alcohol (was never a heavy drinker), start taking medication (Cipralex), and seeing a psychiatrist.

Does anyone else feel frustrated with having to tightly control many aspects of their lives just to prevent relapse?"

I'm a college student doing my internship at Palmer Drug Abuse Program (PDAP) in South Texas. It's a non-profit organization that gives free substance abuse counseling (group and individual) to people ages 12 and up, and their families. But we don't do just that, we also give our clients a drug-free environment where they can come and hang out without worrying about getting pressured to use from friends and family or having the temptation. On Friday and Saturday nights we have activities like bowling, volleyball, or BBQ. We try to promote a positive environment and keep our clients clean from drugs/alcohol. I've learned so much from being there and interacting with different people. You'd be surprised at how addicts come in all shapes and sizes. I'm proud to be working with this organization and I hope Reddit can help donate to this cause. There is a camping trip PDAP takes every Spring Break to get the youth and young adults away from the partying that goes on in our area. We're 15 minutes away from Mexico and an hour from South Padre Island. It's crazy how much drinking and using happens during this one week. So this camping trip is a life-saver for some of our clients. During the four days we're out there, we do different activities like hiking, swimming, canoeing, football, or just sitting around the fire at night talking. Most of these kids come from single-parent homes that are low-income and can only bring themselves on this trip. So we try to provide the food, van, accommodations, activities, and gas that it takes. And it takes a good amount of money. We have some, but since it's non-profit (which means little money for trips), we don't have enough. We need at least $2,000 to make this trip possible. Please help us out Reddit! I know you guys love good causes and this is something I hope you can get behind. Even if you don't have any money to donate, thanks for reading my long post. Maybe when you do have extra funds one day, you'll remember this and donate to future PDAP causes.

My significant other of two years and I broke up recently, and now I'm devastated, disoriented, and in a catatonic-like state. But this is not your typical post-breakup depression.  

Before I met him, I had been struggling with depression and anxiety related to a chronic pain disorder I've suffered from since 2004. Threatening to derail the completion of my undergraduate degree, I doubled down on my studies and eventually graduated. At the age of 22, I moved to a new city to try to start a career. I eventually landed an internship, and eventually, was offered a permanent position. I've been stuck, spinning my wheels, ever since. I'm still at the same, miserable job over five years later. 

I won't elaborate too much on my health condition. Honestly, what it's labeled as is irrelevant, and I am not looking for sympathy. I no longer obsess over finding a cure that clearly doesn't exist, and I've long since stopped going to doctors, besides routine check-ups once a year. But I suffer from unrelenting chronic pain in my neck, shoulders, hands, back, and feet. I have a constant headache that never truly goes away- just vacillates in intensity. My eyes always burn. My skin always hurts. My ears ring loudly, constantly. I cannot really sleep- I wake up dozens of times in the middle of the night. I have good days and bad. And until now, I've had the strength to carry on. 

I had tried dating in the past, but nothing really came out of it. I was also a late-bloomer- I came late in college and had only been dating for a few years. A few dates here and there, a few summer flings. Nobody I had truly loved. I didn't think it was possible. Loving me would be a bad investment for anybody, I thought. You know, damaged goods. Sure, I'll hook-up with someone every now and then, but for me, a longterm relationship was just not in the cards, right?

When I met him two and a half years ago, I was in a very dark place. I had been invited by a friend to a dinner party, and begrudgingly went. Once there, I saw him. Our eyes met, and by the end of the night, I knew that I had found somebody special.

Shortly after, we started dating. Things progressed quickly. But I knew it would not be forever- he would find out about my health problems and they would quickly obstruct our relationship. After a couple months, I broke down and told him about my problems. He said he understood and was shocked that I feared he would leave because of them. It seemed like I finally found a person willing to give me a chance. I was the happiest I had been in years. 

For a while, things were amazing. We hung out often- constantly on weekends, laughed, cried, travelled around the country, attended music festivals, ate at every restaurant in the city, and loved each other. But things started to unravel last year. Aspects of his personality started to become unattractive, and eventually, I even lost most of my physical attraction to him. He would also become easily annoyed at me. Our time together felt increasingly monotonous and tedious. We both knew the end was near, but I was afraid to let go. 

The end was a few weeks ago, and I'm still trying to pick up the pieces. I never thought a mutual break-up could ever hurt so badly. The only things getting me through the days are Jameson and Xanax. Almost every night, he haunts my dreams, and when I am sleeping, we are still together. When I wake up in the morning, a jagged knife stabs me in the stomach and I remember that he is no longer by my side. I am alone. 

You might think, well, you got along okay before him, so you'll get through this as well. But now things are different. I now know what I had, what I've lost, and it's something that I most likely won't ever have again. Even though I had been looking for an out in the deteriorating relationship for the past few months, I am now dealing with feelings of self-hatred for my part in the failure of the relationship.  

Now, I have nothing. I have alienated most of my friends, as I made the rookie mistake of letting the few friendships I had fade while I spent most of my free time with him and befriended all of his friends - and now they're gone, too. 

I was shown what life could be- that I could be happy, even with my chronic health problems - and now it's all abruptly gone. 

I'm not sure what the point of writing this is, possibly someone can offer some perspective that I haven't thought of. But I feel that my days are numbered, and I can only keep pulling myself out of bed for so much longer. I have the tools to do this, and at this point, it's really only my pride (and not wanting to hurt my family) that's keeping me alive. I feel like that won't sustain me for very much longer. 

Thanks for reading, I know it's an essay. "
18hmdt,28,2013-02-13,"Skeptic geek's corner: ""Tell Me Pink or Blue"" early fetal gender test",babytummyMD,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/18hmdt/skeptic_geeks_corner_tell_me_pink_or_blue_early/,"If you've considered doing one of those mail-in blood tests to detect fetal gender, you may be interested in what I found out about the ""Tell Me Pink or Blue"" test by Consumer Genetics Inc. (tellmepinkorblue.com). Warning, wall of text! I'll stick the **TL;DR up here: buyer beware!**


Quick facts about the test if you're not familiar:

* TMPOB purports to detect fetal gender by looking for the Y-chromosome from fetal blood within a small, pinprick sample of maternal blood.
* It's been known since 1997 that ""cell free"" fetal DNA is present in the mother's blood and can be analyzed for chromosomal defects - this is the basis of the Maternit21 test.
* With TMPOB, you order a kit with some lancets and band-aids, perform the test at home and mail it in to the lab in California. It costs between $170 - $330 for the test depending on the shipping/processing speed you select. The marketing materials claim 95% accuracy and detection as early as 7 weeks.

I was curious about TMPOB because 1) I'm impatient for my anatomy scan, and 2) it's a scammy-looking website, yet their story kind of checks out. Cell-free fetal DNA analysis is a real thing. They also provide a lot of info about their laboratory and offer a money-back guarantee.

Sooo ... I just spent a crap-ton of time researching this company, the people it claims are its management, their location, their accuracy claims, etc.

Here's what I found out. Add up all these facts and see what you get:

* The most damning evidence: Consumer Genetics Inc. has an ""F"" rating with the BBB and is not accredited by the BBB, after failing to respond to 21 of 22 consumer complaints. The home kit isn't sold on Amazon anymore, but old customer reviews claim they had to make multiple refund requests and were given false information about the whereabouts of their refund check. All of the positive customer reviews come from Amazon accounts which have no other reviews.
* Consumer Genetics Inc. recruiting materials found online (such as http://www.consumergenetics.com/pdfs/FTInternshipGuidelines051607.pdf), plus some LinkedIn profiles of former employees, seem to indicate there is actually lab work being done that involves purifying samples and PCR reactions, which fits with their explanation of the lab process (http://www.consumergenetics.com/pdfs/CG-POB-Publication-Oct-2008.pdf). So, maybe they aren't just throwing your blood sample into the trash. The fact that 3-month interns are the ones conducting the tests may not exactly set you at ease.
* Mail-in genetic tests like these are unregulated by the FDA or FTC. Additionally, the consent form you file which is supposedly in place to prevent gender selection abortions also relieves Consumer Genetics of any liability for damages to ""yourself or anyone else"" as a result of the test.
* From geneticsandsociety.org: ""Italian researchers published a study in 2005 demonstrating that they could correctly identify 98.7% of boys and 100% of girls by looking for male DNA in maternal blood drawn during the first trimester. But their method required a relatively large blood sample -- 10 milliliters -- that was processed within a few hours. The [direct to consumer] companies, in contrast, require just three to 10 drops of dried blood, which can take days to arrive through the mail."" By requesting a dried blood sample on a flat card, TMPOB avoids the challenge and expense of meeting mailing requirements for biohazardous material. 
* Consumer Genetics has been selling this service since about 2006. The study and article it cites on using cell-free fetal DNA to detect gender came out in 2011.
* The Consumer Genetics personnel listed on their site may not actually work there. For example, Terry Carmichael is variously listed as the Executive Vice President, Vice President of Marketing &amp; Sales, member of the Board of Directors ... and on his own LinkedIn profile, as having no connection with Consumer Genetics at all. Could be just various versions of the truth, but the stockpile of PhDs and MSs named by the company in contrast to the reported business size *kinda* points to some tenuous connections.

I'd be curious to know what any of you science-y types deduce, but just as a consumer and online researcher, I'd say TMPOB smells rotten.

**Edit/update:** I contacted Fair Oaks Women's Health, the clinic that helped TMPOB run their accuracy trial. A physician there confirmed they tested 20 specimens and TMPOB accurately predicted gender for 19 of them. The TMPOB literature cites a survey where they tested 31 samples -- 4 (13%) were inconclusive, 26 were accurate, 1 was inaccurate. Neither study confirms that they used dried blood samples taken more than 24 hours prior, like they do for customers. My own Scooby sense feels that they could easily turn an inconclusive into a fake result just to avoid sending out and performing a re-test.

**UPDATE 2:** I ordered a kit for myself before I did all this research. Frowny face. My experience so far? Did not send me an email with credit charge receipt, as they stated they would. Did not send email saying my test results were available. Did not respond to on-site customer service request. Customer service number is busy and has no voicemail/phone tree. I'm now emailing an address I found on the site (probably a slush pile) plus the CEO's email address. We'll see if anyone responds."

I hope I'm not viewed as selfish for posting and not actively supporting you all. But I had a really rough day and I just needed to share it with people who might understand.

I've been struggling with PTSD since 2008. I was on antidepressants and xanax and ambien for a really long time until I got fed up with my antidepressants and decided to at least try to get off them. Anyway, long story short, it took me 2 years but after a lot of therapy, diet changes and exercise I've pretty much been the antidepressants, only have to take xanax and ambien very little. Not to say that I still don't have panic attacks, or nightmares or sleepless nights, I've just learned to deal with them differently and I feel so much better without the medication.

Anyway, today I had to stay home from my internship because someone was going to come and shut our gas on and if I didn't we'd be without gas for a week. I had all these plans to be productive and clean and finish some internship work and read and make the best of my day at home. A couple of hours into the morning I wasn't feeling all that great. I was anxious about doing my work, because I struggle with being an absolute failure (does anybody else experience this?). I've had HUGE confidence issues since the accidents. I doubt myself at every turn. After they finally got here to activate the gas, it started getting windy and that is one of my triggers and I was overwhelmed with a horrible panic attack that essentially rendered me useless. I was a mess and I was beating myself up for not being able to deal with it like I have in the past and I finally decided to take some xanax and crawl into bed. Within 20 minutes I was asleep and that was over 4 hours ago. 

I just woke up and though I physically feel a lot better, I kinda feel like a failure for a day wasted and not being able to handle my shit.

That's all. Sorry about the wall of text of a rant.

TL;DR: Had a massive panic attack. Took xanax for the first time in months. Passed out for several hours. Feel like a failure for a wasted day and not doing what I needed/wanted to to keep working on my career and life. "
18lovx,5,2013-02-15,I (20M) feel like my girlfriend (20F) is totally apathetic.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18lovx/i_20m_feel_like_my_girlfriend_20f_is_totally/,"Yesterday was Valentines Day, obviously. Let me take you through the day. Me(20M), her(20F)

We live in separate college towns but were both coming home for VD. I posted a cute picture of us on her wall with a cheesy ""happy valentines day see you soon etc etc"" post on her FB wall. She gets on facebook, messages me, comments on a few things, and doesn't even like it, although 10-20 other people had. We were messaging back and forth and eventually I just said ""Chu don't like my post I worked so hard on???"" (trying to be cute, haha whatever), which then she liked it without responding to me. I know this is small, but the fact that she saw it and was totally apathetic kind of bugged me.

We get home a few hours later, both happy, and I give her ~$100 necklace and ~$50 flowers, as I had just gotten an internship so I wanted to do something a little extra special. After making everything look cute, I went over to her house to give it to her. When I got there, she said thank you and her mom had made me cookies and snacks to take back with me. She said she got me a card but hadn't written in it yet. I think ""this is fine, it was a busy week for her, whatever."" Then she offers to pay for a concert for someone I've never heard of that she wants to see. I say ""OK"" but I'll just end up paying for it anyways.

Then the worst part happens. We're laying in bed just watching youtube videos or something because it was late and we were tired, and I try to kiss her but she kept making silly faces or backing away. She then says ""All you ever want is kisses."" Although it's obvious she means sex. Now, we haven't had sex in months although we spent all winter break forever. Needless to say, I'm a little peeved because I already feel like if I was only here for sex, I wouldn't be here. And we've had this conversation before, I could have sex every day and she could go her whole life without it. So I say ""Because we never do anything anymore"" To which she replies ""I can make it never.""

I didn't say anything, but this has really been bugging me. I feel like she knows she has all the power and really doesn't care what happens to us. She seems totally apathetic to our relationship, unless I get on her nerves. Then she yells at me and ignores me. And she knows that she can 'reward' me with sex if I do something good.

Am I exaggerating? Making something up that isn't there? Thanks all.


**tldr**; I say ""We never have sex."" She says ""I can make it never."" and generally acts uninterested in our relationship."

18lk4c,1,2013-02-15,Review my SoP? &lt;3,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/18lk4c/review_my_sop_3/,"/***

this is my first draft for my computational linguistics masters application, its due march 1st and I'm in dire need of more eyeballs so I would greatly appreciate some reviewage. If anyone wants to trade statements for me to review just let me know.

I expect to make a lot of changes so don't be afraid to tear me down.

***/

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.

My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers.  Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.

My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.

So far my academic studies have only covered Linguistics and Computer Science separately, but I am most interested in the intersection of these two fields. In order to learn more about natural language processing, I recently began an internship with the developers of an iPhone application called Nuiku. The application acts as a virtual sales assistant, managing sales data through a natural language user interface. Helping to test the Nuiku natural language processing engine has opened my eyes to the immense potential Computational Linguistics has for practical applications. I am particularly interested in ways that natural language processing can improve search engines. Search engines serve as mediators between the user and all of the wealth of information on the internet. The large scale implementation of semantic categorization and information extraction will one day revolutionize the way we interact with information. This is one of the many ways in which natural language processing has the potential to empower users of the internet with better access to more useful information. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power. It is my dream to apply my practical problem solving skills to empower the average person with better access to the wealth of knowledge on the internet. I will do this through a career in natural language processing.

The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program is the ideal means for me to achieve my career goal. No other program places the same level of importance on preparing its students for the challenges they will face in the industry. The curriculum promises to provide me with the knowledge base, practical experience, and relevant relationships necessary for success in my career.

/***

Some specific questions:

1. How can I improve my intro/conclusion? Right now they feel very generic and my conclusion doesn't really do any concluding
2. Does the rubik's cube analogy help me at all or am I wasting my time? At first I tried writing it like an anecdote about my first experience with a rubik's cube but it was long and flowery and didn't seem like it fit in this paper. Same question for my lame attempt to show how much I loved my programming assignments.

18lfda,3,2013-02-15,[critique] Hi Reddit! How can my wife improve her university application essay?,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18lfda/critique_hi_reddit_how_can_my_wife_improve_her/,"So my wife would love some feedback on this but I'm not a great writer. If any of you would like to lend a hand I'd love to buy the most helpful of you a cup of coffee (paypal) as a thank you for your invaluable generosity. We needed to cover a wide list of topics within 700-1000 words and decided to take a story approach instead of the awful My family history is... My challenges are... I hope to one day... 

So with that in mind, here it is.


	When I was 10, I remember opening my eyes at three one morning to sounds of my mother cleaning the house for her first day in business. As I matured I understood the depth of her immigrant success story. Sacrificing for what all parents want to give their children -a life with opportunities she didn’t grow up with. Today, I’m the first in my family attending college and I owe her so much gratitude. This alone is enough to remind me to smile as I write. She, however, is not the only person that made a major impact in my first years in college. 
 
	In elementary school I met the wonderful boy named Chris I’d marry one day: it just took us a decade to find out. During our first year together we could barely make ends meet, so I decided to work in a restaurant to help. Night after night I came home, often frustrated and unfulfilled. I felt I let my myself down. To my surprise though, this didn’t turn out to be a complete waste of my time. The real world helped me mature as I learned about myself and the value of a tertiary education. I also became aware of my avoidance of embarrassments through self limitations. One day as I vented about work with Chris he said something that I wish never to forget. “I would rather see you fail reaching what you love than watch you succeed somewhere where you will never meet your potential.” These words still echo in my head today.

	That’s when I let go of the fear and doubt that held me back for years. I understood then that courage and resiliency is what separates the doers from the dreamers. In 2010 I enrolled into the University of Central Arkansas while still working part time. Once I did, I finally understood where I belonged. Some nights were unimaginably stressful and I’ve pulled through some long night shifts followed by studying marathons for exams the morning after. I suppose it’s that same determination I saw in my mother, when I was a child, that kept me strong through the times I thought “I can’t possibly absorb another ounce of knowledge today.” I’ve worked restlessly to earn my 3.8 GPA and I’m proud of it because I can say I’ve given it my every bit of effort in me. Luckily this didn’t last long, Chris was soon promoted and I left my job to dedicate all my focus to school. Then, came another surprise. The military gave us orders to move to Washington in 2011.

	The move was a welcomed gift; full of exciting new opportunities including the search for a new school, however, the switch from UCA to TCC gave me a different list of available majors though so I was back to the drawing board. First I felt a medical field was the answer since it seems like an purposeful aspiration but I felt no emotional connection there. I wasn't thrilled about working in a medical field, but the more I grew and learned, I noticed my affinity for numbers, their rules, and systems. I was intrigued by the constant truth in the world of math where nothing is left to subjectivity. I had found my third love in life, and that's when I had an epiphany that connected it all. If my mother became a successful entrepreneur, alone and without a single day of business school; what couldn’t I achieve with an amazing education? That’s when I knew exactly what I wanted to major in and in life; a business degree with a focus in finance to open a commercial photography studio within a year of graduating. The perfect way to combine my talents with my husband’s.

	I want to attend UWT’s Milgard School of Business because I want to know I did everything I possibly could to reach my full potential. At TCC I’ve built my foundation very seriously to prepare for what I’ve heard is a challenging transition. I’m ready to embrace the test of pursuing a finance major with open arms with what can only be described as an unusual enjoyment for math. That however is not the sole reason for choosing UWT. I want to make a positive meaningful change in the lives of young adults who understand poverty first hand. One thing I love about this school are its ties to the community. Within ten years, I want to develop a scholarship for young creative entrepreneurs as well as an internship program. I wish is to one day help others find their dreams because I don’t believe there’re are already too many kind when it comes to helping students reach their potential. As my mother became a first-generation, immigrant, business woman, and as my husband bravely serves in the military, I will prepare for the day when I too can pay it forward.

	Life full of uncertainties, but I’ve come to be sure of a few things in mine. Two of those certainties are my wish to building a successful business with a strong financial structure and developing a community benefiting foundation to encourage new generations of entrepreneurs. It’s beautiful to remember that all this started from an idea of becoming more. Some see decisions as the end of choices but I prefer to see this a the beginning of perfecting. The masters of art earned that title through countless hours of commitment to their craft. Giving your daily effort to work you find meaningful is one of the most rewarding acts we can be a part of and if you travel through life with an unwavering purpose nothing can stop you. Thanks to my loved ones and those who have believed in me, I’ve found my purpose and with it I plan to fuel my success through my years in UWT and beyond.

**Prompt**: In an essay of 300 words or fewer (approximately 1950 characters with spaces), write about your goals for your time at Queen's University and beyond. Your answer will be evaluated for content and writing style.

**Essay**

Pursuing new knowledge and experience in my area of interest has always been an important goal of my life. I feel that the opportunities and resources offered by Queen’s University will allow me to develop new skills and fulfill my lifelong goals. The diverse student body, outstanding professors and the exceptional campus and facilities all contribute to the great appeal of the University to many students, myself included. I believe that Queen’s would be a great fit for my aspirations.

My desire to pursue a career in the computing industry stems from my great interest of the increasingly prevalent technology sector. My interest has lead me to do much independant learning and I would like to continue that learning at a world class institution such as Queen’s. In the next four years of my life I would like to receive the best education possible. The Queen’s computing program would help me achieve that. My goal is to not only achieve high academic grades but also gain valuable experience that will benefit me in the future. The Queen’s Undergraduate Internship Program, a program unique to Queen’s,  is a opportunity I am looking forward to. This program will allow me to gain the practical experience and skills that I will apply in my future career.

I consider post-secondary education to be one of the most important steps of my life and I hope that I can have the privilege of furthering my education at Queen’s."
18l5ba,8,2013-02-15,Sort of just came to the conclusion that my Uni's Software engineering course sucks. Or are they all like this?,bustyLaserCannon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/18l5ba/sort_of_just_came_to_the_conclusion_that_my_unis/,"I'm in my 3rd (out of 4) year of a Software Engineering degree in a fairly large University in London.

I'm currently in a work placement creating software for a few more months until I return to do my final year and one of the people I work with graduated from my University. He had plenty of previous programming experience where as I had none. 

Now being at this company, i've been asked to do things (programming-wise) which they expected me to know how to do. And after a few months here, i'm realising they barely taught me shit at University. 

The only OO language taught was a one year module in Java, and a few other bits of MySQL, Prolog, PHP, basic web dev and I have an optional C++ module I can pick next year which I will. There's also the choice of a Haskell module (any good?) and some other bits I can pick. Things like data-structures and algorithms were taught but there was nothing low-level, nothing practical, not a lot of programming, it just seemed very vanilla. 

That might help but I know for a fact that my software engineering course has less programming involved than the Computer Science course. I'm just disappointed to be honest, and wondering what I could do to 'catch up' on people that had a better CS course.

I also feel sorry for the people from my course that didn't get a placement and went straight into the final year as without the experience i'm picking up from this internship, I would've gone into my final year as a pretty shitty programmer.


Are all courses like this Reddit? Or does mine just suck? If it does, what can I do to put me on level terms?"
18kn59,2,2013-02-15,I am useless and I will never get a job.,littlelovies,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18kn59/i_am_useless_and_i_will_never_get_a_job/,"I am a 20 year old girl who's never had a real job.  
 

Last summer I applied for a job as a waitress at a resturant. I was going to try out for the job and I was nervous but not scared. I thought it was gonna go okay, maybe I would even get the job. 
I got there before they opened and was told to do little tasks such as cut bread, dry off wineglasses, set the tables and such. Everything went fine up til when the guests arrived.   
  
 
For example I was told to try and learn the numbers of the tables. There was a picture on the computer over the resturant and which number the tables were. I have a really hard time remebering and even getting stuff like this to stay in my head so it didn't go so well.  

Then I was told to put the knifes and forks on a table with 2 persons. I was told to put them in order, like salad, meat and so on. As I said, I have a hard time remembering things so I did it wrong. I was told to go do it again, and it took 3 times of me running back and forth to the couple and the table to rearrange their silwerface before I got it right.
  
   
Later I went around the tables refilling everyones water. I spilled a bit at one table and didn't even think to go get napkins to dry it up. Wtf brain? It wasn't before the guy at the table waved at me and pointed at the wet spot on the table that I went to dry it up. I apologized and felt so stupid and embarressed.  
  

Then, I was going to put some silverware at a table. Everything went fine until I knocked over the lady at the tables wineglass, over her blouse. I freaked out and said I was sorry a million times and went to go get napkins. The manager was talking to her and I proceeded to tell her how sorry I was. She was a sweetheart about it and said it was okay.
I had to go into the back and just stand there for a minute. I felt so fucking ashamed and was considering going home. I felt like I was gonna start crying but I held it together. I wasn't going to give up. The manager just told me it wasn't a big deal, this things happen. And I guess they do, but on my first day? I didn't even dare look him or the lady in the eyes for the rest of the evening.  
  

The rest of the evening I just walked around clearing tables. I was told to serve a table but the plates were to hot so I just couldn't do it. I would have dropped them. For everyone else it seemed to go like clockwork.  
   

At 22 at night I was told I could go home. Didn't hear from the resturant again. Felt like a failure. I cringe whenever I think about it and it's even hard writing about it.  
 

Another example is when I was an intern at a store some years ago. I was going to be the cashier while the guy working there was in the back, and he explained how it worked. I have always been bad at math, but he told me it didn't matter and that I just had to let the machine to the work. First customer arrived and I had completly forgot how it worked. I had to go get him and ask for help.  
  

It's not that I go in to jobs thinking I will fail, I am always feeling positive and thinking I can do it. But then it ends up like this.
  

But then, in august I got a job trough a company that provides people to different workplaces when they need extra staff (manpower) It's not that often, they text when they need people and there's a schedule for when there's free shift. It's in a store and my job is just 4 hours spent putting stuff on their shelves. Really really easy and I like it there.

Last time I worked there I was going home when I ran into the stores manager. She asked me ""how is everything going? you seem a little lost.""
I was kinda suprised since I had worked there like 5 times and I thought everything was going good. I told her I was fine, and she was like ""well okay, cause you may have noticed we try to do our work in a good pace."" I told her ofcourse I knew that and that I was doing my job without ever slacking off. She just looked at me and was like ""well, okay.""  
  
I was competely taken by suprise, I thought everything was going well. I try as hard as I can, but obviously that's never enough. I am retarded or something? 
This was in november and I havn't got a workshift from them since. I'm starting to think maybe she told the company I was lazy and they don't want me there anymore? I havn't been ""fired"" (since it's not the actual store i work for, and I don't know if you can get fired from a company likes this), but it feels really weird. 
  

So yeah. Basically I feel like a big failure that can't even do the easiest tasks. I can't get things trough my head and make them stay there, I'm clumsy and forgetful. I just feel like a burden wherever I go.
All my friends have jobs and I feel like I can't even do the easiest ones.
I don't have high hopes for the future. 
  
I don't know if it will always be like this. I'm just so tired of myself.

18kcn4,7,2013-02-14,Should I talk to my ex-friend and hear his apology?,mythrowaway19290,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18kcn4/should_i_talk_to_my_exfriend_and_hear_his_apology/,"Here's the gist of my situation, I copied it from a comment I wrote right after it happened last April:

&gt; My really long term girlfriend (would have been six years soon) broke up with me at the beginning of the month because she ""wanted to be single for a while"". We're from the same town (out of state) and came to school together. I'm shy and she was my best friend, so I never put a huge effort into making new friends. The small group of friends I do have are all mutual, and so what was originally a heartbreaking breakup turned infinitely worse when I found out that she started sleeping with one of the mutual friends who I had been talking to and hanging out with for support (so he knew exactly what I was going through). 

Possibly relevant, missing details:

* ***edit:*** After originally writing the above, I found out that they first slept together before we broke up.
* I deleted my ex and ex-friend from my phone, blocked them on Facebook, and cut off all contact with my ex as soon as I moved out of the apartment we shared. I forgot a few things there, and asked my former roommate (and my ex's good friend) if she could give them to me when I came back to school. She must have told my ex because I got a really nasty text about it in August, which I promptly deleted (without replying).
* My ex and the ex-friend starting officially dating at some point soon after.
* I ended up finding out that she broke up with my ex-friend and started dating a co-worker.

All of that happened in April of 2012, so it's been almost a year. Fortunately, I managed to get a great internship from June-December across the country (away from school and away from my/our hometown), I made friends there, and had a blast.

Now I'm back at school. Knowing that she's here and me worrying that I'll see her occasionally triggers some anxiety, but it's gotten better over the last 6 weeks. Fortunately, I haven't seen her or my ex-friend. I'm still a bit bummed and lonely, but it's way better than the months following the breakup.

I talked to one mutual friend right after I got back, and she suggested that we all do something, but she mentioned that they would likely invite  my ex-friend, so I never really pursued the option. I've been hanging out with a couple other mutual friends once in a while and haven't had any issues there. Other than that, I haven't really made much of an effort to connect with the group like I used to.

A few weeks ago, I got a text from my ex-friend saying that he wanted to meet in-person to talk. This really triggered my new-found anxiety, so I just deleted the text and ignored it. Today I got a text from another mutual friend to the effect of ""ex-friend wants to talk so he can apologize and hopefully we can all start hanging out again. Would you be interested? We'd understand if you said no, we just want to see you more""

I really don't want to meet up or talk with the ex-friend, and I really don't think his apology will be worth much to me. I'm still hurt from the breakup, and I feel like a reminder is the last thing I need. Still, a little part of me feels like I'm being a dick if I don't try to accept his apology and move on.

**tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend cheated on me with a mutual friend a year ago. She has since moved onto another relationship. He wants to apologize and start hanging out again.**

Sorry for the lengthy post. I don't know what to do, and I could use some advice."
18kc5n,4,2013-02-14,16mo Internship or Business School?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18kc5n/16mo_internship_or_business_school/,"I'm a third year software engineering student in Ontario.  I have a major decision to make and I'm looking for some insight.

I've been offered several 16 month internships (May 2013 - August 2014).  These offers expire by tomorrow morning, and range from $40k/yr to $55k/yr.  These salaries are very tempting as it will allow me to graduate debt free and perhaps build a little nest egg.

However, if I take one of these internships, I'll be unable to attend the undergraduate business school at my university (Richard Ivey School of Business for those who know about it) and do the dual degree with Software Engineering and Business.  I have a few connections in that school so if I am accepted (guessing about a 60% chance speaking with past students) then I will have the opportunity to interview for good banking jobs.  However, I have no interest in banking.  I do not enjoy DCFs, or anything of that sort.  My passion lies both in Software Development and the industry as a whole.  I love talking about what I think about major companies, the next big technology, the quality of a recent release, etc.  My roommates are in IB and constantly ask me questions regarding the tech industry.

I'm not sure what to do.  Does anyone have any insight?  Like I said, I enjoy software development, but I also enjoy researching the industry and coming up with ways to make money from it, but I don't like the actual banking work behind it.  I've heard of banking firms that recruit solely software engineers because of their knowledge, but is there any validity to this?

My biggest fear is going the traditional software route and having my salary peak at ~100k.  But, if going the business school route, I fear being 50k in debt and being in a field I don't enjoy.  Or, not getting into business school at all and losing out on the chance of getting $60k in my bank account before graduation.

Does anyone have any advice?  My position is a bit unique so any advice at all would be appreciated.  Thanks."
18k4er,4,2013-02-14,"Holy Mixed Episode, Batman! (just nonsense)",BipolarCos,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/18k4er/holy_mixed_episode_batman_just_nonsense/,"OH DEAR LORD!  I'm so freaking manic right now.  Anyone who saw how many replies I just posted in the one asking for help about sexual impulses would have gathered this.

Not two hours ago I was sobbing uncontrollably.  Why? Oh no reason.  Well there was a reason...my best friend got a girlfriend.  Should be happy for him, right?  Oh no...My thought?  He's going to be spending all his time with her and I'm never the peachiest person to talk to so he's going to get tired of my shit and never talk to me and I'm going to be alone.

Oh and that relationship episode?  If any of you guys remember that whole situation...We're talking about dating.  He told me a few days ago that he didn't think us dating was a good idea and it hit me like a ton of bricks...I did have feelings for him...damn strong feelings...and when he said that I realized that I'd just taken him for granted.  Anyway...today we decided that we would wait on making a decision on whether to stay friends for now or try to move forward into a relationship until my therapist apt on Monday.

Holy cow I can't even focus to type...too much.  TOO MUCH.

I should do something productive.  I have school work I could be doing.  But that would require focus.  I need to do some SPELL SOME RIGHT DAMNIT!

I need to be doing some research for my classes.  I could do that with little focus.  Maybe I will do that when I get done typing this..whenever that will be HA! Shouldn't be too long, I'll run out of characters. 

Oh, so my doctor knows I'm mixed right now.  I saw him...last Thursday and he put me on an antipsychotic and upped my antidepressant.  I talked to my therapist about it on Monday because I've never been in a mixed episode this severe before.  The manic is bad enough that I would have slips of delusions...WTF is that you ask? It's what I named this phenomena because I have no idea what else to call it.
**Slips of Delusion** - A gradual chain reaction thought process that starts with a logical thought and ends with a delusional thought, but you are still sane enough to realize what is happening and draw yourself back.

An example you ask? SURE!  I've been watching Supernatural on Netflix.  I was watching it the other day and this was my thought process ""That's really cool.  I wonder if there really are stuff like that out there (btw  believe in ghosts, was actually in a ghost hunting group..want to get back in one..anyway)...I'm sure there are.  But to this degree?  Well no one in this show knows about them but the hunters, so surely there  COULD be something out there like that.  That would be an awesome thing to do. Hunt these bad creatures that no one knows about and save people's lives...Change the world even!  That's it...I'm going to do it.  How do I do it?  I know, I have to find someone who is doing it now and get in it with th... wait ...WTF...You know that shit aint real!""  And I could actually FEEL myself being drawn out of it.  It's so weird, I can't even explain it.

So I'm laying here in bed.  I'll be embarrassed and ashamed and crying tomorrow because me and that guy up there ^^^ that I was talking about just went further than either of us ever meant to..and he's going to feel like shit, which is going to make me feel even worse and that's just going to be bad.  But right now?  I don't care.  I'm freaking wonderful right now.

Man this chick's going to cut her fingers off in a minute.  Just wait...Yeah, I'm still watching Supernatural.

I've been going to bed early late..OH SHIT SHE  IS DRINKING BOILING WATER

Guess I was wrong about her cutting her fingers off.

Like I was said, I've been trying to get on a regular sleep schedule, going to sleep at about 10 or 10:30 and getting up at 6.  I started a diet..but today I so came off of it.  I'll do better tomorrow.  And I've started doing Yoga in the mornings.  I love it.  I tried to add cardio today..I only got 5 minutes into that.  I SAY that I stopped because they started using weights and I don't have any.  Man, that definitely is not true.  It was hard.  I guess 5 minuets is better than nothing but still.

I've gained almost ten pounds in about two weeks.  It's crazy and I hate it.  And Thursday my Doctor put me on something and told me it was temporary because it made you gain weight?  Damnit man.  So, I'm trying really hard on this diet and exercise routine, even if I messed up today.  It's okay to slip up every once in a while, you just have to keep at it and keep motivated.

I'm not going to get any research done.  I'm almost positive that I'm going to keep typing here until I run out of things to type about and then go to bed.

Holy cow, so I wanted to see about how long I've been typing this.  Surly it hasn't been over ten minutes.  It's been over 20! Close to 30!  Whaaa???  Maybe I just looked at the times wrong.

I have a three legged orange tabby kitten named Nemo.  I should take a picture of him and show him off.  I did once before but he got downvoted and it discouraged me.  Not here! I'm pretty sure it was in /r/aww or something.  He's a spunky little thing.  He wants to play with my other cat but she's apparently in a pissy mood. 

So Nemo..When my mom found him he had gotten fishing wire wrapped around his paw and cut off circulation and it...well...fell off eventually.  So when we got him he had a poor bloody and worn nub.  That's when I named him Nemo because he had a ""bad fin""  But when we took him to the vet they said they would have to take his whole leg.  And now he's mine.  And he's awesome.  I don't think he likes that I've been putting so many hours in at my internship though because yesterday and today he's been unusually needy.  OH and he helps me do Yoga haha.  That's not fun, I have to make sure not to kick him or something.

Man that cat TRIES to make you kick him though. If you stand up he runs up to you and as soon as you go to step he runs in front of that foot to headbutt your leg and either you bust yours ass (Which I've done before) or you kick him or step on him...AND HE DOESN'T LEARN.

You know that guy I was talking about...I really do want things to work out with him, I'm just scared. It's long distance and...4 out of my last 5 relationships have been long distance and it's sucked.  The one that WAS locally completely crushed me.  So I'm trying to put back the pieces..but this guy is so good.  I've known him for somewhere around 10 years.  I can't remember him ever being selfish and has never tried to hurt me or anything like that.

Man I wish my foot would stop bouncing.  I'm twitchy.  

There was a postcard on postsecret this week that said ""No one sends you flowers when you are crazy.""  It made me cry.  It made me realize I've never gotten a valentines gift from a guy I was dating.  Or birthday.  Or Christmas.  Maybe that is true.

I'm going to take a sleeping pill and get some sleep.  I'm sure no one has actually read down this far...I can't say that I would have..

Well...at least I'm not crying and I'm not delusional.  I just want to be level again.  I want to be able to make rational decisions.


TL;DR: Nothing important."

I am a third year econ student at a semi-target.
I am currently working as a full time intern at PwC.
I have a PE SA position interview next week and I need some advice.

It is my understanding that normal PE interviews cover DCF modeling and LBO modeling.

I dont have much finance background as my degree revolves around behavioral and macro economics.

I understand DCF pretty well from 2 finance courses I took at school taught by former MD of Goldman Sachs but for LBO i just barely understand the concept of it.

so here it is.


1. Would they be asking me to do modeling during the interview?
2. If, yes how and where could I get the informatoin to study for LBO?
3. What questions do you think might be asked during the interview?


I have never prepped for a buy-side job before so I really have no idea how or what to prepare for this. The firm is around 300mil funds, one of the largest in S Korea. It is focused mostly on the IT and entertainment industries.

18n2wg,13,2013-02-16,Led an exgf to cheat and I think I would do it again.,iwoulddoitagainlolol,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18n2wg/led_an_exgf_to_cheat_and_i_think_i_would_do_it/,"In 2010, I started dating a girl while in college. She was a year older than me at the time (me 18, her 19), and we'll call her D. Now, our relationship was solely based around sex, and it lasted a good 8 months or so based off of our sexual chemistry. She never really complained about the quality of sex, and my I, having been a virgin before this, had nothing to complain about. Anywho, fast forward to the start of the next semester, and we break up back at school. Our casual relationship once again ended up being a sex fueled stupor. 

Sex continued pretty much all the way back to spring break, when she informs me that she's been chatting with an old friend (hereafter referred to as M) who she has had a crush on for a good amount of time, and he'd be coming to visit her in the near future. I thought, ""hey, whatever, it's all cool."" He comes around a few weeks later, in fact, I recall being in the middle of some fun with D when he called her to say he had arrived. We finished things up in my dorm room and she headed back to her room to change and go meet M in the dorm lobby. Turns out I had never really fully grasped depression until this visit by M. D came to see me but found me in bed. She realized what the problem with me was and apologized. I asked her, ""did you do anything with him?"" I don't know why I asked her, but i needed to know i guess. She assured me nothing had happened. I barely left my bed for a good few days, and I am really thankful for the friends that I have for forcing me out to distract myself. The week came to an end, and D had just gotten into the elevator with M to head down to the parking lot. I had to investigate. My ever curious brain needed to tell the truth. I heard the doors to the elevator shut and I quickly moved to D's room, which was conveniently only a few doors down. As convenient as it may sound for me, D always left her door unlocked for some reason. As soon as I was in, I went straight for the garbage. I grabbed a pencil from D's desk and pushed some paper over to the side when I saw a flash of red. I held the papers to the side and there it was: a condom wrapper. This was almost three years ago and D still doesn't know that I know she fucked M that week.

D started dating M basically immediately afterwards and our sexual relationship ended. She still wanted to be friends, so I thought to myself, why not be friends with the girl who I allowed myself to become so infatuated with before, what could go wrong? Basically, everything stayed remotely normal. There were some times were D and I got a little touchy-feely (a little cuddling), but no kissing or anything sexual. Summer came and went and we were both (D and I) back at school in September. She would call us best friends at this point. I would go to her apartment a couple times a month to hang out a bit and we'd talk and she'd tell me about M and how that relationship is going. Naturally I don't want to hear anything of it but in an effort to be a decent friend I listened to her problems. M started off as a really nice guy, but by the way D described it, he was developing a problem with alcohol and anger (once threw a chair almost at D, punching a hole in a wall) and it was scaring D. She really, really liked him, but there's no way this could continue to be okay. I did my best to let her talk through her problems herself, but I admit to nudging her towards breaking up with M. Several times, actually. Several times I verbally expressed my unhappiness with the situation D was in. She acknowledged this and said something to tune of ""I know, I know"" and we went along with our business. Months go by, and it's spring semester again! It's been a tough one, homework out the wazoo, a house off-campus complete with parties and a dick landlord, and hearing about D's continuing troubles with M. He doesn't drink anymore at this point but expresses extreme jealousy when I am brought up in conversation. At this point I'm thinking she's just not in a good position and once again gently suggest a break up. She seems more receptive this time around but nothing happens. It is now March 2012 and my grandmother has been in the hospital all month. I was walking to my first class when my father called me and told me that my grandmother (his mother) probably only had a few hours left to live. In fact, she died right before my last class of the day let out, less than three hours later. I was depressed, my last remaining grandparent had died, and my family had lost a matriarch. Coincidentally D had called to say hello and could tell by my tone that I was not feeling well. She didn't ask why and immediately come over to see what was wrong. Once in my bedroom I laid down on my bed and told her my grandma had died about an hour ago. She starts crying and lays down next to me. I cried a little bit then too, but felt happy because D was next to me. What came next sort of caught me off guard: D sits up, looks at me for a few moments, leans close, and kisses me. Not a peck on the lips: a full, passionate, kiss. I suddenly remembered what it was like to be with this girl and I kissed back. Long story short, we had sex. Afterwards we just laid there kissing and touching each other but reality quickly came back to us when an alarm went off on D's phone, it was time for her to go back to campus for class.  We both headed down the stairs and outside. She walked down the driveway looking a bit flushed and turned around and smiled at me as she got into her car to drive away.

Summer came around and I was to spend half of it taking a summer course at school and the other half in New York City for an internship. Of course, D and I kept in touch, our relationship changed slightly to be more sexually open with each other, often reminiscing about things we had done in the past and how her having a boyfriend (still with M) has kind of complicated things. One step further, she briefly moved to the state in which M lived because she thought the distance is what was making things difficult. It wasn't. After moving down there and having nothing but terrible experiences with M and his family, she decided enough was enough and broke up with him. She moved back home and all seemed well. Since then we (D and I) have not had many sexual encounters (once when she visited me at school) and has had a new, much kinder boyfriend since January of 2013.

What bothers me is that she has recently (2 or 3 days ago) expressed discontent in the fact that we didn't have more sex or do whatever we wanted while she was dating M and that she is wondering why she didn't make a move to have some fun before she started dating her new boyfriend. I guess my problem is that I'm not bothered by kind of leading her to cheat on her boyfriend, I (like her) am bothered by our immense lack of sex during that time.

My relationship with D right now is like this: touchy-feely cuddling, intertwined legs, nude massages, she still flashes me on Skype, and I can still make her laugh like always. The way i see it, we're extremely close, but to most probably a little too close for comfort. Given the chance I would definitely make a move on her again.

TL;DR: Dated a girl in college who took my virginity and took part in an extremely sexual relationship. Girl breaks up with me over summer, gets new boyfriend, cheats on new boyfriend with me during the following semester, laments that we didn't do it more often, I think I might end up doing it again."

Currently, I'm majoring in Hospitality Management, but the more I learn about it the less I feel it's right for me.  So I'm thinking about MIS.  I love the business aspect of it, and I also love the technical, hands-on computer aspect of it as well.  Growing up, I was into HTML and CSS and had a basic understanding of how it worked.  I loved learning it and using it on my awesome pre-teen/teen blogs (I wish I still remembered the names of them, they're hilarious).  I know those probably won't be used in that major, but just a little background on me.  And if you're familiar with the Myers Briggs test, I tested as an INTJ, which I feel fits me perfectly. Down the line, I could see myself as some sort of analyst.  

My biggest fear is graduating with a degree that is worthless.  I've read that if you do go with an MIS degree, you should defiantly get an internship while in school.  What kind of internship would be best?  And are there courses or skills I should take to help with an MIS degree that aren't necessarily part of the program? Also, how are women viewed in this field?  As in, are there a lot of them?  Would it be harder for a women to get respect(for lack of a better word) from their peers/supervisors/etc?  From just experience already with technology, I feel a lot of people think I don't know what I'm talking about just because I'm a girl, and most girls ""don't know computers"".

Also, would a bachelors in MIS be useful? Or something more like accounting/computer science, then getting a masters in MIS?  I plan on getting my Masters in whatever degree I choose anyways.

My ideal career: A nice mix of working alone, and working with others.  A 9-5, M-F work week(or something similar).  I want to have a family one day, and I don't want to have to choose family or career.  I want something that's challenging, something that will also find fun though, so I don't mind taking classes and staying up to date as I get older.  I want something that pays well, and something that will be easy to find a job in."

this is my first draft for my computational linguistics masters application, its due march 1st and I'm in dire need of more eyeballs so I would greatly appreciate some reviewage. If anyone wants to trade statements for me to review just let me know.
I expect to make a lot of changes so don't be afraid to tear me down.
***/

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.
My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers. Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.
My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application.

18mw4g,1,2013-02-16,I feel it coming back,throwawayy3211,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18mw4g/i_feel_it_coming_back/,"I've struggled with depression before. I grew up in a very strict cult-like religion and only left last year in April. Last December was the first time I celebrated my birthday, wished other people happy holidays and do things I haven't done before. Life felt pretty empty though. I was at a temporary internship for 6 months last year and being alone all day with nothing to do really beats you...It was as if I was aware of my existence 24/7 and I'd comment on the status of my life all the time.

Fast forward to the Fall semester and I feel so much better. I have classes to keep my busy and distracted from those stupid thoughts and I made new friends. I started going to the gym to lift and stuck to a program since June. Now I'm at another 6 month co op and two days ago I decided to confess to a friend of mine...found out she wasn't available because she's taken which I'm sure is a lie. Boy did it hurt and it still hurts. I regret saying anything because we had a pretty solid friendship.

Lifting can only keep me up for so long. I'm only going 3 days a week and giving it my all trying to improve myself but it's so easy for these shitty thoughts to come back. Sometimes I'll just sit and stare at my computer at work not knowing what to do because I just keep letting shitty things hurt me.

Anyways...just felt like I had to post this here. Can't say I have enough close friends to just dump all of this on."
18muvk,2,2013-02-16,Engineering: start-up or arbitrage in a hedge fund?,Laugarhraun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18muvk/engineering_startup_or_arbitrage_in_a_hedge_fund/,"Good morning,

I'm a French engineering student and I'll soon start working (in 1.5 months).The French cursus is a bit different than US ones. I have a strong background in math and in {electrical, electronic,energy,software} engineering.

I've had a bunch of interviews over the last weeks and I'm now at a crossroad: I have several propositions by startups (esp. working machine learning on recommendation engines), including full-time positions. I also have a few opportunities in finance, the most interesting being an internship in a hedge fund specialised in arbitrage on financial markets. This would include modelisation (using R and python) and conception of trading automatons, probably involving financial maths, machine learning and genetic algorithms.

I like maths and I love computer science.

Both companies would be around the same size at my arrival (~80 coworkers, but the hedge fund does not grow while it's the startup's goal).

Here is what makes me hesitate:

* should I take this 5-months internship when I'm offered full-time positions? (I'm not really in need of money right now though)
* what should I expect in terms of career &amp; wages evolution? In case of a full-time position (which should occur if my internship goes well), finance pays *a bit* better than software engineering the first years.
* finance → every day is suit day, startup → every day is pajamas day
* finance → 50 hours/week, no public holiday, startup → 40 hours/week
* if I do not enjoy working in finance I believe I'll be able to go back to a startup after any length of time. Is that right?

Did you have such a dilemma? What did you decide? What tips can you give me?

Thank you very much, and have a nice day!

If anyone wants to trade statements for me to review just let me know.
I expect to make a lot of changes so don't be afraid to tear me down.
.......

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.
My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers. Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.
My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's your favorite meteor/meteorite occurrence in history that you find fascinating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frxbm?context=5)|Ever heard of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the man who wrote The Little Prince? In the '20s and '30s he was a French Aeropostale (air mail) pilot, flying wood-and-fabric airplanes to deliver the mail to far-flung corners of the world. He was once forced down on a small, high plateau in Africa by mechanical troubles. Stranded, he walked around the plateau. He noticed that the plateau was too tall to ever have been visited before, and that it was composed entirely of light-colored rocks. There in the moonlight, he found an odd, dark rock that had no place there. Saint-Exupery identified the rock as a meteorite, as the only way it arrived was from the canvas of stars above, ""just as a blanket spread under an apple tree receives only apples"". He went on to find three meteorites there in the darkness, and to identify them as such back in the 30's was quite the intellectual accomplishment.
[What is your favorite mind boggling scientific fact?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frtu1?context=5)|Stretch your arms all the way out, and let's imagine that the distance from one fingertip, across your body, and out to the other fingertip represents 4.5 billion years. That's the age of most meteorites. Now, take a nail file and make a single swipe across the fingernail on your middle finger. If the distance across your outstretched arms is 4.5 billion years, then with that nail file swipe you just erased ALL of recorded human history. But your average meteorite has been around for the entire outstretched-arms distance - for 4.5 billion years!
[About how often do meteors of about the same size as the one from today enter our atmosphere?  If Superman was out there patrolling the skies this morning, would he have been able to spot the incoming meteor in time to do something about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frn5n?context=5)|Meteoroids (that is, a body smaller than as asteroid) of this size strike the Earth's atmosphere about once a decade or so. As for Superman, it would depend on how closely he was paying attention! I suspect that he would be watching out for us if he saw it coming.
[Where the Mayans off by 2 months or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frspp?context=5)|Heheheh  Meteors like today's must have occurred during Mayan times as well. You have to wonder what they must have thought about such events.
[How do scientists go about tracking meteors? How do some meteors pass through undetected? (Like the one in Russia\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frpjc?context=5)|Meteoroids and asteroids are tracked using optical telescopes and sometimes by radar, although scanning the entire sky with a radar wouldn't work to detect everything out there - the sky is just too big. Some meteoroids get by because they're too small and/or dark to be seen by optical telescopes.
[Too dark? Could you expand on that please? And does the 'and/or' mean that we could  have a massive but dark one which would still get past our monitoring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fss0g?context=5)|Yes, too dark as in, the surface is nonreflective and black.  Like coal! Many asteroids contain a significant amount of carbon, and so they can be very dark to look at. Trying to find these ones against the black night sky is a challenge.  So with the and/or, I was trying to say that some are too small to spot until they get very close to us, and others are too dark to pick out against the night sky. And then some are both dark and small.
[How common is it for meteorites to contain radioactive or otherwise harmful material?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frua4?context=5)|Asteroids, meteoroids, and meteorites (rocks that actually reach the ground) are NOT radioactive. On Earth, rocks usually are radioactive if they are part of a radioactive element's ore. That requires the movement of a lot of hot water in the Earth's crust, and that process does not happen on asteroids. Meteorites are safe to handle.
[What dangers does a meteor of this size pose? Is this a rare event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frple?context=5)|This event has done all the damage its going to do. It was too small to reach the ground without breaking up in the atmosphere, so it didn't create an explosion crater on the ground like that seen in Meteor Crater, Arizona. The damage in this event was caused by what is basically a powerful sonic boom, as the very fast meteoroid struck the Earth's atmosphere like a rifle bullet fired into a swimming pool.
[This is truly your day to shine!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt9w?context=5)|Thank you! I like to see it as a great day for the average person to come in contact with planetary science. It's a wonderful research field.
[How big must a meteorite be to destroy say, an average house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt9w?context=5)|To destroy a house, a meteoroid would have to be even bigger than the event today in Russia. It would have to be large enough to reach the ground without slowing down to an aerodynamically-limited speed, and to strike the ground and cause a crater. With that said, falling meteorites can still cause damage. Look up the Lorton, VA meteorite fall from a few years back - a ~fist-sized meteorite plunged through the roof of a doctor's office, which was luckily unoccupied at the time.
[How big of a bomb would Bruce Willis have needed to blow up that metor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frvcn?context=5)|Hm.  That's a tough one. Scientists are divided as to the best course to take to eliminate dangerous asteroids, and blowing them up may not be the best action. If we were to blow one up, however, I would approximate that your average non-thermonuclear warhead (tens of kilotons TNT yield) would be enough to completely disrupt the body from today's event. Bear in mind that that is a VERY rough guess, though!
[Did we have any advance notice that the asteroid/meteor that hit Russia was coming? -I also heard that the one flying by is worth $195 billion, is the one that hit Russia (or whats left of it\) worth anything near that amount you think? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt62?context=5)|No we did not. This meteoroid, for as much damage as it did on the ground, was too small and/or too dark to be seen before it hit the atmosphere.
[Suppose that we have spotted a meteorite, that will inevitably collide with Earth in, let's say, a decade. It has a very high density so it's hard to destroy, it has a diametre of about 7 miles. In what way would it be possible to prevent the extinction of mankind? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frx3m?context=5)|The best option, if we had all options available, would be to have thriving human civilizations on multiple planets and moons. That way, even if some doom-rock of an asteroid were to cause a mass extinction, humanity would carry on. Bear in mind that this HAS happened on Earth before - notice that there aren't any dinosaurs roaming your neighborhood at the moment (other than birds, but that's another story).
[What is the largest misconception the public has about meteors, meteorites, or asteroids? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwky?context=5)|Hm. Pick your favorite - that they're radioactive, flaming hot, show up unannounced on your lawn overnight, or bring hazardous bacteria to our planet. None of these things are true.
[But are used to make magical swords right?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fteui?context=5)|Heheh  There actually are daggers made out of meteorite metal, to include at least one in the Smithsonian's collection. To the best of my knowledge they don't glow when orcs are near, however.
[Any word yet on what type it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frlad?context=5)|I've seen pictures of a hole in an icy lake that seems to have been caused by a falling meteorite. The description in that article says there are small, dark stones 0.5 to 1 cm in size among the icy debris. That hints to me that this was a chondrite - a type of meteorite composed of stone and small bits of metal. We won't know exactly what kind until the fragments are examined by an expert.
[Wiki said meteorites are most likely to impact at 45 degrees. Why is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frw2a?context=5)|Beats me.  Very few to none are going to strike perpendicular to the atmosphere, so I doubt the average is 45 degrees. Sounds like a mistake to me.
[Thank you so much for doing this! I keep hearing rumblings about the meteor that is going to passing over today closer than some of our satellites, but I haven't read anything recently about when it may be passing back around potentially even closer. Do we have anything to worry about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frly6?context=5)|You're welcome! And no, we have nothing to worry about. The asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass very close to the Earth today, but scientists have been watching it for many months now and are confident that it will miss our planet. On the other hand, we get a close look at this interesting asteroid without having to pay for a space mission!
[So... do the exhibits come to life at night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frrm9?context=5)|Only when I'm not watching, apparently.
[I have nothing to contribute other than I hope your nickname is ""Big"" and your middle name is ""And"".  So you would be 'Big' Marc and Fries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fy592?context=5)|Two of the scientists I cross paths with regularly are named Burger and French. I'm dying to write a paper - ANY paper - with them just so that we'll have the French, Fries, and Burger paper. A Happy Meal of Science!!  whee.
[What is the smallest meteorite we are able to detect from space? What technology exists to stop meteors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwy4?context=5)|The smallest meteoroid? (A meteoroid is a small rock flying through space, and a meteorite is one that reaches the Earth's surface) I'm afraid I don't know exactly, but it will be about the size of the parent asteroid of Almahatta Sitta (AS). AS is a meteorite recovered from Sudan that was detected in space before it fell to Earth, so we knew when and where it was going to fall. It managed to get pretty close to Earth before it was seen, so that's probably the lower size limit for detection.
 |As for stopping them? We currently have NO defense against asteroids. If one were spotted on a collision course with Earth, we could make preparations on the ground but there is no real plan in place right now for dealing with it before it strikes our planet. My humble suggestion is to fix that little discrepancy...
[How did you become an expert in meteors and meteorites?   When did you first become interested in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwmt?context=5)|I still have a lot to learn, and I'll be working to correct that until I'm too feeble to pick up a book. But I was first interested very late into getting a Ph.D. in materials science. A friend of mine brought a funny rock into the laboratory and asked me to collect some spectra on it. He told me it was a meteorite and I tried to kick him out of the lab because I thought he was pulling my leg - only museums have meteorites, after all! Turns out I was wrong on both counts. It WAS a meteorite called Portales Valley, and meteorites are actually very easy to come by, and are wonderful in the sense that they are ancient relicts of the formation of our Solar System that you can actually hold in your hand. I examined the meteorite for him and was spellbound by this incredible rock, which was unlike anything I'd ever seen. I was hooked, and have been studying them ever since.
[Why do meteors explode? Aren't they just large pieces of space rock that is heated up when entering the atmosphere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwyu?context=5)|They explode because they strike the atmosphere at very high velocity. Meteoroids are moving between ~10 and 80, even 100 km/s when they hit the top of the Earth's atmosphere. At those speeds, meeting the atmosphere is a pretty brutal event. It's like doing a belly flop into a swimming pool - sure, the water is nice and liquid and squishy, but if you hit it hard and slow down quickly, it's gonna hurt!  In a meteoroid's case, that belly flop into the atmosphere occurs at speeds high enough to turn solid rock into a superheated gas, and quickly enough to slow down from 10s of kilometers per second to tens of meters per second, all in only a few seconds' worth of blazing fireball.
[How often do people come to you with chunks of things like hematite or other oddly shaped mineral deposits and ask you if they are from space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frp8f?context=5)|All the time! I enjoy it, actually. Most rocks that people bring to me are not meteorites, but I'm happy to show them what a real meteorite looks like and offer advice on how to find them.
[What are the chances of a meteorite smashing and destroying the earth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fru0e?context=5)|The chances of physically destroying the Earth are vanishingly small. About 4 billion years ago, the Earth was struck by an approximately Mars-sized body and the resulting collision produced our Moon. Even then the Earth survived, and today there are no large bodies in irregular orbits that could reproduce that event. But if you mean an asteroid large enough to cause extinctions, the chances are very small. ...but not zero. Bear in mind this exact thing happened 65 million years ago with the Chixulub impact which played a major role in wiping out the dinosaurs.
[How would you compare the asteroid that hit Russia and the one that's going to miss the earth by about 15,000 miles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwqz?context=5)|We saw one coming, and missed the other entirely!  :-)
 |Seriously, we'll know more about both when we A) get pieces of the Russian meteorite into a laboratory, and B) get a good look at the near-miss asteroid later today.
[Where can one keep updated on such things? Normally this sort of thing is all over the internet/news for a day or 2 then seems to disappear! I find it fascinating too, and would love to know more about it after testing. Very jealous of your job, keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fstzh?context=5)|For meteors in the United States, I suggest the American Meteor Society's web page: amsmeteors.com.
 |There are websites for the various astronomy organizations who are watching for Earth-crossing asteroids as well, but I'm afraid I don't know them off-hand. A web search will get you there, though. Search for ""near Earth objects"" or something along those lines.
[Is the Russia meteor the same one the news said was going to pass between the moon and earth?  or something completely different? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frvxq?context=5)|We don't know yet.  The best way to find out will be to compare the trajectories of the two bodies and see if they are similar. At this point, we don't know enough about the trajectory of the Russian bolide. (A bolide is a very bright meteor that includes a detonation event)
[How does the angle at which a meteor strikes the earth affect its destructive force? For example, had this meteor entered our atmosphere at a shallower angle could it have exploded with more force like the one over Siberia a century ago? Or if it had come straight in, would it have struck harder, therefore resulting in a bigger blast on the ground?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs2vt?context=5)|Ah, physics!  We love physics. The infall angle is one of the factors in destructive force. An asteroid plunging straight into the atmosphere MIGHT have a better chance of reaching the ground than one that enters at a glancing angle, but it depends strongly on the velocity, mass, and mechanical strength of the asteroid. The meteoroid that struck today would not have reached the ground in any event; it was too small.
 |With that said, some of the PIECES of today's Russian event probably reached the ground, but only as free-falling rocks and not screamingly-fast cosmic bullets.
[What about this particular meteroite was so different when it made the news? If they happen every ten years or so, why is it such a huge ordeal? The media plays it up to seem as if this is a once in a lifetime thing. But I don't recall anything ten or so years ago about a meteorite like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsbjb?context=5)|In a word, it was BIG. That, and people got hurt. Take your average everyday event and find a version of it where people have to visit the hospital, and you've probably got a news item.  And there have been several very large events like this over the past few decades. Another very large one was several years ago over Indonesia (and mostly over water). It didn't make YouTube, so it was overlooked. There was another one over India/Pakistan a while back during a particularly tense period in their relationship, but that was over a rather remote area if I recall correctly.
[(Also, unrelated, but I'm starting an internship with the Smithsonian in a couple weeks, what are some fun things to do in the DC area?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsbjb?context=5)|As for DC - go ride the Metro and watch the people. It is a train ride, an underground excursion, and a circus all in one.
[Due to this unexpected event in Russia, myself and several others I'm sure, are curious as to how safe we really are from space? And what precautions are being taken to ensure all dangerous space projectiles are spotted and accounted for?  Have there been any instances where rare Earth metals have crashed and been recovered for use here?  How large of an asteroid would it take to guarantee all life intelligent on Earth be destroyed?  Has your knowledge in this particular field ever had you wondering how we haven't been blown to kingdom come yet?  What's the most bizarre thing you've encountered in your line of work?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs49j?context=5)|Oh boy...  I'd love to answer all of these but there are a lot of unanswered questions I'd like to get to. Let's see... I've answered the first one already, so I'll answer the second one here. There are no ""new"" elements in meteorites, in the sense that there's nothing in there that we haven't seen on Earth already. That makes sense, because fundamentally the Earth and asteroids were all originally assembled from the same cloud of dust that gas that swirled around our Sun some 4.5+ billion years ago. There are a few unusual new minerals in meteorites, however, and that's a consequence of their formation under chemical conditions that are unlikely on Earth. They were then protected from wind and rain by ...well, the fact that there are neither wind nor rain on asteroids! Kinda convenient, that.
[Are you trackin, gang? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frsw1?context=5)|Papa Whiskey, what's your position?
[It was reported that the meteorite today exploded while it was still in the air. Why did it not crash into earth as one, flaming ball? If I heard right it created a sonic boom when it exploded.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frxh3?context=5)|It lost the battle between mass and air pressure. The air pressure it experienced upon striking the atmosphere started breaking it up, and it wasn't massive enough to shrug off the damage and plunge into the ground. So it broke up between ~50 and ~20 km above the ground. If it were larger, it might have survived the trip to the ground and formed an explosion crater. As it is, the damage it could cause was pre-programmed into it by its size.
[Did the whole meteor break up into smaller pieces during entry? Or was there a larger piece that impacted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fryus?context=5)|Most of the meteoroid was destroyed - the bright part of the fireball was basically the process of turning stone into gas. But some of it - a small fraction of the original mass - almost certainly survived to reach the ground as meteorites.
[Is global warming responsible for the Russian meteor incident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frseg?context=5)|Nope.  The two are completely unrelated.
[How is the search conducted to find the bits that fell to earth (falls\)?  Follow-up: If I find one, do I get to keep/sell it or am I supposed to turn it in somewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs2j0?context=5)|The science/art of finding meteorites includes assembling eyewitness accounts, some trigonometry-heavy analysis of videos and pictures to re-create the path of the body, and some physics-based calculations of the expected flight paths of falling meteorites. Or, you get lucky and someone saw where they landed! As for keeping them, that depends on the law of the land where you found the thing. Some US agencies like the BLM are forward-thinking enough to have policies in place on what you can keep for yourself. Some countries, by contrast, have very restrictive policies and as a result the meteorites in those countries tend to rot into the ground, lost to science forever.
[What sized near-Earth asteroids/meteoroids is it currently possible to track with the systems nowadays in place? It seems this Chelyabinsk event caught everyone by surprise and wasn't on anyone's proverbial or literal radar...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frz4m?context=5)|The best tool in use is the optical telescope. We have radars, but there's simply too much space out there to effectively scan it all, given current equipment and funding. Many amateur astronomers contribute to this effort.
[Can you hooked me up with an internship on the anthro side?  Serious question: What is the most interesting thing to you that has been found/learned from meteorites.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frzbi?context=5)|The most interesting thing is basically that our Solar System is composed of many bodies, all orbiting the Sun and still running into each other even today. Before a few prominent meteorite falls a few centuries ago, this fact that we take for granted today was not commonly accepted. In ancient times, meteorites were explained as rocks ejected by distant volcanoes or ejected from caves! I'm glad we got that straightened out.
[If a large meteor impact was immenent, could we actually do anything about it?  Would we blow it to tiny pieces, or somehow split it into 2 large pieces whose trajectory would miss the earth.  If a dinosaur-extincting size meteor was on the way, could the government somehow keep it secret and only the privileged get into the shelters?  Or is it easy enough to spot these meteors such that your local university would see it and spill the beans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs7zm?context=5)|There are a variety of plans floated about for dealing with dangerous asteroids...  Blowing them to fragments is certainly an option, although there's some discussion as to just how possible and/or preferable that option is. (As a former Marine myself, I REALLY like the idea! hehe) Other plans include painting one or more sides of it and letting sunlight push it away from us. That sounds insane, but it really is an option - physics gives it a thumbs-up. There's also the option of putting some sort of engine on the thing and thrusting it away from us. The thing is, NONE of these options are currently available. All current nuclear-tipped missiles on Earth are designed to go from one spot on the planet directly to another, and don't even make it to Earth orbit much less a distant asteroid. The only plan we currently have available is to make disaster-preparation plans on Earth.  As for keeping it quiet, personally I think the notion of conspiracy is to antithetical to human nature to work well. People love to blab. But that's a discussion for another venue.
[How long until we start collecting raw materials from space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fshn8?context=5)|The planet already is, in a sense. Some 40,000 tons (give or take) of meteorites fall to Earth every year. As for mining asteroids and such, that is a VERY difficult endeavor and I'm skeptical that it will be practical any time soon. But we should start NOW, or we never will.
[Why do these objects ""explode"" at a certain altitude, rather than slowly burning up little by little to nothing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs1xu?context=5)|It lost the battle between mass and air pressure. The air pressure it experienced upon striking the atmosphere started breaking it up, and it wasn't massive enough to shrug off the damage and plunge into the ground. So it broke up between ~50 and ~20 km above the ground. If it were larger, it might have survived the trip to the ground and formed an explosion crater. As it is, the damage it could cause was pre-programmed into it by its size. (sorry for the cut and paste...!)
[Does the phrase ""meteoric rise"" when used to describe someone who has obtained some sort of fame frost your cookies?  \[it does mine.\]  They actually fall from the sky burning in flames if I remember correctly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs56m?context=5)|I'm convinced that the English language was invented pretty much to befuddle anyone who didn't grow up with it. But then, I suppose one could have a ""meteoric FALL"", too, which is a pretty dramatic descriptor.
[I'm a geology major and I want to go into planetary geology. Do you have any suggestions or tips for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fshhv?context=5)|Talk to lots of people.  LOTS of people - professors, other students, scientists, grad students. More than you think you need to. Ask anything and everything you can think of - they'll either help you, or you didn't really want their advice anyways because they suck. Research the schools that do the sorts of things that interest you, and talk to people there. Form a plan, but be willing to change it as you go. Try lots to things in order to figure out what you love to do, and then do that.
[How different do meteorites tend to be in composition from one to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsm32?context=5)|Great question! There are iron meteorites, which are formed when molten iron-nickel coalesced into the infernal core of a larger body, then that body was broken up to scatter its iron heart through the cosmos. (I've been writing for a few hours now and I'm waxing poetic!) Then there are ""stony"" meteorites composed mostly of silicates, either from small bodies that never got hot enough to form a liquid, metallic core, or from the metal-depleted surfaces of those bodies. Then there's the carbonaceous meteorites, which contain - you guessed it - a large amount of carbonaceous material. That's the simple version. There are dozens of types of meteorites, from asteroids, comets (maybe) and even other planets. There are some whose origins are still mysteries, as well.
[Hi, thanks for doing an AMA.  One question:  How big do you think the meteorite that just hit Russia was before it hit our atmosphere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsjfs?context=5)|My pleasure! I've heard numbers from 10 to 50 tons pre-atmosphere, but we don't have enough info in hand to really tell yet. My estimate lies towards the top end of that range, but we need to know what kind of meteorite it is and how much power the fireball generated.
[Why do they always fall in Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsipd?context=5)|GREAT QUESTION. They have some sort of national meteorite greed over there! Seriously, there were four meteorite falls in the US last year. Two in California, one in Nevada, and one in Alabama. Meteorites were recovered from all of these events.
[I've heard that the event in Russia has nothing to do with the huge meteor that's passing by us... how can that be true? It seems like a big coincidence. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsa9f?context=5)|&lt;snip from above&gt; Dunno (if they're related) yet, and I wish I knew! We will be able to answer that question when we know the trajectory of the Russian object, and can compare it against the trajectory of the near-miss asteroid. I understand that Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy was hinting that the two events are unrelated, and so was the NASA Space Environment Office. But I retain a healthy degree of uncertainty at this point. :-) &lt;snip&gt;
[What made you interested in meteors/ meteorites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsko2?context=5)|Had a buddy bring one into the lab one day, when I was finishing up my degree (of course! bad timing). After I stopped trying to throw him out of the lab because I thought he was pulling my leg, I was fascinated by the Portales Valley meteorite he had and was hooked on meteorite research. I then served as a post-doctoral student at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie is a wonderfully permissive laboratory where research is involved, allowing and encouraging the scientists to follow their interests. I was able to start studying meteorites in earnest, and have been doing it ever since.
[If there was a huge meteorite hurtling towards earth that would cause significant damage to society or completely wipe out civilization, would astronomers tell us ahead of time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs9ga?context=5)|Would the astronomers? Oh you bet they would. That's the whole reason they are looking!
[Whats your favourite meteorite? For example I'm an amateur collector and I have a soft spot for Allende , I have a small slice and its just fascinating in terms of its age and composition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs7u7?context=5)|My favorite meteorite is the one I most recently handled.  I'm simple.  :-)
[I've heard that when a meteor/asteroid explodes in the air it does more damage. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsln4?context=5)|Not necessarily. Impact craters like Meteor Crater in Arizona require an object to hit the ground, making a big hole and flinging debris over a large area. If the same amount of energy were dissipated into the atmosphere by an airburst, you'd still get tremendous damage but no hole in the ground. There are a few cases where this apparently happened and left great quantities of molten glass, called tektites. But both types of events are very destructive in their own way.
[About how many joules of energy does a meteorite coming into the Earth's atmosphere produce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsf6p?context=5)|Depends on the mass and velocity of the meteoroid. The vast majority of meteors are caused by tiny (sand-grain sized), fast-moving (30+ km/s) little fragments, and many of those aren't even powerful enough to be seen with the naked eye.
[What kind of utility vehicle do you prefer for meteorite collecting?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsns7?context=5)|My 1980 turbo diesel International Harvester Scout II.  :-)  wheee.

[Dr. Fries, how big do you think the meteorite was originally before it hit the atmosphere size wise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsfr8?context=5)|I've heard estimates ranging from 10 to 50 tons before it struck the atmosphere, and I think that's a reasonable range. I'm inclined to believe a number towards the upper end of that range. We won't know for certain until we find out what kind of meteorite it is composed of (by finding pieces) and by measuring the total power of the meteor (e.g. from seismometers, the same as measuring the Richter scale number of an earthquake).
[He shouldn't take his job for granite.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frve2?context=5)|Heheheh.

I am online and happy to take your questions at this point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frq83?context=5)|I just received an email from a prominent meteor expert who estimates the energy output of this bolide at greater than 100 ktons of TNT, which makes it the most powerful meteor since the Tunguska event in 1908! His estimates also state that the pre-atmospheric size of the meteoroid was roughly 15m in diameter. Compare that to 2012 DA14 passing by the Earth later today, which is twice that diameter! Now imagine what would happen if THAT one were to strike us...
[The 'darkness' of a rock out in space is called its albedo, which tells you how much light it reflects. It if has a really low albedo, it means the surface material doesn't reflect much of the sun's light, so it's difficult to see out in space. I'm assuming that's what DrMarcFries is referring to. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fyegx?context=5)|Bingo.
[Curious if the video coming in from so many different sources can help you with data analysis--like angle of descent, speed, other variables that might be quantitative in nature or if it's helpful 'qualitatively' speaking. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs0ms?context=5)|Yes! Basically, once you measure the angles in the pictures and videos and locate the spot where the pics were taken, it is a matter of trigonometry. You re-assemble the 3D path of the meteor from the various images. From there, you will get an idea of where any meteorites landed.  Yay, science!

I figured my best chance at being a DBA was to become a developer first and then make the move over. 

To get the current position I have, I had to do an internship in order to get experience. Now, I am older and don't have the ability to an internship due to finances. Will I be able to land a job as an entry level developer somewhere? Or will I have to have an extensive profile of work on somewhere like github? Any advice is appreciated.

18psih,2,2013-02-17,I studied abroad and I hate myself for choosing to do so.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18psih/i_studied_abroad_and_i_hate_myself_for_choosing/,"I moved to collge fall of 2012, and discovered that there was an opportuinity to study abroad for first year students. Freshman year, living in London. How amazing!- but they planned on only accepted 10 freshman out of my about 10,000 person class. But I made it. They accepted me. And now I wish they hadnt.

Heres why I am so blessed:
-I'm only 19, born and raised in small-town NY, and now I'm living in London, England until June 2013.
-Through my dad (in the military), I've been able to get this funding for this schooling tuition.
-I have three beautiful (american) flatmates who i've bonded with faster than I have with anyone else.
-Classes are only once a week. Meaning I spend only one or two hours in class (never before 11 am), four days a week, and have almost no homework.
-I have plenty of time to play sports and work out and get good grades because I dont need to work.
-I have an iPad, with a texting app, so I can talk to my friends and family whenver.
-I have savings money to cover my transportation, food, schooling, ect expences, and STILL have enough left to be able to go out, buy clothes, and make unnecessary purchases.
-I'm only a freshman, so on top of having a fucking great resume, I'll be able to go abroad/ do internships mutiple times because ill  have the time.

Reasons why I'm a little shit:
-I'd give it all up to just be back at my homeschool to finish my freshman year, because I miss a boy, who I dont even know if he wants a relationship with me when I'm home.

I'm worried Ill look back on this trip and regret it, because I spent so much time thinking about someone from home.

First fucking world problems, right?

I just wish I could be more thankful. I realized i am so blessed, but I feel so guilty. There are so many people who are denied this opportunity, I wish I could give it to them. I can't wait for June."

I know that an internship role at *place company name here* would be an ideal setting for me to thrive, and I am confident that I could add value to *place company name here*, as well. With the experience from my current internship, I have learned excellent customer service, troubleshooting skills, and plenty of networking based knowledge. Over the phone support has been a great way to better my skills as an IT support specialist. The specific dates I would be available for an internship are from May 7, to September 1st. These dates can be adjusted, if needed.

As you will see from my enclosed resume, I have also completed Kent Career Tech Center with a 4.0 GPA. In this we focused on computer networking basics, visual basic programming, Sony Vegas video editing, and computer mechanics. 

Please consider this cover letter and resume as my application for an internship at *place company name here*.I would welcome an interview opportunity and will willingly provide any additional information you might require. Thank you in advance for your consideration of my application. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The problem is that a decent chunk of my grade is based on participation quizzes which I obviously got a zero on, because I couldn't be there. This lowered what was probably an A- to a B- in a class where the average grade was either a B or a B+. I don't want people to dismiss me off the bat because one of the few experiences I've had with ML looks unimpressive on my transcript. Should I explain this in a cover letter or interview, or should I not even bring it up unless they talk about courses specifically? How should I handle this?"

Since I've had the opportunity to teach future software engineers at my old university and since I am now helping interns in my company, I have started to write articles with dozens of screenshots and explanations about the various features that Eclipse can provide you with while you are developing a Java application.

While learning to code, people are mostly taught about the language and the popular frameworks but not that much about the tools that they will use to code. So I've created those articles to help you master Eclipse for Java development.

Starting slowly with the details about the creation and organization of your project, those articles move later on the feature available to code your Java application. Then I talk about how to configure properly your Eclipse in order to let it help you or even handle most of the boring work for you. Finally, I conclude with a presentation of the various refactoring and debugging tools embedded in Eclipse.

I've always had clear skin, but in the last 6 months or so, my face has started to break out with small but pretty severe patches of acne. It has gotten worse over the past month or so. I initially thought it was my foundation (Revlon ColorStay) so I switched to CoverGirl 3-in-1 Stay Fabulous, but I haven't seen a significant improvement.

Because of the acne influx, I've been using Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action moisturizer but I haven't seen a decrease in my acne and by midway through the day, my skin has dried out again. 

I am on a very tight budget (working full-time for an unpaid internship on top of planning a wedding) and would love if you could recommend something I could find at Walmart, Target, etc.

As of the end of April, I will have graduated from the SUNY University at Buffalo with a B.A. in Geography/GIS and a minor in Computer Science. I've been studying CS for four years-- I earned an A.S. from Monroe Community College in Rochester, New York before moving to Buffalo.

I'm hoping to acquire a position in an application development job related to GIS, but as a new graduate, I'm looking for any position that will give me experience in the GIS and/or software development fields.

I have programming experience with Java, C++, VB.net, SQL, Python and ArcPy, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I also have a lot of experience using ArcMap (v.9 - 10.1) and many of it's functions such as Spatial , Network, and 3D Analyst. Many of these skills began at school but continued ""beyond the classroom"" as taught myself more about each language. I also won the [2013 Marble-Boyle award](http://www.aag.org/cs/marble-boyle) for my combined studies in the geospatial and computer science fields.

This week she told me that she's stayed over at his place (alone) a couple of times after nights of drinking and being 'too drunk to drive home'. On the first occasion she asked if it was ok, and I said yes because I definitely didn't want her to drive drunk.

I do trust her around other guys but I know first hand that people make mistakes when there is alcohol involved. She's never lied about it but she hasn't been extremely open or direct about it either. She usually drops it casually in a conversation the next day saying things like ""oh I just crashed at _____'s place""

1. Would you be upset if you were in this situation?

I'll try to make a nice, concise list of the important stuff so you can get a better idea of the position I'm in...

* Interning @ a smaller firm, 12 partners, ~60 staff, 12 interns
* Family friend (partner) got me the internship
* HR lady hates me, mainly because I'm sure my connection basically told her to hire me and gave her no say in the matter, prior to even interning (I mean, every other intern got an ""offer letter"" for the internship, I didn't get squat and didn't even know what my pay was until I got my first check)
* I'm the youngest, still in undergrad (senior @ Berkeley)
* The other interns are all a year or two out, taking extension classes, doing masters programs, or simply looking for job experience
* Not to be conceited, but I have the best educational resume (3.6 @ Berkeley) while the rest all either went to San Jose State, Sacramento State, or Cal State East Bay.
* Firm typically offers full time positions to 3 interns


* Thus far, I've completed the most returns of anybody while having very few, if any mistakes.
* A few of the other interns seem to simply be ""going through the motions"" and don't seem to be fit for a higher-paced and stressful environment
* I'm always asking for more work and trying to get more involved.
* When asked what I want out of this internship, I replied... ""I want to get prepared to be a CPA.  I want to attain meaningful hours.  I want to be exposed to anything and everything.  I want a challenge with regards to the returns I prepare - I can't guarantee you they will be done 100% correctly, but I can guarantee you I will complete them to the best of my ability and learn from them as best I can""

So what else can I do, if anything, to try a secure a full time offer?  I really like the firm as it offers a lot - 20 minutes from home, very friendly and family like, everybody works together and partners are accessible, etc, but obviously as an intern I feel below everyone else and would like that to change in a matter of the next 3 months.

let me know.

After 5 years and 8 months of living with my girlfriend.  It looks like it isn't
going to  work any longer.  Only the first 8  months were peaceful.   Other than
that, the  rest of the  time we have  fought or she  has thrown a  fit virtually
every night.  I feel  like a fool for staying on this long  and now she wants to
split up.  I  have certainly done my share  of wrong here but the  end result is
that I'm probably going to wind  up semi-homeless, I've had a substantial amount
of money taken from me, I have no transportation and no job.  My best friend has
been telling me  to leave for years.  He is under the impression  that I've left
and I'm too ashamed to tell him that isn't true.

A little background: I'm a male currently in  my 40's.  For twelve years I was a
software engineer making a substantial amount  of money.  I had some college but
had not  finished my degree. When  I was laid-off  in 2002, I decided  to switch
careers to  something safer.  I  finally settled  on civil engineering  since it
seemed difficult to  outsource that kind of work overseas.   Even to the present
day  though, I  still kept  my feet  wet in  coding.  I  started some  projects,
and learned a couple of new languages.

I worked  at lower-paying jobs  with flexible hours and  went back to  school in
2003.  Some  semesters I took  off, others I went  part-time.  I also  shared an
apartment with my brother.

In 2007, I met this woman (my soon-to-be-ex  gf) and we dated she was very, very
nice but within two  weeks of going out she places her apartment  keys on my key
chain, which I found a little unusual.  I  stayed for a couple days but when had
to leave and she begged me to come back.   I came back a few days later and when
I had to leave again she said that ""it feels like we are breaking up""

A few things  about her: she is six years  older than I am and her  son (in his
early twenties) lives with her.

So eventually I moved in but kept paying my portion of the rent on the apt I was
sharing with my brother.  After one semester, I needed to move  back to my place
but it is clear  that this isn't what she wants.  She is  nice, she cooks meals,
she does my laundry.   We had some fun times together but ..   and I can't quite
describe this  .. I couldn't  seem to connect.  There  was this lack  of ""shared
understanding"" or emotional maturity.

Here is the part where I get stupid:

Eventually  I  left my  old  apartment  and  moved  into hers.   Problems  began
occurring.   I'm not  going to  go into  details but  it felt  like I  was being
bullied and controlled. Several  times I walked out but she  would follow me and
convince me  to come back.  But the  worst was her  tendency to come  home EVERY
NIGHT and  get upset at some  small facial expression or  some innocuous comment
that I'd make but  was taken the wrong way by her.  This  usually resulted in me
walking on eggshells for  the remainder of the evening to  avoid getting my head
bitten off.  This behavior continues to the present day.

I sold my car.  I  have no idea why I did this - but at  least it is easy to get
around where I live and I don't  like driving anyways.  There were other things:
she set  up my automatic  online credit card  payments and receives  the monthly
statement.  She had  access to my bank  account (card and online).   In short, I
fucking allowed her to manage my life.

All the while, she  is also happy to do some great things.   She never said ""no""
to sex.  She helped a great deal while  I was going to school.  The fact is, she
provided a foundation that I could rely  on.  (Note: she was *not* paying for my
expenses or tuition).

She has  always hated  my best friend  and accused us  of being  ""fags"" together
(which  is  false).  Her  hatred  of  gay men  knows  no  limits, which  is  odd
considering that she is  bisexual.  I was *not* allowed to  visit him except for
special circumstances.  Emailing my friend was frowned upon as was chat or phone
calls.

In Aug 2010 my grandmother died. My grandmother basically raised me.  When I was
young my mother and father divorced and  I went with my father for several years
.  My Mother never really came back and dad was a fairly nasty person so I spent
a lot of time at my grandparents.  In 2006 she was in slow decline mentally that
would last for  four years.  She had  several strokes and finally  was unable to
breath on her own.   After talking to the doctors, my family  and I decided that
it would be best to let her go since she would never regain consciousness again.
And here was the ONE TIME that I really needed some kind of emotional connection
or support  from my  girlfriend.  I  stood in  the bathroom  thinking that  if I
didn't  go  to the  hospital  then  this  horrible  thing wouldn't  happen.   My
girlfriend comes in and I just can't help  but break down and tell her: ""I don't
want to  do this.""  She  just stared  and commented that  she had never  seen me
like this.

Here is were I do something really stupid:

All of the grandchildren receive a substantial annuity.  As an act of good faith
and partly to  show my gf that I  want to build a real relationship  with her, I
place it  in the bank  in both of  our names.  I was  planning on putting  it to
better use but at the time just leaving it in the bank seemed reasonable.

In 2011  I find  an internship.   I landed  this internship  based partly  on my
programming skills  and it  was an absolute  pleasure to be  paid to  write code
again.  I had other duties but coding was  what I most looked forward to.  I had
forgotten what  it was like  for an  afternoon to just  melt away because  I was
totally absorbed in my work.

At this  point, things were really  bad with my gf.   Her son moved out  and she
blamed it on me.   Her son and I never really talked but  never really got along
well either.  I walked  out on her again and she tracked me  down in her car.  I
refused to come back but stupidly did a few days later.

Last June, I  became friends with a  woman who worked where I  was interning and
somehow we wound up  chatting online.  She told me about her  husband and I told
her about about my  gf.  I told her how we fight constantly  and how I wanted to
leave.  I am very attracted to this woman and tell my best friend (the one my gf
calls  ""a fag"")  that I  want to  cheat  (the actual  words were  a little  more
descriptive).  Somehow  my gf was able  to get  almost complete transcripts  of my
conversations with  my friend  at work and  my best friend.   We had  some nasty
arguments  and I  agreed not  to have  any contact  with the  woman at  work any
longer.

A few months later,  I discover that all of the money from  the annuity has been
withdrawn from  the shared account.   There was no  real explanation from  my gf
other than ""it  was used for expenses"".   This makes no sense since  we had more
than enough money.  She said that she can prove it to me but I doubt it.

I left again, this time she didn't stop me  or try to drag me back and it seemed
like we were through:  I was angry at what she had stolen  from me, and she said
that I  had cheated  on her.  I  was staying  with my brother  but, like  a fool
again, begged her to come back.  I came back a month later because the apartment
we are renting had both of our names on the lease and I didn't want her to break
the lease.  I also  came back because I was miserable,  jobless and thought that
maybe things would be  different. I had been telling myself  this time and again
for years so I  had no reason to believe it. She was  nice when I visited though
and genuinely seemed to want me back.

After several  months it has come  down to this:  she is leaving when  the lease
expires (with her  son - who has returned),  I'm looking for a job  in my field,
going  to grad  school,  and things  are  likely  to get  rough.   I have  given
everything I have to  this woman in trust and gotten screwed.   I am also afraid
that our beloved Chihuahuas  might wind up in a shelter.   I would be devastated
if this happened.

She claims  that she  can't trust me  and that is  something that  I understand.
There have been times  in the past when I've tried to  contact people on various
sites (but  never actually met).  She's  found pron sites in  my browser history
(and does  not approve). On  the other hand,  her behavior has  been suspicious.
For several  years, she refuses to  tell me why she  came home from work  two or
three hours  late every  evening and  jealously guards  her phone  and computer.
Under no  circumstances can  I use her  comp or  look at her  phone.  All  of my
accounts and chat logs are available to her though.

I know that I'm just as much to blame for this mess as she is but when you can't
find  a job,  lose  your home,  lose  almost all  of your  money  and lose  your
girlfriend then  the next  thing to go  is losing hope.   I keep  fooling myself
thinking that everything is totally my fault and that if I fix a few things then
she won't  always be biting my  head off, putting me  or my friends down,  be so
demanding or  so controlling.  I  keep fooling myself  and think that  she'll be
affectionate some  day but  it is  just a  lie.  Ultimately,  I don't  think she
would've been happy with me no matter what I did or didn't do.

Fortunately,  the last  six  years haven't  been a  complete  waste.  I  finally
finished  my degree  and am  going to  grad  school.  I  have a  whole world  of
interests and study new material, hack on some of my side projects or draw.  I'm
definitely not suicidal but there are times when  I feel as if I can't go on and
wonder if I'm going to be able to rebuild my life.

18rs7t,5,2013-02-18,Enjoyable part-time job w/limited prospects vs. Full-time w/stability. Advice? ,jobprobs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/18rs7t/enjoyable_parttime_job_wlimited_prospects_vs/,"Hi Reddit!

For the last few months of 2012 I worked a full-time, 3-month, internship doing a pretty niche job that I absolutely loved  (I am an unemployed graduate previously in crappy min wage jobs so I took it to gain some office/'real job' skills, and never expected to enjoy the substance of the work as much as I did). I have since been out of work for a couple of months and have been unsuccessfully seeking another 'real job' in any sector that will take me.

The same company that I worked for has recently advertised for a position that is essentially my internship, plus a few additional responsibilities. Due to my previous experience I believe that I would be a strong candidate, however, the catch is that the job is only part-time and lasts for only 2.5 years. If it were full-time and permanent it would be the dream first 'real' job, but it isn't, so there you go. However, I am still considering applying for it.

Like I said, I loved the job, but there are some clear downsides to applying for it on this basis. The job was pretty niche, and as a career it is only as enjoyable when working for a company with the most interesting projects (i.e. good jobs in the sector are very few and far between). It is almost inevitable that I will face another stretch of unemployment afterwards or face potential relocation across the country to do the same job for a less interesting business. I will also have to find a second part-time job to supplement my income; this may be tough in this economy and there may be logistical problems in balancing two part-time jobs.

Alternatively, there *may* be networking opportunities, the contract *may* be extended (the job is key to the business and will probably still be required in some form in 2.5 years) and, because it's part-time, other jobs/volunteering opportunities may prepare me better for the job market in future. The skills are transferable to an extent.

As a graduate I have had a tough time in the job market over the last few years and it seems silly to stop seeking my first stable, full-time job to pursue something that may be unsustainable long term. However, it seems equally silly to avoid a job that I actually enjoy in favour of a full-time 'real' job that may be months/years away in the current economy. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Should I be more focused on sorting my graduate employment problems short-term, as opposed to potentially stretching them out into my later 20s through short-sighted decisions (I'm 24 now)?

Any advice welcome!



TLDR; opportunity to continue a job that I love part-time with a questionable career future or should I hold out for something full-time and permanent but, perhaps, with less job satisfaction?"
18rl6o,2,2013-02-18,More depressed than ever now that I've overcome drug addiction,monastramo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18rl6o/more_depressed_than_ever_now_that_ive_overcome/,"I need help and advice on what to do Reddit.

I'm 25 years old and have had serious problems with drugs since I was about 15. I started because I was depressed, and continue to be depressed but felt much better on the drugs at times. Mostly my use revolved around marijuana and prescription drugs. I've been clean for 6 months now, and used very little in the six months before that, but I've never been more depressed. I don't really have any friends anymore either, as much of our relationships were built around the use of drugs. 

I was never a motivated student in High School but could bullshit assignments easy and tested very well so I got into a top 25 university that I was never able to finish. I had a couple great internships where the offices seemed to love me and thought I'd do great in life, but as my problem with prescription drugs grew I pretty much stopped working. I'm currently on a (now 2 year) leave of absence with just over a semesters work left, but I've been gone so long that at this point I had to reapply to finish my degree. To do this I'd need to take a couple community college classes and work a job to prove my ethic and such. My grades at university were all over the place depending on how motivated I felt in the class: I have a string of Fs in introductory courses (failed some requirements 3 or 4 times) and straight As in some of the most challenging classes.

This gets me to my next problem, I haven't been able to hold a job down at all. I dealt to support my habits and have a small income from a couple rental properties I bought with inheritance. My parents paid for my schooling and tried their best to get me help. It took years for this to finally work, as I kept getting depressed and falling back on old habits as I felt like I didn't fit into the world. 

Now that I've cleaned up I'm trying to find work experience. I have no degree, and won't be able to finish it for at least a year and maybe two despite the small amount of work left. My parents are unwilling to pay for more school so I'm going to have to make a descent amount of money or get loans. I have very little work experience and can't find a job. Even jobs postings that say no experience necessary or that they will train you seem to want people with 2+ years experience in the field. I've been trying for two months now and just can't find anything in my area to even build experience. I really feel like if someone would give me a chance I would excel in any field, but I understand that on paper I look like a bad investment. I just feel discouraged about jobs at this point and don't want to even try anymore.

My parents are continuing to get angrier and more frustrated with me, and I really hate to let them down. I have two siblings that have by far outshone me, my younger sister is a star athlete at her college with sports management jobs lined up. My brother is an investment banker with an ivy league background. I often feel like my parents care about them more, I constantly over hear them talking about how great my siblings are and never overhear anything about myself. My siblings did a lot of activities when they were younger (Athletic camps, comp sci camps, competitive squash, tennis, sailing and skiing, etc) while my parents pretty much left me alone to go to school and play video games. I just feel like I was unwittingly and unknowingly neglected and have suffered for it.

I wish I could do better, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I just feel like I was happier when I was high, and want to go back to using. I don't feel like there is room for me in traditional society. Nobody seems to want to hire me and I don't hold out much hope for things getting better. The way I see it each and every day I am becoming less and less valuable to society. I was never this depressed on drugs and feel like I should just use again and melt away.

I'd really appreciate it if any of you guys had some advice on what I should do."

18rg5p,13,2013-02-18,Should I (22F) quit my job because of my boyfriend (21M)?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18rg5p/should_i_22f_quit_my_job_because_of_my_boyfriend/,"Hi guys,


My boyfriend (21M) and I (22F) have been dating for about 2 years.
He graduated high school last year, and I graduated college 2 years ago. We live in a really small village, where just about everyone knows us. Bonus: our dads have known each other since high school, and are good acquaintances.

Anyway, we met each other during an internship at his dad's office. He's an insurance broker, and I interned there for about 10 weeks. After those 10 weeks, he and I started dating, because I didn't want this to influence my grades. I was hesitant at first, because he wasn't really my type (both mentally and physically), but we got along very well.

After I graduated in June 2011, we went on a vacation with my parents (3 weeks) and his parents (3 weeks). After that, I started working at an insurance office about 5 minutes from home. This office is a lot bigger than theirs, and they obviously disliked this. After I told them I got a job, his dad asked why I didn't ask him for a job (I did, he said they weren't hiring), but I dismissed it. After about a month at my current job, I wasn't really happy with the mood and I tried to resign. My boss asked me to reconsider, and he asked me to gave him my final thought after a week. Okay, I once again went to my inlaws, and asked whether his former offer was still standing. He didn't answer, no matter how many times I asked. After a week, I told my boss I would like to stay at my current job. Case closed.

I've been working there for about a year and a half, and in October 2012 my boyfriend started working at his dad's office. The trouble started in January.

I asked my parents if they wanted me to check out their insurances, and it became quite clear that they were paying way too much. I told my bf about this, and he got very angry about this. He said that we were greedy, and that we were stabbing them in the back. Mind you, I only told him that I made my parents a quote. I did this for 3 insurances, and the total cost was 4000€ (my boss) vs 5000€ (bf).

Because of this fight, my parents decided to just leave it the way it was. This month, I did the same for my brother, and again it was way cheaper. Because of the previous fight, I decided to first take over his insurance and tell my bf after I did this. My brother is marrying this year and is also planning to build a house, so it's pretty important for him to save money wherever possible. He also isn't too keen on my inlaws, so it really didn't matter to him. What's also important (because I realize I might sound like a complete and utter bitch now because I'm ""stealing"" clients from my inlaws) is that my current boss hired me KNOWING that I was in a relationship with my bf, the son of his competitor. I felt (and feel) like I should show how grateful I am for this opportunity he has given me. He easily could've given me the cold shoulder because of my relationship.

Now, of course I understand his point, but he just keeps blaming me for this, and I get very defensive about it. He starts talking shit about my boss (who is a very nice guy btw), and I honestly can't stand it anymore.

My plan wasn't to keep this job for the rest of my life, but only temporary (for about 5 years, or until I got pregnant). Right now, I'm wondering whether I should quit my job (not right now, but in a few months or so) and get a new job in an entirely different department, or if I should just give up on our relationship.

I've tried ""not talking about work"" but even when I have nothing but good things to say about my job (let's say about my colleagues, because we've been having a good time at work or whatever) he gets really annoyed. And we're both very talkative people so it's really hard, but I understand that this might be something we have to work on.

PS: My dream job would be helping the elderly, working in a clothes store (seriously, folding clothes or something, whatever, I'm starting to dislike the responsibility I have at my current job) or working in a bakery. 

TLDR: My bf and I are competitors in the insurance business. We argue about this a lot. Should I quit and find a new job?

I'm so sorry about the rant, but it helped me get things off my chest.

I hate my major. I hate having to live in this shitty small town. I hate being so far from home. I hate the weird locals. I hate how bars here close at 1. I hate that our athletics are subpar and the stands at a football or basketball game will never be packed.

I feel like I hate everyone here. Everyone is so uptight, concerned with what everyone thinks about them. Being involved in Greek life makes it that much worse. Everyone is so caught up in rankings and which sorority has the best looking girls and whether or not they mix with top fraternities. Girls are vicious to each other sometimes making personal attacks on anonymous forums online to bring other sororities down. Frat boys are just dicks. 

All everyone here talks about is how much sleep they didn't get the night before, how they have jobs and internship lined up at all these banks, how they ""failed"" exams though they only got a C. Everyone here is only concerned with wealth and status.

I don't have many friends. Despite being in a sorority, I wouldn't consider many of my sisters to be my friends. They're more like drinking and partying pals who I only see on weekend nights. My best friend and I got into the same sorority but lately I feel like our friendship has been deteriorating. It's gotten to the point where I'll only see her to party. I hate how most people here don't do romantic relationships and just have casual hook ups. They claim to not have the time or something.

The only thing that keeps me going through the week is the weekend, which to me begins Wednesday night. I spend so much money at the bars and I justify it by the fact that I work two jobs.

I wish I would have gone to a different school. I wish I could transfer out. I doubt anyone would even care if I left. I fucked up really badly last semester. Seeing as I hate my major, I just don't feel motivated to study. My GPA took a beating and I could never be able to get into a decent state school like University of Illinois or Michigan. I've already signed my housing lease for next year which is probably the biggest deterrent to me transferring. 

I don't fit in. I'm a very chill, laid-back girl who loves to have fun. I don't care if I'm rich or not in the future. I'm not looking to be a lawyer, doctor, or banker. I really only just want to be happy. I'm pretty miserable here to the point where I'm depressed and thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind. Sometimes I wish I could drop out. However, I have two younger siblings who look up to me and a mother and father I want to make proud. With the shit job I'm doing in school, I'm essentially wasting my time as well as my parents' and government's money. I'm frequently homesick. It's not that I miss my family much. I just miss my hometown. I'm just going to keep on keeping on I guess."

I spent a year and a half as an intern in a pretty complex IT department at a marketing agency in Seattle...and I loved it! I was primarily doing level I-II desktop work and I learned a whole hell of a lot more their that I did going through vocational courses at my community college. I was preparing workstations for new employee's, creating and administering AD accounts and security groups, removing viruses, troubleshooting calendaring issue's in outlook...etc. I participated in cool projects like Office 365 email roll out, and a bitlocker encryption roll out. 

I gained gained all of my colleagues and customers appreciation. I was always willing to help. If I was stressed I would hide it, because I really enjoyed working with my customers to solve their computing issues. I only left the job so I could focus on getting my transfer degree in a shorter amount of time. Beginning in Fall, I will look for a similar role and take night classes to work toward my Bachelors. I think I want to stay in the desktop role the though. Sure, it doesn't pay a sys admin's salary but it's enough for me to have a life outside of work and put food on the table.

**tl;dr**

I really love desktop work, particularly in fast paced environments where I can do some leg work. Would holding the desktop role for my whole career be suicidal? I feel an aversion to becoming a network / system admin...seems really stressful and complicated.

I really want to go to grad school for Industrial engineering or Systems engineering, I find both fascinating and complementary. I know I have waited to long, but I'm just starting to send applications to certain schools. 
The reason why I didn't send applications before is because I didn't think my grades were good enough. I have a 3.6 GPA, but a 4.0 in the Comp Sci major. I'm minoring in Math, Physics, and Economics.
In addition I had an internship over the last summer, along with an IT job for 3 years at the school I go.
I recently took the GRE and I got a somewhat low score in english (mainly because it is not my first language). In verbal I got 151, and in math I got 161. I just learned that those scores are not too bad, so I finally decided to go ahead and apply to grad school.

I have a student visa, and I'm really looking for ideas to places where I can go either to continue my studies or to get an internship as a computer programmer. I'm scared that, if I don't get accepted, I will have no other choice but to go back to my country were my chances of getting a good job are very slim.

For three days she was extremely into me. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I met with her on Tuesday &amp; we ended up kissing. That Tuesday night however, I asked about her... Boyfriend. Her boyfriend lives 500 miles away &amp; I'm not very sure about his situation but I made it very clear that I didn't really want to hurt him... She was confused. So was I. Anyways, she said ""let's just go back to being friends."" I said... ""Eh :/"" &amp; we just kind of dropped the subject and that night she didn't want me to stop texting her even though I had an exam the next day &amp; throughout the next day we texted constantly. I couldn't see her, I had a meeting and a very long church service since I am Orthodox. 

Thursday comes along. Not flirty anymore. At all. I asked her if she wanted to hangout, we could get dinner, go to this basketball game, but she said that she was SUPER busy. She wasn't responding to me anymore with heart shapes in texts, and there was a solid two hours where she didn't say anything to me.

Friday was worse, same with Saturday, &amp; today we haven't texted at all.

Should I text her now? No. That would be weird &amp; possibly pushy... Right?

I'm seeing her tomorrow night at a meeting... What should I say? I was thinking of having small talk, and eventually asking if she was still into me... It was extremely obvious that we cared for each other more than friends would.

You don't lose feelings for somebody in  one day, so something must have happened. I'm super confused. What should I do? My goal isn't to ""bone"" her either. I want to connect mentally before I connect physically. If this isn't the right subreddit, I'm sorry. 

If you need some more info, just ask. I need the advice.

**Background:** I sort of dated this guy James about 2 years ago. We were really close friends for about a year before anything happened. I liked him a lot but he sort of strung me along for 3 months until he ended it. I was hurt but got over it quite fast because I felt he'd treated me like crap. I moved on, he seemed not to even though he ended it. He asked me out a few months later and I said no. I heard later from friends that he was still trying to get me back a couple of months after, but it was around then I started going out with my boyfriend Dan. James and I are still friends, but not close. We have the same circle of friends so we occasionally hang out in groups and we still get on really well, but I haven't hung out with him alone since I turned him down. I assume he's over me now as this was over a year ago.

**Current Dilemma:** My problem is this. James and I work in the same industry, and it's not an industry flush with opportunities. The place he works is one of the few that are growing and hiring. They're hiring at the moment in fact. And it's a job I think I would be good at. But it's a small company, maybe 30 people, and only about 5 work in the section the job opening is in. James is one.

I don't think James has anything to do with the hiring of this job, but if I got it I would be, if not working directly with him, at least sharing a small office with him. For me this wouldn't be a problem, but would it be unfair to him? I'm certain he doesn't still have feelings for me, but would he feel awkward, would I be invading his territory? 

And what about my boyfriend, is it beyond inconsiderate to apply for a job with an ex? I know I would feel at least some pangs of jealousy if Dan was working with an ex, particularly if he purposely applied for a job knowing he would be. But is that enough reason not to go for it? I almost certainly wont get the job this time, but they hire and take on interns every few months so I know this dilemma will repeat.

Normally my instinct would be to talk to the people involved, but I know neither of them would tell the truth of how they feel about this. Who would tell a friend they don't want to work with them, or a girlfriend not to apply for a job.

What is the right thing to do here?

**TL;DR: My ex and I work in the same field, and his small company is hiring. Should I apply for the job or would that be unfair to my ex and my current boyfriend?**

I'm just the average Joe who got into a Computer Science degree (Technical degree, not really sure of the equivalences, a 3-year university degree quite similar to the ""superior"" degree) because I wanted to make video games. Although I really loved the coding (And design) related courses, I got a bit unlucky due personal issues and took way too long to finish the degree, as I ended it with 27 years.

I started the search for some work and things got messy. I managed to score an internship for a big company, only that in their IT department. The position was advertised to me as a more coding-related position (Not exactly ""developing"", but with chances of get dirty with code), and, given the lack of any other offer as a programmer, I accepted. I have spent over 6-8 weeks there and, besides some small scripting work, I haven't written a single line of ""serious"" code.

So doubts arise. I'm now 27, I have some small personal projects going on which I develop on mi scarce spare time, and I don't really know if the pros of the position (The place is great, the coworkers are really smart people, I'm learning a lot of new stuff, the company really cares for its employees -even the interns-, having a big name in the CV...) over weighs the cons (The STRONG feeling that I'm getting too old to start a successful career as a programmer and that it will be harder for me when I end the internship, the fact that time spent there is time not spent programming, the doubt that anything that I do here will ever be useful on a programming career, the fact that I don't really like the job...) 
Right now I don't really know if I can take it easy and enjoy the ride until it ends (""I'm being impatient"") and put it in my CV or jump through the window in mid transit and search for other opportunities (""I'm being realistic"") as this is going nowhere (besides me being older).

So.. any advice, Reddit?"
18u4ja,72,2013-02-19,Advice to aspiring web developers,aquilaFiera,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/18u4ja/advice_to_aspiring_web_developers/,"Here are some tidbits that I've found successful in my career as a web developer. I'm only about five years in the field, but I've been pretty successful. I certainly can discuss my credentials if you wish, but that's not what I want to dwell on.

1. College degrees are far from a requirement. Development and in particular web development is very much a meritocracy: those who are good do well and those who don't sink. As someone who has done hiring, I looked more favorably on one year of professional web development than any four year degree. A degree *will* help get you interviews but little more than that. I am not at all implying degrees are not helpful, particularly if you want to do some of the more specialized types of applications like natural language processing, machine learning, or Bayesian analysis. Even then, with some spare time and a desire to learn you can do those too.
2. A good place to start is HTML and CSS. Too many web devs can't do CSS worth a damn. Both of them are pretty easy to wrap your mind around and pretty essential in my opinion. After getting a firm grasp, then I'd move to more server-side learning. I personally started in PHP and was happy to have done so. I think it's among the easiest to pick up. As far as a first database, I'd say start with MySQL. You'd be hard pressed to find any major app that doesn't use MySQL in at least some minor way. Be sure not to neglect JavaScript either. One of my former colleagues made a very astute observation that knowing JavaScript will likely make you the most money. First because no matter the back-end language, you're always going to be using JavaScript on the front-end and with node.js occasionally on the back-end. And secondly, they're just aren't as many good JS devs as there are jobs for them.
3. Keep your LinkedIn up to date. I can't tell you how many awesome opportunities I've gotten because of this. It's not just Joe's Dev Shack in Timbuktu that's calling (though he does call), but cool new start-ups and cool tech-giants calling too. I've interviewed with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla Motor Company, SpaceX, Amazon, and some other really cool companies. Where did they all find me? LinkedIn. Every time.
4. Going back to experience, open-source work does indeed substitute for real job experience. I'm not great at this because I don't contribute regularly to any particular open-source project, but I have hired based on it. Contract work (as in small, one-off jobs for Consuela's Maid Service made in Wordpress in a week) does not substitute. I rarely bring those up, if ever, in a professional interview.
5. Look for internships if you can't get a junior position. Maybe the pay isn't great, but the experience and the résumé material is far, far more valuable than any sum of money they could offer you.
6. When you do get hired somewhere, find somewhere where there is a deficiency of knowledge and become an expert in it. At one of my companies, we were going forward with the idea of using MongoDB as the database. The issue was that none of the devs had any experience using it. These are opportunities to make yourself indispensable to your company. I went on a weekend coding bender and built an entire app using MongoDB and by the end I was pretty proficient at it. By the end of my tenure with the company, I was still known as the MongoDB guy.
7. Keep up to date on new technologies. Occasionally have a weekend when you lock yourself in a room and build a whole new app just to learn a new technology. When I got one of my jobs, I didn't know the back-end language of what was being used there. However, the weekend previous I had just gone on a node.js bender (despite the fact that it really had little to do with the then-present job.) That fact that I showed I picked up on a new language over a weekend was enough to convince him that I would have little issue working in a new language.

18ty5l,2,2013-02-19,When do you accept a lower standard for your life?,jasperjohnn,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18ty5l/when_do_you_accept_a_lower_standard_for_your_life/,"I graduated from high school in 2001, near the top of my class, just outside the prestigious bubble. I went to a good-not-great private local college (pretty well known for academics and basketball - highly regarded in New England). Studied political science and took a few computer science classes though I didn't finish the minor. At this time you weren't seen as a leech on society when studying liberal arts. (Much better days) 

I applied for job after job and had interview after interview but ended up working at a bookstore for two years after graduation before landing a professional job. I moved out, started law school the following year (while working - so nights at a good school, but not the best I got into because they only had day programs). This is 2008. Bad timing. 

I was laid off after my first year, unable to find work. I moved back in with my parents. I finished law school, but not well. I was miserable all the time and my grades were all over the map. This put me well into the bottom half of my class. And by this point, the legal market had collapsed so only top 1% got internships, jobs, etc.

Since being laid off in 2009 I haven't have full-time work. I've had a few part-time jobs that were temporary. Do a bit of freelance and have done a lot of work for free as ""internships"" with companies (not in law) that ""could lead to pay"" but never have. 

I'm turning 31 this year. I am not medically depressed or suicidal but I hate my life. My peers all kept their jobs through the recession, have mostly gotten married, and are having kids. I'm barely scraping by and it's killing me. I share an apartment with my younger brother now, so not at home, so at least there's that. Until he gets married.

I still feel like I'll find a real job again with the economy on the mend, but I have big loans and am almost 10 years older than all the people I'm applying against because my work history is so hit or miss.

When do you just give up on your life goals and settle for less? I probably won't get married at this rate, I won't be able to afford a house, I'm almost as old as my parents were when I was born and every day it gets worse. 

I have been rejected for jobs so nicely I have wanted to beg the person. Say I'd work for less. Just for something. Just so I could start to scratch my way back into the world.

I accept my failure. I studied subjects without jobs. I took on debt to make my legal dream come true only to have it go as poorly as possible. 

I seem people with my same background in the jobs I apply to. I feel like I'm on the right track. It's just like that Futurama episode, one flip of a coin, and I'm losing each flip the last few years.

TL;DR
having a crisis at 30. wasted money on law school right before economic collapse."

I stuck around an extra year because my University offers an IT Specialization -- I wanted something on my resume to reflect my interest in the tech field, but I don't want to commit to a new major (I wish I would have started as CS). The only real advantage of the specialization is I learned some Python which helps me understand programming much better than I did before.

I plan on taking an iOS boot camp course and being active on GitHub over the next year. I'll be 23 in April and by the time I feel like I'll be sufficiently qualified to work at a top tech company I'll be around 25. 

Is that too old compared to someone who's 22 just coming out of college with potentially multiple internships? I'm trying to gauge my expectations and I just want them to be realistic. 

Thanks for the help, I know these things kind of pop up all the time. I know what I need to do to get a job... I just want to know how much age is a factor I suppose. Thanks for the insight! "

Part 2: Recovery


Enter seddit.  I slowly rose from the ashes, reading post after post about being high value, openers, keeping conversation going, body language, etc.  I started learning to refine what I'd already done naturally before, and attained results more consistently.  Being on my own helped me work on myself more, and I started getting better at pickup over the summer.  I began meeting a bunch of new people, and I soaked in all the wonderful advice.  However, I was doing it for the wrong reasons.  I read the posts but didn't fully understand them.  I saw seddit as a ""shortcut"" for sleeping with women.  I didn't understand what being an alpha male truly entailed.  I was running game and getting better, but getting more and more frustrated with rejection because I became so focused on the end game.  I did improve however, and by the end of the summer, I'd slept with more girls than I had in my entire life combined.  Yet, there was no further interaction with any of these women, I could turn them on but after that they'd be gone.  Everything felt so empty.  I didn't realize how easily they noticed I was still in love with somebody else when we'd be cuddling after sex.  They knew I was gaming them for self-validation, I was just able to keep it holed up until we'd be talking late at night and the real me would come out.  My front came crashing down once I reached that intimate point.  I thought sleeping with women would conquer my oneitis like so many sedditors had said.  I couldn't figure out what was driving this black hole of rejection and sadness.

Summer ends and the semester starts.  At this point I was a wreck, I still had feelings for her and even improving my game was making me more depressed.  I was so confused.  One day as I'm studying she called me and told me she wanted to see me.   We were living in the same city finally, and being my AFC self, I gladly invited her over.  She told me how she was still dating that guy but she had been having regrets the entire time.  I was crushed by the news and I tried to be strong by pushing her away and refusing to get back with her.  I told her about a girl I'd recently slept with and was starting to get to know better, and she went home shattered.  The next day I got a message from her boyfriend who angrily accused me of stealing his girlfriend which I laughed at considering I could say he did the same.

She came over that night, and that's when I left my self-respect behind.  I took her back.  We kicked it off right away, I forgave her for everything and we went right back to our old selves.  She lived at my place for an entire semester.  I was so happy, it was amazing, I had gotten my second chance and my life was back on track.  The depression was gone, so I stopped looking to improve myself.  That's where it all went wrong.  I went back to my old ways, I didn't feel the need to go out because previously the only purpose was to find women to sleep with.  Things went back into motion so quickly, and she felt super guilty about what she'd done so she tried really really hard to please me all the time.  This completely blinded me to my prior errors, and I reverted back to my content self, not creating any excitement, not pushing harder in school, playing a bunch of video games, just smoking with my closest friends every once in a while.  She became the reason behind everything I did, and I lost sight of everything else again.  It's crazy how obsessed I was.  As long as we were having sex and hanging out, I didn't need anything else.  

We both went back to our home town to visit family for winter break.  She broke up with me a day before we went back, all her stuff was still in my place.  This was a month and a half ago.  Turns out she had been cheating on me with the same guy and left me for him, AGAIN.  I had repeated my mistakes, and had become even more of an AFC during the time.  I had gotten her back into my life, and she became a bigger crutch for self validation than ever before.  

Before we'd become intimate I was a leader, confident, independent, outgoing, opinionated, smart, and willing to do anything to get what I wanted.  When I finally got the opportunity with her after waiting an entire childhood though, keeping her around became more important than everything in my life before then.  I lost all my other passions because I was so determined not to lose her.  When she left me the first time I didn't know how to handle it, I became a mess.

I was so caught up with her, that I became a needy person and it had only got worse after spending an entire summer failing to fix it.  When she came back to fix her ""mistake"", she found a weak beta looking for a girl to hold on to make him feel better about himself.  I had completely lost everything that had attracted her to me in the first place because I let myself be defeated by what she'd done to me.  I'm surprised she even lived with me as long as she did.  Had I been the person I am today, she never would've even considered leaving me.

This past month and a half has been brutal.  I let myself fall into the depressed state again, and it was worse than ever.  I was even suicidal.    I'd been browsing seddit on and off, but I wasn't myself at all.  I couldn't even pull myself to go out.  Women were repelled at even greater rates than ever before.  I wanted to drop out of school.  I was back at square one, and completely lost.  At this point I decided something had to be done, I couldn't live my life being dependent on her to feel good about myself.  I hated feeling so weak.  Luckily I'm passionate about school, and my Computer Science professors began to send plenty of my work my way as the semester picked up.  I was a complete mess still, but I kept myself busy and stopped thinking about everything else.  I spent the month alone mostly, trying to figure out what was wrong with me.  I began going to meditation sessions to clear my head.  I applied to a couple of internships, and finished my work early.

One day I tried texting her, and all I got for a reply was that she was in love with that other guy and that I needed to leave her alone.  I holed myself up and cried the rest of the day like a loser.  It was at that point when I broke.  I went off the edge and I considered ending my life.  It was drenched in tears, sobbing all alone in my bed when I realized something.  My entire life everyone had been telling how intelligent I was, what a good friend I was, what a great lover I was, how much I had going for me.  I didn't realize how much that had gotten to my head.  It's funny how no one ever tells you how you're going to get there, they just assume you've already got it made.  As if I never had to work for what I had.  

Everyone always believed in me, but at the time I thought it was just something that came naturally like everything else about my life.  I never understood that everyone had been talking about the strong person that I used to be.  I thought it was something I was born with, not something I had earned by being the confident passionate person I had been my entire life.  I was always reaching further than everyone else, working harder, and I never doubted myself.  That's why I accomplished everything I did, never had trouble in any area of life, and always women around.  I inspired people to better themselves, everyone was always trying to keep up and I had fun staying one step ahead.  I had thrown that all away because I thought this girl was more important than myself.  I had stopped my own ascent of self-improvement that had enabled me to do all the great things I've done.

Finally we get to the present.  This week has been crazy.  I just landed a research position with a professor at my school, and I got a potential job offer at a startup that just raised $18 million in venture capital last week.  I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in two weeks, and I finally found myself again.  I've reconnected with all my friends, cut my hair shorter then it's been since I was in 6th grade, and my approach anxiety is completely gone.  Women everywhere have been noticing me again, and I don't have trouble talking to any girl I want at any time of day.  I finally opened my eyes again and realized that I am worthy of attaining whatever I want in this world as long as I'm willing to work for it.  I don't need somebody to tell me I'm going places, I KNOW that I am and I'll be damned if I let anyone stop me.  I don't need any external validation anymore because I finally understand how important it is to have validation from within.  I no longer need to seduce women because I have become confident enough to be myself again.  All those posts about high value finally make sense to me.  I've stepped foot into my natural alpha state and it feels damn good to be focused on my passions again.  I've gained back my self-respect by reaching further than I ever have before, and BIG things are happening in my life because of it.  I've never been more excited for the future in my entire life, and it feels incredible to be a source of inspiration for other people again.  Never again will I believe somebody when they tell me I'm not good enough, because I know that's bullshit.  I'm done sitting back and waiting for my life to reach that point that everyone has always talked about.  I'm taking my life back right NOW.  

Thank you seddit for all your wise advice and for your patience in reading this.  I never could have gotten back into state if it wasn't for all of you.  For all those who didn't bother reading the wall of text, learn to have faith in yourself and nothing in life is ever going to stop you.  Everybody always talks about how important confidence is, but no one can teach that to you.  Get out and accomplish something, you're never going to convince others that you're something worth fighting for unless you've PROVED it to yourself.  Work every single day on being a better person, be healthy, and do stuff that you're truly passionate about.  If you don't reach out and take what you want it's always going to pass you by.  Don't stop believing in yourself, and focus on one step at a time.  Go talk to that cute girl you saw on campus today, she'll never have any idea how wonderful you are unless you go and SHOW her.  The way I see it, you can mope around and feel sorry for yourself or you can get off your ass and start becoming the person you've always wanted to be by working at it everyday.  TRULY believe that you ARE that amazing person, and one day you won't have to tell yourself anymore, it'll be apparent in every aspect of your life.  Your aura alone will begin to inspire the people around you, and the energy you radiate will attract more friends than you know what to do with.  If you want to be a social person, you have to learn to just let go and be authentic.  When you are genuinely satisfied with who you are, you'll never hesitate to go talk to that beautiful girl who just smiled at you from a distance because you won't be afraid anymore.  No woman can ever take away your accomplishments, your intellectual passions, or your value because they all come from within.  Stop feeding off other people's value, and become someone who takes joy in sharing their abundance with others.  Lastly, never stop striving for more.  The only limits are the ones you impose on yourself.  Anything is possible if you're willing to do what it takes."

I'm 27 years old, married, graduated from med school in May '12, and am now working as an intern. I'm very torn with what to do with my finances at the moment. Before I start asking questions here's a breakdown of my wife and I's income and debt and a little about our goals. 

* Income: 80,000 combined
* Student Loan Debt: 126,000 combined student loans (108,000 of it mine)
* Other Debt: 6 more months of $150/mo car loan at 3.2% ($900 total)
* Savings: 2000 emergency fund
* Index funds: 5500
* IRA: 1000

About 88,000 of my student loans are at 6.55%. The rest of our student loans are at 5% or lower. 

We live relatively modestly and pay just over 1,600 dollars per month on our student loans, with everything more than the minimum payment going towards the 6.55% loans. Up until very recently I've felt this is the smartest thing to do financially. In fact, I was even planning on just applying the $150/mo I'm spending on the car loan towards my student loans when the car is paid off. 

In 4-5 years I will finish my residency training and make somewhere in the ballpark of 200-250k. We don't want children, and do want to retire very early (45 years old or so). Our plan is to keep our current lifestyle once I enter practice and put as much away as possible to retire on. 

Now for the questions. Should I keep paying so much on the student loans now, or start investing and saving more? I know you're supposed to do whatever brings the greatest increase in net worth, but the reason I have so many high interest student loans is because I had and continue to have no equity. Plus, I've made almost 8% on the S&amp;P 500 index fund since August. We also take a big hit in taxes being DINKs and all. Should I take the money I'm putting towards loans and put it toward my 401k (I have no employer contribution, but it'd be pre-tax)?

Any and all help is appreciated.

18sfg4,0,2013-02-18,My Crazy fantasy ending for The Office,kitanakinz,DunderMifflin,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/18sfg4/my_crazy_fantasy_ending_for_the_office/,"This is my first post so be easy on me.This is just my opinion no one go crazy.
Here it goes....
The show is finally televised, it becomes a hit on tv making everyone from the office famous. In the first weeks of the show they become a hot topic in pop culture and are becoming a household name in the american home. 
Dunder Mifflin at this time is the same as always and not growing as a company. Andy is having problems managing the Scranton branch.
Michael Scott becomes the most famous out of all of them and everyone that was on the show becomes wealthy from the new found fame. 
Jim decides to come to Scranton because he realizes that the show has given him enough money that he can quit Athlead and go back home to settle with the life he had. 
Michael comes back to Scranton.
Toby reveals that he is the Scranton strangler out of a raged outburst when Michael arrives.This is due to his jealousy of Michael's huge fame. So he reveals himself so he can gain more fame for himself.
Michael goes to David Wallace and asks for them to be partners in owning Dunder Mifflin and says that he will pay for the costs of expanding Dunder Mifflin into a big chain store. He tells him that they will not only sell paper and printers but computers and have a cafe. A lounge cafe. So that people can make business lunches with clients, but also use Dunder Mifflin products in the cafe like the computers and paper so that clients of all businesses can show each other business ideas or presentations on PowerPoint. Michael comes up with the idea from his love of mixing fun to the work place, making business that is boring to him more social. He always thought the office is a family so he introduces a place where you can have the tools to do serious things and lounge and have snacks and drinks with coworkers or clients. 
David Wallace accepts the idea although it is very risky, because he took a risk with suck it and succeeded. He says they would be a perfect team because he is logical and Michael is creative.
They tell the office about what they plan to do and everyone in the office wants to put in there money to be apart of it. 
Michael tells Ryan to come back to Scranton and that he will hire him and Kelly if they decide to be apart of it. 
Holly and Michael move to Scranton. 
From all of there new found fame they get lots of investors in the new business and decides to make Dunder Mifflin International.

Flash Forward, to present day a salt and pepper haired looking Andy walks out of the airport. He is holding a little boy in a colorful suit and a bow tie and they both follow a beautiful red headed woman. They run to a town car. They finally reach their destination and walk towards a very tall building and on the first floor is a famous store, it is a hybrid between a Staples an Apple store a Starbucks and a Dave and Busters. They walk in and go to the counter and a Young woman says ""Hello Mr.Bernard i have your beet scones and coffee ready upstairs i just sent it up."" Andy says "" Wow your getting big huh? give us a hug! why are you behind the counter today aren't you coming up with us?. Young woman says ""yah i just have to get someone to cover the counter for me. How is Andrea?."" Andy says "" shes at band camp for the summer. But don't worry we are going to bring her for Christmas to play the cello you know how your uncle Mike loves that. I heard you been seeing Dwight's son."" Young girl says "" Yeah my mom said that if i marry D.J. my dad will have a heart attack. Last week me and D.J. hid the coffee beans bag so that when the new intern had to make coffee he would have to go to the back of the store to get more. Brian's daughter Sam recorded the whole thing and put it up on Youtube. We got in trouble and my dad said we always cause trouble and Hank is to old to run after us."" Andy laughs and says "" Lets go upstairs together CiCi we are going to be late."" they hug and talk while going up to the second floor. 

They enter a big cafeteria what looks to be still a few remains of an old office. In it there is one room that use to be a conference room that says ""T.V. ROOM"" on it. It is so full that teens and toddlers are sitting on the floor. Everyone smiles and cries out ""Hi"" and Andy passes all of the people from his old office to say hello. They are all wearing a name tag. Dwight, Jim, and Andy wear a name tags that say COO, CFO and CTO. Others have Name tags that say Accounting Executive ,  Quality Assurance Executive, Sales Executive, Customer service Executive. Michael has a dvd in his hand and his daughter says "" Dad can i have some of your coffee"" Holly says "" You don't want that trust me."" The girl sips the mug that says Worlds Best CEO on it she spits a little on the floor. Holly says ""Honey, that's your dads milk and sugar"". Philip is sitting on the floor and says ""HEY YOU GOT SOME MILK ON ME!"". Meanwhile Dwight says ""MICHAEL THIS PLACE IS A DEATH TRAP"". Pam says "" Yeah Michael why didn't we do this in one of the big conference rooms!. We have at least 4 in this building!."" Everyone starts to argue, and Michael screams ""SHUUUUU---Shuuuttt shhutt it"" Michael is next to a T.V. on the wall trying to put a dvd in it. He cant reach and gets annoyed and says "" Who put this so damn high"" Erin replies "" You told Nate to put it high so it looks bigger because you said that you wanted a t.v. bigger than 80 inches and we could'nt find one.' Michael screams ""Can someone put the damn dvd in please? Not you Gabe you'd just mess it up, your worst then Toby. 

The Video Plays with a tune and then it starts with a bathroom sign with the words The Office on it.Then our tv screens go to black.
 
Sorry this post was so long and so different from the normal ideas of how the office should end."

But if you have any you think would be more helpful please let me know.)

I really need help. 

My anger has ruined my life. It is ruthless, cruel, and unstoppable.
The best way I can explain it is that my anger is like boiling water. It slowly builds until it overflows and burns. 

Just last night, I tried to beat my boyfriend up. I punched walls until my knuckles were bleeding. I threw my phone, multiple pieces of furniture, and hid in a corner banging my head against the wall. This is even harder to admit but I have done self harm (cutting) and woke up not knowing what I had done. I hate it.

I cannot stop. I cannot stop. I want to so bad and it just gets worse. I really do not remember everything I do. It is terrible and I am ashamed.

I cannot focus in school. My boyfriend is afraid of me. My mother is miserable.

I am miserable. 

I have hidden it from my friends and family but they can now tell something is wrong. I have fully admitted that I have a problem but no one knows what to do. I have always been angry but over the past six months, my anger has become another person.

As a broke, college student without insurance, I am so lost. 

I have been to a free weekly therapy session through my university. It only helps so much. My therapist/counselor is an intern and unsure what to do with me. She is kind but I can tell I overwhelm her.

I do not know whether I need therapy or a complete brain transplant. My mother believes I have a hormone imbalance. She thinks it is something biological. My boyfriend and intern therapist think I have just held in too much and now it has exploded.

This angry person is not me. She is the cruel She Hulk. I cannot control her anymore. 



My questions:

* Should I see a doctor, therapist, hormone doctor or someone else?

* Is there anyone out there with this kind of crazy, uncontrollable hulk anger? What helps you?

* Does anyone out there have a hormone imbalance and receive shots? Have you behaved in this hulk-manner?

* **What do I do?**

The thing is, my school's contacts for computational chemistry don't have space anymore. I recently (by recently i mean this monday) learned about SURF, but apparently all positions which have replied to my emails, have been filled for months. I have an option in Rice university, but he hasn't answered, and he's only doing his PhD so i doubt he has too much power.

I have other options available, mainly due to friends of mine who have done summer internships in the past, but they're not for what i want the most. There's some at ASU and some in El Paso (i don't know the university's name), but they're in organic and inorganic synthesis.

So does anyone know of a good place to start, i'm trying all options and it's getting to a point when i might just start emailing my friends' contacts, which is why i have come to you for help.

Sex life continues to decline.,[deleted],DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18x0jx/how_can_i_handle_my_high_libido_and_be/,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post this.   We're both in college, I'm 22(F) and he's 25, been together 2 years. Due to our home situations, we only see each other on the weekends. We would usually have sex every day that we could, and then about a 7-8 months ago it started slowing down. Now we're at a once every other weekend, and I can tell that he's forcing it half the time. He says it's due to stress from school. He also recently started an internship (his first job) and that's taken a huge toll on his energy, even on weekends. I really want to be understanding, but it feels like something new always comes up to stress him out. He feels more distant than usual, but he assures me that he still loves me more than ever. I've talked to him about it but all he really says is that I pressure him when I initiate. He says that if we lived together, it would be different because I would be around when he's actually in the mood as opposed to me only being there twice a week. But we won't be graduated until late this year and I'm worried about how he'll handle things like a full time job, taking care of bills, and all the other things that come with it.  My question is, should I continue to be patient with him and focus on being supportive until we actually have the opportunity to move in together? Another question is: talking to him about it seems to stress him out more, which is the opposite of what I want to do. I want to give him his space and let him handle this on his own, but my sexual needs haven't been properly met in months and it's driving me crazy. I've been masturbating, but what I really miss is being close and intimate with him. Is there a way to talk to him about this without putting more pressure on him?"

I was so excited to come to college this past fall because it would be my first time out on my own, making my own decisions -- my first foray into adulthood and independence! After the first few exciting weeks, the activities started to die down and the real grind of work kicked in, along with some crippling homesickness. My parents have always been two of my best friends. When I was in high school and got ditched by some of my friends for more exciting plans, my parents would spend their whole weekends hanging out with me. My mom and I would get our nails done together, and we'd shop, and we'd have a grand old time. I really look up to and respect my mom. There are a lot of qualities about her that I want to see myself with one day. She's a great role model, and we love each other very much.

The problem is, we're not on the same page about something in particular: the very independence I was so excited to start experiencing last fall. In my opinion, I'm eighteen (I have been for some time) and living away from home for most of the year -- I should be able to operate sort of autonomously, without much interference from her. She texts me every day. Last weekend, she asked if it was OK for her to come visit me at college even though I'm coming home for a break next weekend. I have no classes on Fridays, but when I had a school-sanctioned break that really only consisted of a Friday free of classes (plus Saturday and Sunday off) she insisted I come home to visit. And even now, I'm working on a play (theatre major) that has rehearsals over Spring Break, and she expects me to tell them that my mom wants me home for the week, so I can't come back to my college town early. I've tried explaining that I need some space, especially when it comes to establishing my professional reputation (and that no professional director is going to take ""my mom won't let me"" as an excuse for an absence), but she takes it all so personally and thinks I don't want to be around her. Over Christmas Break, my boyfriend deployed overseas, and she would sort of make me feel guilty for spending so much time with him before he left because it meant that I wasn't spending it with her. The thing is though, when we spend time together, it typically just consists of us sitting in the living room on our computers watching TV. I mean, I love my mom, and spending time with her is important to me, but I feel like I'm being smothered a little. What if I just wanted to stay at school over spring break and enjoy the introvert time? I can't imagine her being okay with that. And, one day soon, I'll probably want to spend a summer away from home working at an internship or something like that, but I'm not sure I could even try to broach that topic without her getting upset. 

There's also the issue of my boyfriend (22). I feel like my parents should have no say in how I choose to conduct myself with my boyfriend. I'm on the pill, we're monogamous, and we love each other. My parents like him a whole lot, they think he's good to me, and they're totally fine with us dating, but they act like I'm still this pure thing that needs to be protected from all men. They're not even religious in the slightest, but they act like they have to protect my (long-gone) flower with all they've got. He and I are going on a trip together this summer with some friends, and the only way to get my parents to agree to letting me go with them was to assure them that he and I would not be sharing a room. He's in the military, and before his current deployment, I wanted to go to see him for a couple days before he left. He had a hotel room and arrangements were all made, but they refused to let me stay with him and made me stay with my grandparents who live nearby the base. Before he freakin' deployed! There's no way they can think that I'm not having sex with this man that I love, and there's no way that they can actually think that them forbidding me to sleep in the same bed as him a couple important nights before he left (for months) would keep me from doing it. My mom even knows that I stay at his apartment many nights when he and I are both at school. I know for a fact that my parents were living together for at least a year before they were married. They can't be oblivious. I think they just don't want to think about it. I also think that the actions that occur in my relationship should be none of their business. I know they're uncomfortable with that, so I'd never go against their wishes in their house (and I've told them that), but I think they need to butt out. 

There's definitely a double-standard between how my parents treat my brother (21) and how they treat me. I get that he's older, so they give him a lot more space, but when he was my age, they never asked where he was going at night. Occasionally they'd ask who he was going to be with, but for the most part, they just assumed they'd see him sometime. He'd ignore their texts and calls for weeks at a time, and though I saw how much it hurt my parents to feel like he was cutting them out, they started letting him do his own thing. Currently, he's not in school and he's living at home while he's saving up money, but he spends every night at his girlfriend's apartment. They realize this, but shrug it off because they ""cant control what he does."" I certainly don't want to hurt them and make them feel like they're not important to me anymore, but I don't know how to set the boundaries of my own life. 

Basically, I guess I'm just worried that my mom (and my dad, I suppose) still thinks of me as a child that she needs to check in on. I know I'll always be her baby, and I like that. My mom's a really cool gal. But I pretty much view myself as an adult. I know that I probably sound like a whiney teenager right now, but I really need some advice from you all who have had to do this. I definitely don't want to cut the cord with my mom, because I want her in my life, but I need to feel like I'm on my own, or I'll never learn how to be independent. 

Sorry for the long rant, and I'm really sorry if I sound dumb and stupid. Any advice is helpful. Thanks, twox."

Trying to breathe and not stress. Last time I was overcome with stress, I had panic attacks. And then having panic attacks stressed and freaked me out... It was a vicious cycle. I don't want to go back there. 

But I have been struggling with my brain and how foggy and tangled it is constantly. It all makes me feel so nauseated sick and also frustrated with myself. Stuff like this, anyone could make the decisions and take the steps. I want so much for everything to just be strands of yarn, simple and pointed out and clear. Instead, my brain takes everything and tangles it up in one ginormous ball and as I try to untangle, it just spins around and around.

My older sister wants to help me. I live with her and help take care of her two sons. She knows about my depression and wants to help me be active. Right now, she is making a nanny contract to help me. She wants me to tell her soon if I'll accept. 

What I struggle with is the fact that I don't want to live here anymore. I can't stand her arrogant and egocentric husband, I can't stand the days just passing with nothing to live for. I want to move out and live on my own or with my friend. But I can't because my dog. So until (and I really don't want this day to ever come) he dies... I'm stuck somewhere that'll let him live with me. I'm so unhappy here. I don't like going out of my room. I'm lost on this.

That's the tangible thing. My mind is cluttered with pain and frustration from my situations and past. I feel sick with myself. I just feel like a wanderer. No parents, no place that I feel like I'm home... I'm just one big ball of worthlessness and pain and hurt and lies. I feel nothing positive. And I just want to go to sleep till everything is how it's supposed to be or for everything to just stop. For me to just stop being. Because the journey to how things are supposed to be feels like walking around in a dark and empty land, like I'll never get there. I need to get there though. I don't want to end up living like this another day, let alone forever.

So this is my tangled web of a brain and heart. It's actually pretty clearer than what I thought I would write.

**A little on my life: 

-I've been struggling with depression for about 8 years

-Mom was severely physically and emotionally abusive, my three sisters and I were removed from her custody the summer before my senior year. Now 2 years out of high school

-Father left at 6, back at 10 and left at 12 on Christmas Eve.

-Raised and took care of three sisters while living with my mom. Used to taking care of myself and being left alone.

-Last year, I was in an internship. Lived with a family for about 6 months when I decided to move in with mom to try to mend the relationship. She drank a lot and we argued. She kicked me out with no notice within 3 months.

Any advice or comments are well welcomed. Thank you"

I am new to this subreddit so please direct me elsewhere if I am lost.

My business partner and I started up a small video production company just over a year ago. Over the course of that year, we have discovered that the people that we most want to provide media for are other small start-ups, non-profits, local artists/musicians (who self-promote and give back to the community), and we also enjoy helping students get on their feet in a real world environment (internships, training).

I have been toying with the idea to somehow work it out so we operate as a non-profit, but instead of giving away food/shelter/etc., we give away media (which, let's be honest, get's expensive!). This combines our two goals - helping those that need a leg up, and doing the media work we love.

Is this a viable goal? How would we get this in order?

Thanks in advice for any help or advice! Still trying to get our feet on the ground over here. :)"

Oh, and you need personal projects to show that you're passionate about programming. Like college applications all over again.~~

On a bright note, I actually deeply enjoy school and developing my practical coding skills in my free time. It's just that getting an internship is such a hit-and-miss game, and I'm starting to get desperate because most companies supposedly are full for the summer. For example, I'm waiting for a reply from Bloomberg after a coding interview last week, but there's no guarantee they'll reply or that I'll even be progressing in the interview process. Maybe I could shoot out more applications to companies (I've only applied to 10 or so, after all), but that's time better spent studying and coding, or maybe I could try for Google's Summer of Code but there are no guarantees I'll get anything.

TL;DR. Is this internship rush normal? Do people really spam internship applications and get used to rejection? Maybe my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bget8b4kz4t4b3o/example_resume.pdf) sucks, or maybe I should network more, I don't know. I'm just really lost."

I recently graduated from college a couple months ago with a B.S. degree in EE. I'm currently searching for hardware engineer/EE positions and have been applying for posted positions on company websites and on LinkedIn. I even tried putting my resume on job sites like Monster and CareerBuilder, but I've only been getting phony sales/recruiting job offers via email and phone. So far, I haven't had any luck. 

In terms of waiting time, a website once told me that 40 days after the original job posting, if you don't hear back from the job, then it's safe to assume that the position has been filled (or no longer available). **What's a good rule of thumb when applying for jobs to safely assume that the position is no longer available?** I keep hearing different things. What about applying to jobs and internships on LinkedIn? I have a well-polished profile and a decent amount of connections which are mostly classmates, friends, and family. I heard that recruiters browse around on LinkedIn a lot and they usually look for those with recommendations. I know it's helpful to have them, but is it really needed?

I also heard that in order to get the first job, you must have experience, which most people get from internships/co-ops while they're still in school. Since I'm a couple months out of school, do I still have a chance of getting an internship after college? I heard that they usually only want college students with 3.00+ for internships. I'm aware that around this time is internship application season and I've applied to a couple internships. However, only one of them replied asking for my GPA, which isn't that impressive (2.77/4.00). **How do I get a post-college internship with such a GPA?** I feel embarrassed and awkward to put it on my resume or even mention it. However, if I don't put it on, it'll be assumed that my GPA is even worse than it actually is. Besides my poor GPA, I have nothing else to hide. 

All I want now is an opportunity to gain some relevant experience so that I can eventually get my first job. "

In 2011 I opened a Roth IRA (without brokerage ability) at Vanguard with wages from my summer internship and put in as much as I could.  I've since graduated, got a job, and maxed contributions for 2012 and 2013.  

I figured it wasn't much of my mom's business what I did with money, but she casually mentioned to me that I had a Roth IRA.  I was puzzled how she knew I had opened one, but it turns out she was speaking of another Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade opened by my grandfather without my knowledge.  He never put in much money...100 dollars here, 100 dollars there for Christmas or Birthday.  I'm in the process of gaining control of the funds here.

I have also opened a separate brokerage account with TD Ameritrade.

The TD IRA is at approximately 3000 dollars and my Vanguard IRA is at approximately 13,000

I know that I can have multiple Roth IRAs so long as yearly contribution is &lt;5500, but it seems to me that it would make sense to consolidate this money in one way or another.  

The options that become apparent to me are these:
1) Roll TD Ameritrade Roth IRA over into my Vanguard Roth IRA

2) Roll Vanguard Roth IRA over into TD Ameritrade Roth IRA

3) Withdraw contributions from one of my IRAs and roll over/take penalties on earnings, and invest contributions in my brokerage account.

I'd rather not pay any fees or lose money, but to me it doesn't make sense to me to keep 2 separate IRAs going as the funds are not easily transferrable to me. 

I would appreciate your guys' opinions on this subject. 

Thanks!"

I’m currently in my junior year as an economics major at Columbia University and am planning to pursue my school’s combined degree program with SEAS starting next year. Unfortunately, one of the aspects of the combined program is that I must choose an engineering major in advance and do not have an opportunity to change majors once I make my selection.

To that end, I was hoping I could get some of your opinions about what path I should pursue. The two majors I am currently most drawn to are Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, but that is not to say I’m not interested in other fields as well. The only majors I’m really not terribly interested in are Applied Math/Physics, Civil, Environmental, and Financial.

For a little background about me, after high school I served 5 years in the Army as an infantryman, radio-telephone operator, and drone pilot. I’ve been at Columbia for the past two and a half years, and had originally planned to work in finance upon graduation, but after experiencing the industry through recent internships I’ve realized that I’m not at all interested in the work.  

It would probably help to list some of my motivations for studying engineering in the first place, so below is a very non-exhaustive list of my interests:

Augmented Reality,
Automation,
Artificial Intelligence,
Cloud Computing,
Educational Technology,
Human-Computer Interaction,
Information Science,
Materials,
Powered Exoskeleton,
Prosthetics,
Weaponry

I suppose the common thread here (besides my status as a Heinlein enthusiast) is that I’m interested in making individuals more productive through the applications of technology.

I know that there isn’t a ton of demand for people to work in some of these fields, and I am definitely concerned about “real job” prospects upon graduation.

Thanks for your help!"

18wl12,5,2013-02-20,A new type of suicidal thoughts,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18wl12/a_new_type_of_suicidal_thoughts/,"First off, might as well give some basic information. I'm 21 and I've been plagued with these thoughts since I was in my early teens. I've been through years of therapy, tonnes of different anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, none of it really seemed to help that much at all. I've just learned to live with it. Even after going through all these different professionals I've still never been properly diagnosed as having anything other than a slight anxiety disorder. 

I do like therapy though, it's nice to have that, but since I'm out of work for the next month or so, I'm out of therapy until I get my insurance back and I haven't been on any pills for over a year now.

In the past I used to idealize suicide as an escape from the pain and monotony of living, but lately it has become a much more intriguing idea. Nothing is necessarily wrong in my life, in fact things are going pretty well. I hang out with my friends as much as I can, I'm doing well in my college courses, I have two possible internships lined up for the summer, I go back to work in a month or so as I previously stated, and lately I've been hooking up with this girl every other weekend or so when we both are free. Despite all this I still constantly live with these suicidal thoughts.

They just seem to be there, as they've always had. The more I think about them, the more interesting it seems to actually go through with it. I honestly just want these thoughts to stop. Everything is perfect and I hate it because at the end of the day I still wish to not wake up the next day. I exercise frequently, I eat healthily, but I do smoke cigarettes and drink. I do not know if that's a contributing factor, honestly it's been something that I've picked up in the last year and a half to help pass the time and help cope with the stresses of juggling relationships with friends and family, work, and college courses. 

In short I want to commit suicide as an escape from having suicidal thoughts rather than as an escape from living and I have never experienced this before. I do not know what to do. Maybe it's because I have too much free time now, maybe it'll go away for a little while when I go back to work, but I highly doubt it'll go away fully. 24 hours is a lot of time and I try to use it as to the best of my ability with reading, exercise, writing, Netflix, video games, school work, classes, hanging out with people, but no matter how I do I'm still left alone with these thoughts and I'm getting sick of it. It's as though I don't know how to be happy."

I've thought that one of the biggest things LoL lacked was a sandbox mode to test builds and matchups. I wanted to make one for quite a long time, but never had a good database to pull info from. Frustrated, I made my own (by scraping LoLWiki and the NA site itself). Not wanting to keep the goodies to myself, I exported the data into a handy API so that any other interested developers would be free to create as well. The system is easily patchable, so whatever you make with the data will always be up to date!

As of now, I've only had the time to make champ data for champions whos name starts with A (being a full time student at University, and all), but the data is to the point where it (probably) won't be changing anymore. I wanted to go ahead and post about it so that any other developers looking to use the API could provide feedback before it gets into too many hands. Now that I have the scripts written, getting the rest of the champ data in there won't be a big deal. ^(Oh, also, XML support is coming soon, so don't worry!)

The project is entirely open source. The code can be found at http://github.com/Xavdidtheshadow/lolapi and the live app (that doesn't do much (and isn't meant to, really; it's just for calling)) is at lolapi.herokuapp.com. 

Additionally, the sandbox is in that repo (battle.py). It's command line but quite easy to use. I'm actively working on it, so bugs'll disappear throughout the day. There are instructions to download and use it now, though a bit of programming experience is recommended (this'll be more accessible when it's done). 

Coincedentially, this is the centerpiece for my internship application at Riot, so any and all feedback is *greatly* appreciated.

Thanks much!

18wjrc,1,2013-02-20,"[Build Help] Here's an almost-complete gaming rig I'm looking at.  I'm very flexible with the price and parts, so critique would help.",Nohomobutimgay,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18wjrc/build_help_heres_an_almostcomplete_gaming_rig_im/,"Greetings. I'm looking to build an overclocked gaming rig that will also be used for programming and modeling, and of course internet browsing and media streaming.

Here is what I am going for:

* **Purpose:** *Gaming*--Skyrim, BF3, Crysis 3, blah blah blah all the good ones--on Ultra-high settings, or as close to it as possible; *programming and modeling*--engineering simulation programs for research; *entertainment* system in general--I'll be off on an internship for 8 months, so I'm looking to add a sound system for music and movies. The monitor will be my screen for movies, gaming, and my PS3.
* **Where?** I'm in the US, not by a Microcenter
* **Budget:** This is flexible, so I'll just put the budget at $1200. If you feel it's necessary, bump it up or bring down the price if it's possible.
* **What I need:** Keyboard and mouse, optical drive (with Blu-ray capability preferably), fans (fans fans fans!), wireless card, upgrade-able to watercooling in the future, possible addition of a second monitor in the future (so probably a second GPU to go with), a sturdy-looking case (get that Phantom crap out of my face), some color coordination with the parts--though I don't really care to make it look like a nightclub in my room with a bunch of LEDs 
* **What I have:** Monitor ([ASUS VH238H 23-Inch 1080P LED](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J6BIJ8/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)) and Win8 OS

I'm not committed to any parts, so please feel free to form and mold the design to how you see fit. The mobo says Microcenter below, but I'm going to go with Amazon. Let me know what you think. I appreciate your help.

18wckm,49,2013-02-20,Something is in my room.,GoldenCoin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18wckm/something_is_in_my_room/,"I have always been known for my creativity and my fantasy. When I was little, my fantasy used to spread around me at night or whenever I was bored. It was fun because I didn't have many friends to play with, but now it's killing my sanity. Sometimes when I look around I see dark spots or figures, I thought that it was because my eyes weren't clear any more so I shrugged this off.

Whenever I can't sleep I like to look around in my room or outside the window. I like how there's little to no light, but you can still make out the shapes and silhouettes of your possessions. How you can easily put a hand in front of your face and make that little bit of light ""Disappear"". Since some time I had some weird moments at night.

I would hear things fall from my desk. I first thought it was because of the fact that it was right under my bed, I sleep in a high sleeper, but I could never find what had fallen onto the ground. One time I heard one of my pencil jars fall, I got out of bed and turned on the light. There was nothing on the floor, my jar of pencils was sitting perfectly on my desk far away from the edge. I shrugged it off and went back to bed, it was too late to even deal with that. But now it started to get worse. My mom usually wakes me up in the weekends. I heard her once asking me kindly to get out of bed. I told her that I would be downstairs in a minute. I stayed in bed for a little longer before deciding to get out. I had a strange feeling that morning, but couldn't put my finger on it. On my way down my mother came up. ""Oh, you're awake, I was just about to wake you up!"" She smiled and went back down. She was planning on waking me, strange, she had just been in my room. That's when it hit me. I didn't hear her opening and closing my door. After breakfast I asked her if she had been in my room and was just messing with me on which she replied: ""No, I was here packing out the groceries."" I was confused and slightly disturbed, but shrugged it off anyway. This happened a few times more and then stopped.

Today it happened again. I woke up and checked the time. 5:40 AM. I turned around in my bed and before I could close my eyes again, I heard something. ""Are you coming?"" It was my sister's voice. I remembered that mom had asked her if she wanted to come with her to work, but that she had to wake up around 5:30 AM to do so. I turned around to tell her that I didn't had to wake up until an hour later, but there was nothing in my room. I heard my sister loud and clear as if she was standing just next to my bed, yet I was looking around in my room and nobody was there. 

I could make out the shapes of a chair with a pile of clothing, my small closet on which my aquarium stands, my fan and my desk chair. Again I got an eerie feeling, but went to bed anyway. I kept on thinking about it, when mom picked me up from the station I told her that I had heard my sister in my room around the time that she wakes up. Mom told me that my sister hadn't come with her since it was too early for her. 
At home my mom asked my sister who got confused. ""Could it be that I was sleepwalking?"" ""Well I turned and look in my room and-"" ""And? Was I standing there?"" ""No. There was nothing in my room."" My sister looked weird and confused, but we didn't talk about it any more and mom laughed it off telling me that I was just dreaming of my sister. I went back to my room and I probably wont be able to have a good night's rest. I am certain something was in my room. I know something was in my room. I know this, because I saw it. I don't know what it was, but I saw it and it probably saw me too. 

I was too sleepy to notice it at first, but I now know why it all felt so weird. I don't own an aquarium any longer. I got rid of it a few days ago. There is nothing on the spot where it used to be. But last night, something was sitting there. Something was watching. Something is in my room and it's watching me.

[UPDATE] Somebody has been in my room today. I came back from internship and found my desk chair in the middle of the room. It couldn't have been my father, he would've opened my curtains and complain about the mess in my room when he'd see me. My mother is also not possible, she would've told me so. There's only one person left, my sister, but she doesn't come into my room at all. She says my room is ""too cold to stand it for longer than a minute"" I actually don't notice my room being too cold. Maybe I am just losing my sanity.

[UPDATE] Why? Why did I have to double-check? I asked my mother if anybody as been in my room today. It turns out that nobody has been in my room. My mother and sister, who I freaked out a little bit, are saying that it was probably dad. He may have been on the level where I sleep, but I know my father well enough. I never open my curtains in the morning, if he had been in my room he would've opened them and left my door open. I just hope it was him, because I forgot to mention one big detail. (I thought it was useless) 

Now that night is almost here I really need this written down. The open little spot, that was created when my chair had been placed in the middle of my room, is actually right under the place where I have my head when I sleep. It's also right across from where my aquarium used to be. My chair was facing me when I came in, as if somebody could've been sitting there. Waiting for me. I don't know if I will get much sleep tonight.

[UPDATE] It may have left my room. I am not certain, but it could be running around the house. My mother said she heard somebody downstairs in the morning after I left yesterday. It was about 10 minutes after I left that she heard noises. She got up and checked downstairs, only to find nobody. If it had been me she should've seen me still closing all the doors on my way out."

* AMD Phenom X3 (don't remember spec, will retrieve in a week)

* AMD Phenom X4 (see above point) Both work

* Roughly 7GB combined DDR2 Desktop RAM

* Roughly 4GB combined DDR2 Laptop RAM

* [Kingston TurboChip AMD 166mhz Pentium compatible processor (for 486 systems) ] (http://www.oldcpu.cz/CPU/Kingston/TurboChip)

* (If absolutely necessary) Sega Dreamcast w\ 5 controllers, controller extenders, 4 knock-off VMUs, roughly 20+ games (5 burned games as well, total 25) tested working, needs new RTC battery (has modem)

~~* 2x Sony PS2 Slim w\ cables (one needs power button ribbon replaced, replacement included)~~ SOLD to /u/Sirc124

I can get pictures of some of these items, but most are at my parent's house while I""m at school. I will provide pictures if you are interested in the items.

Here's what I am needing: Either enough cash to ship my Xbox off to get reflowed\reballed, or someone who is willing to reflow\reball it for some of my stuff. (or someone who would give a discount if I shipped some hardware with it)

If someone is willing, I'll ship off the Xbox as part of a trade with other hardware for a working one too. It's an HDMI model (case was stolen from a guy on CL who said he'd fix it, ended up with a system with no thermal paste, and a non-hdmi case), still my board and matching ODD (BenQ). I wouldn't care what the replacement would be like, as long as it powers up, plays games, and uses a 175Watt power brick. "
18vyqy,2,2013-02-20,Just venting.  S.O. left me stranded after saying he wouldn't.,SuperAwkwardGirl,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vyqy/just_venting_so_left_me_stranded_after_saying_he/,"This is a little bit of a rant.  I'm just so mad right now that I need to vent.  Hope it's okay to do it here.  

So: my husband and I share a car, which is not a big deal most of the time.  Usually when I need the car, he takes his bike and when he needs the car I bike or take the bus.  And usually when I need the car for going someplace too far to bike/not easily bus-able, it's there.

Well, this morning, I had to be at my internship at 8:30, and although it is technically bus-able, it's a ten-minute drive or else almost an hour by bus due to the fact that buses in a small city aren't always the best, and we had talked last night and agreed that I would have the car, like I do every time I go to this particular internship site (I go to different sites on different days).  Anyway, at 8:15, I go to get in the car and discover that it's not there. Because he took it to work.  After saying that I could have it for the morning, and me scheduling myself based on having the car.

Anyway, I probably should have just gone to my internship late, although it would have been about an hour and a half late by the time I arrived (stupid bus schedule) for a three-hour shift, so I just called out and will make up the time later.  Which is embarrassing, because I was upset and didn't have the presence of mind to say I was sick, so I said I had no ride, but it's not the end of the world or anything, just kind of embarrassing.

Anyway, I am just SO MAD at husband.  SO MAD.  I know it's kind of petty to still be so mad, but it's also my career, and we talked about it last night, so I feel really disregarded, and also I was up early for what turned out to be no reason.  I know that it's not *that* early for most folks, but it is for me, due to crazy schedule that has me burning the candle at both ends.

Anyway, thanks for reading.  I feel like I want to smash something.  I'm sure I'll get over it, but right now I feel so angry and disregarded and there isn't really anything I can do about it.  "

",portofmorrow,UKJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/18vt3x/i_need_some_help_making_a_decision_im_in_a_good/,"So I have been doing internships/work experience since graduating last summer, and in the last month or so I've finally decided I've got enough experience to start applying for jobs. I want to work in Wealth Management for Private Clients, but have also been considering Financial Planning roles. So this week and next week I got about 6 interviews set up, some slightly more relevant than others.

On Monday I had a final interview for a Financial Planning assistant postion (A), and I found out yesterday I got it! Then on Tuesday I had a final interview with the Wealth Management company (B) I did my main internship with - I haven't heard that I got it yet but they told me I was pretty much a shoe in for the role, which was nice to hear. Tomorrow I have an interview with a firm (C) who are similar in size to A, and although I haven't heard much about them I looked them up and they are the 3rd highest rated company to work for in the UK (2012). 

I was going to cancel the interview tomorrow (and the ones next week), and then take the job from A if B reject me, or have the choice between the two if they don't - I'd probably pick B based on the role. The only thing is that B is a temporary role, and I'd have to interview again for a permanent position in 3 and 6 months time. This is worrying me quite a lot as I would really like some stability to look forward to. 

What should I do? My options are:

A) Cancel all further interviews including at C, wait to hear from B, make my decision.

B) Go to C tomorrow (I haven't prepped for the role at all yet), and potentially have to chose between 3 positions, even though I probably won't pick C if I have all 3 to chose from. If it was between A and C, maybe. 

C) Ring up B, tell them I have received an offer from A, ask what the status of my application is?


I know this seems a bit petty seeing as I've got some good options to pick from, but it is all happening very fast (both A and B would want me to start on Monday). I feel some very strong loyalty towards B as they had me in for my internship and have been very supportive, I'm only put off by the temporary status of the role. And the salary, I suspect it won't be as high as A.

18vl9f,1,2013-02-20,Not sure if I'm depressed or just becoming a f*ck up[lengthy read],[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18vl9f/not_sure_if_im_depressed_or_just_becoming_a_fck/,"I've been wanting to get this off my chest for awhile but didn't really know who or where to go, I can't talk about this with my family because they would hate my guts if I told them about some of this stuff. I figured this is a good place to start to get some insight to what I've been going through. 

I guess I will start with why I think that I'm depressed; I'm 22 and in my 4th year of college (on the 5 year plan) and the last year and a half have been full of new and exciting times in my life but at the same time I have never felt right about it. I originally went to community college for two years which was basically like high school as I was still living at home hanging out with the same people and doing most of the same stuff, but a year and a half ago I got to the breaking point to where I thought  I just had to get out of my situation. Keep in mind at this point my options were awesome, if I stayed in community college just one more year I would be able to transfer to some pretty nice schools such as UCSB, UCSD or UC Davis. I was just one year away but regrettably I opted out of the third year and transferred to where I am now (not going to say) but I transferred out of state and ended up going to literally one of the worst academically ranked colleges in the United States (I think it's 20-30 spots away from the worst school in the US.) I didn't know this at the time but had heard a lot of good things about the business school, and I am a sports fanatic and always wanted to go to a school with college football and basketball  which swayed my decision a little bit. Also, fuck it, I like to party every now and again. 

At this point you probably think I'm a complete retard, don't worry because I do too. I regret this decision everyday I wake up. I just think, what in the fuck am I doing here? Why the fuck am I so stupid? 

In CC I was a good student, I did all my work, studied everyday for hours, and ended up pulling a few semesters with 3.8+ and I believe I ended up with around a 3.4 or 3.5 before I left. Ever since I've been here there hasn't been a day where I can rekindle that kind of focus, hardly an hour of it much less a day. My first year my GPA fell to a lowly 2.7; I drank, I smoked, I did other kinds of drugs (I'll get into that part later.) Now school is a fucking nightmare. I almost failed my first class ever last semester, I can't grasp or memorize material like I used to (albeit upper division &gt; general ed shit but still) and I literally just feel stupid. I can't focus here, I can't crack down. I have no self control anymore no matter what kind of routine I try to get myself into. I constantly have shitty thought processes of dropping out of school and saying ""fuck this."" I used to be interested in school, I used to enjoy the process of studying. Now I fucking hate it, I hate everything about school but alas I grind away getting shitty grades that won't get me an internship anywhere. I realize my attitude sucks, I've changed a lot from where I used to be in a bad way. 

 I am also a member of a club athletic team who frankly, have never been a good team or had a good record. In high school I was a starter and I worked my ass off everyday to get there, and when  I came here playing this sport was one of my biggest passions I had and I worked my ass off to succeed in it. Long story short, I wasn't as good as I thought I could be, it just didn't happen. Two years in community college took a lot of mojo off my game despite being in the gym all the damn time in CC and practicing every weekend. Part of it I feel like has to do with the way the program is run but I can't say I've made every opportunity count either, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I had a HUGE ego coming into the program because I felt prepared and ready to kick ass, unfortunately the coaches didn't think so and they slowly ruined my confidence by not playing me and other shit. I ended up starting for most of the season but by that point my head was so fucked with lack of confidence I was just never the same. Every little mistake I was reminded of, it was just too much for me to be perfect all the fucking time and kept thoughts trickling in the back of my head of doubt. I still play, and it's still the same old shit except I don't start anymore and I barely play at all. I'm only there to stay in shape and to hang out with my friends. The bull shit is even worse this year but luckily I have thick skin. (And before anyone mentions it, I've talked with all the staff face to face in a respectful manner countless times, but they say one thing and act in another way and it just pissed me off to no end.)


So that's why I think I'm depressed. I went from a life of doing well in school (even had a girlfriend for a little bit) and being good at sports to essentially feeling like the epitome of stupidity and un-athleticism. I also had a great group of friends (who would have split eventually) that was a bummer to leave behind. I made a decision to go to a school that I don't care for, in a city I have no fucking idea of why I would come here, living a life that had no merit or plan except for a decision on a whim. I fucked up and everyday being here I'm reminded of it, and it kills me inside every damn day. I think about just offing myself sometimes for putting myself in this situation, for being this stupid. 

On the flip side I feel like I could just be a fuck up plain and simple. I've casually smoked pot since I was 16, I don't feel like it had any negative bearing on me until I transferred from CC. I started smoking more and more, literally multiple times a day everyday. I had never done this before, I was going to class stoned off my ass sometimes, or just getting so high at night I wouldn't wake up the next day because I would be groggy as shit. (We have late practices from like 9-12am, so I would blaze after practice late at night) I think pot is a wonderful drug in moderation, things like social anxiety have gone almost completely away since I started using it, but I wasn't using it in moderation. Eventually the end of the semester comes and I find myself wanting to go hard in the paint after my last final is over. I end up getting offered some shrooms and I ate them (I did a hit of acid like a year before this but this was a much stronger amount of shrooms.) I swear to god I think these shrooms fucked my head up. During the trip there was a point where I was standing up and it felt like my brain exploded (ok not really) but my vision went black and I had to sit down immediately or risk passing out. After that I went home for summer vacation, and I stop doing any physical activity whatsoever. I started playing Diablo 3 for hours on hours everyday and developed a chewing tobacco addiction; I got fat and out of shape, smoked pot everyday, quit sports, did more shrooms, starting fucking around with cocaine and other pills (shrooms once, coke 2-3 times, and some nights drinking &amp; eating vicodins) By the end of summer I didn't want to go back to school, I sure as fuck didn't want to play sports anymore, I didn't want to work out or exercise or anything that I held as productive for a large period of my life. I just became content being my definition of a bum. 

I tried dedicating last fall to school, I put in a shit ton of effort compared to the year before. GPA still sucked, and now I feel like a retard for not being able to get a 3.0 at one of the worst ranked colleges in the US while riding the bench on a low-tier club sports team. My confidence is fucked, I haven't had a girlfriend in years and I'm lonely as shit, I just pretty much wonder how I can snap out of this funk of feeling like such a piece of shit and just forget about it and live my life. I can't love myself right now or accept what I've done, and I have no idea how. Maybe I'm just getting a reality check and not handling it well, maybe I'm being a pussy, or maybe it's something I don't know. My mom has depression and my brother THINKS he may be depressed to, we have alcoholism in the family and my mom's side definitely has some mental issues if that matters. Everyday since summer the things I used to do on a daily basis (study, go to the gym, getting things done and being organized and having DRIVE) are so much harder than it used to be. It takes so much effort to just get out of bed in the morning and go to class. Sometimes I won't even make food when I'm hungry. Everything is more difficult for me to find purpose in myself to actually accomplish. 

To anyone who actually read this, thank you and if you have anything to say don't hesitate, mean or nice.

18vcvg,4,2013-02-20,Lost undergrad needing insight to software engineering career path,daayyvid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18vcvg/lost_undergrad_needing_insight_to_software/,"Long story short, I am lost as to how I should proceed in a CS or software engineering career.

Some back story:

I am a third-year undergraduate CS major at UCLA with ~3.6 GPA. I grew up teaching myself web development in PHP. While at UCLA, I’ve learned C++ and done many projects in C. I’ve dabbled with Python and a little of Ruby. In classes, we cover other languages and various theoretical CS topics as well, but I feel like I haven’t learned anything practical during my time here.

I’ve recently been trying to land an internship for the summer. With my peers already on their second internship, combined with the stress of the interview process, it is making me question whether I am fit for the CS field. I couldn’t land an internship last year, and have landed interviews but already received a few rejections this year. I have one interview left with another company. How do I get better at the interviewing process? Do I prepare for it like a test (I have Cracking the Coding Interview book), or am I expected to know these topics already? I think part of it has to do with my nerves and anxiousness (I need to relax), but the other part is probably not enough preparation for a lot of these interview questions.

In these interviews for big companies I’ve been having they mainly interview on core CS concepts, algorithms, data structures, etc. It gives me the impression that to be a software engineer I need to be a “super nerd” who is always engrossed in algorithms, etc, when really what I enjoy on a high level is making cool things, and understanding how things are built, which is probably why web development was appealing to me in the first place. Seems like sort of a disparity between CS and SE.

Lately I haven’t been doing much coding or side-projects on my own. What should I learn and what should I do as I am nearing graduation and will soon be in search of a job? As I’m already experienced in and enjoy web development, I could learn Python/Django or Ruby/RoR, or get into mobile development. The problem is that I don’t want to be stuck in this web development world forever. How is job market and pay for RoR developers right now?

I know there are a lot more cool things out there in CS. If I don’t keep going down this web dev road, how should I maximize my time left in college, and what should I learn? What other kinds of things do software engineers work on?

Is grad school an option? I don't really want another two years of school. Something like AppAcademy looks fun, though.

Hope this wasn’t too long or boring of a read! Looking for some advice and insight into the software engineering world. Just trying to figure out next steps as I will soon be approaching graduation and have yet to have any real-world experience in this field."
18vanm,2,2013-02-20,Should I move out?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18vanm/should_i_move_out/,"I'm in a tough situation at home now. My sister and I (I'm 19, she's 14) are always fighting at home, when I'm home. I haven't been home much because of work, school, and seeing my girlfriend, but when I am home, there's always something happening. My sister is always disrespectful to everyone in the house, doesn't listen, etc, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. My dad stays out of it unless it's absolutely necessary to get involved, and because of the relationship my mom has with her she doesn't do anything about it, and when she does my sister just ignores her. I try to keep out of, but it bothers me a lot when she does this and if I keep out long enough everything bottles up until I can't take it and I need to intervene. My sister shows no remorse for anything she does which doesn't help.

I already snapped on my sister once, essentially telling her how hard she makes it for me to enjoy living here and pretty much disowning her. Tonight I snapped again and said to her how surprised I was that her boyfriend hasn't dumped her with the attitude she has. That sent her over the edge, which in turn sent the rest of the house over the edge. My sister yelled and started cursing at me and my mom and my dad left the house for a bit to get away from everything. My mom came up to talk to me and pretty much said that if it were possible now she would want me to leave the house. 

My dad is leaving for a few days next week (pre planned trip) and my mom wants me out of the house completely while he is gone.

When my dad came back we all talked and my mom said she wants me out of the house. I said fine, just give me the money (this money is explained below). My dad said I need to at least finish my degree before I leave.

Here's where I'm at now. I'm a 2nd year Graphic Design major. My plans were to do community college, graduate, then transfer out to get a four year degree. My grandparents put away a substantial amount of money for me to go to college and after I'm done with my education any money left is mine to keep. I won't know for another month if I got accepted to the four year university, then I need to apply for housing too. I have a part time job as a web designer now, it's not big money, but it's enough for me to at least buy my own stuff while I live at home. I did some rough estimates in my head and if I budget myself correctly I could live for a year and a half on my own with that college money alone (nothing used from my paychecks). And this is assuming I stay part time at my job and keep my same pay rate. So here are the two options I have:

**Option One:**

Chances are high I'll get in to the four year university. So I get in, get a small loan, go there, and stay in the dorms. The loan will let me have some money left in the college fund to have when I get out. However I still need to come back home during breaks and such. But after I get out with my four year degree I won't know how much money will be left and I don't know how long I can live on my own for until I run out.

**Option Two:**

I get my degree after two years, take the money, and move out. On that money alone I can live for about a year and a half on my own just on that money. That is if I still work at the same place, for the same pay, and just part time. Obviously stuff like my job can change, so I didn't factor in my job effecting my money to live.

------------------

Either way my main concern when I move out is my job. I'm not too sure what's out there, if I can get a job to hold me over when the money runs dry. If I go with option two, who's going to hire me with only a two year degree? My portfolio isn't bad, but I feel like employers see a two year degree and will think less of it, and in turn go with someone who has more education. My current job doesn't really have room to advance in the company, it's more of a learning experience at the moment and I more than likely won't need to do an internship because of this job."

18zbbr,3,2013-02-21,My [23M] GF [22F] of 3.5 years initiated a break then slept with someone but says she eventually wants to get back together.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18zbbr/my_23m_gf_22f_of_35_years_initiated_a_break_then/,"I'm not sure if this entirely belongs in r/relationships or r/breakups. It honestly seems to be something in-between.

My girlfriend and I have been in a LDR for the last 3 and a half years. It's had ups and downs, but generally I felt it was going as well as something like that would for people our age. We had lost our virginity together, and neither of us cheated on the other. She is a year behind me in school (I graduated college in May of last year), but that never really was a problem. During my senior year, I became very stressed about what I was going to do after school for money. My degree is in a very specific field, and that field is localized almost entirely in one city. My attempts at finding a job - even at the lowest level - met with no success and I became very pessimistic about my chances in the future. Regrettably, rather than sharing this with my GF, or anyone for that matter, I just kept telling myself I'd be fine without actually confronting my fears about reality. 

As a result, I became increasingly hostile to my girlfriend and my family because they were the people involved in advising me through this process. It got so bad that my GF and I paused our relationship for about a month during my senior spring. We kept it monogamous but we gave each other much more space. I admit I still didn't confront my issues but she felt more comfortable once I had landed an internship and an apartment. She moved in with me over the summer and things were very good and we were happy. In the fall, she went back to school and I started a second internship, which I did not like. I became increasingly depressed - things I used to enjoy bored me, I was grouchy all the time, and I hated just getting out of bed. 

Meanwhile, she had  nervous breakdown at school because of academics and troubled relations with her parents, specifically her father who emotionally abused her beginning at about age 12 by telling her she was ugly and stupid pretty much constantly. During our relationship, I had always tried to build her self-confidence, tell her she was valuable, and carry her through anxiety attacks relating to school because she was afraid she wasn't smart enough to do well (even though she made dean's list multiple times). So, during the fall our individual issues both peaked: I was miserable with where I was post-college, and she was breaking down about her own abilities. We spent all our time either fighting or me comforting her or her trying to comfort me while I denied that anything was wrong aside from that I hated my job.

I moved back home in the winter, and when she came back we had several large fights where I realized I actually hadn't been sharing my problems with her and my emotional unavailability had made her resent me. We talked about it at length, and proceeded to have an excellent month a half. I worked on telling her when and why I was upset and we just had a great time. She went back to school and I immediately fell back into a depression about returning to an old (non-paying) employer while I await grad school responses. Two weeks ago, we had a small spat which grew out of my not telling her I didn't want to wait up to tuck her in for bed over the phone (a staple of our LDR). Two days later (Saturday) *she tells me she wants a total break for us each to work on our own issues - my dissatisfaction with my place post-grad and her not feeling self-reliant - and then try our relationship again.* The following day she officially said we were no longer together, changed her relationship status and told me she considered herself single.

*Now I told you that story to tell you this one.* I did my best to focus on myself and not contact her, including asking some hard questions of myself. But of course we talk here and there during the following week. Last Thursday, she tells me that she realized that she has never felt loved by her parents and it has prevented her from ever preserving her self-esteem. She told me she realized this the day after we broke up (Monday) after getting very drunk and having a one-night stand in an attempt to feel better about herself. I was stunned, particularly because we had only ever had sex with one another. I tried to take this in stride, and since that discussion we talked openly with each other about when we felt scared, including my talking her through three anxiety attacks. 

Then this morning, after much prodding from me about why she had been vague about whether or not she was going to sleep with any more people, she told me she was planning on sleeping with her one-night-stand again in casual fashion because she wants someone to have sex with while we were apart. I went ballistic, telling her I felt used and she said is trying to learn how to be on her own but reiterated that she really wanted things to work out between her and me and said ""If I wanted to break up with you permanently I would have done it by now. I'm not trying to spring you along or give you false hope."" I now have no idea what to do. I care for this person very deeply and enjoyed our relationship a great deal. I don't know how to feel about this, aside from confused that she could move on (sexually) so quickly and confused about her telling me she does want us to be together in the future but feels fine about casually sleeping with another man until then.

**tl;dr - GF of 3.5y LDR asked for a break after a tense year b/c of communication issues, told me she wanted to us work to work individually on our individual issues so we could reunite, slept with someone and told me she wants to start having casual sex with him, all while reassuring me she most wants our relationship to work again somewhere down the line. I am bewildered and conflicted.**

I realize now I wrote a novel; my thanks to anyone who actually reads the whole thing. It barely scratches the surface, of course.

I'm Chintan, a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology, and I'm looking for an amazing internship at 
a startup.


Ideally, I'm looking for a startup that's doing something really cool - I'd love to learn about machine learning, data analytics, etc. I've gotten a few offers already, but I don't think I'd fit very well at a big company - I'm looking for somewhere where I'll have actual responsibility and be able to shape the direction of the company.


I have a fair bit of experience in web development (I interned at a RoR firm back in Australia and I've been working in PHP for a few years), but I'd really love to expand my experiences and learn more about the backend. I've got a fair bit of experience in Agile environments and with using Git in a large team (git-flow anyone?).


I'm currently in the process of founding a startup which is based on an app to predict outfits, and I'd love experience in a startup environment. My previous internship was in a small (but awesome) RoR shop, and it was nothing short of amazing. It was very startup-esque and everyone was extremely down to earth and willing to teach. 


I'm currently taking my college's course on data structures and algorithms (which I'm having to teach myself - terrible professor), and it's extremely engaging. Even though I'm a freshman, I have no doubt that I can teach myself the necessary skills required to hustle with the juniors and seniors.


If you're interested, send me a message for my resume. My github is github.com/chintanparikh


Cheers,

Chintan"

I commissioned from AFROTC at NC State Univ last December and I will not go active (EAD) until late September because of federal budgeting. I am currently having a good time trying to find a job for the next 6 months and so far I've landed nothing. (Even after sending my resume out to everybody I know and applying for half a dozen things.)

As a student and cadet, I did not take opportunities with internships either within the AF or civilian world, but instead took summer classes to make my normal semesters lighter, which in turn helped my GPA out. Although it was pretty good for me then, I am currently regretting that decision because the only things I have on a resume are a little bit of ROTC work/management experience and my engineering senior design project.

In the unlikely event that the AF cuts me from developmental engineering - electrical, I would be out of a job with no college internship experience to lean back on. However unlikely that seems, given the dire need for developmental EEs, it is still a small possibility.

My advice to you is to apply for internships when you can and gain experience in your field of study, because you aren't guaranteed anything. I realized the gravity of this too late and I am thankful that I am going into such a ""crucial"" career field. Along with having the perks of some extra money, an internship or co-op will help you out in the long run.

TL;DR: Get an internship or co-op while in ROTC because it will help you out when resume building.

I live in a small city with a small web dev community.  There's a couple companies that are focused on specific apps and have ~50 employees, but in terms of 'clients can hire you to make their website', there's about 5-7 companies that have multiple developers and then about 10 'pro-level' one person operations.

If you look around, it feels like the same 30 people rotating between companies.  It can be really hard to break in at a company if you don't know anyone and most of the new hires trickle in via internships they did during school.

Does anyone else in the same sort of environment feel like you're behind in the industry?  Like, since there's only a handful of viable choices for a company to hire, there's less innovation because there's less competition.  When a company wants to hire local and only gets realistic quotes from 4 dev houses, those dev houses can afford to be less competitive.  Responsive design and other new trends are just slowly taking off here.

Another weird thing I've noticed being in a smaller city is that the arts and film community has really grabbed onto the web industry.  They feel like we're all in this together, being creative, but I don't really feel any camaraderie towards artists, if anything, I identify more with corporate drones coding tax software somewhere!

I don't really know where to start. I've been socially awkward as long as I can remember. I think it all started in high school with my marijuana consumption. Being high made me REALLY awkward, but we smoked on lunch break every day from grade 8 to graduation. At first I was only awkward when high, but it started while being sober too.

Fast forward to last year of high school, we have to pick a college. This is where I started to get really anxious. I did not want to go to a college where I would not know anybody, so I picked the college where my 2 best friends were going. Obviously our schedules didn't match so I started to skip class in order to not being alone between classes. I barely made any friends at this school. I dropped out on 2nd semester.

I then got my first job as a cashier in a convenience store. I worked nights to avoid as much people as possible. I was really depressed during this year. I don't think working nights helped much. I enrolled into another school for a 3-year programming degree.

First weeks were hard, but eventually I made friends. People had similar interests to me so it was easier. There was a girl in our classes, which eventually became my first girlfriend. My anxiety wasn't so bad during the first 2 years, except for oral presentations where I would not sleep for like a week before it.

Work was hard. I now worked 3-11pm shift and I hated it. I eventually had to quit on my 3rd year of my degree. I could not find another job so I got into debt. I had no job so I could not pay, banks and credit card companies started to calling me daily. (This made me dread talking on the phone. I get so anxious when the phone rings or I have to call somebody, it's not even funny. Most of the time, my mom has to call for me. I'm 25 years old for fucks sake. )

At the end of my degree, I found a job where one of my friends for school had an internship. It's alright, except sometimes I have to call people... in english. While my written english is pretty good, I speak like a spanish cow. It does not help my anxiety at all and I stutter all the time. Say what you want, but native english speakers get really agressive when they speak to a french native speaker, like I'm some kind of burden. 

My anxiety also affects my driving. Thanks god for google street view. I have to look everywhere I go on street view beforehand every time I go somewhere new. I would not be able to drive if it wasn't for street view. I also dread driving in the city. 

I have a good group of friends, and love going to play catan or poker with them. But if they all want go out to eat out at the restaurant with their girlfriends and some people I dont know I have an anxiety attack and can't leave the house. It's really frustrating because I'm not awkward with them, but as soon as somebody new is there no words come out of my mouth.

My anxiety is getting out of control. I want to be able to answer the phone. I want to be able to go eat out with my friends. My fear of the phone is so great that I contemplate suicide every morning before going to work. Also I don't know if this is related but I'm tired, like completely dead every day. On the week-end, I wake up at 11am, eat, go for a nap and wake up at 5pm. I'll be ready to sleep at 11pm. What is going on with me? I don't want to go to the doctor, it stresses me out. Do I really have to?"

Besides that, it has to harvest metadata from different sources, supply external GIS systems with a layer through WMS/WFS protocol and display the metadata on a map.


So some external research had already been done before I started this internship. 3 Commercial packages had been researched which would do the job (results varied, ArcGIS came out on top though) along with one open source combination. This was a combination of GeoServer, GeoNetwork and OpenLayers. Since my assignment is to set this all up with open source software, this is what I concentrated on. I've tried to find other open source packages, but these seem to be pretty popular and stable.

The researcher clearly didn't know what she was talking about on some points, she didn't seem to realize that OpenLayers is already packaged with GeoServer, but the combination seems to be the right one.
I've listed the functionalities below along with the software package that provides that functionality. 


* Data Product Catalog -&gt; GeoNetwork
* Harvest data from different sources -&gt; GeoNetwork
* Let other GIS use the metadata as a layer through WMS/WFS -&gt; GeoServer
* Read the data -&gt; GeoServer
* Connect with database (which is MS SQL Server) -&gt; GeoServer
* Display the data on a map -&gt; OpenLayers

As for the webinterface itself, they work here with ASP.net, but they're letting me free to chose it myself. They wouldn't be adverse to PHP. I still have to check to see what I'm going to be using though, but that's not really a priority this soon in the internship (still have 18 weeks out of 20 to go).

So for my question, am I on the right track? I mean, I think that these packages will do what I need it to do, but I haven't had a chance to play with them yet and I understand it more clearly when I do. 

^(I hope I've been clear in this post, I tend to ramble sometimes..)"

18y7c9,3,2013-02-21,I just want to share my story and hope to find some advice.,IwantToProgress,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18y7c9/i_just_want_to_share_my_story_and_hope_to_find/,"Hey everybody, I just want to share my story.

I've been depressed for the last few years of my life and am having problems dealing with it. I've known of my 'condition' for a while and am having issues trying to cope. Let me start at the beginning...

I started college at my university very excited and willing to succeed. I was successful for the first couple years and enjoyed every bit of it. I started drinking in highschool and have loved it ever since. I am very anxious around groups of people and it helps me cope with my anxiety. When I am intoxicated, people find me very enjoyable, funny, lots of fun to be around. I also enjoy being around these same people while intoxicated as it removes the anxiety that I have and helps me 'be myself'.

Let's move on. Later on in my college career, I got a few different internships to make some money and make connections for possible later jobs. The first internship that I had went quite well. I mostly enjoyed it (it was a lot of menial work), but in general I had no complaints. Life was good, I was making good money and the good times were rolling.

So I went back to school and it came time to sign up for another internship. I chose a company that seemed very interesting to me and got hired! I loved working for this company. I got to do some interesting things, my boss was very lenient and I was paid very well. I loved it. I felt in control of my life. Things were awesome and I had nothing to complain about. The semester ended and I bid adieu to the company for the time being, as they said they intended to rehire me when I was up for another internship.

This is where things turned south. I started facing some issues that I had not had to deal with before. The main issue was money. I was lucky enough to have had a part time job chauffeuring around some affluent family friends that had usually been able to cover most of my expenses, giving me a very comfortable lifestyle. The extra money from my chauffeuring gig combined with my internship check was more than enough to cover my rent, bills and my very active nightlife. I'm talking going out every weekend (and some weekdays) to bars, clubs and restaurants. When I got back into school, I did not adjust my expenses to account for not having a paycheck every other week. I started running out of money.

I was paying rent late, my bills were getting to the point where sometimes I would lose electricity for a few days at a time and I was slowly losing my grip. How did I cope? By drinking. I had an ""image"" to keep up, and that image was as a party animal. Going out to clubs with friends, hooking up with chicks, etc...

My drinking got to the point that my family started asking me how I was doing. I was skipping every class, playing video games all night and sleeping through the days. The end of my school semester came and I found out that I had failed all of my classes. I should have been shocked, but I wasn't... I just didn't care. I used to be a very religious person, going to Mass every Sunday and in general keeping up with my spiritual life, as it was very important to me. I stopped all of that too. Missing sunday mass, which normally would have terrified me, didn't bother me at all.

My next internship came up and I signed up for it. The same company that I had worked for previously hired me and I was excited. I was excited that I would finally get my life back on track after the abysmal semester that I had had. I was going to start making some good money, get my life in shape, fix up my grades, blah blah blah...

That enthusiasm didn't last. My depression, that I was still unaware of, that had been haunting me was still there. This job that I loved a year ago bored me. I started showing up late, calling in sick multiple days at a time and browsing the internet when I should have been at work. Eventually I was let go via email during one of my week-long 'sicknesses'. This should have devastated me. It didn't, not at all. It didn't bother me one bit. I simply read the email, frowned and closed the tab.

This is where I currently am. I didn't register for school as I had no interest in it and didn't look for another job. I had to move out of my apartment and started living with my parents. They gladly accepted me, but I didn't exactly savor it. My parents went to bed early, didn't have internet access and I wasn't able to keep up my nightlife that I so dearly loved.

My father got me a job that was very demanding physically. I liked it at first as I got a very good workout, was losing weight and got decent paychecks. I was working very hard during the day and it wore me out. I spent most of my days after work hanging out with my friend who had internet access (I was gaming online as much as I could) and started to spend a couple of nights a week sleeping on his couch. This progressed to me sleeping every night on his couch, and being a good friend of mine, he didn't mind at all. 

I stopped showing up to work and calling in sick again. I wasn't sick, I just woke up most days when my alarm went off and just didn't feel like going to work. I simply didn't want to work and spent most of my days browsing reddit and playing video games at my buddy's house. I was let go from my job. I then began living at my friends house, sleeping on his couch and only eating when I was too hungry to put it off any longer. My friend tried to help me, getting me a job that I eventually got fired from for not showing up and trying to get me to work out. I lived on that same couch for an entire year. 

This is when my family and friends intervened. They had an meeting with me and asked me what was wrong. I started crying as I admitted that I was having regular thoughts of suicide. During that year on the couch, I would contemplate killing myself daily. I never went as far as thinking HOW I would kill myself, but the thought lingered in the back of my mind. Thoughts such as ""I could really just end this all pretty quickly"" and ""Wow, this would be so easy.""

So they started helping me. They introduced me to a therapist and I started meeting with him. I moved off of my buddies couch and back into my parents house. I got a part time job and am trying to get back into school. But my bad habits that I had formed still haunt me. I met with my therapist for multiple sessions. He gave me some great insight into myself. 

I have learned that I am a very negative thinker. I don't understand why people like me, despite the fact that my friends and family enjoy my company. I don't know how to accept compliments. My friends often say they love when I show up to events. I'm still convinced that they are mocking me. I don't understand why people enjoy my company. I don't believe anyone truly likes me. It feels like everyone is simply putting up with me. I know deep down that this isn't true, but I still feel have these feelings. I feel so alone.

And this is where I currently am. I have stopped seeing my therapist because everytime I set up an appointment, I don't bother to show up. He is probably tired of my unwillingness to change myself.

I just don't know what to do. I know that I want to better myself, but I'm just too indifferent to put forth the effort. Can you all give me some insight?

Sorry if this is a long read, but I felt the need to share my story. This account is a throwaway, so please feel free to comment or PM me any questions you might have. Thanks for anyone who read this and if this has helped anyone then thank you for reading."

Reddit, I need help. I'm graduating in May with a degree in journalism. I've had two successful internships, one of which turned into a weekend reporting job. I was editor-in-chief of my school newspaper last year and have worked there all four years of college. I have well over 100 published clips and a good GPA.

And now that I'm at the end of the road, I don't know if I even want to be a journalist at all. I'm burnt out on it.

What I SHOULD do is use my connections here in my home state to get a job in journalism as planned. 

Another possible option is Teach For America. I've made it to their final interview stage and I'll know in mid March if I made it. However, I'd have to decide if I want to commit by the end of March, which would likely be before I have job offers from other places. 

What I really WANT to do is move to Los Angeles and find some sort of job in media, and be with the guy I've been seeing on and off for six years (we can never get the timing right). I have a few connections out there, but I hear finding a job there in an field is really, really difficult.

Can someone help me reason this out? "

I'm here simply because I have just discovered the [Dodge Dart Registry](http://bit.ly/Y0Tera), which looks to be a great opportunity to raise money for a car. Before you close this post, hear me out. 

I'm currently an 18 year old full-time college student pursuing a degree in Business Marketing or Sales with a minor in Criminal Justice. I currently live at home with my parents and catch a ride with a friend to school everyday, and my mom stays late at work to pick me up when my day is over (I'm at school for about 12 hours M/W/F). With my parents' schedules, I have no means to get to work when I am not at school, which has made it very hard to get a part time job in order to save up money for a car. I do save what I can, however. I worked every day over this past holiday season since I was able to go in at 8am and leave in time to pick my mom up from work (only time I'm really able to take my moms car without inconviencing her). I have applied for an internship at my mom's job as well, so I will be able to ride with her to work all summer, and I plan on putting all of that money in a savings account to go to a car.

I would like you to sponsor a part of the Dodge Dart I have created on Dodge's website. I have set a goal of $25,000 to go towards a car. This is a large number, but the way Dodge has this set up, even if I don't reach that goal, I still receive what has been sponsored, minus about 10%. My hope is that I will raise enough for a basic model Dart, but since I will still receive the money sponsored, I would really like to raise enough to get a used car. Finally getting a car of my own would allow me to get reliably get a job without worrying about how I will be getting there everyday so that I can save up money for my next school year, as well as paying off the loans I have taken out for my tuition. Any help provided will be very much appreciated. Thanks.

It only took me a few conversations to realize that everyone at this career fair were looking for primarily Microsoft track software developers.

Well, I have a phone interview for an internship in the UK this Friday, and I'm in need of some advice. The interviewer is obviously *from* the UK, and so the call with be done international and with a 6 hour difference. 

The biggest issue I am worried about is the difference in accents. I am from the US, but my accent is a bit different than the typical American accent (whatever that may be) as I speak with a different tone and emphasize different words. I can't completely explain it, let's just say I got yelled at a lot by my public speaking teacher for not speaking ""correctly"". But, is there any other way I could try to speak more clearly besides slowing down? Also, how should I approach trying to understand her accent? Is it appropriate to ask her to slow down?

Also, any tips on what questions to prepare for? I have of course gone through the interview process previously, although I am unaware of what questions I might be asked from someone abroad. It was suggested that I should prepare to answer questions that may revolve around ""Why are you trying to get a job over here?"" although I'm not sure if that really is reasonable question to prepare for.

Any other advice is welcome, thanks!"

Made in Korea was hilarious!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7rz?context=5)|Not vlogs specifically but I want to do more on camera stuff starting this summer once I move into a bigger place. I have a dream of doing a nightly 1 hour on camera stream in the style of a late night talk show, but one with a hugely unprofessional public access vibe. We'll see where things go in a couple of months but, yes, I think on camera stuff is definitely a big part of the future of this kind of content (not just facecam horror videos) and I don't want to miss the boat. 
[Where does the name ""Northernlion"" come from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fucoc?context=5)|I was 13, lived in Canada (northern) and my name rhymes with lion. Thank god I didn't go with like xXxMOHSNIPER69.
[You spoke about eventually ending the ""Isaac"" series before starting the cheat engine runs. Now you are at episode #410(?\).

I still enjoy playing the game and the metrics show that there's still a large chunk of my audience that enjoys watching it, so I'm going to keep doing it for the time being.
 |The thing to keep in mind is that Isaac videos never take away from the other content I produce, they're just in addition to it. I've never skipped over a game for a Let's Look At or something because I've felt an obligation to dedicate a 'timeslot' to Isaac instead. 
[How much is your steam library worth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7nw?context=5)|Damn, this is a good question. According to Steam I have 400 games, but most of those are indie titles usually in the $5-$15 range. Factoring in AAA titles that I've received or bought myself, you're probably looking at maybe $5,000? That's kind of a staggering number to me, so guys that have been doing this a lot longer (TotalBiscuit, for example) must have libraries worth as much as a new car. 
[If this is your business, shouldn't you kind of know these numbers? Even for tax purposes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvrlu?context=5)|95% of these games come direct from the publisher or developer, so I don't need to write them off as a business expense.

I think Skulls of the Shogun is super underrated right now. It's a fun strategy game that seems to be getting no attention due to its weird distribution strategy/obligation.
[Fan since SMB, you're easily one of the best LPers on YT, dat voice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubtb?context=5)|Most overrated, recently? I think *DmC* is a decent game but I don't think it's ""85 on Metacritic"" good. *Borderlands 2* didn't hook me at all, either. 
[What introduced you to doing videos, was it watching others doing it too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7yz?context=5)|Yep, I was primarily influenced by guys like AVGN, Spoony, and Angry Joe (who I had the pleasure of meeting at Paradox Con a couple of weeks ago) . I started out doing reviews in a similar vein to them but branched into more unscripted content once I found that I sound like a robot when I'm reading off of a page. 
[When was your biggest, ""Holy crap! People actually like my videos,"" moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu9oa?context=5)|I try to stay pretty humble and self-deprecating so I get these moments all the time. Just yesterday Edmund McMillen tweeted and blogged about my ""Top 10 Items in The Binding of Isaac"" video and that made me a bit giddy. 
[Dude, you got Edmund McMillen in one of your videos! Retweet is nothing after that!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvfa0?context=5)|True! We're going to probably do another collaboration in the future if I can get my shit together. He's really good about stuff like that but I'm terrible at setting it up.
[What's involved in managing your youtube channel? For example, what are your usual daily activities? How many hours do you typically work?  Edit: You're a pretty cool guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuacf?context=5)|An hour or so shooting emails to devs/publishers, few hours recording, few hours playing games to get acclimated enough to record them later, maybe a half hour writing meta data and making thumbnails. Thanks!
[Oh yeah, onother thing. I really want to see one of your livestreams but I live in Europe, so fuck me, right? :D Totally screwed! Btw, will you do a Let´s play of the Day Z standalone game?

Not sure if I'll LP it, but at least a Let's Look At.
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu83e?context=5)|Just tweeted verification [on my account](http://twitter.com/NorthernlionLP).
[My question is, how did you network and advertise your content to gain your subscriber and following base?  (I am a small YouTuber, mostly LoL content with 700,000 views and 1400 subs\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fufqa?context=5)|It's mostly search traffic. I haven't done much network or many collaborations. The landscape is more competetive now, though.
[Yeah, I use to make content (on a separate account\) way back in 2008 and you would get 1000-4000 views on it if it was a popular topic... and now it is like 10-20... :\ oh well...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fv119?context=5)|YouTube is a pretty harsh mistress. You can have a decent following but if you stop posting videos and lose momentum, people will just go elsewhere since there's no shortage of channels doing similar types of content. 
[What Isaac items do you have little or no knowledge of? (Crystal Ball, Dead Dove, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fui69?context=5)|Acording to commenters: all of them.
[How did you deal with the transitional phase from smaller channel to a medium sized channel? This is something I'm currently going through, and I'll be entirely honest here, it's extremely stressful at times. Knowing you need to focus all your efforts onto the channel to encourage growth leaves little time for anything else. This means income can be a problem. So, how did you deal with that period in your channels life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubx7?context=5)|Luckily for me I was in a financial place where I could kind of risk it. When my contract teaching ESL in Korea expired in Nov. 2011, I had a decent amount of money saved up so even though my channel wasn't making me too much income, I could afford to dedicate a few months towards growing it without breaking the bank. Ended up being a good decision!
 |The big change for me from a content perspective was producing a lot more videos. I went from doing around 1/day to 3/day as I started to realize that there were people out there who relied (for lack of a better word) on my videos for entertainment. So from my perspective, that transition wasn't necessarily about hitting X number of subscribers, but rather a philosophical change from being ""that dude whose videos you watch now and then"" to ""that outlet where you can get a ton of gaming content every day"".
 |Hope that helps, and good luck! 
[How exactly do you make your money? Do you just strictly enter gaming competitions that award cash to the winner? Or do you have some sort of partnership with youtube? How can you support yourself by just playing video games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fugpm?context=5)|It's entertainment, not competitive gaming. Basically, I have a partnership with a network. The network runs ads on my videos, and I get paid a small amount for each ad viewed.
[How does one obtain a partnership with a network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fxl5r?context=5)|Basically just exist, make content, and have a reasonably sized audience. There are a ton of networks that will sign channels basically sight unseen but your best bet is to work your way up a bit until you qualify for a major and reputable network.
[Ey Ryan, watched literally all your videos and I´m addicted to you. :( Congratz! Greetings from germany...  Has your voice always been like this? Have you trained it somehow?

Thanks for the support!
[What games, if any, are you playing outside of your usual Isaac and Let's Look At routine? Is there any time left to play games just for fun, without doing anything for the channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvfv9?context=5)|I play a ton of games but usually it's for limited durations. I drop in, play a few hours (or if it's for review, beat the whole thing), make my content, and move on. The line between fun and work is blurry but I like it that way.
 |I played a lot of recreational XCOM:EU and, although I know it's blasphemy, spent a decent amount of time in BLOPS 2 online as well. 
[Are you getting tired of Isaac?  How many hours do you have played according to Steam?  Also, it's time for a reset.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu90t?context=5)|I was getting tired of it for a while but after a short break I always find myself wanting to return. Challenge runs have also helped mix things up for me. I have almost 300 hours in the game according to Steam and I'm super excited for Rebirth to be here in the winter. 
[Was Roll Fizzlebeef responsible for moving that asteroid just out of impact range using telepathy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fucva?context=5)|All I'll say is that I have Roll in a cryosleep chamber in my basement ready to be thawed when the Earth needs him the most.
[Do you ever feel like following your degree in Biology might've been better for you/more interesting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fugvx?context=5)|It's a touchy subject since what I'm doing now has literally zero relation to my degree (not that I'm necessarily complaining). I make myself feel better by thinking that the four years I spent in university made me a little more confident and a little funnier, which are probably skills that have contributed to my modest success so far.
[1\) When is the next Saving Progress podcast going to be uploaded on YouTube? It seems like it has been forever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuc3a?context=5)|We've having some problems on the SP front. We live in different timezones and Josh and Mike both work full-time jobs. When they're off of work it's only like 3PM my time and I feel obligated to complete my solo stuff before I do collaborations. On top of that, Fox had problems with his ISP and had no internet for 3 weeks, and then I was in Iceland/recovering from jetlag for a couple Wednesdays as well. SP will return and collaborations will become more frequent, but it's an adjustment period right now.  I'm kind of ashamed to admit I don't read much. I mostly listen to podcasts like Dan Carlin's excellent Hardcore History.
[Have you met any other youtubers before, and if so who impressed you the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Not really. I met AngryJoe and RageGaming at PDX Con a couple of weeks ago and they all seem like nice people.  
[Have you gone to conventions before and was it strange interacting with your fans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|I got recognized at PAX a couple of times last summer. Not strange necessarily, but surreal.  
[Do you feel like youtube is over-saturated in video game youtubers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Yeah, definitely.  
[What do you feel like separates yourself (i.e. competitive advantage\) from other video game youtubers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|I started doing it earlier and I think I have a more mature angle than a lot of people are. I hope so, anyway.  
[Have you ever seen a lion before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Yes, at the zoo.
[Are you at liberty to comment on your payment/fee structure with YouTube?  How does this go from being a hobby to YouTube saying ""we'll pay you?""  Understandable if you want to refrain to avoid divulging 'trade secrets,' for the sake of my/our curiosity...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvth3?context=5)|I'm not allowed to talk financial specifics, but the process is pretty standardized by now. You start your channel, eventually you grow to the point where a ""network"" takes notice of you and offers you a partnership whereby they serve ads on your videos, take a cut of the revenue, and give you the rest. You can monetize directly with YouTube as well, but networks provide some secondary benefits like promotion (sometimes) and protection from publishers/takedown notices (sometimes).
 |The landscape is changing though. Networks are going through major restructuring and it'll be interesting to see how things look a year from now.
[How do you find such terrible games for poison mushroom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubvl?context=5)|Metacritic and sort by lowest score in the past 5 years or something. Lots of gold to be mined there. 
[When are you publishing ""The Northernlion Story""?  PS: Loved your X-Com playthrough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubmb?context=5)|Thanks! I loved the XCOM series too. Fizzlebeef for life.
[What is, in your opinion, the worst game you have ever played ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuk45?context=5)|There's been a lot of games that are just broken, and by that metric I think Action 52 is definitely the worst. For me, though, I at least find those games interesting because they're such spectacular failures. The worst times I've had with games have been games that are bland in their badness, so for that I usually mention *Drug Wars* and *Tunnel Rats 1968*.
[Which ""series"" made you more famous ? (I know you since you posted videos about Super Meat Boy, but i wonder if you have statistics on that\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu99h?context=5)|Super Meat Boy, Isaac, and Scribblenauts Unlimited have been the big ones in terms of bringing in a new audience. Terraria was pretty big as well when I was much smaller, and I think Spelunky and FTL helped out a lot on a smaller scale as well. One thing is for sure, without Isaac I wouldn't be as big as I am today, but without Super Meat Boy I probably wouldn't even be in the same ballpark.
[Wha tis your current stand in pixel art graphics in games these days? Its getting used more and more frequently but I kinda like that :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvoo4?context=5)|It doesn't bother me at all. I think there's a backlash to it because some people think it's the developers jumping on a retro/nostalgia bandwagon, but the reality is that pixel art is relatively easy and cheap to do, which makes it a nice choice for small teams or programmers who have no/limited art skills.
 |As nice as it would be for every indie game to have its own unified and unique art style, it's just not practical for most of these studios in their current states. 
[I've been a big fan from near the beginning of your Youtubing adventure (not trying to be a hipster or anything...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|There's obviously a lot of perks to my job. I work from home, set my own hours, can take sick days or vacations whenever I want (like today, as I have laryngitis), and perhaps most importantly from a grown-up perspective, even if I don't 'go to work' I still make money, which is awesome. The 14-year old in me loves getting big games a week before they release to the public as well.
[What is your favourite/least favourite part about doing what you do full time? I'm guessing favourite is quite easy to answer, doing what you love doing but for a living, but anything else? Certain perks that keep you trundling along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|The worst part is definitely internet commenters. I've grown better at ignoring trolls but people often levy personal attacks at you based on your content/voice/appearance and it adds up sometimes. It's easy to say that you should just let it roll off your back and ignore it, but it's harder to do in reality. Also, when I genuinely make a mistake, I feel like Peter in Office Space, because I have one person who clues me in, followed by dozens/hundreds/thousands of people telling me exactly the same thing.
[Also, you should get a catchphrase. ""This game is great, and I ain't Lion"" could be a good one... ...okay, I just really wanted to make that joke and had to force it in somehow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|Overall, this is obviously an awesome job and ignoring a few trolls is a small price to pay.
[Hey Northernlion, just wanted to ask what you think attributed to your success as a YouTuber. I'm a fan and love your commentary to be sure, but there are so many fairly entertaining channels out there that get completely ignored. This isn't a question about how to get famous on YouTube, but what you consider maybe turning points in the channel's popularity? Moments of success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuiyr?context=5)|My marketing strategy is basically just to make the best content I can and then make it as easy as possible for people to find it.

Right now, YouTube is the leading online distribution platform so I'm going to stick with that. Things change fast on the internet so it's hard for me to predict where things will be in 6 months, much less well beyond that. 
[If you directed a game, what would it be like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubrc?context=5)|I'm smart enough to know that if I directed a game, it would be garbage as I have no experience in the field.

That combined with the general...unpleasantness of playing shitty games week in week out makes it a drag sometimes production-wise, although I like how the videos turn out.  
[What do you think makes a good gaming YouTuber?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fx0bx?context=5)|Authenticity and doing their own thing as opposed to just hopping onto bandwagons.

It's a complicated decision and streaming on Twitch doesn't make financial sense for me, but I want to produce high quality content and that's very difficult for me to do on YT Live.
[One thing about Twitch is that it has a fairly strong network of casters and viewers as well as, I have heard, good support.

[Tad bit late(as usual when it comes to Iamas\) but I've got a couple questions.  Since you have a huge amount of Isaac videos, when the remake/rebirth comes out, do you think that you will focus a lot of attention on that, or stick with 'classic' Issac.  Which gaming media outlets do you read/watch and do their review opinions ever sway you when it comes to purchasing a game?  When will the SP Podcast return, and do you think there will ever be guests?  Has there ever been a game that you really wanted to do a series on, but got shot down by the publisher, other than the Assassin's Creed LP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvcw6?context=5)|To be honest, I get most of the games I'm interested in direct from publishers nowadays, but when I purchase a game my decision usually boils down to whether or not I'm personally interested in it and whether or not it will make noteworthy/interesting content. As such, I shelled out $50 for Aliens:CM even though I was confident it was going to be garbage, just because I wanted to make a video of my thoughts on the game. I do read a lot of sites though, to keep abreast of news and developments, or just to see how their opinions of games line up with my own. I love *Polygon* and I think they have wonderful writers, and I'm a big *Rock Paper Shotgun* fan as well even though they turned me down for an internship position a couple of years ago! Also, big Giant Bomb fan.

I understand the need to get things out. I understand that I've always been your venting source, shoulder to cry on, tissue box holder, and the one who fixes your situation.

But latley, I worry about you. You're anxiety has been through the roof, worrying about every little thing you come across. The smallest problem turns into a natural disaster. I've had to calm you down about homework, our neighbors being loud, the printer not working, if you coughed, etc. I've blocked WebMD on your computer so you don't think you have liver failure or cancer when its really just gas. You lost sleep over your friend and I had to stop you from thinking she got in a car accident while doing cocaine, when in reality she was talking on the phone and didn't want her mother to hear.

I'm worried about you, I can't tell you anything in the worry that you might get anxious. I feel like my opinions or worries don't matter, or you turn all the outcomes to the dark side, stop me from talking, and make me feel as if my voice is a waste of space. 

I'm just as stressed as you, maybe a little more. I'm up all night working on portfolios for internships, major projects for class, weekly essays, making my mother happy, applying for jobs left and right with no responses, feeling as if my voice doesn't matter at all, AND listening to you and making sure you're okay. You have no idea how many times I've cried in the empty computer lab, just because it was safe to cry there.

I'm worried about you. I'm sick of this dark cloud that overhangs over your head constantly. I'm worried that you might have an anxiety disorder, and I don't want you to get run over by snowball effect that looms over your head. Quite frankly, if I say anything positive, the negitive snowball just engulfs it.

I'm sick of the negitivity, and I know this is something that can't be changed overnight. But please, please, I'm sick of every conversation turning into a depressing nightmare. I know that life if not all sunshine and rainbows, BUT PLEASE, if I listen to you 24/7 then you have to give me a chance and listen to me for once."

(x-post from /r/UCDavis) ,ucdavisthrowaway,Veterinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/190npm/does_anybody_here_attend_uc_davis_i_could_use/,"Hi, I'm Dave and I'm currently a 3rd year NPB student at UC Davis.
Edit* NPB stands for Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. It is considered the general ""pre-med"" major for undergrads at UCD.

I originally chose this major because I was planning on going into the medical field, but after partaking in the volunteer program at Davis Medical Center as well as after going to a number of animal science interest programs as well as enrolling in classes, I find myself fairly committed to a career in the veterinary field.

If it's at all possible, I would love to be able to attend the vet school here at Davis, and I would like to know what undergrad courses and experiences I am expected to take/have while studying here. This is the resource that I am primarily using as of now:
http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/students/dvm_program/admissions/required_prevet_courses.cfm

Quick summary of courses on that page:
CHE 2ABC, 8AB

PHY 1AB

BIS 2ABC, 101

ABI 102

NPB 101

STA 13 or 100

as well as 12 units each of English and Humanities

So I guess I have a few (maybe more than a few) questions:

Am I not expected to take the CHE118 series, and can just take the 8 series instead? This surprised me because I had often heard that the required courses for vet school were similar to as of those for med school, and apparently the 118 series is required for UCD Med?

Are the requirements for UCD Vet fairly similar to those of other vet schools? For example, I don't want to take the CHE 8 series instead of the 118 and find myself being rejected from other schools because they had expected me to take the 118.

Are there any courses that are not required but are highly recommended/expected for me to take?

Are there any particular internships or volunteer services that I should be applying for or be keeping an eye on?

Is my NPB major okay for my future plans or should I change it? There are a few reasons why I felt that I was okay keeping it:

I've already started taking upper div NPB courses (such as NPB 101L) and I feel that it would be wasteful to not put them towards a degree, as well as the fact that I would have to take additional courses for other majors.

The subject matter of the major seems relevant enough to the veterinary sciences to continue studying it.

From what I hear, animal science majors are required to submit a thesis/undergrad project at the end of their 3rd yr. It seems that because of this it is too late now for me to switch to an animal science major, as well as the additional courses that I would have to take.

Not a question, but any general opinions about the veterinary field as well as information such as job outlook, personal experiences, and job satisfaction would be greatly appreciated. One of the reasons I was dissuaded from medicine was because of a trusted mentor of mine (a general surgeon) telling me frankly that he feels the medical field as it is now is not worth it, and although he does not regret working to get where he is, if he had to do it again there is no way that he would. Honest opinions such as these are extremely welcome.

Thank you SO SO much for taking the time to read through this and help me. I know that I really should talk to a counselor about this manner, but I'm working two jobs to pay for school and I really just have not been able to schedule a time that works for them (within regular day hours). Also, if there are any volunteer programs or internships that are incredibly worth it, I would not mind quitting a job and taking out more private loans to be able to work towards my goal, as I'm passionate about working with animals and getting some more hands-on experience.

I hope this was comprehensible. I apologize for any unclear statements as well as any errors in grammar or format, as I'm not the best at submitting posts and it's kind of late.

Thank you!

Go Aggies!

I have an internship now and am volunteering at a place directly related to my dream, but I'm still scared because of that damn deadline.

I want to drink to deal with the anxiety because it usually makes me more pro-active, but then if I drink I worry about gaining weight.

190irc,1,2013-02-22,What does it take to get hired?,Jamoker,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/190irc/what_does_it_take_to_get_hired/,"Hello everyone, I've been checking out this subreddit and finding it to be full of very helpful and informed people.

The question I have is on some advice on how to get hired by an industrial design firm as an engineer. I am a mechanical engineer in the process of applying for my first real job. While I am applying for the standard jobs mechanical engineers apply to, I am also looking at working as an engineer for a design company. I have always had a passion for design and creating things that people would be in constant interaction with, but I know that I am neither the most creative nor artistically gifted person, so I chose engineering as a ""safe"" major during school, but never really enjoyed it. I guess currently I am stuck with seeing that I might do something I don't care that much about for the rest of my life, so I am seeing if I can get into something I care about much more. 

A kind of job I would be really interested in is something like: http://www.coroflot.com/jobs/45203/Junior-Mechanical-Engineer

Some things going for me would be that I took all the CAD courses that were available to me, so I consider myself fairly competent at using the software that was used at school (SolidWorks). I also have a minor in Architecture, which I chose after taking some courses for a communication design minor. The school I went to had a much more stronger Architecture program which is why I switched, and also the courses seemed to deal much more with the interaction between the resultant product and the user, instead of focusing purely on aesthetics. Therefore I can say that I know a bit about the interaction process between designers when working on something together and have somewhat of a design education background. I had to learn quick as I was taking classes with senior/grad level students and had to discuss with the professor and students about my opinions on the finer details of architecture. I also have some experience from my engineering design courses and my Formula SAE team with designing something in CAD and handling the challenges of fabricating those designs into a physical model for use.

In a position where I would be working together with designers consulting and working on CAD models, I think I would do very well. I am a bit lost on how to show it however. I do not have experience with a company in terms of internships that would demonstrate my ability to do so. I do not consider myself having the strongest portfolio, as I just have my engineering CAD projects to show. However, I do think that if asked to work on or create something, I would not have difficulty making anything.

What do you guys think I can do to increase my chances of getting noticed and possibly hired?

Thank you very much."

Hell, everyone says I'd be damn good at it, even my teachers and mentors tough so. But that thing is I'm already 23 and that's it's gonna be a waste of time and money when I could just get a job. (My internship ain't so bad, if repetitive work. Plus, the folks are footing the bill). That, and the folks says I should do a masters degree.

Read about why my life sucks",canond08,stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/18zxd1/story_time_story_time_read_about_why_my_life_sucks/,"So I had an exam today. Nothing major, just Politics. I had stayed up pretty late cramming for it and seeing as I never, and I mean never ever, see the cute girl in one of my classes on Tues/Thurs, I just kinda fell out of bed and put on whatever doesn't smell of death and methane. Now, I live life with no regrets; my only regret thus far was not making a reaction video to 2 girls 1 cup, but this, this decision not to dress to impress beats even that out.

11:45 AM, 21-2-2013 I walk out of the building my class was in and see a booth for the Engineering Student Council. Crap. I know she is involved with them. I decide to walk the long way around to my friend's dorm since we usually eat lunch on these days, and going this longer way would help me to avoid the booth. I stare at the booth for a good 15 seconds scanning the faces before I conclude that this cute girl, let's call her A, isn't there. Good. I'm safe. I then hear a familiar voice getting closer. I turn and look up at another booth, this one is advertising an Energy Expo and as luck would have it, A is running the show and staring right at me. ""fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck"" I mutter as I change course to take yet another detour. I hope to myself that she doesn't see me, but I was right smack dab in the middle of the courtyard. Everyone can see me. I decide I'd rather lurk than go eat, so I find a comfy spot in a study lounge and hunker down. At least I don't have to endure that trauma for the rest of today.

12:05 PM, 21-2-2013 I get an invite on Facebook to the aforementioned Energy Expo. But the strange thing is, it's from A. Not directly, but through another organization she's an officer for. Using her moderator powers, she invites me through this account. I decide I'll decline. You know, always keep them wanting more, amiright? Upon further reading, I realize this is a field I am more than interested in, and a chance to meet potential employers so I take it under consideration. ""Spots are limited"", the page says. ""Deadline to RSVP is 2/24/2013."" I decide to make an executive decision by the end of the day to determine whether or not I attend. How will I decide?

1:15 PM, 21-2-2013 I feel the rumbles in my stomach, so I grab some food and move on to a new place with a power outlet. I then get an email from a professor asking me to meet him in his office later that day to discuss a group project. 

1:25 PM, 21-2-2013 I make plans to visit my professor in the Engineering building. I know of a lazy classmate who trawls the halls of the 2nd floor around this time so I come up with a plan to avoid him. Seeing as the 2nd floor is the easiest way into the building and my professor's office is on the 3rd floor, I decide to enter through the service tunnel which leads to the 1st floor entrance, and from there, take the elevator up to the 3rd floor, eliminating the 2nd floor from the equation altogether. It's risky business because the organization room where A spends a lot of free time is right across the hall from the elevators, but since I had seen her at the Energy Expo booth, I deduce that I'll be safe. What could go wrong?

1:45 PM, 21-2-2013 I successfully navigate my way through the service tunnels and arrive at the entrance to the EB. Before I go in, I take a quick glance to make sure there is no movement. Seeing no signs of life, I venture forward. This is the point of no return. I approach the elevator and hit the ""Up"" arrow. Both elevators are on the 3rd floor, and holding. As I'm waiting, I see something out of the corner of my eye. It's A and her red-headed friend, let's call her K, walking right towards me. I let out an audible ""fuck!"" followed by a facepalm. There's no way they couldn't see that. I still look like shit, I'm sweaty from the poor circulation in the service tunnel and I realize my shoe is untied as well. I do, however, have a couple things going for me. I'm a solid 8/10 and very quick on my feet when it comes to making conversation. But on this day, my greatest assets fail me. A whispers something to K upon turning the corner of the staircase, and K walks up to me and hands me a flyer for none other than the Energy Expo. I can feel A staring at us, K and I, and K is talking up the Expo, informing me of free lunch and internship opportunities. It all sounds so good, and then it gets even better/worse when K assures me both her and A will be going. I, still feeling A watching me, freeze up. The only thing that passes my lips is ""cool."" A and K return to the Org room. Had I arrived seconds earlier or seconds later, I could have avoided this embarrassment entirely. How could this possibly get any worse?

1:48 PM, 21-2-2013 I arrive at my professor's office only to find my group mates already in the room. They're complaining that I assign too much work to them and not enough to myself. I explain that I do a lot of the computations and that whenever they bring me anything, it's usually incorrect and I have to fix it or redo it entirely.

Anyone who's seen me around here knows that working on a farm is a dream for me. I dream of being able to wake up in the morning, take care of my livestock, and then spend the day working in the fields and growing food, and being able to not rely on anyone else to function. Seeing as I've had no experience farming before, I needed to ease myself in. That's why I decided to become an apprentice on a farm, work there for a season, and decide whether or not farming is truly what I want. So I went to a farm I was really interested in today. I helped out around the barn, took a tour, met the family, and I felt so strongly that *this was it*. I was offered a job and told to email her back with a sort of confirmation, saying that I understood the commitment and agreed to try it out for three months. She even told me that is was possible for me to ""have"" a cow after a month-- she could arrange it so that I could borrow one, which is the ideal situation for someone who's as eager as me to learn about dairy.

Anyway, I came home and told my parents that she'd like me to start on April 1st. Contrary to what I was hoping, neither one was happy for me. They told me I should just volunteer on a farm instead, even though I want experience as a day-to-day farmer instead of just a whenever-I-can sort of one. I tried that last year, and I worked on the farm a total of two times. I told Mom that I didn't want to just be a volunteer-- I need to *live* it. They especially weren't happy that I'd only earn $200 a month, even though it includes room, board, and food. I do have a lot of bills (car insurance, school, credit cards), but I see myself being able to use it. Sure, I won't be able to spend money on myself as much, but why would I need to? It's a different experience to be out in the boonies, farming hard every day instead of working in a place where all people do is shop. I wouldn't be tempted to buy sushi from the grocery store every day, and I wouldn't even be on the computer as much to buy things online. I plan only on using the internet for blogging purposes. They still don't think it's enough, though. They know I'm bad with money. I suggested the idea of sending them my whole paycheck and having them take care of expenses, and request money when I need it, but it didn't seem to make an impression on them.

It's so important for me to have their support in this. I've always been the type to *need* her mother's approval. It's even one of the major sources of depressive episodes when I suspect that I don't have or wouldn't have her approval. But I need to be able to farm. I do earn more as a cashier (about $200/week versus $50/week), but I wouldn't be spending frivolously on the farm, which is something I do now as a cashier. I'd be gaining experience I need, which will ultimately help me own a farm one day, since there's an FDA-sponsored loan that requires three years' experience and no necessary down payment. I'd finally figure out if full-time farming is right for me. My mom told me that the apprenticeship situation sounds like slave labor, since I get paid so little-- but isn't it the same sort of deal as an unpaid internship?! I see it as something beautiful, whereas my parents think it's a scam or something I shouldn't focus on.

A lot of times, I feel like she thinks I'm not even interested in farming, and that it's another manic pipedream. I've wanted this for well over a year. I don't think I can take another summer of not being able to live the simplistic, industrious life on a homestead. I don't want to sit at home, eating pasta while my family enjoys factory-farmed chicken, getting fat while watching HGTV, and wanting to cry every time someone yells at me at the checkout. I want to live life that's full and vibrant and colorful, not fake and empty like how I've been living for the past few years.

I don't know what to do, guys. If you were so kind as to read this whole thing, what should I do? If I plunge into this without my mom's blessing, I'm worried I'll lose my sanity. If I stay home, I can only see myself staying miserable for another year. I'm not ranting, nor am I just trying to blow off steam. I legitimately just want a new perspective on this. What do I do, guys?! D:"

Desperate, I accepted my boss's proposition - though it was vague I got the gist. To make it worse I had just reconnected with an old boyfriend and though we weren't sure of our ""status"" or whatever, it was pretty obvious we were falling for each again. Fast forward three months and I still hadn't been able to find a job. The constant rejection and weight of what I was doing left me numb and lethargic. I finally admitted what was going on to my boyfriend and now I think I've lost him forever. I can't bear the thought of not having him but at the same time I don't have an alternative means of making rent or paying my loans. The way he looked at me made me feel worse than I've ever felt in my life and I've felt sick to my stomach ever since. I know he'll never be able to look at me the same way again and I just don't know what to do. Regardless of whether he comes back or not, telling someone made the reality of the situation - the reality that I had been suppressing - all too apparent. It lit a fire under my ass to find a job - any job - so that I can get away but it's frustrating because I feel so so terrible. I guess I'm not really looking for advice or anything, I just needed to tell someone. "

I'm a sophomore at &lt;insert state university&gt; majoring in both Computer Science and Business (the focus is UNDOUBTEDLY CS, the other is more for practicality sake). I guess I'm a little behind because I do not have a resume yet, but I've always been daunted about what skills/experience I actually have to write on one. At this stage, I'd be writing one solely for internship applications. 

My academics are solid, I think (3.45 cum GPA, 3.7 CS GPA, 3.9 Business GPA, two semesters on Dean's List) and I have a solid understanding of Java, C, OOP, and am proficient at HTML/CSS (but I know that's not necessarily connected). Every sample resume on this subreddit seems to have a dozen different languages on it, do I really have enough for a skills section of a resume?

My other question is about the idea of ""projects"". I don't know what level of project/assignment really constitutes as resume worthy. In my classes I've done some basic GUI things and implemented (in c/java) (and understand) a decent number of data structures (linked-lists, heaps, stacks, queues, etc.). I'm currently doing some assembly language work in MIPS (obviously the language itself would not end up on a resume), and there have been assorted projects of roughly the difficulty of the above description throughout the last two years. In addition I have a few small personal projects, but nothing extensive or enough to write home about.

Sorry for the novel, but does it seem like I have anything worth putting on a resume for an internship application? what can I be doing to make more of an impression on hiring managers? I just really have no experience doing this so far. Thanks for the help!

When I first got my license, I took my savings and bought a [1999 Ford Taurus](http://i.imgur.com/NqJgu6w.jpg) for $1700 I think it was. this was back in 2010. I loved the car. It was quick and strong, not too many troubles. Bad alternator once and a few minor fixes here and there. not too bad. I wish I still had it now actually.


Then of course, [This](http://i.imgur.com/C6UNmcK.jpg) would happen to me. Some lady pulls out in front of me while i'm going 60mph. Worst thing to happen to me. I was devastated. Physically I was fine. but I lost my first car.
It held up like a champ though.
[album of the accident](http://imgur.com/a/jks9n)

So after the accident, in about 3-4 days I had purchased a new car for about $5,000 with all of the insurance money they gave me. which is what i am currently driving now. [2002 Mazda Millenia](http://imgur.com/a/Qa7sV), This car is alright. It's quick, looks beautiful whatever. It has an assload of problems though. The list goes on, I have spent almost $4,500 in repairs. It really is a junker and it needs to go soon.


So now you know my back story, here is what is happening currently.

The chance of me getting a good internship at **unspoken power plant** over the summer and following Fall semester is pretty good. So I will hopefully make bank. I am looking for a new car obviously. And this is where you will come in. I need help deciding what to get.

I am looking really new. I don't want anything older than 2010, and that's pushing it. I need something that will last me through college and until I have a really steady job and life. I think $20,000 is a spending cap, obviously the cheaper the better though. 

So what do you think?

193d42,0,2013-02-23,"If you have attended Devry, here's at least some kind of light.",[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/193d42/if_you_have_attended_devry_heres_at_least_some/,"So I've seen a lot of discussion about Devry and other technical schools, and I wanted to share my experience comparing a traditional university  experience to the one I've received at Devry.

Lets cut to the chase. Devry teaches you a lot of basics, but very rarely are you going to be in a class that teaches you current up-to-date real world methodologies. I recently completed a Java Class in which majority of the class was spent writing programs in the console. We didn't learn about web services or really any advanced topics.

I have a friend that is going for a similar degree at Baylor University and has spent time at a community college learning how to write Java. Although his degree was cheaper, we basically learned the same amount of information. The biggest difference was that in one of his classes he got to write a game which I thought was pretty fun, but it was console based and still basic.

The point I want to make is this: For anyone who has been sucked into Devry University and think because they graduated that you will never get a job in your career field, I want you to stop and realize it's not the degree that will get you the job, it's yourself. The most important thing you can do to grow as a developer is involving yourself on projects outside of school and reading books. Hell, grab an internship if you can! 

Yes, a degree can help you get in the door, but I have interviewed many people who have degrees from all over and if their skillset doesn't match the job they are expected to perform, their degree does not save them. I know there are many companies who throw degrees away from Devry, but a good company with decent recruiters know that for development it's not the degree, it's the portfolio. 

Oh and yes I work at a job where people look down at Devry. When I told them they are working wtih someone who graduated from Devry, they were quite shocked. The majority that can make it look bad, but trust me - individually you don't have to be a statistic :)"
192q4c,6,2013-02-23,My brother [17] has friends over often and the noise is driving my crazy because they are loud and right above my [f26] room (I'm living at home). Its driving me crazy,ShittyLifeThrowAway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/192q4c/my_brother_17_has_friends_over_often_and_the/,"**TL;DR: is it appropriate for teenage brother and his friends to hang out often at home (xbox; right above my room) and be loud/obnoxious? or am I just crazy that it's driving me nuts? what should I do?** *extremely sorry for wall of text*

**Why my ass is at home:** I am in a tight financial situation where I had to take on an unpaid internship-like position, and I was invited by my very enthusiastic parents (and brother) to live with them while I finish this internship. Actually, I took the position *because* they said they'd let me live at home. Sometimes though, I feel like a burden and don't know when to say if something is bothering me and when to not. I also have some anger issues, so sometimes I question my annoyance and wonder if its reasonable. 

**For the sake of context,** because we're an Indian family, it is more of a norm that I'm living with my parents than it is in a western context and I don't think that my parents think of me as a burden. In fact, if I told my family how I feel they would most likely be offended. My mom always kept my room the way it was, even though they moved a couple of times (they would set up my room on their own); she refused to make it a guest room or something, even though I said that she could since I didn't live there any more (in the past). According to them it's their duty and pleasure to help me out, and despite the financial set back, I am on a good carrer path so it's not like I am a no-good loser with no prospect of ever moving out.

**The issue**: the problem is that I have a 17 yo brother with an xbox in a room directly above mine (minimal noise barrier) and he has just made a bunch of friends. They all have those annoying deep voices that you can't cancel out with ear plugs, and they all howl at the game or whatever it is they're doing up there like you can imagine any group of young men would do. Let's just say, they're not a quiet bunch - it is essentially a party when his buddies come over. *Context for brother:* we're not a normal sibling pair; I am almost a decade older than him and I almost co-raised him with my parents. So he looks up to me and we barely fight. If my parents need to have any talks with him, they usually try to do it through me, since he listens to me.

**I said no to everyday parties**: since his birthday sleep-over weekend (yes, it lasted the entire weekend) recently, it seemed like he brought home friends from school every day for another week or so before I got tired of it and told him that he can't have a party everyday - it is unreasonable. I told him it would be okay to do once a week or so, but that I can't tolerate the noise every day. I suggested that he and his friends can go to a mall, or to another friend's house or something as well, instead of always just coming home here and being incredibly loud right above my room.

**I mentioned it to my mom,** and she seemed a little uncomfortable about it. I asked her if I was being unreasonable and she gave me a not-very-convining response along the lines of ""don't worry about it, you are his big sister, you can tell him to stop making noise"". But it could be that she just didn't want to tell me off - my parents usually take my side as I am usually the more reasonable sibling, and also because I am the older one. Also, my parent's room is on the other side of the house, down on the main floor so I don't think she realizes just how much noise comes to my room. I think my dad would understand - he's the loner, loves his quiet, which is where I get it form, but he's not here for a month or so, so I don't really know who to turn to to in/validate my concenrs.

**What drove me crazy tonight:** It was okay for a while, but it has started happening again. Right now for instance: today, it's Friday night and at around 1:30AM there were at least 3 grown boys stomping around and being loud in the attic above me. This had been going on since after school, then they went to watch a movie so I had some peace for about 3 hours, and now they're back. While it really grated me, I put my ear plugs on and dealt with it during the day (for a full 3pm-9pm) - because it was Friday evening, and it was fair enough. But I just couldn't take it anymore. I almost wanted to cry and I could feel my anger rising with each noise. I just wanted it to stop, I also wanted to sleep soon and there are no signs of calming down from above. My brother's attitude was basically: *its Friday night, deal with it* (we had a slightly heated phone convo). And while he did quiet down out of respect (which I realize is a big deal) I could still hear them - it's impossible in the quiet night not to. So I just left the house - I am at my bf's house ATM (he's away but left me a key in case I ever wanted to come over).

**My question**: I keep thinking, I am living in their home for free. Do I have a right to say anything? But, they invited me to live there and promised me a place to stay, so shouldn't that also mean peace and quiet? Is it normal to have noisy teenagers spend hours and hours at someone's place; I mean, I don't think they even recognize the concept of inside voices. I am just confused because it is so incredibly annoying for me, but my brother doesn't seem to get it, and neither does my mom I don't think - which leads me to think maybe I'm just being unreasonable. Maybe I should get a personal loan and just move out. But then I'll just look like a drama queen: ""shut up or I'm leaving"". I can't decide how to deal with this problem. Halp."

He offered me an ""internship"" as a software developer, but here is there deal:

1. He doesn't code. In fact, no one in the company does. I would not have any guidance for projects should I get stuck.

2. Unpaid. Would be developing for iOS and Android, and depending on success of a product, I would get reimbursed(probably like 25%)

3. No office. I would have to work from home on projects. Not sure if this would be a set back? I would hence not be working in a team environment.

The guy has awesome ideas for applications he wants to make, and I would actually have a choice for what I work on (and would probably be excited for it).  We discussed some projects and I feel like I wouldn't be taking on anything bigger than I could chew?  

Basically what I want to know is:

1. Does this sound legitimate to put on a resume? The most important thing is saying that I got experience and a possible recommendation from the business, right?

2. Is it a good/bad option for someone to intern at a start-up company that isn't a big name?

3. Is working at home a bad idea?

4. Is not having guidence a huge issue? I'm pretty good at programming and could always look up ways to do things (like integrate to facebook) online, right?"

Sorry in advance - I'm halfway through writing this now and its already huge!

Some context - I'm 23, she will be 23 next month. I'm in the final year of a Masters degree, with good job prospects on graduation and she is already working in a good job. We began dating in December 2010. For the past 11 or so months, there have been about 200 miles between us (across water) so a plane journey apart (she had to move to get a job, but I always said I would follow her).

So we met online, everything was great - I totally fell for her from very early on, but she was my first REAL girlfriend that I had real feelings for, and it was (still is!) a learning process for me.
From fairly early on (I would guess from maybe 1 year in) she would fairly regularly try to bring up ""our future"" in the conversation - getting engaged and stuff. At the start, I told her right off the bat that I was pretty uncomfortable with it, and would rather she didn't, because I wasn't planning it any time soon (in my mind's eye - I could see myself getting engaged around 27, married a year or 2 after).

She reluctantly (disappointinly, not angrily) accepted that and wouldn't bring it up as much after that.

Last summer (2012) I got the opportunity to work abroad for the summer. It was still only 200 or so miles between us (but in the opposite direction) but I didn't think it would be any different than before, though I did know it would be great for my resume. So I went, and was staying with a very large (25+) group of other interns, because I was always either working or hanging out / partying with those guys, I really didn't have time to miss her so much, but I know she missed me like crazy. I was away for 3 months, and I guess after 2 months, I told her that I think we should take a break.

This was due to a number of things. Firstly, I just didn't feel the same about her after being away for so long and also that every time we went on a trip somewhere for a few days, we would always have a blazing row - and it was always over absolutely nothing, but no one would back down. I'm sure you guys have been there. We were usually as stubborn as each other, but to be fair I think I was worse. I also said to her (please don't hate me!) that she had put on a fair amount of weight since we started dating, which was true - and I have always kept myself in decent shape but it was having an impact on how I saw her so I told her.

Breaking up was incredibly hard for me, at the time, she was visiting me and we were in a museum. I had been thinking about this and I told myself I would tell her today, and I actually started crying in front of her in the museum thinking about it. I then totally cried my eyes out as we talked about it later on in my hotel room - as did she. She didn't want to do it, but I paid for an early ticket home for her and she left and I wouldn't let her change my mind despite the fact I was absolutely heartbroken myself and I did it!

So within a fortnight, we were talking again, and I was telling her not that I had made a mistake, but that I saw this as a chance for us BOTH to work on our flaws or things that caused friction in the relationship. She even went and joined a gym for me and took up some hobbies (because I said she relied on me too much to do stuff and she didn't really have any hobbies of her own which I feel was also true) like baking and some craft things. We talked every day and eventually agreed that when I returned home, we would go away together for a few days and try to fix us.

We went away and it was fantastic, we got on so well and it was like we were closer than ever at the end. That brings us up to around 5 months ago.

I'm back home again, she's still working away and I'm now started back at uni. I know she is still missing me but god damn even though I know she wants to talk, I just can't bring myself to talk to her on the phone - I really want to talk to her, but its like I can't be bothered if it isnt in person. It's so hard to explain, I didn't do it anywhere near as often as I should have, and I didn't put enough money aside to spend on visiting her.

This kept going on right through Christmas and up until last week. We hadn't talked in like 3 weeks because of another stupid argument where we wouldn't back down. Eventually she said she needed a break and couldn't do the long distance thing anymore. I asked her was there more to it than she was telling me (ie. had she met someone else who was making her feel like this) - she told me no, but that if someone (though she hadn't anyone in mind) asked her out on a date, she might say yes.

OK so you are up to date. I should add that since before Christmas, the way I have felt about her has changed. I don't know why, but I suddenly stopped being afraid of commitment to her, and I KNEW that I wanted to marry this girl.

It's so hard to understand why I can feel like this yet not take the time to Skype or call her or whatever, but honestly, I can't imagine my life without her now. She means everything to me and I go to bed every night thinking about her. I even told her this a while back - that I knew I used to not like talking about this stuff, but now I can, because I knew she was the one for me.

So yea, that's where we stand - we are currently broken up, but I want her to realise that I am completely committed to making things work with her, and that I love her more than anything. She is fairly adamant that I can't change her mind, but I'm hoping I can. Also worth noting is that since we went away after I came back from abroad, we only saw eachother less than 10 times, for no more than maybe 4 or 5 days at a time, usually less.

I wish I could have moved over to her sooner, but I had already committed to an extra year on my degree when she accepted (and I was completely behind her) her job across the water, because I was planning to go there with her after.

TL;DR

Was with my ex over 2 years, just over 1 year in we had to start long distance because of lack of work at home - only saw eachother every 4-6 weeks or less for a couple of days. Been like that ever since and I really didn't pull my weight during that time.

After a ""break"", we then spent some time away to try and ""rekindle"" our relationship and it was amazing. We became closer than ever until she had to leave again.

After that I went back to my old ways of not putting in the effort, but at the same time, I realised that this was the girl I wanted to spend my life with and I wanted to change.

I started trying to put more effort in, but it wasn't enough and eventually she told me that she couldn't do the long distance anymore because my lack of effort almost made it like she wasn't in a relationship anymore.
I had always been planning to move to her when I finish University in about 4 months time.

Please help me get her back!! :("

Do you ever lay awake in bed to just think about the past year? Think about all the shit that went down, all the embarrassing shit you've pulled and all the moments you wish would last a lifetime.


I don't. At least, not until two months ago. When all was fine and we were just a normal healthy family. 


Haide was my younger sister but for some reason I've always been the one to look up to *her*. In fact, I even beleve my mom and dad looked up to her. And I think that's because, in a way, she made us feel like we would do anything and be anything she needs. It's amazing, really. Without trying, she could make anyone like her. Although some people were weirdly jealous of her. But not in a way that they would make orrible comments about her or try to bully her at school. No, no. It's much.. worse than that. They would simply befriend her, try to make their way into her heart and then take away all things that make her happy.


Esther was her best friend, they could barely stay apart from each other for one day. Cute, right? Nuh-uh. I knew what she was doing. She would convince Haide to stop practicing ballet, because she didn't have the right figure. She would tell her that no, she shouldn't try to get into Harvard. Because really, you could only get into Harvard in you have a shitload of money. Maybe that's true, I don't know, but Esther did whatever she could to prevent Haide from even trying. To make a long story short, Haide started feeling worse and worse about herself. She indeed stopped practicing ballet and stopped looking at colleges to go to. My and my parents watched her slip away but we felt there was nothing we could do. She wouldn't listen to us when we suggested that maybe she should stop seeing Esther so much.


After a few weeks of watching Haide feel like crap, my mother decided to step in. ''Finally.'' I thought. ''Thank god, now she will get the help she needs.'' Ha, were we wrong.


Haide started seeing a therapist in the town nearest by. My father felt skeptical about this. ''All they're gonna do is shove antidepressants down her throat and convince her it will all be fine, that it's just her age. Please Ellen, stop this at once.'' But my mother refused and convinced my father that we should at least try. After her second appointment with the therapist Haide told me and my mother that Dr. Harman indeed suggested that she should take some very light antidepressants. Sertraline. I remember the name oh so damn well. I could see that this startled my mother, but she tried to maintain a pokerface. After talking about it with me and Haide, we all agreed that she should indeed take the antidepressants, but not tell our father. ''He will just freak out over nothing.'' My mom assured us. So yeah, that was the plan. The next day Haide went to the pharmacy to pick up the pills and for the following two weeks, everything went back to normal. That is until Haide started telling me about horrible side effects. She said that the worst was the feeling in her legs. She just couldn't keep them still. She would lie awake at night, every night, constantly kicking and moving her legs around, til the point where she would start to cry and eventually cry herself to sleep. I told her to call Dr. Harman about it, but apparently he was on his once-a-year vacation. After that I told her not to worry about it, that it just takes some time getting used to the pills. I could tell by her face that she felt horrible, and I offered her to sleep in my bed tonight, maybe it would help her sleep. She agreed.


That night after we got ready for bed she whispered at me: ''Marit, it's really bad.'' With her lips pressed together and her eyes watery, I could tell she was about to cry. I fucking hate myself for doing this.. I just gently slapped her back and told her not to make such a big deal out of it. I'm such an idiot. A few minutes later we crawled in my bed. I fell asleep almost instantly, feeling extremely tired from my internship. It was about 1:30 when I woke up to the soft crying next to me. I turned around and sighed, feeling irritated. ''It's really bad, Marit. It's really bad. Is there nothing we can do? It feels like my legs aren't even mine anymore, I can't control how they lay, everything about them feels wrong.'' She would whisper. ''It's okay, I'm here.'' I said, cuddling her. I could feel her legs kicking around and I could hear her grinding her teeth. I should've know, I should've fucking known. I could feel myself drifting away, back to the dream I came from. I'm a horrible sister.


I dont know how much later it was, but I suddenly woke up to the most terrifying screaming I have ever heard. I could feel my body get numb in cold swear and extreme fear. When I got to my senses I realised it was Haide, my dear sister, who was screaming as if she was slowly getting tortured. I jumped out of bed and switched my light on, revealing something I will never ever be able to unsee again. Everytime I close my eyes, it's not the inside of my eyelids I see, but it's my sister. Covered in deep red blood. She was still screaming at the top of my lungs and my father rushed in, pushing me aside. He jumped on my bed and yelled at her ''what did you do, Haide? Baby, what did you do?'' I just stood there, frozen in place. My mother called 911, but by the time they got there, she was gone. My sister, my only sister, a part of me, was gone. 


She had taken my snowglobe, the one my grandmother gave me when she came back from Paris. She smashed in onto the frame of my bed and started stabbing her legs with the broken glass. There was so much blood, so much blood. They counted a total of 41 stabbing wounds in her legs. We should've listened to her, made her quit those antidepressants when she told us about the side effects she was experiencing. 


A few days later my father would tell me that when he rushed into my room, jumped on the bed and held Haide, all she would whisper was ''they're not mine, they're not my legs, get them off. Get them off.''

Think twice before taking antidepressants called Sertraline."

I've had an up and down couple few years.  I was doing really good about 12 months ago.  I had been working out and eating well.  Down to about 170 and building some solid muscle.  Got caught up with school, internships, and then I was unemployed for a while without access to a gym.  Then the stress of moving and starting a new job.  Anyway, I'm trying to get back on the right track.  

Plan is basically to count calories ~ 1800 a day during workout days, 1600 on off days.  I may do some keto, but probably not strictly since it's hard to plan ahead for work sometimes. Try to get to the small but decent gym and work 3 days a week and start riding my bike to commute when it gets warmer ~5 miles each way if I dont take the train part way.

Desired weight goal by May 19 is 180 lbs for about 2 lbs per week.  I have a halfway goal of 15 lbs lost by the end of March and an interim goal of looking sexy for my friends wedding in late April.  Long term goal is about 165-175 with additional muscle mass.

My main challenge is that I am not a morning person and have to leave the house by 7:15 to get to work on time.  I hate going to the gym when I'm tired, but I'm hoping springtime and eating better will help.  

My motivation is to look and feel healthier.  I'm not sure how stable my job situation is and I want to be able to put my best foot forward every day no matter what happens."

I'm a sophomore computer science student right now and I've recently made a commitment to really learning web development. Sorry if this might be redundant and if this is asked a lot, but how long will it take me (starting from scratch learning HTML --&gt; CSS --&gt; etc) to build a website like http://lifeandtimes.com/ or http://www.dreamvillain.net/? I know these are professionally done and it probably would take me forever to do these, but I would like to have a rough timeline on when I should expect to be capable of creating websites like these (both professionally made and sort of amateur-ish). One of my friends is an aspiring musician and I told him I would be able to build him a website by the end of the year. 

I'm currently starting my upper divs in my computer science degree so I won't have that much time to really learn during the week, but I can say that when I have time, I will be trying my best to learn! Also, the reason I decided to do web development was because in my search for an internship this summer, many firms ask me what I'm interested in or what I want to do and I never really have an answer, so I guess I'm sort of committing myself to something so that I can actually build something instead of giving a generic answer like (I want experience or I just know C/Java...etc) when applying for internships in the coming years.

We met at a party in December during winter break and were inseparable until he left to go back to college. For the first couple of weeks things were going ok (long distance isn't fun but it was bearable because we would Skype and talk regularly). 

But lately he's been so busy with his classes and his internship and just his life in general. It doesn't bother me that he's busy it bothers me that he will often forget to text me or when we agree to Skype he usually forgets and goes to bed. I figured I could put up with this because he promised he'd drive up to see me for a weekend but when he found out he had to go to an event for his job and couldn't come see me he didn't tell me, he waited for me to ask what was going on which I had a really big problem with because we agreed that communication was super important. I got over it until he did it again when I asked him when he'd be home for his spring break because we made plans for it but he told me ""his parents cancelled his flight"" (sounds really stupid to me). 

I feel like it's just disappointment after disappointment anymore. I definitely deserve someone who will be there for me and who will be honest with me and not always ignore me. I know, logically, that I can and should have a better relationship than this; that this is torture if it leads me to feeling like I have to be constantly smoking just to be able to deal with the stress. I don’t want to give him up but he’s hurting me a lot and the fucked up thing is I can see that so easily but I keep telling myself that it’s deeper, there’s more to this than what it seems. He tells me his feelings never changed, but how can I feel that if he never bothers to follow through on things he tells me? 

This is really hard. I'm trying to talk to him to see how we can deal with this problem but he never has any time I don't really know what to do, I don't want to just let this amazing person walk right out of my life but I'm beginning to feel like I have no choice. Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you anyone who read this I'm sorry it's long!

194c09,70,2013-02-24,How my grandmother and I became fuck buddies,incest_confessions,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/194c09/how_my_grandmother_and_i_became_fuck_buddies/,"Just over seven years ago, my mom passed from an aneurysm. My father left when I was a kid (I'm an only child), and neither my mother or I heard from him since. Since I was 16 at the time of my mother's passing, my choices were to go into foster care, or find my next of kin. Luckily, my grandmother (Corinne) was aware of the situation, and she took me in. At that time, Corinne was 55. Prior to the day she took me in, I barely knew of her.

My mother and Corinne didn't have much of a relationship. Corinne gave up my mother for adoption at the age of 17. From what I've been told, she took a year off of school to avoid embarrassing her family, and was forced to give up my mom. My mom was supposed to become ancient history until she started seeking Corinne out in her teens.

Long story short, when my mother found Corinne, she never received any replies. She did get in touch with my grandfather, though, which is how I know any of this. Although Corinne never responded, my mom kept her in the loop with holiday cards. She never gave up on her. I guess Corinne felt a sense of obligation to me, since my mother was always reaching out to her.

I was junior in High School when Corinne took me in. She was rarely home. She worked full-time as a VP at some regional ad agency. I mostly kept to myself, too. I had my own car—brand new. There was money left over from my mom's life insurance pay out, as well money from the sale of her condo. Although I had quite a bit of cash at such a young age, I stayed pretty responsible.

So, before going to college, I lived with Corinne for about a year and a half. During that time, there was nothing sexual. In fact, we rarely talked. I'm pretty confident, in that time before college, we never cooked a single meal or ate together. We had our own lives, and we merely lived together; we were like roommates. And, like roommates, we brought home partners. Neither of us said anything about that.

While I was away at college is when Corinne and I started getting close. Although she was in her late 50s, she was very tech savvy because of the industry she worked in, and we emailed pretty regularly. Later on, we started texting. We talked mostly about my school, and without really realizing it, she became my long-distance mentor. I was a marketing undergrad, and, really, her mentoring was invaluable.

In my third year of college, Corinne invited me back to her place for a week for the holidays. That was the first time we really celebrated anything. Previous holidays, I always stayed in the dorms. I never had too much trouble finding dates, so not really having a home to go back to was never an issue. But I was happy that Corinne invited me. I was applying for some internship positions, and I wanted to discuss them with her.

The first night I was at Corinne's, we had dinner together for the first time ever. She actually cooked. She made seared ahi tuna with mango chutney, a kale salad, and some sweet potato dish. It was amazing. She also served me white wine, as I had just turned 21 few months prior (that puts her at 60).

We were getting a little buzzed, but we kept it pretty professional. Our relationship was more like good coworkers, than any sort of family. She was vastly superior at drinking than I was, and I knew I wasn't going to keep at the pace she was going, so I thanked her for a fun night, and I headed to bed.

In the middle of the night, I woke to up to pee. As I sat in the dark of the hallway bathroom, I heard sounds coming from down the hall—likely Corinne's room. I didn't recall what time it was, and I was still a little drunk, but I listened and realized she had a partner over. I had seen men walk out of the house some mornings when I lived with her, but I had never actually caught her in the act (not that I ever cared to). Once I finished in the bathroom, my curiosity got the best of me, and I wanted to see if I could catch a glimpse of anything.

I crept down the hall, stumbling a little, but the noises of sex became louder with each step. Corinne's door was open a crack, and the lights were on. And, what I saw was amazing. She was riding reverse cowgirl on some guy on the bed who I couldn't really see. I watched, fascinated. Never had I really seen her as an object of desire, but I had to admit, at the age of 60, she looked pretty good. It was obvious she got some work done, since there was no way a 60 year old could look as tight as she did.

I'm not sure how long I stood there, but I suddenly noticed that she was looking at me, or at least in my direction. I quickly escaped back into my room. Watching Corinne fuck some guy was extremely arousing. I fapped and went to bed.

The next morning I woke up to sounds in the kitchen. Corinne and, I assume, the guy from last night were having coffee and poached eggs. I ended up joining them for breakfast.

Corinne introduced me as a college student she was giving room and board. I went along with the story. Later, it turns out, no one knew she ever had a daughter, let alone a grandson, so I guess she wanted to keep that part of her life hidden. The guy she was fucking was a coworker, looked to be in his late twenties, maybe early thirties. They talked about work, and we talked about what I was studying in college. The casual nature of the entire thing was strangely comfortable. I liked it.

As the week wore on, neither Corinne and I talked about me seeing her fuck that guy. It hadn't done anything to our relationship, but each night I fapped to that image of her. On Christmas Eve, she and I drank into early Christmas morning. She noticed the time, and she plainly asked if I wanted my gift. I had no idea I was getting one, and I apologized for not getting her one. She laughed and said that she wasn't going to get me one either, but she went out and got it the other night.

I opened it. It was the newest iPhone to replace my previous generation one. I thanked her, and she said that since we're texting regularly, I should have the latest tech. I thanked her again, and then, out of nowhere, she brought up the night I saw her having sex. Asked me why I watched for so long. I sat there, suddenly sober, and after what felt like an eternity, I said that I couldn't pull away. I told her I didn't mean any disrespect, and that I was still a little drunk. She laughed, and said she didn't care. She admitted that she accidentally saw me once, too, years ago when I was a senior in high school. I'm pretty sure I turned every shade of red. She laughed again.

I was pretty out of my element, but I guess I didn't know Corinne well enough to see that she was testing the waters with me. Also, she was pretty drunk. She started asking me about my sexual adventures in college, and we essentially swapped stories about our experiences. Clearly she was winning in terms of crazy sex stories.

Following that, she said she was going to call over that guy again, if I didn't mind, and I told her to go for it. I excused myself to go to the bathroom. When I came back to say goodnight, she said the guy couldn't make it out tonight. She had a few other people she could call, but some of them were either out of town, or too far away. I'm not sure what possessed me to say this, but I said, “I'm here.”

To which she replied, “Alright.”

She grabbed my arm and took me into the hallway. Without warning, she pushed me up against the wall, and we were making out. Honestly, at this point in my life, I was in my early 20s, and I was pretty much hungry for sex all the time, but I was taken aback by how carnal her sexual desire was; she had a need, and she was going to get it.

We groped each other and kissed in the hall for a bit before getting to her room. She started to undress, and I followed suit. Underneath her white blouse and pinstripe pencil skirt, she was wearing a matching set of black bra and boy shorts. She was breath taking. She unclasped her bra, and her breasts barely gave into gravity; they clearly weren't real, but they still seemed pretty natural.

She pushed me back onto her bed. I had stripped down to my underwear. She tore them off of me and started to give me a blow job. I had to focus extremely hard not to cum right into her mouth. After a while, she told me to lay down in the middle of her gigantic bed. She pulled off her boy shorts, and threw her leg over me. She hovered over my cock and pointed at the lube on the side of her bed. I handed it to her, and she opened it and let it drip onto my cock. It was the warming kind, and she rubbed it on. Her long, white nails grazed my skin, and I laid there in ecstasy.

After a few seconds, she tossed the lube container aside, and she used the remaining lube on her hand to wet herself. She grabbed my cock and slowly lowered herself onto it. All of this was effortless for her. I watched my dick get swallowed up by her surprisingly tight pussy. She moaned loudly, as if she finally got was she was needing all night. She kept a slow and steady speed, eyes closed, breathing heavily.

As I laid there, I immediately knew this was the best sex I had ever had, and maybe could ever have. I've had many partners over the past several years, but most lay motionless like a starfish, and others were simply not as good as Corinne—my biological grandmother.

She was picking up the pace. I followed her rhythm, and I thrust, too. I could tell she was really enjoying it, and I knew that I wouldn't last much longer. I announced that I was going to cum soon, and she all she did was grind even harder. I held out as long as I could until I just completely let go. At this point, she was screaming, but I could barely hear anything. I was literally cumming the hardest and most I had ever cum in my entire life. I probably shot 3 or 4 huge loads, but I felt my cock contract many times after that. Corinne had slowed down to a stop, with her head back. I couldn't see her face, but she had one hand on my abdomen, and one on my knee. She let out a long, deep sigh, and looked down at me. She told me it was great, and asked if I wanted to sleep next to her. I said okay.

I woke up around noon, naked in her Corinne's bed. She was gone. I put on my underwear, and I headed out. I could hear her in the kitchen. I came out to greet her, and she was cooking breakfast. I proceeded to tell her that last night was one of the best nights of my life. She flashed a smile while plating me up some bacon and fruit. We didn't talk too much while we ate, but I think that's because we really needed those calories.

After clearing the dishes, she told me to go take a shower in her shower, and I did. A minute in, she joined me, said, without any hesitation, “I want to fuck again. And I don't want to wait.” She grabbed my cock, and started to rub it slowly. It was a little sensitive from the night before, but I was hard in no time. She had a pretty big shower, and she leaned over and grabbed a rail. She put her hand between her legs, and used her fingers to spread her pussy. I stuck the head of my dick into her pussy, and I slowly rocked my way back and forth deeper and deeper into her. She still had some of my cum from the night before, and I didn't have trouble getting in.

The steam from the shower hung thick as I fucked Corinne from behind. This time we were sober, and I felt like I had a lot more control. She had even more energy than the night before, and I swear she was pounding back into me harder than I was slamming into her. I watched her has she held onto that rail, and her body kept a steady beat.

Since I wasn't as drunk this time, I was able to see her body more clearly, although this time from the back. She was fit. The only sign of aging that was apparent was her spine, where her bones were clearly defined. Her ass was tight, but I'm sure she's probably had a lift. Her skin wasn't youthful, but it was nowhere near elderly. Her arms were strong, and it's pretty clear that she works out reguarly.

It wasn't long before she I could feel her pussy start to tighten around me. She was breathing heavy, and grabbed my hand that was on her waist, and put it on her tit. She told me to pinch her nipples as hard as I could. I was hunched over her like a dog, squeezing and pulling her nipples as we collided into each other. The sudden demands were unbelievably hot, and I knew I was going to cum soon. I could tell she was just around the corner, too. She started screaming first, and I grunted a few times as I built up to my orgasm. I came hard as her pussy squeezed my cock over and over again.

We separated. She immediately knelt down before me. She took my softening cock into her mouth, and cleaned it up. I stood there as she gently pulled back her head, careful not to overstimulate my sensitive dick. She looked up at me with this satisfied look in her eyes. Without saying a word, she started to clean me, and then I returned the favor.

Before I left back to school, we fucked many, many more times. She always took the lead, but she wasn't a selfish lover. Since that amazing week, she's flew me out every other week to fuck and talk about my career, until I graduated. By then, she had gotten me a job at her agency, and I moved back in with her. We kind of went back to our old routine of little contact, as we focused on our jobs, and we still kept other partners. However, at least once a week, we fucked like animals, and many times, we've fucked at the office after hours.

I know Corinne's my grandmother, but I don't see her that way. I mostly see her as my mentor, and my sex life, outside of her, has improved because of her. But, I have to admit, no one has come close to beating her at sex."

I'd love your advice on what I should do with my finances.  (I hope this isn't a repost, I've kept my eyes open but not seen any posts that fit my situation)

I'm currently a single 21 year old junior in college and I'm on track to graduate in May 2014.  I'm so grateful to have an academic scholarship that covers most of my living/tuition/book/fees expenses and generous parents that control a college fund for my food, healthcare, and remaining learning expenses.  Overall, I am only spending money on entertainment, some food, and incidental expenses (like gifts, clothing, and personal care items).

I have 3 majors and I'm very involved on campus so I'm only able to work part-time.  My income is not always reliable, but I usually make about $100 biweekly.  I shop very frugally.

I am unsure about where I will be this summer, but I am hoping to work full-time at some sort of paid internship or student job.  I have applied several places but cannot really predict what my cash inflow will be from May-August.

Currently, I have:

* one college credit card (1200 unsecured limit, I only have ever spent up to 300/month), paid off in full every month with no problem
* 1300 between checking and savings (both give essentially 0.00% interest so I am unhappy with this)
* no student debt or debt of any kind, and no real anticipated debt

I'm considering:

* How much money should I set aside as an investment/savings?
* Should I consider a Certificate of Deposit?  Rates seem to be pretty low at the moment, but the security is attractive.
* What about an IRA?  I've considered starting a Roth IRA but am worried about the liquidity of the investment, possible risks that would be involved, and high minimums.  I may need access to my funds for expenses this summer.
* Is Vanguard the best way to go for Roth IRAs?  Seems to be the preference around here.
* Should I wait until next school year to start or try to begin saving now?

Is it a good idea to ask her to come watch the Oscars with me even though we haven't had a proper first date yet? Would really appreciate answers ASAP. (More details provided in post) ",alkscdn,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/193vsr/3_weeks_after_my_ex_and_i22m_broke_up_i_asked_a/,"**Because of the time-sensitive nature of my question, I would really appreciate any replies within 24 hours. The TL;DR of my very, very long post is at the bottom.** If you’re someone who prefers more background details before giving out advice, or can skim and absorb a lot of info quickly, please be my guest (I would be more than happy if you were able to pick out relevant details I may have overlooked). Be warned that it is quite long, though. Anyway, here goes…

I go to a small, private, liberal-arts college on the West Coast (obviously a throwaway account). Three weeks ago, my girlfriend and I broke up, but I've already successfully asked out someone (I'll call her Rachel) who I've had a big crush on for a long time. Rachel and I are both from the New York area, we met here in college about two years ago. We were involved in the same organization on campus, and though we were perfectly cordial to one another, we weren't all that close. Ironically, we started getting closer after both of us left the organization we were involved in, once: a) I got an internship in Bangkok last summer, where she used to live, and I asked her for advice via Facebook about living there, and b) we ran into each other at the start of the school year and found out that we were both from New York. Then, over winter break this year, she contacted me out of the blue to come hang out with her at an art exhibit in the city, and contacted me again after school started this semester to ask me out to lunch. I've really enjoyed hanging out with her and getting to know her; she's a really interesting person (in a very good way), we have quite a lot of common interests, and we've always had really good conversations. She's also gorgeous, which made her a natural choice for the Next Girl To Ask Out. 

So after taking two weeks of respite to get over my breakup, I texted her to see if she wanted to grab some lunch, the ulterior motive being that I wanted to meet with her face-to-face to ask her out. During our lunch, we had another really good conversation, and as we were walking out, I asked her out, and she said yes. 

The thing is, though, is that while she said yes, it came with a curious twist. I think it's worth it to replay the whole exchange as close to word-for-word as I can:

Marcus: So (name of ex-girlfriend) and I broke up three weeks ago.

Rachel: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. 

Marcus: Anyway, the think I wanted to ask you is whether you would like to go out some time.

Rachel: Yeah, sure! Just let me know whenever you want to grab a drink or something!

Marcus: Great! What are you doing this weekend?

Rachel: I'm sorry, I'm busy this weekend, but I'm definitely free next weekend!

Marcus: Awesome, I'll text you before next weekend then.

Now, before you jump to conclusions, there are some things I should point out. 

*1) It’s very possible that her excuse that she isn't free this weekend is completely legitimate. She's a photographer that does a lot of really complicated work in a studio requiring a lot of time and planning. She's also pledging a sorority this semester, and is very involved in an entrepreneurship group on campus. 

*2) I realize that she may have felt pressured to say yes simply because I told her I broke up with my girlfriend, and especially because I prefaced how I actually asked her out with that info. I could be wrong, however. Regardless, I probably should have found a way to work it into the conversation during our lunch earlier, but I couldn't/didn't. (Sorry for going on a bit of a tangent there.) 

*3) When she told me that she is busy this “weekend,” I think it’s safe to assume that she meant Friday night and Saturday, and not Sunday, right? (This question will turn out to be important for the reasons given below). 

So, my question is: should I invite her to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow night? Now, normally, I would just ask without a second's hesitation; I'm looking for a long-term relationship, and if another girl I had asked out wasn't game for something like this, then I'd have a pretty good indication that she wasn't quite relationship material. But here's the thing: I’ve grown to really like this girl and I think we would be great together. I don't want to make her feel rushed, since she seems to have more casual expectations for what dating between us is going to look like (the ""grab a drink"" suggestion she gave me when I asked her out took me by surprise), and especially since we haven't actually been on a first date yet. 

**TL;DR: Last week, three weeks after my now ex-girlfriend and I broke up, I ask out someone who I've developed a big crush on in the last year or so, and she says yes. But when I ask her what she is doing this weekend (by which I assume she understood as Friday night and Saturday), she tells me she is busy, but that she is free next weekend. Should I ask her to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow (Sunday) night, even though we haven’t been on a proper first date yet? Or should I avoid making her feel rushed and give her some space?**

Again, I would greatly appreciate any replies within 24 hours. "

I was genuinely interested in both audit and tax and didn't have the opportunity to complete an internship in public accounting since I wanted to study abroad for a portion of the summer before my senior year. Luckily, I found a real estate management firm offering an in-house accounting job that let me work whatever days I could outside of traveling. While it looked good on a resume, it didn't help me get any closer to a decision between audit and tax. 

Now, I understand that an internship in public accounting is (supposed to be) designed to shed some light on a prospective career path, but how can students possibly know that an alternative path isn't better for them in the long run? It seems unrealistic to expect college students to know what they want to spend several years (or more) of their lives doing. 

The firm I've been working for since graduation has a program that I think more should offer. We allow employees to spend 3-6 months in one of our other departments (we're split between audit, tax, and systems) if they elect to. The number of open spots is obviously limited each year and only certain employees (generally staff and some seniors) are eligible since client needs come first, but it's still a unique opportunity to offer. 

I don't really have a question or anything, just wanted to start some discussion since I feel like this is issue is so entrenched in the public accounting profession. "
197mxr,9,2013-02-25,School projects on resume?,wackyratt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/197mxr/school_projects_on_resume/,"Hey people, I'll be graduating in a few months, so I'm working on making a great resume that will help me sell myself and accurately represent my programming abilities. I've never done any internships and only have one non-school project.

I feel like the best way to advertise the programming skills I have and make my resume look desirable is to show the best/most complex projects I've done, even if they were school assignments. As an example, here is one project I thought I might add:

*Huffman Tree Text Compressor - herpderp.edu/link-to-applet.html*

* Implemented in Java SE 6 and tested in JUnit

* Compresses text files by assigning new bit encodings to characters according to frequency

* Re-expands text files that have been compressed with Huffman encoding

**Should I bother putting something like that on my resume?** If I do, should I indicate on the resume that I did it for a course, or just explain if I'm asked about it?

Even though I would be cleaning up the code of any school project and adding to it substantially, in accordance with my school's honor code **I cannot put the source code in a public place.** Therefore I would be providing a link to a webpage with an embedded applet.

Is it worth doing this, or is it a good idea to mention projects on a resume only if I can link directly to a source code repository?

I'd like to hear your opinions on this."

However, I've still got some interviews with startups in the SF area, and I'm fairly sure one of them will offer me an internship soon. I'd also prefer not being tied down to a co-op.

I've also got another opportunity in Perth with a Rails shop that I interned with previously, and they're offering me significantly more money than Oracle.

However, I'm sure Oracle would look pretty awesome on my resume, especially considering I'm a freshman.  

What would be the best course of action right now? I've still got interviews with Tumblr, Khan Academy and a few other startups, so I'll definitely ask for some time to decide."

196kud,2,2013-02-25,"I Am, Simply, A Shitty Excuse For a Human Being",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/196kud/i_am_simply_a_shitty_excuse_for_a_human_being/,"I have a lot of pent-up self-loathing that has been building inside of me for years now. It has probably culminated in mild depression, but that's not what Im here to talk about I guess.

Seriously, I'm just a really shitty person. As a bit of background to all of this, I come from a relatively wealthy family and suburb in midwestern America, and have been handed pretty much everything in life. I'm white, male, at least marginally intelligent and come from a loving and supportive family that saved enough money to send me to a very prestigious midwestern engineering school. I was able to get into this program because I excelled in a special program at my high school, and I got into that program because I was in another set of smaller, focused programs in middle school, which I got into because...the cycle repeats all the way down to 1st grade. I was in small classes with great teachers who probably coddled us a bit. I have had two internships at a great engineering firm because a family member knows the owner. I worked as a caddy at a country club for 7 years, and got preferential treatment for many of them because my dad worked for the same caddymaster when he was a teenager. I have had to work for almost nothing in my life. My family isn't super rich and I'm not blaming them for this at all, nor am I begrudging the opportunities themselves. I just fucking hate how I have dealt with and pissed away everything I have been given. [Very first-world-problem, I know, I know. If already want to punch myself in the face on a near-constant basis, I can't imagine how much somebody from a less-privileged background than I would despise me]

Anyway, I'm just going to tear into the reasons why I suck.

**Laziness:** This is a huge one. I didn't work nearly as hard before I came to college as I should have, in school or with my personal appearance/health/fitness. There isn't much else to say about this one, laziness is just self-explanatory. It seeps into everything I do. 

**Shitty Attitude Toward Work:** I have had a couple of jobs in my life, and I have been woefully ineffective in both. As a caddy, I was overweight, didn't hustle much, and really didnt like the job. I didn't want to head out onto the course and work, I didn't like the people I was working for, and hated one of my bosses. In my internships with the company I dont deserve to work for anyway, I constantly showed up late to work and took 15 extra minutes on my lunch breaks (though I made sure to work the full 8 hours everyday), didn't talk to many people, slacked off, didn't learn much of anything, and decided I really did not want to work as that type of engineer for a living. I understand everyone probably doesn't like their job, but I have an extreme aversion to it. **IMPORTANT THING/REASON FOR POST** I have, inexplicably, been invited back to that internship for a third year, and I'm actually weighing the option of NOT WORKING for an entire summer instead of working there again because it made me so unhappy. Who the fuck actually turns that type of thing down? What the fuck is wrong with me that I'd actually think ""yeah, I don't need to make roughly $6k this summer""? Again, my family isn't rich. Well-off, but not rich, and $6k would make a huge impact on my student loan payments/rent. I go to school with a very intelligent girl who would run me over with her bike for this job, and here I am, not wanting to take the offer because I hated last summer (other note, while I didn't enjoy caddying, I didn't look back on a summer of caddying negatively. I look back at last summer as one of the more horrible times in my life).

**Shitty Attitude Towards Others:** As I alluded to above, I was kind of gifted as a student, and grew up in an echo chamber where all everyone ever told me is that I was some sort of genius. I got a bit of an ego about me at a very young age, and sported a cocky, douchy, piece-of-shit attitude everywhere I went before college. I was a horribly offensive human being, and I don't know how I made friends at all. (I do, however, understand why I lost so many best friends). I still have moments where I am an arrogant asshole. What has remained most though is my overall cynical and angry attitude towards people and life in general. I get annoyed with people for no reason all the time. This has been coupled with a shyness borne out of being a fat kid and bullied in middle school to leave one hell of a terrible conversationalist who has trouble meeting new people and hates everything. (it is totally possible to be a huge piece of shit and shy and bullied all at once)

**Wasted Opportunities:** This is more specific than anything else, but I have wasted virtually every great opportunity presented to me. When I was young, I played baseball. I was pretty good, and threw the ball very hard at a very young age. Parents payed for lessons, and the biggest thing the guy stressed was that I needed to lose some weight. I completely ignored him, threw away the pamphlet he gave me to give to my mom, and never lost that weight. Ended up never getting better at the game and destroying my elbow. I never would've been great at baseball, but I loved it so dearly and yet refused to help myself get better...My junior year of high school, I was in great position to lose weight, and actually lost 15 pounds in my first month of trying to do so. And for whatever reason, I stopped. I think it was because of some mean remarks from people in the school weight room that scared me off, but I can't be sure. And here I am so much later and still having gained so much more weight, and now have a bad knee preventing me from doing too much at once...Also my junior year, a girl who is a thousand times more intelligent, kind, and pretty than anyone I could ever go up and talk to crushed hard on me. I basically ignored her out of fear I wasn't understanding her correctly/afraid she'd hate me the more we talked. I treated her like shit in our senior year and I will never forgive myself for it...Also in my senior year, I was contacted by a friend about opening for local band that had made it *huge* (no seriously, if you search the first couple of letters in their name on YouTube, all of the suggestions are related to them and they have like 5 videos with over 12 million views. I'd tell you exactly who they were or it'd be way too easy to figure out who I am.) for a benefit concert at the school. I said ""no, we havent really practiced in a month or so."" My friends/bandmates eventually found out and two of them don't talk to me anymore because of it. We wouldn't have become huge because of it, but who turns down the chance to play in front of 3,000 people? THIS asshole, apparently. I was/am terrified of failure and am easily scared away by really pushing hard for something. Which brings me to... 

**I have been a complete failure in college:** I actually technically ""settled"" on the school I'm at right now. I got into Northwestern, Notre Dame, Michigan, and a few other big name schools, but went where I went because I was worried about what those schools might cost. And I must have come into school with a ""settling"" mentality, cause I slumped out of the gates. I chose a private dorm rather than a dorm where I'd branch out more because I was afraid all the party people would hate me. I don't go to office hours because Im ashamed of my appearance and I am afraid that the professors hate me. I have failed a core class in a subject that I came to the school to major in, and that was the cumulative product of half-assing everything I did before that class. I now probably need to change my specialty to something less interesting that also lowers my earning potential by tens of thousands of dollars at higher levels. I don't really have the passion needed to succeed in the major I have chosen, and it is far too late to change majors or get back on the right track for this major. My GPA is mostly shit and I don't have enough credit hours left to bring it back up to something respectable.

**Zero Direction in Life:** All of this has left me mostly without close friends, no passion or interest in any future job, and lying around in a general malaise that I cannot shake. I am a bum, for lack of a better term. And everything I look back on in my life is just one major embarrassment or failure.

I really wish I'd stop hearing from the people around me that I am such a smart kid/that I have worked so hard to achieve what I have.

First I am an electrical engineering student at an Ok university (University of Oklahoma). My main goal is to one day work for a tech company, such as Intel, IBM, Nvidia etc... I am confused on what I should do to get there though. 
My first question is what classes should I make my electives? I can choose from a variety of topics and will list some. There is different areas with classes under each:

Signals and Systems:
Digital Signal processing,
Random Signals ,
etc

Solid State:
IC Fabrication,
Solid State electronics, 
etc

Electronics and Optics:
Electronics,
Optical Engineering,
etc

Radar(I am not listing this since I assume it wouldn't apply)

Communications:
Wireless Comm,
Comm,
Comm theory,
etc

Controls:
Control Theory,
Linear Systems,
Etc

Power Systems: Analysis of Electrical Transmission, Analysis of Faulted Power System

Digital Systems: Computer Architecture, Computer hardware Design, VLSI, etc

Software: Basically any software course I wish to take.

Now I can't be specific about what it is I want to do, but I do know I love computers and so far have loved my classes. If you aren't sure what the classes would be for but know some key words I should look for that would be great.

Also for internships: I know(well assume) that big tech companies like Intel, Nvidia, Google etc are extremely hard to get an internship at. If I can't get one there is there anywhere else I could look that might help with experience?

As for the minor question. What is a good minor for my goals? I was thinking computer science would help.

For my last question: When I first started college I picked the wrong major(I graduated high school early and none of my family went to college) and I found myself miserable which led to poor grades. At the end of this semester I will be looking at an Overall GPA of 3.0-3.11. How does this fare for me to get internships? My major GPA is probably about 3.8 as my grades have gotten much better after I changed my major and found my passion for what I want to do. Is there any advice for what I can do to make myself look better? 

I appreciate any information you all give me, thank you in advance for the help!"

* For my programming languages listed, what is a good way to differentiate between the ones I am highly proficient at versus the ones I am only relatively familiar with?
* I went to a highly recognizable high school in my state- should I keep that information there still?
* Can I list classes I am currently taking this semester under relevant coursework or what is a good way to show they are still in progress?
* Should I include knowledge of version control (Subversion and Git) under my skills section, or is that something employers assume you know or is not that important?

I'm pretty close to the end, but lately I've been feeling so down and disappointed and it's making me doubt what I want to do. 

For example, I did pretty badly on an exam today.  I studied thoroughly and did a lot of practice problems, and was pretty confident that I knew the material.  But after the exam I realized I made so many small mistakes here and there that probably cost me a good score. I'm so disappointed right now. 

In my next class today I was sitting there thinking about how terrible I feel for doing badly on the exam. Even though I do well overall, I've had a lot of these moments throughout my years in engineering, and it always causes me to feel terrible. And I asked myself, do you really want to do this? 

All of my internships have required walking into a cubicle every day for several hours, staring at a computer. I ask myself: Is that the end goal? Do I really want to feel terrible every time I do poorly on an exam, when the end goal is probably just sitting in a cubicle all day?

But on the other hand, for the most part, I DO do well. And for the most part, I really enjoy learning about engineering. But the times where I get stressed I just really wonder if the end is going to be worth it all.

I've wanted to be a programmer in the game development field for a long time.  I had attempted to learn C++ a few times before, but never really stuck with it. This time I have and I've made your standard Pong, Breakout and a Plants vs. Zombies type clone (with a friend) in C++ with SFML2.0.  I currently only 'know' C++, and haven't used Java in about 9 years.

What I'm looking for is someone in GameDev who could use an intern-ish coder.  I'm happy to work for/with someone for 20+ hours/week at no charge.  The only problem with me (as a perspective intern) is that my knowledge base is fairly small and I'm severely lacking experience, i.e I'm a bit of a noob.  I do however consider myself a fast learner and a relatively smart guy.

Instead of being paid, I would rather have access to someone who knows a decent amount about GameDev so I can ask questions and learn from them.  If I'm able to do it (skill wise), I'd like to help you on your project with anything I can, in exchange for a bit of your knowledge.  I may need a bit of guidance when working on something I've never done before, but you won't have to hold my hand if it's within my ability.

I also wouldn't mind maybe a couple hours a week watching you code on TeamViewer (screen share program)/Skype as I found doing that with a friend to be fun and full of chances to learn.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.  It may be too early for me to be trying to work with others, but I think there may be someone out there who could use someone like me, although it's a pretty niche situation.  General advice is also welcome!"

I work in electrical engineering and make an decent salary, but far from amazing.  I've been dating my SO for 6 years, for the last two years super long distance across the country.  She's attending law school on the east coast, while I've been working in LA.  We see each other about once a month, when I fly out to visit.    

Between undergrad and law school (both at private universities), my girlfriend is looking to graduate with over $300,000 in student loan debt, most of which is at 6.8%, some parts as high as 10%.   I went to a community college and a state school, mostly on scholarships and working full time as an intern during my junior/senior years, graduating with savings instead of debt.  Everything I've read shows that the legal job market is collapsing; unemployment is skyrocketing and wages are plummeting.  Worst yet, she wants to go into family law, which is one of the worst hit markets.  Best case scenario she pays off her debt over 25 years, having sunk the price of an average home in LA into her education.  Starting salaries aren't great, and they don't get much better as you gain experience.

I'm kind of at a loss.  I don't want to see my girlfriend as a shackle of debt.  As I start to think about marriage, I worry that I'll never be able to afford a nice home if we're shouldering a $2500 monthly loan payment for the next 25 years.  

Every option I've considered seems like a horrible choice.  Do I stay with her, and keep our finances separate, dooming her to spend 50% of her income on loan payments? Do I stay with her and help her repay her loans, putting at risk potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of my own money that can't simply be returned if the marriage ended less than spectacularly?  Do I leave the girlfriend that I love, that I've sunk 6 of my best years into?  Do I try to convince her to change course and go into something more lucrative that she may not love?

I don't want to feel selfish, but I can't help but feel like I could find a different woman who was a strong career earner like me, and enjoy an extremely high standard of living.  I love my girlfriend but I just feel like this isn't the life I wanted.  I know money isn't everything, but it certainly gives you freedom in this country; the power to make choices and not be railroaded into one option. I want to live in a nice house, raise a bunch of kids, send them to private school, drive a convertible, have a dog, the american dream you know?  I don't want to be living in a 1BR apartment and eating cheerios for the next 25 years.  I also don't want to end up single again when I'm past my prime.  "

Here's the run down. I've been working professionally in the Des Moines (Iowa) area for about a year now (3 years if you count my internship), and I would say I have medium to high job security. I graduated school here and love the town. My fiancee and I will be living together when she graduates college this Spring. My apartment lease is up June 1st, but I can also extend it on a month to month basis if I need to. She wants to rent a place, while I think buying is the better option. My reasoning:

-Another year of renting would be like dumping about $12k down the drain. 
-No one ever got rich or gained equity from renting
-I really don't want to move now, then move in a year when we get a house together
-The costs seem to be relatively similar for the two (of course houses are expensive to maintain but at least I'd be spending it on my own house)
-I'm 99.9% positive I want to stay in this town for a very long time. 

The ""rent versus buy"" calculator says that after 1.5 years, buying would be the better option, and since I plan on staying here, it seems like the better choice.

Any advice would be very much appreciated! Thanks.

I’m a 22 year old female. 6 weeks ago I decided to embark on a new weight loss journey. Stress from school and work really ruined my health. In the summer I had an internship in a different city and took 22 credits of engineering in the fall. I was pretty unhealthy and inactive, and gained a lot of weight. Since graduating, I decided I wanted to get healthy.I cut out white breads,pasta,rice, juice, cookies, pizza, crackers etc. I decided to do a lower carb, low calorie diet. I focus on lots of high protein foods, watch the fat, count calories, and eat many veggies a day.  I also drink over 8 glasses a day, take fish oils, vitamin d, multi, and vitamin b. I get at least 7 hours of sleep a night.

Having had previous success losing 40 pounds before, I know it’s not diet alone. The first week I did purely a diet. The second week I added in 60-80 minute walks 4 times. The third week, I added 4 days of cardio at the gym with 40 minutes-60 minutes. The fourth week I added a trainer twice a week along with my own 4 day individual 45 minute to an hour cardio sessions. I live in a college town and walk a lot on my days off.

That being said, I’m 6 weeks into eating healthier,  5 weeks into cardio, and 3 weeks into adding a trainer, and I just weighed myself and I gained 1.5 lbs in this time.  I’m 5’4” and 191.5 pounds, never been so heavy in my life. I usually allow myself one cheat meal a week on the weekends but try and not make it too crazy, I do drink on the weekends with my friends. But I am drinking a lot less and have gone from sedentary to active and changed my diet completely. But I just don’t understand why I’m not losing weight? Could it be muscle? Or maybe the fact I was on prednisone last week?  I really count my calories and watch what I eat, so I’m so distraught.

After graduating in 2005 from a math-and-science-oriented residential high school, I started a baccalaureate program for chemical engineering.  Unfortunately I was unable to complete it due to my mother's drug problems.  Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of ~~Education~~ Energy (blah, typos) at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!

After a rock-bottom 5 year hiatus from school and 2 years at a community college, I was selected to participate in an aerospace program at NASA -- but wait, there's more!",[deleted],intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/199c6d/fuck_supergirl_i_feel_like_superman_after_a/,"*This is a crosspost because I want to share this awesome feeling so that maybe someone in a low spot might feel like there's something for him or her around the bend.*

After graduating in 2005 from a math-and-science-oriented residential high school, I started a baccalaureate program for chemical engineering.  Unfortunately I was unable to complete it due to my mother's drug problems.  Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of ~~Education~~ Energy (blah, typos) at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!  The US Department of Energy is going to PAY me to have job experience at one of the most prestigious labs in the world.

1992fe,1,2013-02-26,Help for an engineer interested in working for a product design firm.,Jamoker,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1992fe/help_for_an_engineer_interested_in_working_for_a/,"Hello everyone, I've been checking out this subreddit and finding it to be full of very helpful and informed people.

The question I have is on some advice on how to get hired by an industrial design firm as an engineer. I am a mechanical engineer in the process of applying for my first real job. While I am applying for the standard jobs mechanical engineers apply to, I am also looking at working as an engineer for a design company. I have always had a passion for design and creating things that people would be in constant interaction with, but I know that I am neither the most creative nor artistically gifted person, so I chose engineering as a ""safe"" major during school, but never really enjoyed it. I guess currently I am stuck with seeing that I might do something I don't care that much about for the rest of my life, so I am seeing if I can get into something I care about much more. 

A kind of job I would be really interested in is something like: http://www.coroflot.com/jobs/45203/Junior-Mechanical-Engineer

Some things going for me would be that I took all the CAD courses that were available to me, so I consider myself fairly competent at using the software that was used at school (SolidWorks). I also have a minor in Architecture, which I chose after taking some courses for a communication design minor. The school I went to had a much more stronger Architecture program which is why I switched, and also the courses seemed to deal much more with the interaction between the resultant product and the user, instead of focusing purely on aesthetics. Therefore I can say that I know a bit about the interaction process between designers when working on something together and have somewhat of a design education background. I had to learn quick as I was taking classes with senior/grad level students and had to discuss with the professor and students about my opinions on the finer details of architecture. I also have some experience from my engineering design courses and my Formula SAE team with designing something in CAD and handling the challenges of fabricating those designs into a physical model for use.

In a position where I would be working together with designers consulting and working on CAD models, I think I would do very well. I am a bit lost on how to show it however. I do not have experience with a company in terms of internships that would demonstrate my ability to do so. I do not consider myself having the strongest portfolio, as I just have my engineering CAD projects to show. However, I do think that if asked to work on or create something, I would not have difficulty making anything.

What do you guys think I can do to increase my chances of getting noticed and possibly hired?

Thank you very much."

* I haven't graduated college yet, so aside from an internship this will be my first job

* I don't have any other offers right now

* cost of living is %124 compared to the national average. SF is %160 from the same source

*  I don't have any significant qualifications for the job - I am confident in my general abilities and I think I interviewed well, but nothing that specifically matches the job/industry.

* The offer is 72k + insurance and 401k, sick and vacation time. The extras seem to be good.

* The company seems really great, definitely somewhere I want to work. The culture seems awesome, everyone was nice and the recruiting process went well.

So basically, from what I've read a counter-offer generally seems to be a good idea, 5 minutes for potentially a few thousand dollars is a no brainer right? I just don't feel like I have much to negotiate with, and the current offer is pretty good in my opinion. Also, I really don't want to risk them revoking the offer. 

This is completely new territory for me so any advice is very much appreciated."
199185,2,2013-02-26,"Can't sleep, need to let all of this off my chest. Just need to write it down, sorry for the length.",LateNightInadequacie,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/199185/cant_sleep_need_to_let_all_of_this_off_my_chest/,"I’m coming to realize I’ve been crankier as of late. Technically, this isn’t my realization, this is the realization of some of my friends, but they’re absolutely right.  I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere, at some point, I was happier. I was a happy person, and now I’m angry. I treat those who are close to me like shit. I’m a straight up asshole, and I really need to atone for what I’ve done. I need to make right. I need to find ways to be more constructive. Two things are for sure: I need to write more often, and run without headphones. Writing, like I’m doing right now, always seems to alleviate some of the stress. It flows through the lungs that won’t stop going, into the fingertips, and out onto paper. Or, I suppose, the keyboard. Headphones are the bane of my run. They cheapen the experience. Every time I run without headphones, I am imbued with life, with the livelihood of the environment I am surrounded by. I live in a beautiful place, but to experience it to its fullest, I need to ensure that every sense is alert, including my hearing. I love running, but  There’s a third thing I need to fix; I’m on the computer too much. I’m not even doing homework. I need to stop procrastinating, and do things without a computer.

Why am I this way? I’d argue it’s lack of sleep, but it honestly makes me sleep less, so if it’s that, well, it’s cyclical. If I don’t sleep, I’m angry. If I’m angry, I don’t sleep. That sucks.

But, in addition to that, I’m lonely. When my friends told me the other day that I’ve been an asshole recently (they said it jokingly, but every joke has a kernel of truth), they theorized that it’s “because I need to get my dick wet.” As obnoxious, immature, and chauvinistic as that sounds, its true to an extent. The fact is, in high school, I had girlfriends, and I was happy enough. But, ever since twelfth grade, I’ve hardly tried. I definitely haven’t attempted even trying to go after a girl in at least a year. It has been 2 and a half years since I’ve even kissed a girl. And while I’ve done more than kiss, I never lost my virginity. As juvenile a complaint as that sounds, it’s getting to me. The only girl I’ve ever loved is happily in a relationship (and I’m happy FOR her), lost her virginity to the guy she dated in between him and me (a guy who was my friend, but a total asshat to her), and I almost feel like I’m behind somewhere here. I should be way ahead. College was supposed to be a blossoming period for me, girls were supposed to be crawling everywhere. A couple days ago, my housemate (who doesn’t know I’m a virgin) said to my roommate “yaknow, you either lose your virginity before your twenty one, or its not happening for awhile.” My 21st birthday is coming up (woooo), and I don’t think he realized how much that comment got to me. It really cut deep. But it’s not just the virginity thing.
I need a teammate. Someone who is on my side, who I can confide in. That’s how I’m lonely. I have friends, but I feel like I have very few friends who I can truly get personal with. And, perhaps because I spend so much time with my fraternity, I feel like I have no female friends, with the exception of a few girls from high school who I hardly talk to anymore. Honestly, there is a huge difference between girls and guys, and sometimes its nice to have close friends who are girls.

I’m also wasting my potential. I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. I want to write or teach, but I’m majoring in government, which I find fascinating enough, but I’m not engaging myself in my classes. I don’t have any special relationships with my professors (the one professor I thought I was going to ask to be my advisor, I found out tonight, can’t advise). I hardly do the work. My grades are extraordinarily lackluster (not terrible, but not what I want). I’m being pressured into applying for internships, something I’m not really trying to hard to do. I’m just not interested. The phrase “think tank” means nothing to me, and I don’t see how it will help me in my life to do this, but I feel like I’m wasting my summer if all I do is work at the movie theater again, while my peers are in DC doing fancy things with their lives. I’m really passionate about film and writing, but I don’t see anyway I can do anything about that because I’m so fucking behind. I don’t know how to make a movie, I don’t even own a camera, nor do I know how to use one. As for writing, I’m taking a class in playwriting, but I’m such a fucking procrastinator that every time something is due, I end up hastily writing it the night before, sacrificing sleep and quality, and my professor sends me back mark ups that are full of disappointment. 

I’m thinking, instead of an internship, I’ll keep the movie job. I need the money. But making 8 bucks an hour won’t do for a summer. I want to make a movie, buy a camera, final cut pro, etc., but I’m worried I don’t know anyone who will be willing to go along with my idea and star in the movie. And even if I did, I probably wouldn’t be able to energize them to help me out.

If not that, maybe I’ll go learn a foreign language at the school near my house. I need to increase my worldliness, and, on that note, I want to study abroad. However, I feel like I just want to study abroad for the sake of studying abroad. I don’t care where, or if its relevant to what I’m studying. I just want to go, but I might not even have good enough grades for that. 

Damn.

Sorry for the length of this. I couldn’t sleep and had to get these things off my chest, and there’s no one I feel I can tell most of them to.

I'm applying to my first CS internship, and I'm a bit nervous, considering that I have a mediocre GPA and I'm still blooming as a programmer (i.e., I only have experience with HTML, Python, and C++).

My question is pretty simple. I have a LOT of experience outside the classroom. For example, I served as the vice-president of the student government. Or last summer I did an internship where I worked with juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program. 

Basically, to those of you who have hiring experience, are these sorts of things something you'd want to see in a resume or hear about in an interview? Or do you just want to see a kick-ass GPA and a ridiculous amount of programming experience . . . neither of which I have. 

Thank you for any answers and for reading this!

School,  internship, job applications, my sport, nothing that nobody else has gone through and I do still find time for myself as I am an introvert. My sister and my Dad both have anxiety issues and have both had numerous panic attacks. My Dad regulates it through meditation and using a workbook and my sister uses medication. 

Lately, I have been experiencing a weird sensation, that at first occurred when I was trying to go to sleep, but has now been creeping into everyday situations. When I close my eyes my brain feels like it is almost swimming and swirling, like there is a rushing sensation where it is almost a panic feeling. It is really hard to explain that aspect of it, but I feel really rushed and my mind jumps from topic to topic, as I work myself up. I also experience a weird feeling of objects that are around me being very far away, like I am almost isolated from them. I am sorry I can not explain it in more detail, its a unique, unsettling feeling that I am not familiar with. Usually it resides after a few minutes, and I really have to focus on making it go away and open my eyes to keep my head from swimming and breathe deeply for a while. Like I said it started usually when I was trying to go to sleep, but now its happening in everyday situations, like parties and class.

198a1v,1,2013-02-25,My crappy friend and my own darkening depression.,Bristol_Larkin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/198a1v/my_crappy_friend_and_my_own_darkening_depression/,"I'm going to preface by saying that I haven't exactly planned out exactly what I'm going to say, so I'm sorry if I ramble. I will try and edit along the way to make this as understandable and readable as possible, but you have my apologies if I don't fully succeed in doing so. It will also probably be long. I wouldn't be surprised, I always find more to say.

I was considering writing this in a journal or word document, because mostly I'm looking for the catharsis of writing it down, but I figured OffMyChest would be a good place to go due to the possibility of feedback and creating a dialogue. I'm not really expecting any, but I think that allowing the possibility of it is better than no response at all. 

So, with all that out of the way, I'll get to the meat of everything.

I have a friend, and I use that term loosely, and I haven't spoken to him in over a year. Sometime I like some statuses on Facebook, but that's about it. I'm not entirely sure why I just didn't defriend him after we fell out, maybe because I didn't want to be the side that fully wrote off the other side, but I'm not entirely sure.

The rest of this will make sense if I explain exactly why we fell out. I've known this guy for about four or five years since taking a year off college. I moved back in with my parents in southern Delaware and got a retail job nearby. This guy probably wasn't someone I'd normally associate with, but people in my age group (I was 19 at the time) that had roughly the same interests as me was pretty hard to come guy. Southern Delaware is predominantly older and with middle aged couples with kids. We formed a pretty fast and close friendship. Cut to about 3 years later, I was taking the long route through college at the University of Pittsburgh with internships. Electrical Engineering isn't exactly a cake walk to begin with anyway.

Anyway, taking a longer time to get through school, a lot of friends had begun to move away and I was getting a little depressed. My fiancee had moved in after getting a job as a teacher in the area, and that was awesome, but it's still upsetting to have a steady stream of friends move away. At any rate, this friend of mine I had made in Delaware was looking to move to Pittsburgh to start college. He had gotten tired of the retail life and southern Delaware. We had a two bedroom apartment, and he asked if he could move in with us for a year to get his name on the lease and start working towards in state residency to get in state rates and in the meantime, do community college.

My fiancee and I made a pros and cons list as we heard bad things about letting friends be roommates. Our list was basically break even, with biggest con being we'd lose our own place and privacy, which we were enjoying. On the pro, the help with rent would allow us to contribute more to our wedding, which my in-laws said they would cover, despite struggling financially. At first we said no but tried to convince him to move out to Pittsburgh and find his own place.

Looking back on it, he basically guilted us into it by saying the school year was starting soon and he didn't have time to find a place. I, in my infinite wisdom thought, well, with all my friends moving away, it would be nice to have a friend move here. We would beat the odds by making a roommate agreement. He and his girlfriend were moving into our place so they'd have to play by our rules. Through the year, as far being good roommates and doing what was expected, there were no issues. In fact, things were going well. And it was around this time that I was debating back and forth between my cousin or this guy being my best man. It was a real dead heat. My cousin lived no where close, and this guy was living in the apartment with me! He'd be seeing the current status of my relationship and we'd be able to do buddy-buddy things, so he became my best man.

As the year progressed however, his true colors really came out. He moved his girlfriend away from her home in Maryland to Pittsburgh, away from her friends, and then left her after 4 months because she became depressed from being so quickly and suddenly removed from her safety net, friends, family, job, and the place she had lived all her life. He would condescend my fiancee and bury me with backhanded compliments. We came to head many many times, but always seemed to fix things. Looking back on it, he charmed and manipulated me into fixing things. He's a Grade A salesman. If there is any one thing he is good at, it is being a pitchman. I'll also give credit to say he's a phenomenal musician and lyricist, but it ends there.

So anyway, things finally blew up when I realized he had failed at every duty I needed him to do as a best man, and every time, my cousin would swoop in to save the day. He'd complain about money or scheduling, but it was just always a result of poor planning. And every time, my cousin would save the day. When my cousin finally managed to pull out a last minute bachelor party with only a week, maybe two, of planning it became pretty apparent who my best man needed to be, and I did just that. This guy got pretty pissed, and we had a very long and angry grudge match before I finally said ""you know what. Fuck you, this is my wedding.""

That might seem somewhat petty, but the real under lying feeling to this is that we opened our home to him. In return, he couldn't get his act together to be my best man. I certainly made my own missteps and mistakes with him along the way, I can not claim to be 100% innocent. However, the fact that in return for us allowing him to move in he could not be responsible for the duties of being best man hurt, and really came across to me as sense on not caring and to an extent, betrayal.

Now, this is far from over and I realize this has already very long. Longer than I intended, but that background was necessary. If you've stuck around this long, you're a pretty amazing person. If you stick around till the end, you're probably a saint.

So, we will cut forward to present. This guy who I watched for a year burn everyone around him, his ex, his co-workers, his roommates and new friends he made in Pittsburgh and simply got 'tired of' has suddenly found himself with a life that someone who has been so shitty to everyone doesn't deserve, and confuses the ever living fuck out of me. I'm entirely aware I'm going to come off bitter here, and I will address it shortly. So, anyway, this guy has become engaged to a very, very smart and successful electrical engineer from the number one engineer school in the country and now working on their PhD in Pittsburgh. And this guy has found himself to soon be a father. And I'm just sitting wondering how, in a world that is supposed to balance itself out, something like this could happen. I know he had a really crummy life growing up, but this woman just seems to so far out of his or anyone's league, and I just don't *get* it.

So, I know this makes me sound bitter, and part of it is because I'm projecting myself into this. He is living the life that I worked hard to achieve and have somehow missed it, and all he's ever really done is be an ass, yet he's traveling around to exciting places and meeting new people. I have always tried to do the right thing. I'm certainly no saint, I've stepped on a few toes, and there are some things I wish I could go back and redo, but I don't think I've ever deliberately gone out of my way to screw people over or put myself first just to get ahead. 

Strangely, I want to be happy for him, and hope he has changed, but at the same time, I feel like he is some continuing to burn by getting what I had wanted. At the same time, I'm also legitimately afraid that he will just get tired of her at some point and burn her, and then leave her with a kid and become an absent father. I actually don't want that to happen, but I'm afraid it could. At the same time, I feel like if it did, then he wouldn't be living the life I worked for and all would be even and square again. Thinking that though makes me feel like a real jerk and I know that it is wrong. A kid's life is now concerned and that's what more important than me feeling cheated.

Currently, my wife is getting her PhD in Philadelphia, so we moved from Pittsburgh. It is a 7 year program and she is one year in. I supported this decision and will continue to do so as I would never do anything to compromise her ambition and dreams, but I **hate** it here. I miss the ever loving fuck out of Pittsburgh. I have friends that moved back to the area and made friends in my last year of school that are still there. Where I'm at now, I just haven't really met people that I feel I can connect with. I live just beyond the suburbs of Philly, my wife takes a train into Philly and I drive to my work outside of Reading. I'm into electronics, video games, Doctor Who, European tabletop gaming and weight lifting and the majority of the people I've met are into hunting, working on their cars and the like. I'm a Grade A nerd stereotype who is most at home with other nerds and the people that I've so far met around me are decidedly not.

Compounding the problem is my job. When I first started, I had lots of varied and interesting work. I was actively making use of my electrical engineering degree, to the extent I was still consulting my text book and notes. It was challenging and exciting, and I was able to do some domestic traveling. Unfortunately, they have an overly complex management systems which keeps the company's cost extremely high and they are currently non competitive in the power market, which is where my interests lie. Lots of jobs have been pulled and they are losing lots of bids and it is a day to day struggle to have enough work and I've become quickly disenchanted with the work I do have. My interests lie in relay coordination, grid communications, power storage and power generation. The work I have is none of the above, it is not engaging and is not satisfying. I'm not looking to change the world, but I would like to have work that gets me out from behind a desk, away from the cubicle farm and makes a difference.

I wish I could say I was looking, but I am on the graduate development leadership team and have made my commitment to that. That position ends in June, and then I will probably begin to look. Being in this leadership position offers me the opportunity to go to senior management meetings, though I myself am not, and hear their business development plans. It legitimately sounds very interesting what they are trying to bring in, and I'm almost tempted to stay, but I don't think they are structured effectively to be competitive to do so, and they don't market themselves well enough to be visible to this new work.

The past few months with work near zero has made me considering going back to school. With my wife already in a PhD program, I have no idea how we'd afford if I return to school. We signed a two year lease to keep rent locked at its current rate. I know I want to get my masters, but I go back and forth if I want to get my PhD. I'm really interested in smart grid technologies and grid power storage, but most of this is still in research, and I'm not interested in a life in academia, I'm interested in design, application and instrumentation. Basically, I want to have my cake and eat it, too. I don't know what to do about that. Also, with my wife in her PhD, I'm limited to the schools I can apply to. I don't really think I can ask her to try and do a long distance marriage just become I feel bad. Furthermore, I think I'd fall apart without her. She's my absolute best friend.

Meanwhile, I see this guy who has always been an ass living the life I hoped I was going to have while I tried to always do things the right way. I've taken my risks, and they haven't panned out the way I hoped they would.

So, that's my wrap up. Sorry it ended up being so anti-climactic. If felt really good to get this all out there. Also, my apologies for this being so long, and any edits or typos I may have missed. I think it at least flows and is understandable. If you made it this far, you're pretty fucking cool, and if you leave something to say, then you're a better person than I could probably ever hope to be.

Edit 1: Found some typos and fixed them. Sorry

Edit 2: Also, I know you're not supposed to compare your life to someone's Facebook highlights. I certainly have my own hobbies and accomplishments, but given the past history, it just really irks me for some reason."

I'm currently a 2L law student. I was wondering if any lawyers on here would like an unpaid intern for the summer. I'm interested several different types of law but my top choice would be corporate, dealing with mergers/acquisitions, securities, IP, or tax. Also, I am very interested in prosecution or criminal defense. If you would like some free legal labor this summer, please let me know and I can send you my resume and anything else you'd like. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and upvote please,

19cwds,5,2013-02-27,I feel like my bf [24] and I [20] are on completely different pages when it comes to our future. ,confused___girl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19cwds/i_feel_like_my_bf_24_and_i_20_are_on_completely/,"My boyfriend is graduating college this year while I'm still going to be in school for another two years. We've been dating for a little less than a year, and things have been going well. We are on the same page about nearly everything, sex life is great, no serious arguments, etc. Personality-wise, I feel like he's my other half. I've never felt more comfortable with anyone else as I do with him.


When I first met him, he had been in college for five years and not had a resume. I had to give him my resume format so he could have one. He filled it with three pages of pointless fluff like ""worked as a movie extra"" ""worked on the set of this TV show"" ""worked at a bakery in Korea"" etc. when his major and the jobs he's applying for has nothing to do with baking or television. I told him it was common knowledge that a resume should be a page long and should contain only relevant experiences, but we actually had an argument over this because he wanted to keep his irrelevant work experiences since they were ""cool"". He's not active in any sort of school organizations and has worked as a bus boy for more than 6 years instead of looking for relevant work experiences because he it's easy and he ""gets paid to eat"". I had several arguments with him over this because I was so frustrated that he had spent his college career doing nothing that would have helped better his future. As a fifth year college student he didn't even know that three pages for a resume is too long by any standard. Now he's starting to get nervous and is looking for jobs but has not heard back from any about a job offer. I'm waiting on him to sign a lease because he wants to move to the same city as me and get a job here. However, I feel like we have different goals for the future. For me, I want to be successful in my career and have been working hard since starting college to secure internships and relevant work experiences to help me in the future. He hasn't taken much initiative to market himself as a qualified candidate for jobs that he's interested in.



I told him before that if our positions were reversed, I couldn't reciprocate what he's doing to be with me (moving to the same city and getting a job here). But he is still keen on moving to the same city as me to be with me. I don't think this is fair to him so I've been seriously considering breaking up (which we have done so in the past for a few days, but got back together). He thinks that it's stupid to break up when we have no serious disagreements or irreconcilable differences. I just have this feeling that while I have a great time being with him, and I do love him, our differences will eventually become too apparent and it wouldn't work out.



Is this a justifiable reason to end a relationship? I've told him in the past that I felt that in a relationship, both parties should help motivate each other. With our relationship, I feel like I'm the one who feels like I have to keep pushing him forward. I thought that dating someone several years older than me would mean dating someone who was mature and could be someone I could look up to, to have a shoulder to lean on.



I told my friend about my feelings and he told me that as someone who comes from an Asian background, we're ""hardwired"" to be more concerned about jobs and our future, and white people are more laid back. However, I know plenty of white people who are doing internships and job fairs! I'm not trying to secure a future so I can have money and status (which he has accused me of...saying that I am just looking for someone who is successful/rich). I'm genuinely passionate about my area of study (which does not guarantee a high salary at all) and I want a significant other who has passion and drive as well.




Right now, I feel like I'm at a crossroad. I really care about him and I love being with him. I don't think I'll ever find anyone more compatible or similar to me. However, it's difficult to see us working out in the long run. I just don't know what I should do right now. This is my first serious relationship so I'm a bit clueless and may have been a little incoherent with what I wrote. Sorry about that, and thank you for your help in advance.



tl;dr: I feel like my bf and I are on completely different pages when it comes to our future and goals in life. Should I/is this a justifiable reason to break up?

19cvme,1,2013-02-27,"Another unemployed, depressed artist.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19cvme/another_unemployed_depressed_artist/,"I’m really, infinitely sorry for posting this, but I’ve been reading other people’s problems and frustrations and everyone seems to feel better, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? 
Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, wanted to make video games more than anything else in the world. 
I knew it would be hard to get a job, and I didn’t even really believe in myself skill-wise, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. 
School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, all while drawing like crazy on the side.
Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!”  I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. 
Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. 
It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. 
Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. 
Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. 
Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. 
Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc. 
Stop drawing altogether. 


2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. 
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. 
Extreme depression. 
Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 

Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. 
An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. 
I start creating more. 
Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. 
Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. 
Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy much more.  

Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete!
-illustrating a children’s book
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints.
Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. 
Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for, but find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. 
Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. 
Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. 
I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. 
I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work.  

There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. 
I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program)
 I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 
Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job.  If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.

19cuav,2,2013-02-27,Dilemma: Work at defense contractor or go to dev bootcamp (App Academy)?,nothing4me,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19cuav/dilemma_work_at_defense_contractor_or_go_to_dev/,"Hello!

First, background information:

* I graduate in 2014.

* Major: Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering

* Minor: Computer Science

So, I have an internship offer for the summer I have already accepted for a large defense contractor named Raytheon (software engineering). I am also currently in the middle of talking with a couple of very interested people at Lockheed Martin (another defense contractor, software engineering).

In addition, I got accepted to [appacademy.io](http://www.appacademy.io/#p-home) as well.

So, I am kind of torn between working these two options (I am a student, so I am only free for the summer). I do not mind working for a defense contractor at all. I find software fun to program as well as doing web development. But, I am not sure which way to pick.


I am thinking of this... Tell App Academy to hold my admission for some time. Then, take the defense contractor internship and if I don't like it, attend App Academy.

Can I please have your opinions? Thank you for your times!"

I'm Bipolar II, and I'm currently in my 2nd year of getting my MSW and I have an internship as part of the program.

I've missed a few meetings (the internship is online) and I hate coming up with ""lame"" excuses.

I'm afraid to tell ""the truth"" because I don't want to be seen as unable to perform well enough for this job.

Any thoughts or advice? How have you handled this? 

UPDATE: Talked to my supervisor, and she said that she is glad to know more of the ""context"" of why I've been missing meetings. She said that in the future to call ahead rather than apologize and ask for forgiveness after teh fact. So, it helped and made me feel better about it. She appreciated the disclosure and acknowledged that there is a stigma with it, but it does help (sometimes) to know what it going on rather than making up excuses. 
So, even though it may not be best for everyone, it seems to have worked out for me. Thanks for all of your help, and I hope this can help some of you :) "

Did you miss out on opportunities that would've made your life easier?

In college you always hear about how you're supposed to network and do all these extra activities like frats/soroties and clubs. And you meet those few choice students who do amazing side projects on their own and develop the new facebook or instagram or whatnot.

However I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student and have never done any of this aside from my Society of Computer Engineers club membership (but even then I only go there to sit and study between classes). My classmates are out there creating amazing side projects and going to job fairs and amassing internships and I just don't have the urge to do any of this.

I take the minimum amount of units to be full-time and I work part-time and I feel like just that is enough to keep me busy at all times (and then add in familial obligations as I still live at home). Though when I see my classmates who have jobs lined up for the future and who all seem to have much more marketable skills than I do (usually from pre-existing knowledge before college which I never had) it makes me feel like I am very much behind the 8 ball in the industry. 

So redditors who took the same path that I am currently on, please share your stories. Are my fears justified? Any advice you can offer?

19cfzc,6,2013-02-27,"I [f22] work as a graphic designer. My little sister [f20] works for a company with no real job description, but is apparently 'designing' their website.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19cfzc/i_f22_work_as_a_graphic_designer_my_little_sister/,"Note: I tried to be as clear as I could in that title. I'm a bit frustrated and I didn't know how to word my frustrations.

Backstory:

I went to college right out of school to get my degree in Visual Communications (Graphic Design). Once I completed college, I picked up an internship, which then turned into a full time job. I have been with this company for nearly two years. Though, I'm not paid very well - The company is fairly busy but because of a choice client refusing to pay his bill we have fallen in rough times until the case is taken to collections. Anyway...

My little sister has no education, other than highschool. She's been in the workforce since she graduated. First she worked for a children's hair salon (hair stylist, still uneducated). She then left when she fell ill and had to go live with my parents. (The house they were renting was riddled with mould and made her very sick. Her and her fiance lived in my parents basement for about half a year.) 

While she was recuperating, she took up an office job at a trailer manufacturing company. While there, she approached me and the company I work for for a website. We met, quoted it out, and never heard from them again.

She eventually quit this job, despite the incredible pay and how good the company was to her. She bought a house with her fiance, and went back to the children's hair salon. After about 6 months there, she's back at the trailer manufacturing company. (Wow, I didn't realise how back-and-forth she's been).

I actually picked up a part time job on weekends at said hair salon because I'm having money issues.

To be fair, I'm fairly resentful of her job. She gets paid a LOT more than me. She doesn't realise how fortunate she is to have this opportunity. She was hired on initially to do their safety program, and work on the floor doing something to do with safety. I don't know exactly, but she kind of had this handed to her on a shiny silver platter.

Yeah, I've always had resentment for my sister. Likely relevant.

The problem: 
Once my sister got her job back at the trailer place, I asked her if there was any chance to revisit us designing/building their website. She told me the owners decided to go with 'some girl' instead.

Which, happens to be her! And this kind of really PISSED me off! I only found out because my mom mentioned something about it last night. She's also been emailing me these last few days asking about templates, design, and 'back office'.

I told her that if she intends to change the design, she'd need to know HTML and CSS, and I don't know what a back office is because we build our stuff custom from the ground up - no templates or the like.

When it finally clicked I became enraged. I've kept most of it bottled up inside me but I am wondering how I should go forward with this.

I feel like she's pissing on my career choice. I went to school for this. I do my job, and I do my job well. It's my livelihood. We have a programmer, who does his job well. She lied to me about who was doing their website, and she's asking me for help. She is going to do a hacky shitty job (other than hair styling, she has no creative talent), and she's obviously aiding in taking away work from our company.

I don't know what to do. I want to call her out on it. In fact, I may have already emailed her about it. Just asking if she was designing the website, but I don't know what to say once she responds.

Side note: I'm supposed to meet with her this week to work on designing her wedding invites, but the childish mad side of me wants me to tell her to go design her own invites seeing as she thinks she's capable.

And rereading all that I feel like a childish brat. So feel free to call me out on it if you see fit. I just don't know how I should act about this. I know what I WANT to say, but I also know that won't go over well. I do want to make her aware of how this is effecting me. How, with the current financial issue I'm in, it's become even more frustrating. We get clients like this all the time, who take their work to 'someone else aka their nephew who knows dreamweaver' or something, but when it happens with my own family it's a bit more personal.

**TL;DR Little sister, always having thing handed to her on a nice shiny platter, knowingly takes away design work from the design company big sister works for to do it 'herself', which spells disaster. Bit about education, big sister works her ass off to get where she is, while little sister just floats through life. Obviously resulting in angry big sister, but unsure how to approach the little sister to talk about it. Like adults. Hopefully.**


EDIT: Ah, a short-lived drama, flaired by my rash temper. I appreciate all the helpful advice given. I guess morning when I realised what was going on, and not hearing the full story directly from her kind of pushed me over the edge. I'm glad I wrote here before I confronted her because I can guarantee things wouldn't end well.

I haven't heard from her, but I did email her and say that I was bothered by what happened. It was a piss on my career. I didn't feel good about it. I didn't like that she lied about it to me, and that I found out through someone else. I also said I realised that it wasn't her decision where the site was made, and I can't blame her for that. I told her that she can't ask me for advice. I won't give it away freely. I worked hard to get where I am and I'm not going to spend my time trying to help her when I've taken the time to figure out these things for myself.

And I said I'll see her tomorrow. So, if I haven't enraged her too much, this means I can still do her wedding invites for her.

I ended up spending summer self-studying a bunch of programming languages and programming in general so that by senior year I felt like I was on top of things.

I come from an undergrad in Electronics Engineering and I'm currently doing an MS in Comp. Engg. at the U of Florida. I'm having a hard time securing an internship interview. I have some questions about what to put on my resume (already searched /r/cscareerquestions but couldn't find anything relevant):

* **objective section on resume**: yay or nay? I've read one post where they said it's better to put a summary of yourself than a generic objective. The internet has divided opinions on the subject (but Google didn't show up anything specifically for Comp. Science, which is why I'm asking here). My objective currently reads as ""looking for a software development internship."" too bland?

* **list individual courses**: is this a good idea or is it a waste of space? I did this because I figured it would offset my lack of undergrad CS exposure. but after having been to the career fair this semester, i saw that most people just skimmed through that section. *edit: Also, I'm worried that this is eating up space that I could better use to provide more details on my projects.*

* **work experience**: I have work experience (4 years after my undergrad) in VLSI testing and design. not sure if i should include it. there are some transferable skills like mentoring and there was a bit of C coding involved. most of it was VHDL, RTL simulation though, which is not relevant to software development.

**TL;DR**: current Masters in Comp. Sci with unrelated undergrad degree needs advice on internship resumes."

I've been reading this sub for a while now - you guys always give great advice, so I was hoping a few of you could check my thought process here.

I'm a grad student, living with my SO.  Together we take home about 3.6k a month.  We currently live in a city and don't need or want a car.  However, I have a mandatory (paid) internship for the summer in a part of the country where, sadly, a car will be necessary.  We would want the car for driving across the country to the internship, daily commuting, and driving back.  After that, we have no more use for the car.

Since I started grad school in the fall, we've managed to save up about 5k.  This amount constitutes the entirety of our savings/emergency fund.  The internship is paid, and our take-home pay will be about the same per month (possibly a little higher).

As I see it, my options are either:

- Buy a car, and then sell it (possibly for a small loss) at the end of the summer.  OKish looking used cars sell in my area for about 3-4k with 150k miles on them.  The benefit of this strategy is that over the long-term I wouldn't pay too much, since I could sell the car at the end of summer.  The drawback is that it would cut significantly into our pretty meager savings, and if something goes wrong (like the engine fails), we'd be out 3-4k and have no car.

- Rent a car for 3 months.  I've called a few places up, and it looks like this would cost about 1700-2200 dollars for the entire summer, split over 3 months.  Since this is roughly equivalent to what we've been saving per month, we could definitely afford this kind of a monthly payment without even cutting into our savings, though we'd stop contributing for the summer.

Advice?  My current thought is that option 1 would technically be the overall better option for someone with a little more in savings, but for us it would be too risky.  I don't really know a lot about cars or how likely they are to fail, though, so maybe I'm overestimating that risk?  

I'm happy to provide other information, if it's relevant.  Thanks a bunch for your thoughts!"

I just want to vent, or maybe even just write down my thoughts. Anyway, here it goes.

I started dating my girlfriend in November of 2011. We were really good friends starting around May of that year, and got closer and closer over the summer. By the fall, I had to start my first semester at college. Not being able to bare the thought of her finding someone else while I was away at school I made my move on her. We finally kissed and were dating the same day. Everything was amazing from November throughout the school year and summer. We grew even closer, I loved her more than I thought I could love a person. And even though we were only 18 and 19 years old, we started talking about marriage down the road and planning our lives out together. She said she wanted to be with me forever, and I was stupid enough to believe it. At the end of the summer we were both heart broken to let each other go. But, she had to start her Freshman year at school and I had to begin my second year. Our schools were 2 hours from home in different directions so we figured it wouldn't be any different than being long distance last year. We agreed that we'd both come home every 2 or 3 weeks to see each other. It sounded doable and I was ready for the start of the semester. But after only a few days at college she started to seem more distant. I didn't know what was going on, but I didn't like it. Late one night, still in our first week into the new school year, I told her that I felt like she was getting more distant with me, and I just wanted to know what was going on. She said she wanted to break up.

I was stunned. She was my whole world and out of nowhere she just wanted to be done. She was my first girlfriend, and obviously my first breakup, and this was a very serious relationship in my mind. So all of those factors led me to be really upset and depressed. She said that she still loved me, but she just didn't want to have a boyfriend in college. She didn't want to be tied down. As I said before, I was heartbroken and it seemed like our breakup lasted an eternity, in reality, it was 6 days. 

After less than a week, she realized that other guys didn't compare to me. They weren't worth saying goodnight to is how I think she put it. Anyway, she wanted me back and, not having any time to get over her, I took her back with open arms. Everything was going great after that, it felt like we were back to normal...for about a month.

Around the beginning of October last year I asked her a very potent question. One that was stupid and that I knew I wouldn't like the answer to. I asked her 'before me, when was the last time you had sex?' She didn't want to answer, but I finally got it out of her, and she told me that it was the day we first kissed. This crushed me. I felt like the song and dance we were going through before we started dating was a mutual experience. I felt like her sleeping around while we were in that 'pseudo-dating' phase cheapened all of the memories we shared during that time. So, after she told me that, I lied to her and told her that while we apart for 6 days I slept with someone. I hadn't really; at that point I hadn't slept with anyone else in my life. I had never kissed anyone before in my life. I just wanted to feel some idk, vindication? I wanted to feel like I could do what she did. But, after about an hour of thinking about this, I decided I didn't want to lie to her for the rest of my life and I told her the truth. She flipped out, asked me how she could ever trust me again, that kinda stuff. I still feel like she was over reacting a tad, but what I did was really shitty, and really stupid I know. So she used that to break up with me a second time.

 A few days later she said that she forgave me, but still didn't want to date me anymore. She gave the same reasons as last time, saying she didn't want a ld boyfriend blah blah blah. This time, we don't really talk at all for 2 weeks. That's when she calls me on the phone crying. She says she misses me, and how she's a terrible girlfriend, and she's really confused, and feels alone and all of this. I was a little overwhelmed but just told her that I was there for her. That kicked off a period of a few weeks where we were unofficially dating. I even went down to see her at school one weekend and it was feeling like we were going to get back together again. But she was still on the fence. So, I told her that we wouldn't talk for 2 weeks, she could get an idea of what not being with me would be like, and then she could decide what she really wanted. Well, the 2 weeks went by, and she decided that she wanted me back. Again I excepted. I also found out that she slept with someone while we were in our 2 week nc phase. I didn't blame her for that. All that stuff goes on with being single and not having a bf. 

So we get back together AGAIN and everything is good for awhile. We have less than a month left in the semester, she comes up to my school to visits me and then winter break hits. We were inseparable. For 5 weeks we spent maybe 2 nights  away from each other. Alas, winter break ends and we go back to school. About a week into school, I go on Facebook for the first time since break and notice that she's logged in. I go to log her out, but see her messaging her friend. They were talking about how she was thinking about cheating on me with another guy. I'm shocked once again (even though maybe I shouldn't be at this point) and call her angrily. She says she wasn't really going to do it, but that a part of her wanted to. And then she goes into the exact same thing about not wanting a relationship right now. 

So we break up again. And the first week, being 2 days before Valentines day (when I was going to go see her) I was a complete wreck. Crying every day, it was awful. The next week, a switch flips, I talked to my ex (that still feels weird to say) and she said that she still loves me, and even misses me, but that she doesn't want this right now.We decided that we would see each other in a month, so that we could return each other's things. But I hope that's just a front. I really can't picture giving all of her stuff back. I hope that she misses me just as much as I miss her. Anyway, since the feelings are still there, I decided to look at this more like a break and go out and experience things that I never thought I'd be able to do. So, I did that. 

It's been 2 weeks since I made that decision and for the most part I'm happy. I joined a bowling league, I got an internship in the nature preserve on my campus, I started a tv show for the school tv station, and I made a ton of new friends. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this next part, but I've also slept with 8 girls in about a week. And I think that's whats getting my depressed lately. No matter how many girls, or how good it is, I still feel empty afterwards. It's not the same. None of these girls can compare to her. It's not her. There's no connection. And I miss the connection, and I miss her.

Like I said, I've taken the mindset that this is a break that will end in a month when I give her stuff back. I feel like that will be enough time for her to realize what she's done again. But a part of me is starting to think that this isn't going to be just a break again. And I'm worried that it won't be. Despite everything that she's done to me, I still love her, and I still want her back. If I get that chance I won't be so careless with how we treat the relationship. We're obviously not perfect, and we need to change some things. Both of us. But if she's willing, I would love nothing more.

So that's my story. I feel  little better just writing it down, but I'm still confused. Getting over her is going to take a long time, but I don't want to think about that. I don't want to get over her, I want to get back with her.  Despite what she's done, and the pain she's put me through, I want her back. And I don't know if that's going to happen.

So what are your thoughts? How much time did it take you to get over your SO? Based on my story, do you think she'll want me back at some point? If she does should I do it, and if so what types of ground rules could we put down so that this doesn't happen again? I have some ideas but any advice is appreciated."
19bcxb,21,2013-02-27,What is an entry level job?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19bcxb/what_is_an_entry_level_job/,"I am going to try and keep this general, because I think (and I could very well be wrong it happens a lot) this is something a lot of people want to know.

What exactly is an ""entry level"" job or position in the tech or IT sectors? What are the job titles that different types of tech companies (software companies, ISPs, open source foundations, etc...) use?

For example, I have been told that ""QA"" was the entry level job for developers. I didn't know what ""QA"" meant so I gave it a google and found out it meant ""Quality Assurance"" (or some similar variant). I thought to myself ""Finally! I know what to look for!"" So I plugged that in to search engines and all I've found are jobs looking for people with 5+ years in QA. So I need 5 years of experience at an entry level position to get an entry level position? Normally you don't see this kind of recursion outside of poorly written computer science textbooks.

I am not looking for a job that pays over $30,000 USD (GROSS) annually. I am not looking for a job with benefits, long term security, Hell I'm not even looking for a growth position. I am completely aware that these jobs are contract positions farmed out to staffing agencies.

I am not looking to get rich quick. I am not looking to pad my resume with a couple hundred certification acronyms my gut tells me don't mean shit. I just want to know what Microsoft or startups or Amazon or whoever calls their bottom rung. I just want to know what the bottom of the totem pole is. 

So, TL;DR: what are the entry level positions in the most common tech company businesses called?


Final note: for the purposes of this discussion, ""intern"" doesn't count.

I finished with my undergrad in psych 3 years ago and am finishing a masters now in industrial organizational psych. I have been working at a consulting firm the last 2 years a week here or there every month or two. The reason I'm saying what I've been doing is to speak to the job prospects I would have in my field. I can remain at the small firm I'm at being treated like scum and barely making enough to get by since jobs are few and far between for the firm or go into HR. 

So 2 years ago I took an entrepreneurship class and loved it. I had an idea for a project and made a website for it and have since made many websites, logos and other design work. I spent a few semesters in a masters architecture career change program in between undergrad and masters psych. I enjoyed it, but none, and I mean none of the recent graduates were finding work so I decided I had to move on. So that's where my background in design comes from. So I've started to learn python and java on my own the last few months and really enjoy it even on a very beginner level. 

There's a masters CS program that's around 50th from the rankings I've found in my city that I'm planning to begin prereq's for this summer through the fall and begin the program in the spring. My gre score was pretty high and the program said with the prereq's I would be admitted. I'm really worried though that even after an internship over one of the summers during an MS that it would be very difficult with my background to find a job. Will my background really hinder me? Is this a reckless decision since I don't have the experience other students will have? I'm also a little worried about the research I've read a little about showing that there is basically two groups in programming, the one's that can and the ones that can't. I'm not afraid of working really hard but am worried that going off the 'I've been good at math in the past' thing might be way too small of a sample size to predict programming aptitude from.

I have a few questions about changes I have thought about making and your input is greatly appreciated: 

* I think I have pretty good internship experience, should I list that ahead of education? Or perhaps my skills summary first? 
* I am pretty sure my first sentence in my skills summary before my bullets is just a waste of space, thoughts? 
* For my programming languages listed, what is a good way to differentiate between the ones I am highly proficient at versus the ones I am only relatively familiar with? 
* I went to a highly recognizable top high school for science and technology in my state- should I keep that information there still? 
* Can I list classes I am currently taking this semester under relevant coursework or what is a good way to show they are still in progress?  I have some classes (database systems, computer security, computer networks) that I want to show I am taking but am not sure how or if this is a good idea since I am still enrolled and it is early in the semester
* Should I include my knowledge of version control (Subversion and Git) under my skills section, or is that something employers assume you know or is not that important?

I have heard that the two are similar, and I was wondering if I should try to transfer over to comp sci or if I should just stick with computer engineering. What is the process of switching engineering majors like? What are job and internship opportunities like in computer engineering live vs comp sci? I have been hearing mixed reports on this, so I'm not really sure what to do. 

P.S. any tips for getting my self settled at UIUC? I'm the first in my family to go to college so this is very new to me. "

So I've been trying to get healthy for a while, with moderate success. I started going to the gym with my brother when I was 19, and started going off and on. I lost a good amount of weight, but kept on eating shittily. In the past year or so I've really started eating healthier, but I haven't going to the gym as much, the longest I've been away from the gym was the 3 months that I was working at my internship. I really want to get a good, consistent gym routine going, and my brother pointed out BTFC and asked if I wanted to do it with him. I said I would be down as it would be a good motivator and it's a lot easier going to the gym with someone else than by yourself, at least for me. So here I am now, and hopefully I will be able to stick to the routine that we made and have some good progress in the months to come."
19ayyv,7,2013-02-26,Descent,Kinkaypandaz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19ayyv/descent/,"As of late I have been reading some of the tales others have shared here on NoSleep, I decided it was time that I share a story of my own. A genuine story that has been quite disturbing for me.

It was late in the fall, the time when most of the leaves are a deep crimson red and the wind is bitterly cold and biting, I was scheduled for a job interview that day. I had applied for an intern ship with a big time oil company. The interview took place in a tall building that seemed to surpass the clouds and the heavens, it hurt my neck looking that far up. I was greeted with the usual business front a warm inviting lobby with a receptionist behind a desk, she looked up at me with a soft smile and said ""How can I help you?"" I returned her smile and said ""I am here for an interview about the internship, can you tell me what floor I am supposed to be on?"" She looked down at her computer for a couple of minutes typing away, still glancing at her computer she said ""You will be seeing Mr. Harkinson on floor 22"" I thanked the receptionist and made my way to the elevator.

I stepped into the elevator and slowly began my ascension to the 22nd floor, while I waited and gazed at myself in the mirror I began to give myself a peptalk ""Alright, you have got to be confident, smooth, make him laugh a little... but be serious!"" The elevator rang as it approached the 22nd floor and the doors parted revealing rows upon rows of cubicles and a large glass board room near the back. A man that was dressed sharper than a sword came out to greet me with a hearty hello and a firm handshake. From there we hit it off, I made him laugh he told me he liked my business ethics and I would make a great addition to the company. 

All I can say is that I was teeming with joy upon hearing this, a little too much though. For when I re-entered the elevator, my excitement got the better of me and I failed to notice that the elevator had went past the lobby and down to the basement of the building. ""Funny,"" I began ""I don't remember there being a basement button."" To my surprise there was no button for the basement as I had previously acknowledged, the elevator stopped with a loud and resonating mechanical whir and the doors parted. There was an empty room ahead nothing in there, I tried to close the doors and return to the lobby but the elevator refused. Thinking that I might be able to find some stairs that led back to the lobby I stepped out of the elevator, just as I did the doors shut and the elevator left me. I searched the empty expanses of the basement for a door but there was nothing. By this point I went from uneasy to nervous

I turned to make my way back to the elevator and there was a man, or what I thought to be a man, standing there, my hairs stood on end seeing this figure and the air chilled me to my core. I couldn't meet the man's gaze not because I didn't look at him but because no eyes met mine. He only had a mouth, which looked as if it was muttering something but it was too silent and indistinct to make sense of. The man begun to slowly shamble towards me still muttering to himself, I froze in fear and panic, his words became more clear as he got closer. He was whispering ""I shall take your eyes..."" 

With what ever strength I could muster I ran past the apparition towards the elevator, furiously tapping the up arrow and slamming my fists on the doors. Glancing over my shoulder I could see him continuing towards me still whispering those horrid words. As he inched closer the lights behind him began to flicker and shut off. I turned to the doors again still banging my fists, but to no avail did the doors open. I felt his breath upon the nape of my neck, his whispers rang loudly in my ears, I whirled around and fell against the door only to meet my him standing before me. He seemed to be intently focused on me, relishing his soon to be eyes. Fear had frozen me again, I stood and watched as he placed his hands on my shoulders and brought his mouth closer to me still whispering ""I shall take your eyes..."" 

I shut my eyes as tight as they could go and waited for the inevitable, I heard his jaw crack and unhinge and I could smell his rancid breath, his mouth centimetres from my face. I heard a loud ding as the doors opened and I fell backwards with loud thump, I opened my eyes to find that I had fallen inside the elevator. I stood up and reached to press the lobby button but before I did I gazed out of the elevator to see the figure standing just before the threshold of the doors, still whispering ""I shall take your eyes...."" With that the doors closed and the elevator made its climb to the lobby. I walked out of there as fast as I could.

I never take the elevator in that building any more. However, I still feel  uneasy, I still hear the faint whispers reminding me ""I shall take your eyes..."" "

First, I think it's awesome that this subreddit exists. It's been hugely helpful to see the kinds of questions and answers that get posted here, and I want to thank you guys for being supportive of those entering this career.


To those wanting to get straight to the point, here is the resume in question (sorry, it's a direct download link): http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12995124/John_Doe_Resume.docx


So about myself, I'm going to be graduating with an M.S. in comp sci this May, and before that I graduated with a B.A. in comp sci and a social sciences major (double major). I went straight from undergrad to grad, so I have no in-between real world experience, and I also have no internship experience. I personally think this is going to be the killer (i.e. biggest downfall) for me, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, I think I'm a decent programmer, but I also didn't take the all the rigorous CS courses that the B.S.'s had to take (foundations of computing, undergrad algorithms, senior design, etc.) so I may be lacking somewhat in those areas. The biggest concern I have is that people will see M.S. in comp sci and immediately think ""Oh, this guy has a Master's, so he just MUST have all the theory down solid""...truth is, I don't. My school is okay, but they really didn't teach me as much theory as I thought they would in the past 2 years during grad school.


Really the only thing mildly going for me is my teaching experience (been a TA for the past 2 years during grad school), and one year as a graduate research assistant working with robotics (first year grad school).


Also, I'm sure this has some effect but I'm not sure to what degree, but I'm an international student so that automatically closes many doors for me (correct? wrong?). Should I include this on my resume?


Any input at all is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the help in advance."

[The study cited in this article was done on data from a past population in a single country, in/during which life was significantly different than it is today](http://www.shine.yahoo.com/parenting/study-having-boys-months-off-life-175000907.html). It doesn't show cause or even genuinely negative implications of the subject matter (the effects of having a baby boy on a mother's lifespan) yet the author's title implies relevance, cause, and negative effect.    
    
According to the article, the study was done on data from families living in pre-industrial Findland. The population sample size described is odd, with the number of mothers evaluated nearly double that of fathers. This leads to the question, ""Why so few fathers?"" Since this was during a more traditional time period, it isn't likely to be because of divorce. It is reasonable to wonder if the reason is that some fathers' shortened lifespans were ignored due to circumstances to which their deaths may have been attributed, such as accidental deaths.     
       
One factor providing some insight as to why the correlation discussed in the study cannot be related to cause is buried in the middle of a paragraph placed halfway through the story.    
&gt; In Finland during the 1700s and 1800s, a girl helped her mother by shouldering many of the household responsibilities, which could have increased the mother's life span slightly.    
    
...which can be turned around to say women died earlier if they didn't have daughters, as daughters represented the same type of help a business receives from an unpaid intern - free labor in trade for training.    
    
Attribution of shortened maternal lifespan to boy births involved speculation on the varying effects of gestation and childbirth on the body. The Daily Mail story linked in the Yahoo story even states that testosterone weakens the immune system.    
   
This idea did not make sense - If weakening of the immune system by increased testosterone shortens the lifespan, wouldn't that negatively impact on the survival of men in societies existing prior to modern advances in medicine like antibiotics?    
    
Most of the links I found in a search leading to assertions that testosterone weakens the immune system opened bodybuilding discussion forums in which laypeople were discussing the possibility, but almost nothing of a medical or research nature.    
    
Finally, I found [an interesting article on the topic on sciencedaily.com](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/10/991007083730.htm) which, instead of confirming the notion, contradicts it. The article suggests that rather than suppressing the immune system, elevated testosterone actually activates it, triggering the stress response and sending immune cells to locations where the body is often the most threatened.   
    
[This news-medical.net article agrees with the notion that testosterone weakens the immune system](http://www.news-medical.net/news/2004/11/08/6138.aspx?page=1), but if the study relied on blood testing for its evidence, it may suffer from exactly the type of flaw cited in the sciencedaily article... and the news-medical.net author admits that further study is needed before applying the concept to medical treatment.     
    
Regardless, one must also consider the fact that even with elevated levels following childbirth, women are still exposed to a lower level of testosterone than men, and shortness of male lifespan is not attributed to elevated testosterone, but to [other factors](http://men.webmd.com/features/why-mens-lives-are-shorter-than-women), some of which [can be linked to *decreased* testosterone](http://kwikblog.kwikmed.com/2012/04/17/preliminary-research-shows-potential-benefits-of-testosterone-for-heart-failure-patients/). Certainly, if testosterone were as dangerous as suggested in that one line of the article, there would be more evidence in the portion of the population whose testosterone is generally higher. 
    
The Daily Mail article also suggested that the size of baby boys had an effect. However, the size of baby girls varies among women, as well, and there is nothing in any of the articles to suggest that the study controlled for that factor. Further, the difference in weight we're discussing here is an average of 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces,) not a huge gap in weight. Birth weight of babies can vary by a few pounds, and has [increased over the last generation](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=9&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CH8QFjAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faje.oxfordjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F144%2F6%2F563.full.pdf&amp;amp;ei=uuEvUf3nO4e_0QGOhIHYCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFwbqJiQZNjmS-wF-2DxbQ2tmpHmA&amp;amp;sig2=ZyxhQ7EPyAoCNgQD93IqbQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.dmQ), possibly [due to changes in nutrition, and apparently also affected by the mother's weight](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2022126/Why-todays-babies-born-BIG.html).     
    
There is also nothing to show whether the cited study controlled for hereditary health concerns or environmental factors unrelated to pregnancy or the sex of one's babies.     

This leaves us with a study which may be flawed in its failure to take into account factors affecting its subjects, is made inapplicable to modern populations by medical advancement, changes in environment, and changes in family planning, and doesn't provide conclusive evidence of the assertion made in the story's headline.
   
In the end, the article did provide an example in answer to two questions.     
How badly is modern media biased against males?     
How far are they willing to bend in the exercise of that bias?     
Apparently the answer is at least to the point of publishing glaring misrepresentations and exaggerations of the results of narrowly (if at all) applicable studies, if such can be done in a way that casts a negative light on the human male."

19f3nm,1,2013-02-28,Bachelor's degree in CS? Or just learn the basics and seek out an internship?,Dante2k4,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/19f3nm/bachelors_degree_in_cs_or_just_learn_the_basics/,"I recently posted a topic here about dealing with uncertainty when first attempting to tackle this field. Everybody that posted was *very* helpful for a variety of different reasons, but one thing I noticed that was a pretty common suggestion was that I should find a job or internship or something with a company and learn from *that.*

Right now I'm learning the basics at a community college so that I can earn my transfer degree, then move on to a university and earn a bacherlors in computer science. Thing is, I feel like I'm wasting *so* much time meeting the requirements of all these other classes, which aren't teaching me *anything* relevant to what I need to know. I'm an excellent writer, I know as much math as I need, science isn't gonna help me with jack at this point, and my social science teachers have all been terrible. I *hate* taking these classes and wasting time and money on them, but I've been making myself do it so that I can transfer to my university as a junior and get my bacherlors done.

But then I'm not even sure if a bachelors is actually necessary! I know that having a degree just by itself will make me look better... but I've heard *so* many tales of people who no degree who make it in this field simply because they have the knowledge to do their jobs.

So, you all were *so* helpful to me before, I figured I'd come to you again and ask, how much do you value a degree in regards to web development? Or even in general tech support type work, which I may end up doing as well?

I am *so* fed up with taking classes that don't teach me anything of real value, and I'm really genuinely contemplating just blowing all those classes off, taking the relevant computer science classes (web design, PHP, javascripting, hardware &amp; repair, etc), and looking for an internship or entry-level job of some kind.

So what do you all say? Should I just continue to endure the shitty classes and accumulating student loans? Or should I learn the necessities and look for work as soon as possible to gain experience on the job?

Also, something I thought of during the last topic when everybody was telling me to look into internships... where should I be looking? I don't actually know where you'd find those kinds of positions &gt;_&gt;"

Thing is, I need to pay for rent/food/etc in that time, and was wondering if it would be at all feasible to try and resurrect my programming skills as a way to get some supplementary income. I'm a little rusty now, but (if I may say so) I was a pretty good programmer back when I was doing it a lot; my original track was a double major in CS/math, although I never pursued any kind of internships or professional experience. Do I have any hope of finding part-time or freelance work, or is there too much competition from people with more experience/expertise than me?

If it's relevant, I'm most experienced with scripting languages, but I'm also comfortable with C/Java/etc and have a decent working knowledge of languages like Lisp, Haskell, etc."

The interview went really well, we basically had a conversation rather than an interview and she even followed up with some emails about the company and how she will get another person to interview me to discuss more technical aspects.

Well now she called and basically said the internship is likely going to another current worker because they need to save money. I guess she tried to lessen the impact by saying that she found me to be the best suited applicant because the primary communication is through the phone and I could actually speak fluent english. 

She said she won't know for certain until next week because they need approval from another higher up who is in another country at the moment but said ""it will likely go through"".

I was kinda dumbfounded by all this and didn't say much other than just agreeing with her and thanking her for the opportunity. What I really should have done is tried to sell my skills to her more, I didn't even ask for a call back if it does go through because I was in shock.

I didn't want to get buried and not get the your talented money saving minds to pick apart my predicament. 

**Back story:**

We're a two car family in the mountain west (of the US).  Under both our names, my wife and I bought a (pretty used) 2007 Dodge Caliber about a year and a half ago. We were bad in not being careful in getting it inspected and overall it still has about $1200 (non- detrimental) work needing done to it and our payments are already $190 a month (not including whatever insurance is.) It's a regretful situation, but it works okay enough. 
We're not gonna be heart broken to get rid of it though.

The other car is a 1993 Suzuki Sidekick and it's kinda on it's last leg. I've had it since my college years, about 2003. It's missing the driver side mirror (wife busted it off backing out of the driveway, lol), pretty busted driver side inner door mechanism, overall outer aesthetics have fallen off over time, squeaks and squeals when driving, the steering wheel sounds like the TARDIS when it's cold out and the roof leaks when it rains or the snow melts. It's been paid off and the upkeep has been standard barring the aesthetics and minor mechanical problems but the obvious noise issues could become deeper problems in the future.

My wife works full time, less than a 10 minute walk from home. I work part, timeless than a 10 minute drive from home and will be telecommuting a design internship.  We have a young son that's still in a car seat, so we would need a reliable car (which prompted our being duped into the Caliber). 

We're trying to pare down our lifestyles to afford everything with what little we make and the idea going down to one care came up. Still, with me? OK.

**So, the questions are:**

* Should we even try to trade both in, knowing the Sidekick could bring almost nothing to the table and we're only a few grand down on our payments on the Caliber?
* If we do, how and where should we go about finding the best deal.
* We know we're dumb asses for not getting the Caliber inspected, so what other things should we look at if we trade?
* Regarding choices, what would be the ideal used car for a one car family that would meet the essentials of lowered payments, reliability and functionality? We are **NOT** particular about aesthetic but sheer utility.

We appreciate any insight that you all can gives us. This can be another wonderful discussion about many other options of lifestyle changes as well. THANKS!"

19engu,50,2013-02-28,Tips from an old Techie,geotech,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/19engu/tips_from_an_old_techie/,"Going to the career fair? Please do yourself a favor and review the companies that will be attending, the ones you're interested in, and then do some research on that company. Never go up to a company and say, ""so, what do y'all do?"" 

In Capstone and you're about to call a company for questions? Do some research first. Get on the company's webpage and dig around their technical site. Folks like to speak to ""intelligent"" students. 

Have an interview for a full-time, internship, or co-op position? Be early! Do not try to take Atlanta traffic into account if you think you're going to make it ""just in time"". Always have the mindset of being late when driving in Atlanta, especially if you have to drive through Atlanta. Also, if you're going to be more than 30 minutes late, call and cancel the interview (you should call regardless, but an hour is too excessive). Give your excuse and request an interview for a later date. Folks aren't sitting around at work just waiting to interview you, they're more than likely squeezing you into their schedule.

These are just a few things I've noticed in the last week from students that I believe you can benefit from."
19en7c,6,2013-02-28,"Another depressed, unemployed artist...",foshohammer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19en7c/another_depressed_unemployed_artist/,"I actually posted this yeterday, but after having it up an hour I became more and more embarassed with myself for posting and coming off as such a whiner, but today I am more desperate for advice than I am afraid of hurting my pride, so here goes !




I’m really, infinitely sorry for posting this, but I’ve been reading other people’s problems and frustrations and everyone seems to feel better, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, wanted to make video games more than anything else in the world. I knew it would be hard to get a job, and I didn’t even really believe in myself skill-wise, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, all while drawing like crazy on the side. Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!” I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job as well as school full time, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc.
 Stop drawing altogether. 

2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. Risky, but I moved to be closer to more relevant jobs!
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. Extreme depression. Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 
Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. I start creating more. Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. Fighting off feeling really down about this acceptance. 

Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy more. 
Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete! 
-illustrating a children’s book 
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints. Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for. Doing something creative, ANYTHING would make me feel less depressed and useless. Find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work. 
There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program) I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 


Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job. If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.

19edaj,71,2013-02-28,UPDATE: My Mother-in-law is driving me insane and I feel like she is taking advantage of us for money. Please help,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19edaj/update_my_motherinlaw_is_driving_me_insane_and_i/,"[Link to original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/199q4i/my_motherinlaw_is_driving_me_insane_and_i_feel/)


I spoke with my husband about how I felt about the whole situation, and he went over to his parents to discuss the situation. When he came home, he walked in the door and refused to speak to me. He stomped around the apartment cleaning up and would not acknowledge me at all. I finally asked him if he would like to talk, and he said ""about what?"" When I finally got him to talk, he explained to me that he forgot to tell me that his mom had told him before we even got married that she planned to claim him on her taxes for 2012. I was angry that he had this conversation and made a financial decision of that nature with his mother instead of me, and he said ""we weren't even married yet anyway!"" I then asked him why he is okay with his mom taking his education credit, because it is for his education which he pays for in full and the fact that we owe the government over $40,000 for our education. He explained that when he went to his parents, they sobbed and said they are in a bad place financially, so he decided to give them his education credit money as a gift to ""help them out."" I, admittedly, lost my cool and freaked the f out. I can't believe that he sat down and talked to me and felt uncomfortable with the situation, but then he went over there, listened to his parents cry for two hours, and suddenly he wants to help them out. 

I am the most upset that he made a large financial decision with his parents and omitted me from discussion entirely. When I explained to him why I felt uncomfortable with the way that his mother approached the situation, he screamed at me that I am insane and told me I had fifteen minutes before he was leaving. While I tried to talk him down, he repeatedly looked at his watch and then started putting on his coat and boots. I sobbed.. I couldn't believe he would leave me over something so small and so silly.. I can't believe I can't question his parents without him calling me insane. When I was talking, he shoved his finger in my mouth to prevent me from talking and lunged at me to get me out of the way of the door. I slapped his hand out of my mouth when he did this. I can't believe it escalated to this point.. I never expected it to become such a huge issue.

I am terrified at the fact that this is such a small issue.. In the big scheme of things, this is likely the smallest issue that we will encounter in our marriage. He divulged to me that he is a person that will ""do everything in his power to avoid conflict"" and feels that I do not pay enough attention to him and he is lonely (I work 60 hours a week, 16 hours a week are an unpaid internship, and I am also taking 3 college courses. I commute an hour one way four days a week - so he probably does feel lonely, I am friggin busy). 

I should have kept my cool and not gotten so upset. I should have prepared what I was going to say before he got home, because I knew that he would change his mind after talking to his parents. I knew he would side with them, because he always does. He purchased a vehicle without speaking to me once about it, he went over to his parents, stayed there for two days, and then surprise! He had a new car. He didn't even go to purchase the vehicle, his parents did it for him while he was working. There are many situations when he has made important financial decisions with his parents instead of me. I am offended that they feel that it is okay to make these kinds of decisions with their married son without considering his wife, and I am pissed that he thinks its okay to cut me out. He told me that I am ""too immature"" to make decisions with him, so ""until I grow up, he is going to keep making decisions with his parents.""

The whole ordeal ended with him calming down, telling me that he is trying to create boundaries, and that ""the taxes this year will be the last thing, I promise."" When I asked him how I was supposed to trust that he was going to make large financial decisions with me instead of his parents, he said ""yeah, I am totally going to go out and buy a boat and a vacation home. What other financial decisions will I be making in the near future anyway?"" 

I am shocked that he thinks it is okay to talk down to me. I am shocked that he thinks it is okay to decide financial stuff without me. I fear that, regardless of the situation, he will side with his parents. I refuse to ask him to choose between us because that is unfair. I don't want him to lose his family, I never had, but he insists that I am trying to force him to cut off his family. I don't want that. I know that if I did make him choose, he would not pick me. I don't know if I can live with that. "
