1woz49,2,2014-01-31,I feel horrible and I need someone to talk to.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1woz49/i_feel_horrible_and_i_need_someone_to_talk_to/,"Hello /r/depression. I've always thought about making a post here but it never seems to happen. I'm a long-time lurker. I'd like someone to talk to, but knowing me, it probably won't happen since I have a tendency to isolate myself from others. This might also turn out to be terribly long, so I doubt that anybody will really read it. I'm 23 years old and I just graduated from college.

My living situation is good. I am a telecommuter, and I work from home providing customer service over the phone. They pay isn't great, and the angry customers tend to be verbally abusive. I've only been doing this for a few weeks, as I do need a way to pay the bills while I look for a job that's ""in my field"". 

I have always been an imaginative person. My dad has always yelled at me for day dreaming when I should be paying attention. When I graduated from high school, I was a lot happier and more hopeful than I am now. I was going to college to be a nurse, and I would just sit in my human biology class looking at this beautiful poster of all these different sharks. I loved it. I always loved nature and animals. I began to think it would be wonderful to go to school to do something that I loved. I received all kinds of discouragement about how hard it is to be a scientist. I was told that the pay was terrible, that the job security isn't great, and that there aren't many openings. Academic advisors were mostly unhelpful and dismissive. In all of my naive glory, I took the leap and followed the advice of Confucius: do what you love and you'll never work a day of your life.

I took an internship at the Department of Environmental Protection in my senior year and it was the most miserable ""job"" of my life. I spent 4-8 hours a week there doing monotonous, repetitive data entry into spreadsheets. They never gave me a chance to do anything enriching. It was miserable, and for the most part, the people who worked there seemed as miserable as me. They were constantly laying nice people off because they were underfunded. I left after spending a year there.

Despite the bad experience, I worked my ass off on my degree. All the while, I began to grow weary of the entire thing. My senior research project was the best in my class, and I graduated in the top percentile of my peers with cum laude.

Despite my accomplishments, I feel utterly devoid of any sense of achievement of motivation. I have not been able to find a job in my state, and I am absolutely crushed. I have severe medical depression, but I'm a very tenacious person so I have always fought it tooth and nail. I have never succumbed to it in any way, but I am starting to lose steam here. I'm so discouraged. I kept telling myself all of this time that everyone was wrong, and that I would prevail and do something with my dreams.

Meanwhile, a lot of other things have gone to shit. Almost all of my friends are in horrible situations. They're all either addicted to drugs, horribly depressed, in abusive relationships, or something else that's just bleak as fuck. My parents are terribly unhelpful. My mother walked out on me when I was 14, and although we have kept in touch, the last time I tried to tell her what I was going through she found it appropriate to tell me about how ""God is the answer"" for forty minutes. She just talked at me about how I should stop being an atheist for forty minutes while I said nothing. My father is a recovered alcoholic and drug addict who has nothing to offer me as far as emotional support is concerned. His approach is ""tough love"", and I just can't take feeling like any more of a loser right now than I already do. My boy friend is a guy who is easily satisfied as long as he isn't starving and homeless, so depression is completely out of his ballpark and he never has anything to say to me. I feel like I can't even talk to my best friend. She is as depressed as I am and in the same position, but every time I try to bring it up with her, I feel like I'm making her feel worse and then I can add guilt to the laundry list of my problems.

I feel so fucking alone, and I hate trying to make new friends. I almost always find other people to be disappointing and hard to relate to. Everyone who gets close to me loses interest or finds me disagreeable.

The thing that hurts me the most right now is that poster of the sharks. Someone I loved bought it for me a couple of years before I received my degree. He's now addicted to drugs, without a job, suicidal, without a degree, and living at his parents' house. He calls me all of the time because I'm his only friend, but hearing from him makes me sad. The poster is hanging behind where I sit when I work. I used to turn around and see it when I was finished studying, and it filled me with hope and reminded me of why I was working so hard. Now I turn around and see it when I'm done working, and all it does is remind me of what a failure I am and how everyone I love is suffering horribly. I want to take it down, but I think it would hurt me more to look at an empty space where the image that ignited my dream once rested.

The world is so ugly. I didn't think this was how my life would turn out to be."
1wozhw,467,2014-01-31,The fires beneath Centralia Pennsylvania,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1wozhw/the_fires_beneath_centralia_pennsylvania/,"Centralia Pennsylvania. Current population: 10. One of the most prominent ghost towns in America. The reason? A massive coal fire burning below the surface. In 1962 a landfill was set ablaze to celebrate Memorial Day, and the fire was never properly extinguished. The landfill was directly on top of an old coal mine that was supposedly filled and properly capped. When the ashes from the fire weren’t quite extinguished they smoldered underground for an unknown period of time before being exposed to the open air and setting coal dust ablaze. This dust led directly back to the mines creating a massive labyrinth beneath the town.

I was tasked by a geological research team to map out the remaining mines untouched by fire to give a better approximation to the extent of the fire. In summer 2013 I began my expedition to the town that no longer even has a zip code as of 2002. I don’t think a garbage fire is to blame for the underground inferno…or the evacuation of the town above.
 
I arrived on the outskirts of Centralia at the end of a highway that literally continued straight into a dirt mount. The road simply ended. Due to the risk of collapsing shafts, and the inherit risks that the fire I brought one of our interns with me. I’ll refer to him as “Tim,” Tim was a PhD candidate (has since earned it) at Penn State and had been doing research about the effects of mine fires on the surrounding crust of the Earth. He’d placed small, very accurate seismographs around the area of Centralia and studied the results over several years. Tim thought very far in advance; halfway through his bachelor’s degree he began placing the seismographs so that he’d have solid data for his PhD thesis.
 
Tim noticed that the fires would bake and crack the earth above occasionally, but nothing unusual occurred until early 2013 when one of his seismographs began recording data that was akin to something digging the earth directly underneath. It was almost as if someone was using a boring machine directly beneath the seismograph, heading straight up. The Earth’s crust can change, distort, and tear in odd manners, but this was something that I’d never seen before. After less than two days the readings had gone off the scale and we’d begun to assume something was wrong with the seismograph, our fears were nearly confirmed when the machine suddenly stopped broadcasting. We went out to inspect…and it was gone, a perfectly circular five foot diameter hole in its place. 

Shortly thereafter the government contacted us. They tasked us to map the remaining mines using a GPS tracker that had a built in safety feature; if we began to suffer ill effects from carbon monoxide (from the coal fire) the tracker would emit a high frequency ping to any other trackers nearby, and an obnoxious screech to anyone within earshot.
 
Once we left the truck behind and continued towards the mine on foot, things took a turn for the weird. I saw one of the residents of the town, but he didn’t seem all there. He looked out from the porch window of his dilapidated house and basically stared straight through us. His look was akin to the “1,000 yard stare” of combat veterans. We waved at him, as we were walking within fifty yards of his house and he yelled something at us, but we couldn’t hear him. I raised my hand to my ear in the universal “we couldn’t hear you” gesture and he yelled louder, “you won’t want to go in there…the mines ain’t kind to visitors!”
 
The man looked to be a few steps past crazy, so we took his brief rant with a grain of salt and continued to our destination, which was only about a quarter mile past the man’s house.
 
The woods had an unnatural feel to them; the trees seemed stunted in many places, and there were numerous vents created by the subterranean fires, of course. These openings in the Earth’s crust were usually pretty easy to spot; they were puffing out smoke in some places, and generally they were devoid of vegetation. This, however, was not always the case. Some of these chasms were hundreds of feet deep and had stopped smoking…an open maw on the surface of the Earth with no warning whatsoever. Tim nearly walked straight into one that was overgrown with a fallen tree bridging the two sides.
 
The smoke that emanated from the ground cast eerie shadows everywhere you looked. It was almost as if something was hiding within the smoke, but I dismissed that as me simply being paranoid. This town had been nearly abandoned since the 1980’s, and the only people that remained were, from what I could see, mostly crazy.
 
Finally I saw something move that I knew wasn’t smoke. I knew it wasn’t my imagination because I saw it move a small fern-like bush as it hid. Something was in the woods with us. As I moved towards the rustled bush I felt myself begin to fall. I had walked over a small drop-off that was directly above one of the fiery chasms that wasn’t actively smoking. I lucked out and managed to grab the edge as I fell in. Tim was able to pull me out before either of us succumbed to the carbon monoxide gasses emanating from the pit. Our walk towards the mine continued in silence.
 
The mine entrance was overgrown with thick vegetation and gated off by a rusted fence. Thankfully the lock had long since rusted and fell off as we’d never have been able to open it with our key as rusted as the thing was. Inside was an absolute labyrinth of partially collapsed tunnels that gradually sloped downward. My map, circa 1930, showed that the mine had a spiral series of shafts that went several hundred feet deep before the main shaft hit a water pocket, dooming all of the miners in the near vicinity.
 
We entered the first shaft (main number one) and immediately the temperature began to increase. I knew we’d need our portable respirators before long; I just hadn’t expected to need them yet. The ambient temperature outside was nearly 80° F, and inside a mine it would normally be closer to 50° F…it was well over 90° F and rising. This was a good indicator of how close the fire really was; by my calculations, the ambient temperature in the mine would be close to 120° F near the waterline.
 
The depth of the water was such that it would have washed out or flooded the bottom quarter of the mine, but there should be enough room for us to gain access to the portions of this mine where the fire would hit first. It wasn’t an “if this mine caught fire,” it was more of a “when.” The mines around and under Centralia were just too close together, and the coal seam was too large for any nearby mines to be spared. It would likely burn for another two and a half centuries.
 
After donning our respirators we headed deeper into the main number one shaft. The shaft would periodically open into larger chambers where pillars of coal had been mined around and supported with large timbers. Occasionally one or more of these would be collapsed, leading me to question the structural integrity of the ceiling supporting millions of tons of coal and rock above our head…but we trudged on.
 
In the second such open chamber I saw a plume of smoke emitting from the wall. My eyes darted away from it, and as soon as they did I could see movement that didn’t match the smoke. Something black as the surrounding coal was standing directly beside the wall, so close to the opening that if it were human it would have almost instantly succumbed to carbon monoxide poising and passed out. Whatever this was just stood by the opening and watched us walk by. I didn’t dare look at it directly for fear that I’d illuminate it with my headlamp. I couldn’t take that risk. We came within about twenty feet of it, and I guess Tim just couldn’t see it.
 
Just as we passed by the thing I saw it slide between two pillars and disappear into the wall. Before it left I saw it grab the pillar and I noticed three massive claws on its “hand.” I knew we’d have to return to that room…I just wasn’t looking forward to it. We exited the cavern without incident, but afterwards I couldn’t shake the feeling that there were things scaling the walls just out of sight.

Finally, after another half an hour we could hear running water. Apparently the underground water that the 1930’s mine had hit was some sort of creek or stream. We were probably about 200 yards from the water when Tim stopped dead in his tracks and pointed straight ahead. I didn’t get a good look at whatever he saw, but I saw a shadow, and I knew that Tim could finally see what I saw. He was deathly pale, and just managed to slightly turn his head sideways to look at me before something climbed to the ceiling directly behind him. He heard it and darted the way we’d came.

I had no plans on lingering in the mine, but my own terrified curiosity got the better of me; the water shouldn’t be running. The records indicated that the 1930’s crew hit a pond, an underground pool of, essentially, stagnant water. Somehow the water either interconnected with another waterway in the passing eighty years, or the records were wrong. Terrified as I was, I knew I was mere feet from finding out.

I turned the last bend, maybe twenty feet and ten seconds from where Tim had turned tail and ran…only to see a rather large flow of water moving perpendicular to the cavern. The shaft continued on the other side of roughly fifty feet of water. The water was near the boiling point as I could feel the immense heat resonating from its surface. 

On the other side stood a black creature. When I shined my light on it fire seemed to resonate from its eyes. I was running the other direction instantly. I heard its feet hit the ground on my side of the bank and I broke into a full sprint. I could hear its footsteps, and although I was panting through the respirator in the extreme heat I couldn’t hear it breathing at all. I ran up the incline towards the exit, but the creature seemed to have more stamina than I and I began to falter. A dark shape emerged from directly beneath one of my feet and seemed to grab my boot as I stumbled towards the room where I’d originally seen the beast.

As I passed through the first room where I saw the creature I heard a loud screech and my GPS lit up a pinged beacon…from inside the wall…I continued to run. I felt fire on the back of my neck, and I could see daylight from ahead, only, I didn’t think I could make it. The fire grew worse and worse even though I knew the temperature should be decreasing, and right as I exited the mine I felt the flames overcome me and I fell into darkness.

Tim revived me some minutes later and indicated that we were both suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning and that we needed fresh air in a bad way. After a few minutes and many scared glances at the mine we decided to leave. I asked Tim where his GPS unit fell and he responded that it was still in his pack. Confused I asked him to show me. Sure enough Tim’s GPS unit was in its rightful place. I pondered why mine had malfunctioned and as I looked at it I could clearly see a dim ping moving around beneath the surface. I decided to take one last look down the main shaft of the mine before we left. Tim stayed outside.

Once back in I could see about 200 yards straight into the main shaft. I peered off the side of the drop off and not twenty feet below lay a charred GPS unit exactly like ours with three charred scrapes on it. As soon as I saw it a black clawed hand raked the unit back out of view and I was immediately running towards the surface lest the owner of the hand know how to fly.

We contacted the government with the results of our first excursion and informed them of the unusual pings. They mentioned nothing. Upon a little further digging by Tim…apparently we were the second team to map the area; the first being four months prior…they did not return."
1wp0gh,3,2014-01-31,Lost after college and stuck in a career path,Messisfoot,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1wp0gh/lost_after_college_and_stuck_in_a_career_path/,"I recently graduated college. Luckily I landed a career, but unfortunately, it's not the path I wanted. I am in no way passionate about this line of work - IT Project Management - and I am only good at it because it pays the college bills. I tried to break into the finance world (wanted to work in wall street) since I studied economics and actually had a passion for it. But my resume got no replies, every career coach told me I needed experience. 

I look around for internships, but all of them require me to be in college. 

Am I stuck in this career path? How am I supposed to find what I'm passionate about if I need experience in anything before I delve into it?"
1wp1lk,15,2014-01-31,"I've been to numerous interviews, and every time they hired the guy with more experience. I've had two internships and a master's degree in engineering, but can't seem to get a foot in the door. What am I doing wrong?",one14four,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1wp1lk/ive_been_to_numerous_interviews_and_every_time/,"Some background:

I have a bachelor's in physics and an MS in aerospace engineering, both with a GPA around 3.3.  During my years of school I had a research internship with the physics department chair, as well as a manufacturing engineering internship with a local company (both summer internships).

Since then, I've had eight (i think) interviews in the engineering field as well as five or six outside of engineering.  Each of the engineering ones were for entry-level jobs, but in each case they went to candidates with years of experience more than I have.  I've even had interviews at two companies at which I know someone in upper management, and still no luck.  Even trying to find jobs outside of engineering (customer service, sales, etc.) I've been told straight off the top that I'm overqualified, and I scare companies away.  

I'm really in a bind, my girlfriend (who tried to get me a job at her company but was told i was overqualified) is getting fed up with me not having a full time job and has told me she can't be around much longer if I don't get a job.  On top of that, my student loan payments have become crushing, and I've had to move back in with my parents (another reason for the gf to leave).

I've tried going through temp agencies, but they don't know what to do with me between my lack of experience paired with my ""scary"" degrees.

I know its a tough time and people have been a lot worse off than I am.  But its been a year of working at a pizzeria for minimum wage, and I'm close to the breaking point.  What can I do?

Tl;dr - Finding a job sucks and evidently I'm not good at it."

I do not want to be a police officer.  I don't have the personality type to do that kind of work every day.  However, it is my hope to work as a criminologist or criminal profiler.  I know these positions require Grad Degrees (sometimes Doctorates), which I am absolutely going to enter into.  I'm a serious student (3.98 GPA, graduating top of my class, have done a few great internships while working FT) and possess a desire to keep acquiring criminological knowledge as it becomes available.  My question is do I have any chance of getting into a Forensic Psych program (such as NYU or John Jay) even though I'm a CJ Major?  I've taken a myriad of psychology and forensic courses as they pertain to law, i.e., victimology, psychology and crime, criminal profiling, forensic accounting, forensic geology, intro to forensics.  Are these classes enough (along with basic psych and soc glasses) for me to get into a forensic psychology program?  Any help/career advice would be sincerely appreciated.  Thanks guys."
1wpcv2,7,2014-01-31,First timer; my story and a couple questions,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1wpcv2/first_timer_my_story_and_a_couple_questions/,"Hey guys. Before I ask my questions, I'm going to explain a little bit about myself first. Feel free to skip to the bottom for the questions.

First off, I am 17. I know this sub is 18+, but I think I can address this topic maturely. If the mods feel the need to ban me, so be it, I won't hold anything against them (although this is a throwaway). If it's any consolation, i'll be 18 in two months anyways.

I first came into contact with trees face to face this summer. Some friends asked me if I wanted to smoke with them, but I had to turn them down as I was starting an internship that was likely to ask for a drug test. If it weren't for the internship, I don't really know what I would have done. Up until then I'd never really researched anything about weed, I just knew what I had been told from others.

At about the same time that I first saw cannabis face to face, I began actively using reddit. Eventually, I stumbled upon this sub. I decided to subscribe and quietly observe these ""stoners"" from a safe distance.

After following /r/trees for a few months, and seeing the posts on here, I realized pretty much all my preconceptions about marijuana and its users were wrong. I'm not kidding when I say just being around you guys really showed me how uneducated I was. 

One day, while riding in the car with my dad, I had a debate with him on the legality of marijuana. Coming from conservative roots in the deep south, I wasn't entirely surprised to hear that he opposed it. We both made our opposing cases fairly well, but neither of us were able to fully convince the other to change their views. Neither of us could cite any real scientific evidence on the effects of weed. So I decided to educate myself.

About two months ago I started researching the effects of smoking cannabis. After listening to countless debates, browsing many forums, reading endless studies, and even watching movies (The Union: The Business Behind Getting High), I formed a new opinion of this misunderstood drug. After lots of research, I've come to the conclusion that while smoking marijuana is not necessarily harmless, its negative effects are negligible compared to the potential benefits it has for many people (myself included).

I even went as far as to voluntarily type a 1000+ word essay on my case for legalization. I originally planned to present my paper to my parents, but decided against it. I'll save it for any extreme cases in which I may need it.

Which leads me to where I am now. Tomorrow, my friend and I are planning on smoking some weed. She has smoked once, but I've never even touched weed before. I really cant afford to be caught, as it would ruin my parents' image of me. Up until now I've pretty much been the ""role model"" kid. Most of all, I don't want to hurt them.

TL;DR I'm about to start smoking. Mind answering a few questions?

1), We are most likely going to smoke from a joint. We are also going to be outside. Will there be a noticeable smell on me/my clothes? If so, is it possible to cover up?

2), We'll be smoking mid-high grade weed. I've also never smoked before. Approximately how long do you think I'll be high for?

Thanks so much for reading! Feel free to give me any advice that you may have!"

I am looking for advice, or an opportunity if it turns out that way. I'll keep it brief so I don't bore you.

I've only learned LinkedLists, dynamic arrays and I did a few projects with binary search trees last semesters, but I honestly don't know about any ohter data structures. I'm definitely surprised that they invited me to an interview since my resume wasn't very impressive, and everytime I see people posting lists on here of what things we should know, it's usually a pretty extensive list. So Since I only have about 4 days to prepare, are there specific things that I should focus on? I feel like if I try to learn everything at once I might end up not really knowing anything very well for the interview. Any advice?

1wphii,2,2014-02-01,Not Sure What to do With it Anymore,[deleted],malehairadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/1wphii/not_sure_what_to_do_with_it_anymore/,"I keep debating how I actually want my hair styled.

and wore it for a little while. Then I grew it out again because I wasn't completely satisfied with it. Then I wore it long for a while again. Then I just kept going back and forth getting it cut short and then letting it grow out again and repeating. 

So now I'm not sure how long/short I want it. I'm 22 in my last year and a half of college and think I should start looking a bit more professional and mature since job and internship interviews are coming up soon. I think I might like it short if I got the right style but I'm not sure what that is for my face/body shape and I keep being a little unhappy with it when I cut it shorter.

I've read the official documentation and and a few stack overflow pages about making a package and it seems like having an __ init __.py is the only important part - but I would imagine there things that I'm not aware of, like for instance should I try to have one class per file or does it matter at all?

So we were talking about programming languages and he tells me that C or C++ is pretty much mandatory in his field. And I said to him ""great because I can just go into the gaming industry and work for Blizzard or something"" and he smiled at me and said ""once you graduate and actually learn how to program, you wont want to"". I said to him ""What do you mean i wont want to, I love games"" and he said ""yea but there's other opportunities.(pauses and stares at me for 4 seconds then says:) you know what, just focus on right now and learn what you can before school starts so you can get a head start.

So school starts in March. And I want another opinion on this. What could possibly be better than making games and why wont I want to? Any input would be great. Thanks. Udemy here i come!!! (unless someone has other suggestions)"

1wpv0v,185,2014-02-01,The Interns.,Intelligoth,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1wpv0v/the_interns/,"Back In 1995 when I worked for the big French telecom, they had an arrangement with a local technical college where, a couple of times a year, we would get a student of theirs on practicum for six weeks.  These students would experience what it was like to work in a real-live development and networking environment.
  
At this stage in my career, I was a PFY with ""Jr"" in my title.  Yet, some assclown higher up decided to dump these practicum students on my lap, and they were supposed to help out in all things IT.  Note, this INCREASED my workload and was not the free resource that the HR twat was hoping for.
  
Intern 1:  A really twitchy, skinny older guy who took advantage of some government program for retraining.  He'd had some medical issue where he couldn't work his former labourer job and figured ""computers are the wave of the future"", so decided to get into IT.  Nice enough guy, wrote EVERYTHING down, but was a raging alcoholic.  He never came to work drunk, but he was suffering from severe delerium tremors every morning.  I ended up just delegating him to reinstalls of OS/2 Warp on the production testbeds.  I couldn't have him fixing hardware because his hands shook so badly.  
  
Intern 2:  A very soft spoken Iranian lady who followed me around like a puppy and took direction very well, as long as I supervised her work.  After about week 3, I had her perform a RAM upgrade on the Reception PC and figured she could handle it herself since she'd watched me do it numerous times before.  I give her the RAM and a screwdriver, then continue with my work.  2 hours later and I haven't heard from her.  I walk over to Reception and the computer is on, with the case opened and she's just staring at the guts.  The receptionist is working away on Email and WordPerfect, and the intern is just kneeling beside the computer. *CRYING* very softly.  She had no idea where to put the RAM and was too embarrassed to come and ask for help.  Turns out she was on heavy antidepressants and was suffering from a major post-partum issue.  We had to terminate her internship because she needed serious professional help.
  
Intern 3:  Donna (not her real name).  Oh my god, I LOVED Donna.  Smart, attentive, had a binder where she kept hardcopies of all my procedures, was never afraid to ask for help, sported a Gerber multi tool on her belt, and actually READ manuals, brought Timmys in every Friday...  She picked up on things almost immediately, had an intuitive knack for problem solving and a disdain for the users seldom seen in an Intern.  We got along like a house on fire.  She ended up becoming a Sysadmin for a company who made control systems for those big research telescopes you see at Keck and Hale.  I'm proud as hell that I was her mentor.  We share stupid user stories to this very day.
  
Still, 1 gem out of 3 wasn't that great and I had to recommend we terminate the Intern program because I wasn't involved in the interview process, and as a PFY, it wasn't my job to babysit students and I didn't have any sort of supervisory authority over them.
  
But seriously, who thought it was a good idea to have a Jr. PFY with only 2 years on the job train up Interns?"

Without revealing much, I attend a high-powered school in the city and have many accolades on my resume.

I've received admissions to two schools of my choice known for their strengths in the sciences and engineering, what luck!

Now that I am a second-term senior, I'd like to start getting some work experience under my belt.

I have applied for computer science for the two schools, but I am interested in other fields too. I don't know exactly what I want to study, but I'd sure like it to be a field where I'd be able to make a DIY Segway or a raspberry pi powered safe! (I have so many ideas but never the resources, heh)

So that being said, I'd like to know about potential places where I can intern.

Thanks folks!"

Learning ArcGIS 3D Analyst,  Learning ArcGIS Spatial Analyst , Learning ArcGIS Desktop (for ArcGIS 9.2-9.3), Working with Rasters in ArcGIS Desktop.


I suppose the next logical step is to learn python and SQL as I have little experience with either.

 * Company A: A well known software giant. Massive Employer. Pays interns moderately well. Expensive cost of living.
 * Company B: A large aviation related company. Pays interns quite well with other valuable benefits: furnished apartment, travel, etc. Lower cost of living. Not a well known name.

I like both companies and I feel that I will have great opportunities at both. However, there are slight **compounding factors**: 

 * Company A's location is expensive. They don't provide housing, and I have a family who won't be there with me, so I will be paying for two residences. We can make it work, but the monetary difference will be very noticeable. Also, I have already accepted their offer.

 * Company B: I have an aviation background and there would be a lot of opportunity to apply my somewhat rare skill-set.

**TL;DR** -- The heart of my question is this: Should I choose Company B because it pays much better and leverages prior experience? Or, should I choose Company A because they have a very well known name? 

It's worth noting that apart from the difference in name, I think both will look good on my resume because both will provide me with the opportunity to make valuable contributions.

Note: I did read [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ao75t/name_recognition_or_prestige_of_employer_with/), but felt that my situation is different enough to justify asking a similar question."

I feel very alone.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1wqqla/i_feel_out_of_place_among_people_younger_older/,"I have a boyfriend, younger siblings, and work with people that are 15 to 20 years older than me. I'm going to feel like a huge douche writing this, but I'll do it anyway.

The lives of people younger than me or even my own age seem trivial. Their problems are non-problems to me and while I try not to be judgmental and be helpful, I often find myself internally rolling my eyes. Okay, you don't know what you want to do in life? Get an internship doing anything and figure it out. You can't find a job? Okay, stop being picky and take whatever comes first. You can get a better job later. Your boyfriend is being a dick? Okay, do something about it or shut the fuck up.

Nevertheless, I am the first person to volunteer for helping you find your dream job, or applying for 50 jobs, or listening to you when you want to complain about your relationship problems. I do these things because they are me. It is how I am. I see a problem and I want to solve it. Not necessarily because I want to be kind or helpful (at least not some of the time), but because I want to fix whatever is broken.

As for people older than me, especially at my job, all they want to do is drink and go out. That is not me. I am a homebody. I don't drink because I have not found any beer, wine, or liquor that doesn't burn like a thousand suns as I'm drinking it and bar/club scenes creep me out. I don't want to make small talk with people I don't care to see again.

I could be super focused on what you're saying and then I'll get bored or want to talk about something else and it never goes past that. I guess you could call it a passing interest. 

I have been very good at masking how much I really don't care with people in general. However, with family members and my boyfriend, I sometimes can't hide it. In those times, I do come off as bitchy and insensitive and as soon as I notice, I try to right my wrong.

Maybe something's wrong with me but I just don't click with many people on anything deeper than a superficial level. I feel like I'm just going through life pretending I give a shit when really, I don't.


Has anyone else experienced something similar?

1wqr9j,9,2014-02-01,How do I deal with my irrational dad?,mypup321,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1wqr9j/how_do_i_deal_with_my_irrational_dad/,"I am hoping this is the right sub-reddit to deal with dad issues.

I am a 21 year old female currently enrolled in university. Back story, my parents got divorced right before the sub-prime mortgage crisis. My family was well off at the time and dad had to pay my mom significant alimony. The crisis happened and we went broke. My dad quit paying my mom alimony and she had to get a job. My dad keeps trying to keep our previous life style even though he's essentially broke now. He's been trying to get back up on his feet changing from real estate to finance jobs back and fourth, but he's struggling.

How does this relate to my dad being irrational? Well, I am currently a student at university. My dad use to give me some money my freshman year of college, but he's essentially stopped. I get a tuition waiver because we are now low income and some years when he makes more money, I take out loans to pay for my education. I basically take out loans entirely to pay for my cost of living. Last year when I barely got any financial aid, he took out a parent plus loan for $7,000 to help me pay for school. I never saw a dime of the money and he claimed ""well it's for all the money I gave you before. it's making up for it"". 

Most recently I realized that I am already 15,000 in debt and I can't keep taking out loans. Last summer, I buckled down and landed myself an internship that I grossed 10k. I received scholarships as well and ended up studying abroad in Europe. I financed my entire trip traveling in Europe myself with no debt. My mom gave me $700 towards the end of the trip because she wanted me to have the experience I always dreamed of. Mind you, this was my first time leaving the country and traveling alone. My parents have never traveled outside the US.

I got back to the United States basically broke. I had a scholarship check come in for $1800, but this won't last me very long. Rent in my city is very expensive. I should be graduating in the Spring, but I realized I will have to take out loans if I don't get a job. I can't handle my courses and a job. Not to mention, I am unemployed after graduation.

I decided my best bet was to take an extra semester, take less classes, and get a job right now. I can get another internship this summer to help pay for my school in the Fall. I can recruit next Fall when I have less classes for a full time job and be entirely independent of my dad. I hopefully can get a tuition-waiver again.

My frustration comes in because my dad is still claiming me as a dependent. He pays for only my health insurance and cell-phone bill and files my tuition breaks on his tax returns. I called him about discussing my taxes and he started to yell at me. He told me I needed to file my 10k income under his tax returns. I told him no, I was independent and you didn't pay for anything for me. He said well, until your out of school, you're my dependent. 

I know this year I will get a huge refund for my 10k income because my employer with-held a lot of money. This could easily go towards paying for my schooling next Fall. 

My frustration is that he's been getting tax breaks on me and he yells at me when I try to discuss otherwise. He basically does nothing for me. He pays my cellphone bill and medical insurance and that's it.

I don't know how to discuss this with them because I still need his taxes for next year to get my financial aid. I know if he got auditted he'd be screwed if I didn't consult him and just filed independently.

What should I do? He won't listen to me when I am clearly an adult basically doing everything myself.

**Dad is broke, but still claims me as a dependent. He only pays for my health-insurance and cell-phone bill. I made a hefty amount last summer that I want the tax refund for, but he keeps telling me I have to file under him. Even if I file it myself, I will still get less of a refund because he's claiming be as a dependent. He's also taking my tutition breaks, but filing my financial aid on his tax returns.What should I do?**"

[What damage was done, exactly, to the West's security, diplomacy and economic interests? I can imagine that relationships were affected, on a political basis, but how much damage did this really do? Also, were there in your opnion any positives about the 'whistleblowing'? Any good effects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4ieq9?context=5)|I tried to answer this question above. Snowden’s published revelations include material that has nothing to do with his purported worries about personal privacy. They reveal how countries like Norway and Sweden spy on Russia. Why is it in the public interest to reveal how democracies spy on dictatorships? The Snowdenistas’ outrage is based on the fact that this spying takes place in cooperation with the NSA, the Great Satan of the intelligence world.
 |Other disclosures are similarly hard to justify. Why is it in the public interest to reveal how the NSA intercepts e-mails, phone calls, and radio transmissions of Taliban fighters in Pakistan, or to show that the agency is intensifying scrutiny on the security of that country’s nuclear weapons? Snowden even revealed details of how the NSA hacks into computers and mobile phones in China and Hong Kong.
[Hi Mr Lucas. As you may know, Edward Snowden is seen by much of reddit as a hero. What's your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4i288?context=5)|I disagree. I think he did not expose systematic wrongdoing by the NSA. He showed that it makes mistakes, which is not the same thing. The ""Snowdenistas"" do not seem to realise the damage he has done. They are too paranoid about their own Western governments, and too trusting about Russia, the country where Snowden arrived so strangely and lives so secretly 
[Can you elaborate on the damage he has done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4i5bp?context=5)|The details are in my book. But Snowden’s published revelations include material that has nothing to do with his purported worries about personal privacy. They reveal how countries like Norway and Sweden spy on Russia. Why is it in the public interest to reveal how democracies spy on dictatorships? Why is it in the public interest to reveal how the NSA intercepts e-mails, phone calls, and radio transmissions of Taliban fighters in Pakistan, or to show that the agency is intensifying scrutiny on the security of that country’s nuclear weapons? Snowden even revealed details of how the NSA hacks into computers and mobile phones in China and Hong Kong.
[I don't think anyone thought they were playing Sudoku, smart-ass, but it's dishonest to think that the American people should have known that the NSA was using billions of tax dollars to spy on their own citizens. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4ihf2?context=5)|No need to be offensive. If you know that you have the world's biggest signals intelligence agency and that you face a range of adversaries including spies terrorists and gangsters, who do not conveniently confine their activities to neatly packaged geographical categories, I think you should assume that this agency will do its best to intercept their communications, including those which terminate in America. For that reason they will need to warehouse the meta-data in some way that is both secure and searchable. 
[This is an interesting answer.  I strongly disagree, but thank you for your perspective. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4inml?context=5)|Please buy my book andwrite to me off-line when you have read it if you want to discuss further.
[Why Snowdenistas? You're doubling up on the smear by association gambit. Not only associate with ists like communist &amp; socialist, but ending with 'istas' it brings to mind the Sandanistas of South America.  Flagrant judo attempt, lumping anyone who feels that the NSA &amp; GCHQ domestic actions should be carefully regulated and at this moment, publicly investigated should be considered a socialist foreigner and automatically suspect. In the same vein, why shouldn't your supporters be labeled Lucaryans?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4ijwh?context=5)|I don't mind if my followers (if I had any) were called Lucanians or Lucastiniks or anything else. It's quite legitimate in journalism and book-writing to find catchy titles and catch-phrases for things.  I think that the Snowdenistas have the same problem as the people who glorified Ortega and his gang, who feel pretty silly now 
[What was your role in ""helping topple Communism and ending the reign of the evil empire in Europe""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4i4i2?context=5)|I organised a ""Solidarity with Solidarity"" campaign in London in 1981, and did as much as I could help dissidents and anti-communist causes. I was one of very few Western freelance journalists living behind the Iron Curtain. Getting the news out helped break the Communist information blockade.
[Do you think that there are lines that journalists should not cross in handling stolen classified files? Is there a point at which journalists can be said to be in collusion if they incite hacking or specify what they'd like to see hacked or constantly collaborate with hackers on the material?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4iq0v?context=5)|Yes I do. I make this point strongly in my book. I quote a bit here.
 |This book is not based on complacency about the status quo. It is not a whitewash of British and other allied intelligence agencies, either regarding their reaction to the Snowden revelations or their activities in previous years. I have spent much of my career in pursuit of official secrets (in dictatorships and democracies) and have had some success in finding them. I have on several occasions prompted official leak investigations, notably in NATO when I was the first journalist to disclose that the alliance had finally agreed to make contingency plans to protect its new members.  In my book “Deception” I exposed the German BND’s spying operations in Estonia, and described the disastrous British intelligence operations in the Baltics in the 1940s and 1950s. In all these cases I have judged the public interest more important than saving politicians and officials from embarrassment. My instinctive attitude is to mistrust official explanations. The plea of secrecy that intelligence and security officials invoke when confronted with hard questions makes it easy to cover up incompetence, corruption and treason.
 |Yet transparency and journalistic freedom do not trump all other considerations. Secrets may be so sensitive that journalists have no business exposing them ...  Journalists have a duty to their readers – but they are citizens too. Their safe and comfortable lives, and those of their fellows, depend on the proper functioning of the state. They should not take this for granted.   
[Hi there, and thanks for doing this.  I've noticed you sit among the harsher critics of Putin, but I was wondering what did you think of Yeltsin? Also, you write a lot about how Putin's foreign and domestic policies are more aggressive, but I'd be most interested in fundamentally why you think that is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4i4tj?context=5)|I think Yeltsin was a great man in some ways but gravely flawed in others. He did not understand the corrosive effects of corruption. He did not really understand the importance of institutions in a capitalist economy. (To be fair, many other people were making mistakes at the time too). The Chechen war was a terrible mistake. He also failed to see that the KGB had not been truly destroyed (as we now see all too clearly). On the other hand he did help the Soviet Union to break up more or less peacefully. 
[At what point did Yeltsin go from formidable poitician to mostly drunk ans seemingly a puppet of spin doctors/oligarchs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4ixka?context=5)|I think after about 1992. I also blame Korzhakov [Link to ru.wikipedia.org](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87)
[What's the biggest mistake you've ever made, and how have you learned from it?  If you could tell your 17-year-old self anything, what would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4hz0o?context=5)|I should have started learning foreign languages earlier in life. I would tell my 17-year-old self that languages are fun and that the younger you start the easier they are. I really started only when I was 22 with German, and after that with Polish, Russian etc. But it was quite a hard slog.
[What are your best tips for learning a new language, then? For someone who is older.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4i3nx?context=5)|Immersion is the best. If you can't do that, get a passive knowledge by reading as much as you can. Try setting your Facebook and other website settings to the language you are learning. 
[What are your views on how mainstream western journalism covers eastern Europe and former Soviet states? I've become really disenchanted with The New York Times especially over their under researched reporting on the Maidan protests. What are good (preferrably English language\) sources on the region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4ieas?context=5)|Foreign coverage is expensive and much of the mainstream media doesn't have the money to do it. When I was based in the region formerly known as Eastern Europe (a term I don't like) we had dozens of foreign correspondents. Even papers like the Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune had correspondents and bureaus in Moscow and elsewhere. Now they don't.
 |I also think that the media was a bit too trusting towards Putin because he wasn't Yeltsin. Many people refused to believe that Russia could be both in decline and also a threat. That was why I wrote ""The New Cold War"" in 2008. They also did not believe that Russian espionage was a threat. That was why I wrote ""Deception"" in 2011.
[Thank you. I really enjoy your books and your contributions to The Economist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4in2w?context=5)|Delighted to hear it. 
[What advice would you give a 19 year old university student who wants to become a journalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4igjl?context=5)|Write every day about something. Practise interviewing techniques and observation. Read lots of media, noting the things you like and dislike. Write to leading journalists with suggestions for stories or critiques of their articles. Check out the Economist for internships.
[Absolutely desperate for the Foreign Analysis internship, but the last time I've seen it advertised was in 2007. Does it still run?

But all our internships are advertised in the Economist. 
[What are you most proud of in your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4i028?context=5)|Helping topple Communism and ending the reign of the evil empire in Europe.
[What's your opinion on Putin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4iq2h?context=5)|I have written a lot about him in the past. I suggest you look at my book ""The New Cold War"" which is available for a token 0.01p on Amazon (plus P&amp;P) [Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0230606121/ref=tmm_hrd_used_olp_0?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=used&amp;qid=1391281202&amp;sr=1-3)

Jokes aside, can you make money from a book priced 99cents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4itjj?context=5)|It's the Amazon pricing structure. 99c in US, 99p in UK. Make sure that you are on the right site. I get 70% which is rather more than I get from a print book especially when it is sold discounted on Amazon. 
[What do you see for a Post-Russia Putin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4iu5d?context=5)|It will be difficult because he has stoked up a lot of problems for the future, both in hollowing out institutions and in letting tensions build up.

I am not arguing that government is perfect or that whistleblowing is bad. Indeed I make a specific point in the book of highlighting the Obama administration's lamentable record on whistleblowers. 
[Helping topple communism is a bit vague. Supposedly people in the weapons industry in the US could say they same as they made the Soviet regime overspend. In what ways were you involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4izvi?context=5)|See above.

I helped organise Student Solidarity with Solidarity in 1981-2 and thereafter worked with dissident and emigre groups. I smuggled things across the Iron Curtain, was arrested several times, beaten up etc. My main job was to get information out.

[Hiya. Whatever Snowden's motives, do you not trust the journalists and their publications in possession of the full data dump to report responsibly? I'd thought the Guardian (as one example\) is at pains to keep within the limits of D notices received from the UK Govt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4mt9n?context=5)|The Guardian did conceal some things from the leaked documents. All but one of their stories was passed by the D-notice committee, I believe. But the D-notice committee is only advisory. If I had been offered the Snowden documents I would have been horrified. I think you can make a public-interest defence for publishing the Verizon court order, but even then I would not. Journalism is all about establishing context and credibliity, and that is hard to do with a collection of secret documents where you don't know the source, can't check with anyone etc.

I think the situation is almost beyond repair in terms of a peaceful solution leading to an effective government of a united country. 
[What do you want to say to the people of the world that believe the secrets should have remained a secret?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wqpc0/iama_edward_lucas_senior_editor_at_the_economist/cf4rfqi?context=5)|I think journalists can publish state secrets in the belief that the public interest demands it. But they have to be prepared to take the consequences, face prosecution and argue their case in court.

The results suit China too, but particularly Russia. And that's where he ended up, in strange and secret conditions where we can't ask him questions.

1wru61,6,2014-02-01,I Contacted Anonymous Ads about using Dogecoin as well as using Bitcoin - I urge you to do the same!,Pizzaface97,dogecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wru61/i_contacted_anonymous_ads_about_using_dogecoin_as/,"For a while, I've seen webmasters using Adsense, and while that's great, I think we should be supporting the whole ""Anonymous"" type feel that we get from using Cryptocurrencies, as well as keeping the whole fun feel that we've had from DogeCoin.

Now, as a future Webmaster (Stay Tuned for more information Later). I'd like to gain some revenue for site costs and etc. And to do so, I'd like to receive payments in Doge (I know this isn't the most effective way, but it supports the economy) So, I sent an email over to Anonymous Ads Support (See [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/u9W8FFz.png).) asking them to support Dogecoin as a form of Payment, and a form of Paying. 

Using /u/wouldacouldashoulda 's letter as a backbone, I wrote the following:

Dear people of the awesome at AnonAds,
Let me start of with saying how much I appreciate your ad service. As a cryptocoin user and webmaster, I love the ease of being able to earn direct Bitcoins for displaying ads on my site!
Anyway, that's not why I'm writing today. Today, I'm writing about Dogecoin. You might already have heard about Dogecoin, but in case you haven't: Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) that's kind of hot recently, and has been the most traded cryptocurrency (after Bitcoin) for nearly a month. It is a bit different than Bitcoins, most notably in that there are much more of them, which in my opinion is also one of its strengths; it's not a lot of fun (and not so easy) to pay with 0.00044779 Bitcoin for something like ads. That makes it much more suited for smaller payments. In that sense, Bitcoin can be compared more to a valuable material such as gold, with Dogecoin being more like a regular coin.
The strongest point of the currency however is its community. If you search for the Dogecoin, you will find it was based upon a meme. This might make you disqualify it, but honestly, the community behind it is the best behind any other cryptocoin, with people really believing in it instead of just being in it for a quick buck. Because it is such a familiar concept for something unfamiliar (a trick earlier performed by Apple, by putting a piece of fruit as logo for a hi-tech company) it attracts way more kinds of people to it than your regular, techie cryptocoin. This has caused the getting started guides to be the best of all coins, is evolving the tooling better than for any other coin (for example an Android app was released a while ago, unique for most cryptocoins but the very big ones), and has made marketing efforts sprout up here and there (such as Starcraft gamers playing against each other for Dogecoins). There's a momentum going on, and I think it's time for Dogecoin to take the next step.
So, to get to my point. It would be awesome if you guys could add Dogecoin as valid payment method to your Anonymous Ads. There's a big userbase behind it so there would be no worries about not getting anyone to use it; I can guarantee you'll even see a large influx of new customers paying with the coin.
It does require some kind of faith however from your side, as the value of any cryptocoin isn't fully stable right now. However, a move like this would be unprecedented, and as such will for sure make the value of the Dogecoin rise quite a bit, at the very least for the short term. This should make it quite a safe investment for you as well. Obviously the value could still plummet, but with more support will come more trust, and with more trust comes more support. We just need someone to take a leap of faith. I am asking you to take that leap of faith.
About the implementation,There are a few PSP solutions available such as https://www.dogeapi.com/ or https://www.moolah.ch, but you can make incorporate it, but some custom work would have to be done. The coin is based on the Bitcoin principle, so your system wouldn't have to change all that much, and plus, Dogecoin is just as Anonymous as Bitcoin!
Furthermore, for any questions or requests to the community, we are available here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogecoin. We are very happy to answer any questions, or to help you during implementation. I'm sure it could even be an option to recruit one of us as intern to build the implementation completely, if that would be an option for you.
This has been quite a long mail already. I hope you will consider taking up Dogecoin as real payment method on your website. It would give a great boost to the coin and to cryptocoins in general, and will help provide a real alternative for Bitcoins, which is currently really more for investors than for consumers.
Thank you so much for your time.
Best regards,

I suggest you shoot them an email too! This could be big for DogeCoin, as I don't see an ad service that supports it directly. 

Email them at contact@anonymousads.com!

To the Moon!

1wrupf,1,2014-02-01,Regretting decision to accept low offer at a company I might not enjoy working at. Advice on moving to a new job in future?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1wrupf/regretting_decision_to_accept_low_offer_at_a/,"I’m an undergrad in CS about to graduate. I accepted an offer back in October to a well known virtualization company in the Bay Area / Silicon Valley. I interned there last summer (my first software internship) and they extended an offer for full-time. I was in a networking division, on a tools team that managed builds and other projects that supported the dev team. Although I enjoyed my internship, I really was not planning on going back there because I felt I could challenge myself more and work at a more ""mainstream"" company with more people my age doing something with more noticeable impact. But by the end of summer I was a bit burnt out and also anxious about interviewing again. They gave a short deadline for the offer, and I eventually decided to accept it because I didn’t want to start interviewing again and risk not getting a job. 

But now I am regretting that decision because 1. I didn't challenge myself, I just gave up and accepted the safe offer. and 2. my peers are starting to get offers and I feel like I am on the low end of the spectrum for Bay Area salary. My offer is around 84k + 15k signing + 5k relocation + RSUs. I should have at least negotiated for more, since they gave such a short deadline. Did I lowball myself, or should I just stop caring about salary? Honestly its enough for me but I can't help but feel like I could have done better or found a better place to work. 

I'm planning on just making the most of my time at this company to learn the most I can from it. I think working here would be a good experience since I would be exposed to enterprise networking technology, which is something I normally would not seek out. I probably would have applied to more mainstream companies that produce more ""consumer""-oriented software. I just don't want to be stuck doing enterprise stuff forever. When companies hire new grads, I feel like they generally are more lenient in hiring, and also open to placing them in a team they don’t have experience in. In the future IF and when I decide to leave this job, how much do companies cater their hiring to the type of experience you’ve had in your previous jobs? Does the hiring process for a new grad differ from someone who has already had a full-time position for a few years, interviews get any harder, are they more specific to the position, etc? Say I spent all this time in a tools team, would it be easy for me to jump to back-end web job, or another dev position? I'm hoping I will have the time to do some side projects to showcase other skills.

Last question, how do I know whether I am being challenged and learning at my job, and when is it the proper time to leave? In all honestly, this post could be a little premature since I haven't even worked there long enough to tell whether I will enjoy it.

Sorry for long post and the myriad of questions! Appreciate any feedback. Thanks."

I got bullied in high school and was suicidal back then. I never actually tried to kill myself because I was worried about my parents, but I was hoping I would just die one day so everybody could live on happily instead of blaming themselves for my suicide.
Then college started and I thought I finally turned things around, but a girl from high school at my college went absolutely batshit insane, told people shit about me, attacked me verbally about High School and those feelings came back. On top, my ""best friend"" turned out to be a fake asshole, basically dropped me as a friend like it's nothing and told me his friends hate me as a reason. I started to feel like I want to die again at that time and it never stopped since then.

Now I'm a recent bachelor graduate and have been looking for a job to get experience for months. None of those companies I really want to join accept me. I don't know why and it feels just not fair. I don't think it's my profile, but I think it's the way I express myself. I feel unable to cope with the pressure, I feel like I'm unable to archive my goals because even when I finally fix things, stuff like that happens. I just want to be happy, have friends, people to trust. I feel like I missed soo much in college and fail at life, despite still having a year ahead of me after (and if I) finish an internship. I've read about people here and I wouldn't kill myself, but sometimes when waiting for the train in the morning I just think ""Why not just step forward and do it?"".

I want those negative feelings to stop and just be happy..."

I have a degree in CS, with 16months of internship experience, and about 8 months of full time experience, at two different companies. Most of my experience is in making Android and some iOS apps, with some server side work. 

**Further Education?**
I am wondering if I should go back to school to do a Masters in CS/Applied Computing, or pursue a PMP and get some project management experience. My overall goal is to increase my salary, and work on more meaningful projects, at small-medium sized companies while targeting to work at a larger company in about 5-10 years down the line in a management role. 

**Concerns**
What I am concerned about is that there is a huge push towards Machine Learning / ""Big Data"" (I am not 100% clear on what is meant by this), and that I am lacking this valuable toolset. However, they both seem like really big, unapproachable topics, so I am wondering if it is better to go to school to learn them, or go to school to gain a PMP. Which would be more valuable in 10 years? 

**Ideal Future Plans**
An ideal goal in life would be to manage my own company, but I want to have a strong grasp of the tools before I venture down that path. I also would like to target a path that has a 100k+ salary :). 

I hope that was clear!! Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
1ws0kd,2,2014-02-01,"I am unhappy, unmotivated, and have no passion. I hate it even though I know I have to be positive.",qwertyui1234,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ws0kd/i_am_unhappy_unmotivated_and_have_no_passion_i/,"I don't know where to start or where to end. I sometimes think it's just because I'm immature and still broken because I just came out of a rollercoaster relationship. But I do not think that's all there is to it. I don't know how or why but I just feel so pathetic and unhappy. I shouldn't be so negative. I know that I have to be positive. But I just can't. This, everything around me, even though I'm at a place where I thought it would make me happy two years ago, is not making me happy. Everything around me is boring. Nothing excites me. I'm so fucked up on the inside, but I don't know how to tell people that correctly. Maybe it's the stress or slow realization that I'm an impatient fuck up. I used to be passionate. I used to be motivated. I used to be a person with a purpose. Everything I did worked towards that purpose and it worked and I felt so happy and felt like I was achieving something great. I used to be confident yet humble about it because I never spoke of my successes or improvements to others. I knew I was happy with myself and that was all I cared about.

Then somehow, everything started going downhill. I can't exactly say when, but the confidence started to be replaced by my huge ego. I feel like the person that I NEVER wanted to be before. My confidence, I feel like, has hit rock bottom while my ego is hugely inflated. I was such a man before. I was proud of myself. But now, everything is a repetition and I am not happy. I was emotionally stable with just being me, but now I'm such a fuck up that I need someone and sometimes I'm so needy that I don't even recognize myself anymore.

I'm only a Sophomore in college and I've never been in love. I have commitment issues so I used to run away a lot. Around three months ago, I met a girl and we fell in love really fast. We went really in fast in the relationship too. She moved in and we lived together for about two months until she moved away for study abroad very recently. I think my roots of my problems started from her. Couple weeks before she left, we started to fight a lot. Even though we never explicitly said we were exclusive, we were in a serious relationship even though we knew our relationship had an expiration date. And then I started to question this whole thing. What if I'm being used? What if she doesn't really love me? Can I trust her? And such. They were extremely irrational looking back, but it was too late. We began to fight a lot and I admitted to her that I was dating someone else when we only began to see each other (ended with the other one very soon after). Then it just began to all fall apart and she started talking about how she really doesn't like me and started pointing out all my flaws. Then she left leaving things in a huge mess. 

Couple days later, I open my diary and finds that she read my diary. When I write, most of it is just emotional dump at any random days when I'm feeling whatever I'm feeling. I also find that she left a note at my diary that says 'stupid, if you love her, should've told her'. I thought about being mad at her, but realized that didn't achieve anything. But she has read my diary and seen me at my most vulnerable state. I think this experience is emotionally taxing me more than I admit. 

I only say that because I recently met another girl at a party and started seeing her. I absolutely hate defining relationships with people, especially with girls. I think emotions shouldn't have such clear lines when dealing with people especially romantically. But, on our second date, I asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship with me. What the fuck? What was I thinking? The past me would have NEVER done it.  And of course, she said no even though I knew she liked me somewhat. It was just too soon for either of us. I definitely wasn't ready for it. Later that night, I realized that I was the one that fucked up and that I should just let it go, but pathetically I later texted her 'don't talk about this to other people'. Really? I'm such a fucking pathetic person. Why couldn't I just man up and realized that I fucked up and got rejected and just let it be? I had to be a needy pathetic person that makes sure my failure goes unnoticed. 

I used to be happy with myself and these things would never faze me. I never got emotionally involved with anything and if it did, I ran away. But now, I care about my emotions and failure and it's fucking stupid and pathetic. Also, my life isn't fun. Everyone around me is moving forward with their lives with internships and boosting their resume when there is nothing new going on with my life. Go to classes, go to work. I know as soon as I'm done with this semester that I'm going to go traveling, but I don't know how much longer I can take. I hope I was as independent as I was just couple months ago. And I really hope I can find my passion and motivation again. I want that feeling of knowing what to do again. I want to smile every morning knowing that I have purpose again. Right now, that seems so hard and distant and it's killing me. I wish I could man the fuck up and make my family proud for being in a city all alone by myself. 

Sorry this was a terrible rant. I really know I shouldn't self-loath this much and this seems so pathetic and petty and negative, but I don't know how to stop it. And I really just wanted to get my story off somehow so here it is. "

First I tried a couple introductory computer science classes since I liked the idea of programming and computers in general. But, I looked at the math requirements and honestly I'm not that good at math...at all.  I was looking into graphic design and film. More so graphic design since the university I will be transferring to has an internship elective for graphic design and some web design classes.   I'm not sure about their film concentration.

I keep hearing about how the market for each of my interested majors are flooded and it's too difficult to find a job.   I also hear that you don't need to go to school for these areas of work. 

Can someone help me out? Since I dropped out of school a couple years ago, all I could think about was my career options and what I would like to do for work.

1ws2jb,0,2014-02-01,How do I [24F] forgive my boyfriend [28M] for a lot of wrong doings?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ws2jb/how_do_i_24f_forgive_my_boyfriend_28m_for_a_lot/,"I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We met and started dating my last year of college. He was a returning student that needed to fulfill some prereqs for grad school. We are 4 years a part. To be honest I was in a relationship when we became close friends and when I started having feeling for him I broke it off with me ex before I did anything stupid like cheat. My close friends and people who knew him during his undergrad years warned me about him. Things were fine for a while. I caught him flirting with a girl through facebook and confronted him about it. I forgave him. After that most arguments were just about communication and still understand each other's personalities. I will admit I did do something wrong. I had a best guy friend (he has a girlfriend) who I would confide in when I need a guy's opinion. Some how we started talking about sex after I said that my bf and I were for some reason lacking in that department for a while. The conversations about sex started getting deeper and deeper and then i was actually caught. I stopped. I even stopped talking to my friend at all. By the way, to me sex is really important in a relationship. 

My bf is very into fitness and would always try to get me to workout before. The topic of us not having any activities in common was and issue. My close friends will tell you that you would not catch me in a gym or outside doing any physical activities. But then I saw a conversation between my bf and a friend saying that he didn't know if he loved me anymore. We don't do anything together and that I get jealous easily. It's true. I would get jealous when I would see him commenting and liking other girls' fitness photos. So what did I do? I gave in. Now I work out 4-5 days a week and my body has drastically changed. Did the sex get better? No. Mind you we don't live together, we actually live over an hour away from each other. But in the beginning after I graduated we had a lot of sex. And then it went down to maybe once a month. And honestly, if I could I would have sex everyday. I kept my mouth shut until i caught him 2 more times flirting with other girls on facebook. Then I had the idea of googling his most common username and what do I find? I find that he has accounts to online dating sites like Plenty of Fish and OK Cupid. That was really hard to take. I was freaking crushed. So of course I confronted him. His excuse was that he was just curious and bored. I told him how inadequate I feel and that maybe I just don't satisfy him anymore. He cried and apologized and said he would deactivate all of them. He even offered to give me the passwords to his facebook and email. I didn't ask for them because I was hoping he was would stop everything on his own.

 A few months later while we were in bed he got a text message from a girl whose name i recognized and asked about before. Months earlier he said she was a friend. This time she was a new intern at his work. So i called him out on lying. I confessed to lying but said the message was friendly. During our work out I asked him to prove it to me. Well he didn't so I took is phone and saw that their conversation was deleted and so was her number. ANYONE would assume that he deleted it because he's hiding the fact that it wasn't a ""friendly"" conversation. 

I forgave him again and along with threatening him to leave I also said that we were having major sex problems and that i needed more from him. After that sex wasn't an issue anymore. But something was still lingering in the back of my mind so I asked for the passwords. Boy! I found a lot of shit. I found a lot of those craigslist ads trying to meet with women. Now most of them were from before we started dating but DAMN. He's been doing it for the past 3 girlfriends. A part of me wants to contact them and ask if they knew. Anyways. We talked about it. He has a lot of issues he needs to take care of. He says needs me to get through these problems so he'll stop. But going though his emails I noticed he has other email accounts that he said he has deleted but my gut is telling me that they are still active. 

Despite ALL these negative things everything is fine. We enjoy each other most of the time. We are close to each others' families. We do a lot together ever since I started working out with him. It's just that I feel like I only have a grasp on one side of him and the other half I'm just finding out and it's not good. He keeps telling me that he will be more open with me. He'll make me happy. He says he doesn't want to lose me and that I am the one. Even asked him to move with him if he has to move out of state for grad school because he feels that if we are together everyday things would be different.

 My question to whoever reads this whole thing is should I confront him about the other emails or hope he's not using them for bad reasons and how should handle this? How do I make it clear to him? I love him a lot and I'm trying to make the positives out weigh the negatives. So breaking up with him is out of the question. We just need to move forward and things need to change. I did tell him though, that if he does anything like that again I will end it. But I just need advice on how to get through it.

I am in a high stress graduate level program working towards a degree in the medical field.  Last year when I quit it was right before finals and the high stress of work/school/losing my coping mechanism resulted in me grinding my teeth alot.  I ended up injuring a ligament so that I was in pretty bad pain all the time (these sort of injuries take about a month to resolve) which made studying super difficult.

I have been a heavy user of weed for ~6 years, hitting a bowl about every 3 hours all day, every day when not at school or at work. The only times I have quit since I started were last year for about 2 months and now.

 Quit again last week for the same reason, and while it feels much easier psychologically this time, I have already noticed I'm clenching my jaw alot, and starting to feel pain in my teeth again.  Ideas anyone?  Should I just suck it up and go to the doc for some anxiety meds?

He eventually became my best friend and, after I had a messy break-up with my high school sweetheart, we started dating during sophomore year.

College was great, and we really didn't have many issues in our relationship.  During senior year, we tried to make sure our post-grad paths would keep us together.  He was starting grad school, and I was looking for a job, and we both managed to end up in the same city.  We lived together for a year, and it was great.  Sometimes we had minor arguments -- sometimes I wanted him to spend more time with me, sometimes I felt like we weren't physical enough in our relationship -- but we loved living together.

Then I decided to apply to grad school and ended up moving 12 hours away.  We talked about it, about how we would need to communicate really well, but how we were going to make it work.  By the time I moved, we had been together for 3.5 years, so I thought we had a strong foundation.  The end goal was to be together again -- and we talked about moving back together after we graduated.  It would be 2-3 years before we were in the same city again, but I thought we would make it.

Long-distance was really hard on me, and a lot less hard on him.  I didn't know anyone in my new city.  My grad program is very small, and I have had trouble making a solid group of friends.  Then my dog died about 1.5 months after I started school.  I just felt really lonely -- and I took it out on him.  I wanted to talk more, to video chat more, to text more -- and I guess he felt overwhelmed by it, and like he was always disappointing me.  But every time we saw each other in person -- the last time being 2 weeks ago -- we had a great time, and the distance seemed to me like a small thing we would get past.

Then, just a few hours ago, he broke up with me over the phone.  I am so lost and confused.  Just at the beginning of January, he told me he thought he was ""in it for the long haul.""  We had our share of problems and uneven expectations, but we didn't talk about breaking up over them.  This decision just seems so sudden, so I am having a lot of trouble accepting it.  After 4 years, I feel like he shouldn't just give up on a whim.  Like he owes it to our relationship to try a little longer, to try different things to make it work.  I had already booked flights to visit over spring break, and I was planning to visit him often during the summer around my internship dates.  Things were looking up, and I feel like he should have stuck it out a little longer to see how things progressed.  Maybe I am being unreasonable.

One of his good friends broke up with his GF of 4+ years just a few weeks ago, and the two of them have been hanging out a lot.  I feel like this friend might have influenced my BF's decision.  His friend told his GF that he didn't want to ""waste her time,"" and my BF used that exact same line.  He kept telling me that I deserved someone better, who could give me everything I wanted and who wouldn't hurt me all the time, and that he didn't want to waste more of my time than he already had.

It just seems like such BS reasons to break up with me.  Who is he to decide what I deserve?  Who is he to tell me that I am hurting too much as things are?  I feel like there is some underlying reason he is not telling me, or like we just had a rough day and he broke up with me on a whim.  I want him to reconsider.  But I don't want to be the crazy ex that is desperate to get him back... even though that is what I am.

He was my best friend, and I don't know what to do now.  I don't have many friends here.  All of my hobbies involved him.  I feel like this was such an unfair, unilateral decision... but I guess that's what break-ups are.  

I honestly thought we would be together forever.  We talked about it... where we wanted to live, how many children we each wanted, our views on family.  

I regret moving.  I regret pursuing my career over staying with him.  I was so proud of our relationship, that we could each strive to make ourselves better and do our own thing while staying together.  Now I'm questioning everything.  Was he just looking for an excuse to break up with me?  Did he ever really love me?  Why is he doing this?  How can I get him to change his mind?

Sorry to rant.  I don't know what to do.  It's hard to breathe, it's hard to think, it's impossible to sleep.  I feel so alone.

You are going to go to the doctor and they will analyze your DNA to see how many genes you have related to each disorder. They will also use genetics to predict medication and probably psychotherapy effectiveness too. You go in get a cheek swab and say you need CBT and medication X:)

[How do you feel about the mental disorders being subjective diagnoses? How far are we from having objectively diagnoses mental disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wswop/iama_psychiatrist_ama/cf57aru?context=5)|I think the diagnoses are pretty good. They provide common terminology which healthcare professional understand. If I diagnose someone with depression with psychotic features anyone else can have a picture in their head what I'm working with so they can continue care. There are some diagnosis that are a little more complicated but everything continues to evolve.
[What can patients do to get the most out of therapy?  Edit: spelling, dur.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wswop/iama_psychiatrist_ama/cf52g3h?context=5)|You've got to get comfortable with being vulnerable and opening up. People fear appearing weak but the reality is getting help is a sign of strength. You have to be able to tell your therapist when you feel it isn't going right. Tell your therapist, I'm not sure I like you or I don't feel this is going in the right direction and that opens doors to go somewhere you have never been:)
[Me and my friend (both diagnosed\) often talk/joke about ""trends"" in psychiatric care, where a diagnosis becomes very popular for a few years and almost everyone seem to have it, aspergers, borderline and bipolar seem to go big, and some people we know pile up very similar diagnoses.  Is there any truth in our blabbering, in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wswop/iama_psychiatrist_ama/cf54q42?context=5)|Not really. I think some times money drives the system. Insurance companies decide they are only going to pay for a certain thing and then everyone gets that diagnosis. The problem is people really need the help but insurers don't want to pay so they get that diagnosis. I don't play that game, I call it like I see it and stay out of trouble that way.

There are people who are willing to help and donate their time. Most city and state governments have programs and free and reduced cost medical care. Most areas have free and reduced cost medical clinics. Pick up the phone and call someone in the area. Ask what is available. Most medical schools have free and reduced cost clinics too.

Worked with some women who had such severe mental illness they became life threateningly incapacitated without meds. In that situation the recommendation would be to continue the medication.
[I'd like to start by saying that I absolutely believe mental illness is real and serious.  I've always wondered where does personality end and a condition begin. It's obvious when it comes to schizophrenia, but what about depression? When does sad end and depression begin? Or anxiety? So I guess I'm asking how you tell if someone has a problem or if it's just his/her personality.  Or does it just work itself out because if someone comes to see you, he/she want to change whatever he/she came to talk about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wswop/iama_psychiatrist_ama/cf56rzh?context=5)|Hard to say it falls on the judgment of the provider. Everything is always a mix. In psychiatry we have bio-psycho-social and spirituality. Genetics and medical issues play a role. A person's learned behavior and thinking patterns play a role. Also the environment they are in such as job and school impact their mental health. Finally there is there religious beliefs. Usually those things are all meshed together and you have to treat all of them simultaneously.

[What is the psychological basis for gambling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wswop/iama_psychiatrist_ama/cf55vcf?context=5)|Gambling is like a fantasy. It's a dream you are going to score big and live large. It's fun to buy a lottery ticket and live that. But then reality hits after you lose. What makes it more complicated is some time persistent gamblers win which makes them think the fantasy is obtainable and they keep going. It becomes a problem when people can't control it and lose everything. I think its also like an escape. People who are in a terrible situation are more susceptible.

First one that comes to mind: It was 2 in the morning and I had just admitted a patient on the inpatient psych unit. She was quite a character to begin with - tearful, emotional, angry, etc. She was informed that her drug test was positive for cocaine. She totally flipped out and was causing a disturbance so I got called to talk to her. She begged me to repeat her test and threatened to keep causing trouble if I didn't agree. So I gave in. Next thing I know the lab called me and send the drug test was positive for Kool-aid. She had taken her drink and poured it into the urine sample. The lab results should a glucose level of 1000 and was negative for drugs:) Suffice it to say she calmed down after that.

[THANKS doing this AMA. My question pertains particularly to worldwide schizophrenia rates and mental illness generally. Why in non-westernized  countries (India, some African countries, etc.\) do they seem to recover relatively quickly e.g., within a years time? I ask because from what I was researching during an Anthropology class, the articles gave the impression that schizophrenia was not seen as a life long disorder, but a temporary thing based on the sufferer's present circumstances. Also, Nidotherapy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wswop/iama_psychiatrist_ama/cf57hss?context=5)|True schizophrenia is really a genetic or biological disorder. My impression is the rates are the same in every country. Probably in other countries where the rates are low their detection rate is very low because of there mental health systems aren't very good.

Very similar to DSM IV in my opinion.
[Okay, here I go. First things first, yes I know this is the internet and a proper diagnosis would be better at a psychiatrist face-to-face(I'll be seeing one later\).  Zoning out frequently in conversations. I would go off an a thought as you were talking and pop back, mid conversation, trying to play catch up by reading signals. This wasn't a rare thing at all, it was very common.  I was very forgetful. I frequently lost track of things. Phones, glasses, keys, things I borrowed, etc. I wouldn't remember to do things requested of me.  I never organized anything. If I went to school it would be with the same books in my bag I had from the start of the week. I was always untidy and the depression simply made me not care about it in the slightest.  I have a thing against turn-based games of any form. Especially with friends. Uno, monopoly, card games, etc, I simply hated the thought of waiting for someone else to take turns. Even worse when someone decided to interrupt and ask to join. I had little patience and it easily infuriated me. Living in a country known for people showing up late to everything has taken a toll on my mind and I simply avoid asking others to drop me somewhere or any other thing that makes me dependent on someone else for my time management(what little I have\).  My constant chatter somewhat isolated me and made me a prime target for teasing. My dad beating me for every little thing didn't help at all and by around 8 years old my outlook on my future was very bleak and I constantly thought about suicide.  I now talk a significantly less and pretty much avoid people. I was a lot friendlier as a young child but now I find reasons to avoid social events and typically avoid meeting new people.  All that said, with the things I mentioned my pscyhiatrist told me she thought it was ADHD but because I have a significantly high IQ  (The number of which she never cared to tell me\) and I showed no signs of being hyper she thinks it must be something else.  I soon left because it was honestly wasn't doing a thing for me but draining my pockets.  Looking up ADHD recently I noticed several things.  I don't have to be hyper and my IQ can be whatever it damn well pleases.  The things I mentioned directly pointed towards ADHD and depression.

I worked with hundreds with active duty military coming back from combat with PTSD and felt very comfortable working with them. For PTSD the treatment usually involves meds including for sleep and therapy to revisit the trauma. Anxiety is pretty similar but CBT is pretty good.

If you look at it that way, maybe there is a ""natural tension"". Ultimately healthcare is a team based activity where professionals work together to help people. There is a shortage of mental health professionals so there is plenty of work to go around. When professionals battle and try to out do each other the only thing they hurt are the patients.

[Since studying Psychology and doing voluntary work in Clinical Psychology, I've become increasingly frustrated with how the DSM works and especially the potential for corruption within the system. Doctors and drug companies are rewarded by prescribing more drugs to patients, and it seems that this has led to an overwhelming increase in the amount of people who are ""diagnosed"" with various disorders. The DSM-V seems to have made this situation worse than ever. In my opinion, this will seriously harm the general public's trust in Psychiatry in the long term.

[Greetings,  I've been told by two psychiatrists that I display prominent schizoid behavior, and was instructed to use Modafinil and Prestiq. Unfortunately, while Modafinil seemed to work for two weeks, making me feel 'intense' for lack of a better word, I haven't really noticed any change from either pills for more than eight months now. Additionally, while I do think I display most schizoid traits, I somehow enjoy being temporarily on stage. As in, I found myself in a business school, giving presentations every week. I actually enjoyed them, and was considered one of the more lively, entertaining, and energetic presenters in a very extroverted class. I did return to my regular self the minute they ended, which did confuse them, and my professors as well. It also made me wonder, because this is not, as far as I know, schizoid behavior.

The reality sometimes is diagnoses are just a label or billing code. What matters is you are achieving the goal you want and the treatment is working. What do you see as your main issue? Are you trying to change something? What is your desired outcome?

1wtcys,1,2014-02-02,"The one that got away. Just my story, not really asking for anything, but any advice is welcome. (Sorry in advance for the length)",buddy469,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wtcys/the_one_that_got_away_just_my_story_not_really/,"So I met this girl in high school. Let's call her Carrie. Carrie and I were involved in a lot of the same activities in school and had some classes together, so we saw a lot of each other. We didn't talk much Freshman year, we started talking more Sophomore year. 

I was best friends with her best friend, and the summer before junior year I talked to my best friend (call her Sandy) a lot. Carrie saw how much Sandy was talking to me and decided she wanted to talk to me too. So we started talking and started getting very close. She had a phone plan that caused her texting to eat up her minutes, and she would always use up those minutes very quickly because we were always talking. 

So Junior year started and I was infatuated with Sandy. I dated her once before and I really liked her again. Unfortunately for me, Sandy is a naturally flirtatious girl and unknowingly led me on and I just got hurt. Carrie, hated the way Sandy treated me and we started getting closer.

About two months into the school year, we both realized how much we liked each other. I remember one night I planned to drive her back from a Halloween party. She got there first, and she was constantly looking to the door hoping I would be there. Once I came there, we spent the whole night next to each other dancing and talking. It was a blast. When I drove her home I was playing a CD my band just finished recording, and I just casually sang my favorite love song to her. But anyways, that's all beside the point. We started dating soon after.

That was the beginning of the best relationship of my life. We talked all the time about anything and everything. On our first date we went to a local park and sat by the water, just talking about life and our morals and views on everything. It felt so natural, I was so comfortable around her. We had our first kiss before we left the park, and then we went to the circus. Honestly, that was one of the best nights of my life. 

That's basically what our relationship was like until the end of high school. We spent so much time together, made so many memories, it felt like nothing could keep us apart. 

Then it was time for college. We both went for very different things in college. Carrie is more science/math inclined, I'm more artistically inclined. The school I wanted to go to was about 1500 miles away from her school, which is only about a four hour drive from our hometown. Neither of us wanted to end our relationship simply due to the fact that we wouldn't be able to see each other, so we decided to give long-distance a try.

While the first year was hard, with a lot of ups and downs, our love never wavered. We stayed strong even in our weakest moments. There was a lot of crying on both sides. We missed each other like crazy, and were just counting down the days until we'd be back together for the summer.

Well we made it to the summer, and it was perfect. It was like we had never left. Both of us were a little worried that we had changed and things between us wouldn't be the same, but that wasn't the case. We spent almost every day together all summer. Going to zoos, her family reunion, just having so much fun and making so many memories. By the end of the summer, we were more in love than we ever had been.

Because of the way our schools work, her semester starts about two weeks before mine does. So I was at home with my parents while she was at school. 

During her second semester (of the first year) Carrie got really into swing dancing. She went every Friday, and Saturday for a while. She went out dancing until 4am the night before she said she would drive back to see me off on the plane back to school. She left at 7am, on about three hours of sleep, and wound up getting into a really bad car accident on the way home. Somehow, she came out of the accident unscathed. Everybody said she should be dead, but someone, somehow must have been watching over her. 

We still wound up seeing each other that day and slept in each others' arms that night. Something we always dreamt about doing, and it was so special. It was a great day for us despite everything that happened. 

We cried at the airport as we said our ""see ya laters"" (we didn't like saying goodbye), but we were very optimistic about the upcoming year since we had already done it before (and she bought plane tickets to come visit me over winter break!!). 

Before her accident, she met this guy (we'll say Mark) at a blues dance. He was very outgoing, very forward (at least from what my friends told me), but he was married, so I didn't have too much of a problem with it. He did sound creepy to me (He googled Carrie's name and found her address and other things about her), but Carrie assured me it was just the way he was. He wasn't creepy. 

I still had concerns that I voiced, but she was free to do as she wished and started spending a lot of time with him. One time, they went to a dance that was an hour or so outside of the city she lived, and her and Mark stayed at some friends house for the dance. On that trip, Mark told Carrie that he was in an open relationship with his wife. He was free to date and be intimate with whomever he wanted outside of his marriage. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that life style, people live how they want to live, but with how much time Carrie was spending with him, I just got a really bad feeling.

Now for a little about my situation for the first month. I lived off-campus this year with three of my friends. The people that rented the place before us were absolute slobs and left the place disgusting. Our landlord didn't do anything about it. So the first two weeks coming home from school, all my roommates and I did was clean the apartment. It was really stressful when all I wanted to do was relax from my really long days, but I couldn't because the place was that revolting.

On top of school I also took on a part-time job and an internship. I was way too ambitious. 18-credit hours, 15 hours a week job, an internship that took up seven hours of my Saturday, and being a music major, I had to find time to practice and do homework on top of everything. I was stressed out to the max. I would come home and just sit for like an hour every day, just trying to relax. (I quit my job after three weeks).

I wanted to confide in Carrie about all of this (what one would naturally do in this situation) but she wasn't really there. She would cancel our Skype calls, she wouldn't call me before bed, and she wouldn't even text me if she was around anyone. I felt really alone.

All this time that she wasn't really there for me, she was spending time with Mark. Going sailing, watching movies, dancing, he was always asking her to hang out. And Carrie, recovering from a potential fatal event, just wanted to live life and have fun, so she took all the opportunities to hang out with him. 

As time went on, she became more and more distant. There were days we never even talked on the phone and only sent a few texts here and there. The fact that she was leaving me alone and spending all this time with another guy started eating away at me. I felt like something was going on that she wasn't telling me, but she was such a pure, innocent girl that I couldn't actually believe anything was happening.

A couple weeks before our 3-year anniversary, she told me she started having romantic feelings for Mark. I was really upset. She said she would distance herself from him until her feelings subsided, she really didn't want to lose one of her best friends. Well she never really distanced herself, and that made me jealous and angry. A few times I toyed with the idea of breaking up with her because of the way she was acting, but couldn't bring myself to do it because I loved her and she promised me she would distance herself.

In November, she finally said she would distance herself, and it seemed like she really was. She said her feelings for him were diminishing and she was seeing him as just a friend. So they started to hang out more again. I was stupid, and I let the problem eat away at me. I would ask her probing questions because I couldn't understand how the woman I loved fell for another man. It consumed me and I exhausted her with these questions.

In the weeks leading up to her trip to come visit, she told me she had started losing romantic feelings for me. I was devastated. I took a lot of time to think, and I apologized for everything I had done and told that I trusted her because she had given me no reason not to trust her. She didn't seem very moved by this, she seemed indifferent. 

We hoped things would get better when we saw each other when she came up. They didn't really. Every night I could feel that she didn't love me the same way she used to, and I would talk about it. Staying up late with conversations that she really did not want to have. There were some good moments, but overall it was not a good trip. When we got home, things seemed to be a little better. We went to the places we always used to go, reminiscing and having some laughs.

Then she went back to school, and the first thing she does is see Mark. He winds up spending the next 3 days with her, never going home, just sleeping on her couch.

I went up to see her for the week before I left. At some point we had a fight about Mark (she told me she still had strong feelings for him and was sexually attracted to him) and all this, I told her to stop toying with me and I stormed off. She came and found me a while later and we talked in her car. She wanted another chance and I told her this was the very last one.

The next day, I met her in between one of her classes and I told her that the second chance comes with one condition, I get full disclosure on everything that happened between her and Mark. She was crying and ashamed, but she told me she had been cheating on me for two months now. 

(continued in comments, sorry it is so long) Also a TL;DR in comments."
1wtdsv,0,2014-02-02,(22M) I'm in love with my (22f) gf but I'm also attracted to another girl,anonymous19992,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wtdsv/22m_im_in_love_with_my_22f_gf_but_im_also/,"I've been in a relationship with my amazing girlfriend for 4 years. We met when we were in high school. After the first 1 and a half years, we left our home town for college, each in a different city, but remained in a long distance relationship, trying to see each other as often as we could (every 3 weeks, on average).

Despite the physical distance, we got closer together during college. We understand each other really well, which is a rare thing for both of us, being that we are so driven to be great in our profession, which has taken a toll on our social lives. We are both determined to become financially secure before committing our lives to someone, probably because we both felt the difficulty in having to live without it in our childhood. We talk on the phone every day, discuss everything from how our day was to philosophy or science, and so I go as far as to say that intellectually, we are a match made in heaven.

We started being physically intimate about a year ago, which brought our relationship to a whole new level. Needless to say, when we get to see each other, we go at it like we're insatiable. She was my first sexual partner and I know I was her first too, although I never asked. So this is yet another department where we are perfect for each other. Did I mention I think she's beautiful? (even with clothes on *cough*)


So everything is perfect in our relationship. **Right? Well, not really.** The first problem is we expect to be together after she graduates, and given that she's in medical school, that'll be in 3 and a half more years. I knew that when we started this, but after 2 and a half years, I miss her like crazy. What's worse, because I choose to focus on getting the best education I can and go to internships in the summer, and so on, my social skills are fairly poor. As a result, I often feel lonely, and this is eating away my happiness. I know I would be happy with this woman if I would end up marrying her. But, when you meet someone else you're attracted to, who can actually be with you when you want to see them, it starts to feel like this is a steep price to pay.


---


So here's the other story: I met this other girl, in the city where I study, about a year ago. We clicked instantly, and we went on some walks together, and talked about everything our minds could grasp. One day, she invites me to the theater. At that point, I started to get a fuzzy feeling about there being more emotions between us than I knew what to do with (remember, I was in a relationship at the time). But I went to see that play with her, as I felt great while spending time with her, and hoped we could see each other and be friends.

I was actually beginning to notice I was attracted to her, but decided I would just ignore that, because I didn't want to lose the great time I discovered I could have. That night ended up feeling like a date. We never even touched hands, but we didn't have to. It was enough to look into each other's eyes to feel the tension. 


So I walk her home, like any self respecting man would do. Then, as I get home, I get her message saying she like me, and would like to be more than friends, but that she understands that I am in a relationship, and if I don't feel the same for her, she would like us to at least continue to be friends. **BOOM! Bomb dropped.** What do I do now? Foolishly imagining that we could actually continue to be friends, I tell her that I don't feel the same way. **Even though I did. Why, you ask? Because I was afraid. Afraid of hurting my girlfriend, afraid something that started with more passion than I ever felt could last.** This is not to say that I know now I should have behaved differently back then. I still love my girlfriend. I don't know if that would have made me happier. I guess I never will.


Long story short, the next time we saw each other was extremely awkward, conversation felt forced, and slowly got to the point of no contact. I still thought about her every once in a while, but didn't want to hurt her by reminding her of me. We saw each other again one time when we were going out with a group of friends. I found out that she was in a relationship, said I was happy for her, and got out of there as soon as I could.


---


A few days ago, I started thinking about her again. She is still in that relationship, but because almost a year has passed since that night, and we haven't talked in 6 months, I decided to talk to her again. Who knows? Maybe she's happy in her relationship, so much so that we could be friends again. So I did. We talked on Facebook for a while, got updates on what each of us is up to, and felt like there was no awkwardness anymore. Yay!

I'll be leaving the country in a few months, for my graduate studies. I asked her to get together sometime, before I leave, as I feel this might be the last time we'll have the chance. She seemed to love the idea.

I'm not sure, at this point, that I still want to fight for my relationship with my girlfriend. I think we're perfect for each other, and I love her, but this is hurting me. **I know that breaking up with her would be something I would always think about with regret, even if I would find someone else to be happy with.** I am actually considering sharing all this with the other girl. Including the fact that I actually was attracted to her, and that I was still thinking about how nice the little time we spent together was.

Now, I'm facing you, dear redditer, to ask for your opinion. What do you think I should do, both in my relationship and on my (probably last) meeting with the other girl?

**TL;DR;** : I'm in a 4 years long LDR with a girl I love, but my infatuation with another girl didn't go away even after we had no contact for 6 months.

I am writing this post in the aftermath of a momentous decision by the devs and the last /u/GoodShibe post regarding the future of Dogecoin. I am fairly certain that some of you will be a bit confused by the discussion about deflation and what it means for the future of Dogecoin. After seeing so many helpful posts here, I was thinking about how I could contribute more to the subreddit and provide a service to my fellow shibes. That's why I decided to start a small series about economics to give you at least a glimpse into what economists are actually talking about. Not all of this will be related to currencies, in fact I would like to also talk a lot about the topics that are maybe seen as more peripheral. However, I hope that you will find it interesting and maybe learn a thing or two.

About me:

I'm an economics grad and about to start my PhD thesis. I have a Bachelor in Economics and a Master in Quantitative Economics. I have been able to apply my education in the real world during internships in Geneva at the German embassy, where I helped formulate the German proposal to reform the WHO and at an institute here in Germany where I cowrote a policy paper on behavioral economics as well as cowrote a study on macroeconomic scenarios for a major insurance company. If you are interested, I have produced a few episodes of a podcast on the basics of economics with a friend between my bachelor and master, so if you liked this post you can listen to me blabbering [here](http://econcast.libsyn.com/). Please also excuse my language mistakes and pronunciation, I'm not a native speaker and it was sometimes not that easy to keep the pace easy to listen to :)

___

Enough with the formalities, now on to the good stuff!

Let's talk about money!

Since cryptocurrencies have the currency right in their name, it stands to reason that they are intended to be used as money. A succinct definition of money is the first sentence of the money article on wikipedia: 
___

""Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country-""
___

This is a very broad definition that lacks some important properties, but it is a start. The most important point of this definition is in the words ""generally accepted"". Money as a medium of exchange functions all the better the more people accept your money as payment. This makes intuitive sense. If we had something we intended to use as money, but we were unable to actually exchange this in economic transactions because it were not widely accepted, it would be useless for its intended function. As you can see already, we have hit upon a key factor dogecoin has going for it: It has a high rate of adoption and steady growth in users. This means that more and more people are trying out dogecoin. This also means more and more people are willing to ACCEPT dogecoin, which is even more important than having dogecoin. The exchange of doge for goods and services is what makes dogecoin ""money"".Exchanging dogecoin for USD or any other currency would be using doge as a commodity.

But the definition is still too broad, because there are also other things you can exchange for goods and services, such as labor! Instead, we can look at the second sentence of the definition:

___

The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. Any kind of object or secure verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered money.
___

Now we're getting somewhere! Let's ignore the point about the ""standard of deferred payment"" for now and focus on the first three properties:

* A medium of exchange

This is already contained in the first sentence, but we can try to make it a bit more clear: Money has to be able to be exchanged for anything that has economic value. If you have debt, you pay it back with money, if you want someone to do something for you and he doesn't want to do it for free, you can offer him money in exchange for his service. If you want to acquire something from someone else, you can exchange it for money. 

Money has an intermediary and smoothing function in economic transactions. It allows us to convert our time, labor, electricity, ingenuity, ideas and actions into a commonly used item, which we can then exchange for things we want.

This is extremely important for economies to function! Traditionally, people think that the evolution of markets goes from 

1. Gift economy, an economic system only feasible in tightly knit group where economic exchange is based on reciprocity and the enforcement of adherence to this system by societal pressure.

2. Barter economy, an economic system where goods are directly traded by participants (i.e. a shovel for five sacks of wheat)

3. Monetary economy, an economic system where goods and services are first exchanged to the intermediary form of money, which can then be used to acquire other goods and service.

The problem with the 2nd step, the barter economy is twofold: First, we have a problem called the ""double-coincidence of wants"". This is relatively easy to understand and a tremendous source of friction in this fictional type of economy. Imagine you are a blacksmith: You have just finished an expensive tool, for example an axe. In order to live, however, you need food and you want to trade the axe with the farmer next door for food. The farmer, however doesn't really have a use for an expensive axe and no trade can be made. He suggests, however, that you should ask the lumberjack, he will surely have a need for a fine axe. When you get to the lumberjack, he loves your axe, but all he can trade you for it is wood, which you have no need for. You could of course trade the axe for wood, trade the wood with the carpenter etc. until you can finally trade for food, but the tedium and inconvenience I think has become clear.

Money solves this problem because it serves as a common standard, a channel if you will, through which economic actions can be funneled. This is also why barter economies have never really existed outside of thought experiments, the ""transaction costs"" (I'll talk about these soon!) are just too high.

Which brings us to the second point:

* A unit of account

Money as a unit of account makes immediate sense and we do it all the time. This allows money to actually function as a medium of exchange. Something that is inherently related to this property is what we call ""divisibility"" and ""fungibility"". Divisibility is pretty self-explanatory, but nevertheless important: Money needs to have enough divisibility in order to be used for small as well as large economic transactions. Dogecoin of course has almost infinite divisibility, as there is no diminished use of 1 * 1000 Doge or 100,000* 0.01 Doge. Think about the example beforehand: an axe can't be divided up into smaller parts in order to make multiple small transactions.

Fungibility is a related concept. All units of the money should have the same value. This is why diamonds can't be considered money, because their properties and value differ wildly depending on a host of factors. however, every doge is exactly like any other. 

This means that money as a unit can be used to describe the price of every economic interaction. It can be used like any other unit and it denotes ""value"". Important for this function is that there is some relative stability. This is a key point that will continue to be important for cryptocurrencies, because they are still rarely used as a true unit of account. Instead, they are usually instantly converted to fiat, or prices are set on the current exchange rate for that cryptocurrency.

Doge is starting to move away from this already, in the subreddits /r/dogeservice and /r/dogecoinbusiness, where prices are set in doge. 

Now on to the last point 

*  A store of value

The use as a store of value is incredibly important for the use of money. Money does not only act as an intermediary to alleviate the ""double-coincidence of wants"" in the spacial sense, but also in a temporal sense! Most people have something called a ""time-preference"", which means that we rate things not only in their sense of economic worth and the utility, but also when we will get that utility. Money as a store of value allows us to pool the rewards of multiple transactions so that we may use them in a bigger transaction in the future. This is why perishable things are not very suitable as money, because they are not good at storing value long-term. Storing value in the form of money allows people to invest, and it allows the development of lending money.

This property is there for every cryptocurrency, as long as people are able to exchange it back into fiat. It's also true for other financial assets, such as real estate, commodities, art, precious stones, etc.

As you can already tell, these things are great stores of value, however they lack the other properties of money, instead, they are assets.


Considering these three core properties, where does that leave us? In my opinion, Dogecoin is doing great in the most important category for any cryptocoin: Being a medium of exchange. If we continue to see these high adoption numbers, I believe the future is indeed,

           the moon!

I know these are the very basics, but only if we all understand what makes money money, can we have an informed discussion about things like deflation, inflation, fiat money, intrinsic value, etc."

About 25-35 hours go to a part-time job I need to pay for my living expenses in college, and 15 hours go to an internship I got this semester for a company I have been wanting to work with for a long while. I'm only one month into the internship, and one of my bosses already recommended me to a full-time position that has been recently created in the company. I've been tired, but I'm feeling good.

This past week has been especially stressful, so I was very much looking forward to yesterday, my first non-work day in two weeks. That morning, my best friend invited me to go shopping later in the afternoon. However, there was a miscommunication, and I arrived at the mall earlier than she anticipated and was left waiting for 45 minutes. When I called, she said she was still at home, and I snapped at her for wasting my time on my first free day in weeks. She apologized, but I had trouble holding my temper in check. I didn't completely blow up on her, but I said some choice words I would not have said in hindsight. We didn't hang out yesterday, and I spent all yesterday watching TV and eating snacks alone.

It took me the entire Saturday to calm down, which surprised me. Normally, I have a gentle temperament. I've been complimented by others — including my best friend — for my patience. I exercise regularly, eat relatively healthy, and get solid 8 hours of sleep. I have been fatigued lately though with all the work. 

I'm disappointed with how I let my emotions boil over to my best friend. I texted her a long apology letter last night, explaining my point of view and that regardless how fatigued I am, the way I acted was inexcusable. She hasn't responded yet (I'm letting her take her time). But I want to know I how can avoid these situations in the future.  What measures can I take to de-stress? What would you recommend? "

I work out three-four times a week, I have a decent GPA, internships, close friends, family, and life is looking good. But I know I can do better. At least that what I keep telling myself.

This semester, my earliest classes start at 10:30AM. I told myself I'd wake up early and go to the gym on my way to class. That failed after day two, when I started telling myself I'd just sleep in later, go to the gym in the evening, and go to bed later. Of course I never end up studying at night so that never works. 

Ok, so suppose I go to the gym in the evening. That works, in fact I've been doing that. Great. But as I'm writing this, it's the afternoon and I haven't started studying yet, even though I have two midterms coming right up. I just spent the entire day in my room refreshing /r/videos wondering why there's nothing left to entertain me on the internet. 

Every few days, walking to school, I'll give myself a pep talk. Today's the day! Not like all those other times. This time is *different*. I'll honestly believe myself. Then it starts over.

I'm scared that this endless cycle is just part of who I am. I'm scared that it will just continue on forever and define my life. *Oh yeah him, he spends his days laying around, but still gets things done and seems pretty happy*. 

Sleeping in/oversleeping. I sleep like 9 hours a night - it's gotten to the point where I'll just go to bed early to avoid work, telling myself I'll do it first thing in the morning (future me won't). Procrastination. Constant motivational cycles. Laying around wasting away. I have important books I want to read, I have programming I want to learn, career aspirations, and interesting classes to study. An outsider will think I'm really occupied, which I am during work hours at school (very involved - a friend just the other day asked me how I managed to keep up with everything), but at home, nothing happens. I'll only start working when the deadline is right in from of me.

Alarms across the room, glasses of water in the morning, thinking about future/past me, poor results on exams, pep talks, none of them woke me up figuratively or literally.

How can I get out of this for real, once and for all, and regain control of myself?"

1wubig,2,2014-02-02,Completely overwhelmed by depression and anxiety,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1wubig/completely_overwhelmed_by_depression_and_anxiety/,"
I am a 23-year-old recent graduate, unemployed, living at home and suffering from crippling anxiety/depression. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, but never in my life has it been so debilitating. If it’s worth anything, I have also had a history with disorder eating and self-harm.

Anyway, I graduated from university back in may at the top of my class (4.0 GPA, excellent rapport with all my professors who keep urging me to become a professor myself, completed an 60 paged honors thesis, etc.) with a seemingly useless degree (French literature). I knew my degree wouldn't really qualify me for much in the “real world”, so I made sure to get some work experience under my belt before leaving school (I interned at a major magazine in NYC, worked part time in a restaurant, wrote for the student newspaper, tutored on the side and occasionally worked as a volunteer ESL instructor at an adult school). 

Maybe all of this seems like a lot, but I know I would have been capable of doing so much more had anxiety not impeded me. I took ""safe"" risks that look good on paper and were somewhat within my comfort zone. Despite having many “what if” and “wouldn’t it be cool to” thoughts blooming in my mind, I sheltered myself, engaging only in actives I was 100% sure I could do. If ever there was a question of failure or discomfort, I ran. 

Thanks to this mentality, I avoided many things. Anxiety prevented me from ever living on campus or getting involved with student actives I was interested in or curious about ( improv theatre/comedy troupes, poetry clubs, alternate spring breaks); Ever attending a ""real"" college party;  Ever making friends/ reaching out to people; Ever participating in a full-year abroad (instead I spent the summer abroad because it was “safer”) and taking care of my health (I always told myself that grades were the most important, so I never really put a lot of effort into my anxiety/ eating disorder recovery even though I did seek some help from the university behavioral department when things got particularly difficult).

I realize that I graduated with many successes; however, I have many, many many more regrets than anything else. Currently it seems as if everything I’ve ignored over the years have come back to haunt me with a vengeance ever since I graduated.

For example, in September I attempted to chase my dream of living and working abroad for a few months (in a way it was to see if I could do more than a safe summer abroad). To be fair, the whole situation was a major undertaking considering a) I had never lived away from home longer than the month and a half I studied abroad and b) I took myself off of my medication before leaving because acquiring the medicine while abroad would have been a really messy process. Anyway, I wound up having a complete nervous breakdown when I was there, crying hysterically in my room whenever I got home from work. 
Additionally, the simplicity of transportation (I could basically walk or take a bus/train anywhere I needed to go. This freedom was relatively new for me, since I don't drive here in the USA so it's more difficult to get to the store) made it so I could acquire binge food absolutely anytime I wanted with minimal effort. Needless to say, I wasted a lot of time and money stuffing my face with sugary treats in order to blunt my feelings of fear and inadequacy. I constantly felt disgusting, uncomfortable and desperate.

I remained abroad for about two months before coming home. I had to make up some terrible excuse to my employer, and I know I let a lot of people down. Most days I wonder if I should have just stayed and pushed through the negativity, Everyday the regret of wasting that opportunity and of taking the ""easy"" way out consumes me and I feel like an utter loser. It humiliates me when I have to explain to people why I came home early, and what the next steps in my life are.

Ever since I came home life seems to be in a downward spiral.  I barely leave my room, and binge eat almost every single day. I feel terrified for the future because I have no idea what I want or if I can even hold down a job. I want a job, I want to contribute to society but I feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I want to accomplish, and the thought of picking ""one path"" feels suffocating and sends me into a panic. Aside from sending out a few resumes here and there (the easy part --- its the follow-up and the settling-in that terrifies me), I can't get myself to do any productive during the day due the fear/anxiety of not being able to accomplish it all.

Every day I feel more and more behind my peers. Most days I even feel significantly behind my brother who is a high school sophomore. In many ways, I still feel like the lost high school girl I was years ago, except now much more is demanded of me, and it feels much less acceptable to ask for help when I’m drowning.

Recently a local grocery store hired me for part time help, but after three days my anxiety got so bad I just stopped showing up. I haven't contacted the grocery store and they haven't contacted me. Chances are I won't even go in to collect my check for the three days of work. I was also interviewed for an internship position at a pretty awesome company, but I stopped responding to e-mails once I knew they might actually hire me. I felt like I couldn't handle the pressure, and I backed down to avoid disappointing the company. 

I'm so tired of anxiety ruling my life. I don't want to make decisions based on fear anymore, but sometimes it becomes so unbearable that I can't even imagine acting or reacting in any other way. Panic screams into my ear, and I listen because sometimes it’s the only thing I can hear. The threat feels so real, and I almost gladly hand over my dreams for a false promise of safety. 

My question to you all is how do I fix this? How do I stop myself from becoming a recluse or from being comfortable with running away all the time?

 Do I deal with my anxiety first before tackling other issues (i.e. finding a job)? How do you chase dreams and thrive in a competitive world when you can't even compete with the thoughts racing in your own mind?

I've been scanning the subreddit for a while and seen cold wallets being discussed fairly frequently. Dogecoin has taken over my life as well and I have wanted to be involved in the community in a practical way from day one. My hardwired fear of failure always stops me from really seeing anything through.  I'm sick of getting in my own way, I hate it and I think I need your help to see this through.

I've found a potential plastic card printer in the UK to create a plastic wallet to gift to people or keep as an offline wallet.  I feel like [this card design](http://www.e-plasticcard.co.uk/plastic_card/images/2_part_snap_off_cards.jpg) offers an advantage over a standard dogecoin card. The designs I've seen so far have both the private and public key on the same card, rendering it insecure. My example card design allows for the private key to be printed on the small snap-off card. The private key can then be discarded or stored separately once used, leaving the main card for day to day use.

While I'd love to just charge into this idea headlong, a few personal obstacles stand in my way:

*I have no design experience.  I literally do not possess a creative bone in my body!

*I do not fully understand how to bulk generate keys, private keys and QR codes and how to export them accurately into a share-able format.

*Even if I do work out bulk address generation, how will I get that information to the printers?  Will printing highly individualized cards like this be cost-effective?

*Creation of a fully functional website to handle selling wallets.  I've dipped my toe into Wordpress and built a basic site on there before. I know HTML and web fundamentals. but putting in a payment processor, conditional redirects and handling shipping and queries? It fills me with dread! 

So I'm putting myself out there to the community with my little seed of an idea. 

If someone wants to take it and run with it, super! I've helped in my own little way. 

If you feel like giving me some pointers, smashing! 

If you have the generosity to take me under your wing as an intern and mentor me while you work on this yourself?...well shit, I'd love you forever.

So there you go. What do you think? any advice will be well received.

I'm new to this and read the rules, but if any of this is wrong, I apologize in advance. 

I submitted my federal refund on TurboTax, and then I was notified that the IRS had received it. Meanwhile, I got another W2 from an internship (it was a busy year and I forgot). So I went online to fix it, but my return (and my status on wheresmyrefund.irs.gov) is only reflecting the original form I submitted. I really don't want to have to mail off my taxes if possible and TurboTax hasn't been able to give me an answer. From what I gather, you can update the changes but have to wait for the IRS to reject your form (which I presume they will do since it didn't reflect all my employment) and then resubmit-hopefully online again without having to pay an additional fee. 

Any ideas on how to fix this? Thank you in advance. "

1wut34,3,2014-02-02,[23F] Not sure where things are going with my ex[24M] from 4 years ago,yaweighyoself2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wut34/23f_not_sure_where_things_are_going_with_my_ex24m/,"Hey all. I dated this guy my sophomore year of college for about eight months, and while it was my shortest relationship so far, it was probably my most serious in terms of long-term vision. Being 19-20, neither of us were experts at relationships (we drank and fought a fair bit, I crossed some emotional boundaries with a friend who was pursuing me, I was uncomfortable with him mentioning kids/marriage, etc).

We had a really awful breakup at the end of it all that left me a bit of an emotional wreck. We didn't talk for over 3 years - total blocking on all platforms, avoiding or ignoring each other at events with mutual friends, the whole shebang. Since then, I've had a serious relationship with one of his close friends; he dated a girl he met abroad long-distance for over a year and had quite a few flings. We both became relatively accomplished in our related fields but never interacted, and I never expected to speak to him again.

Fast forward to November. We now attend grad school 200ish miles apart. I have many friends in his current city, intern with an agency there, visit relatively often, and am moving there after graduate school (~1 year away). I drove up for a mutual friend's birthday party and he happened to show up. He told my friend he needed a few more drinks to talk to me. Friend is dickishly giggling about playing matchmaker, so of course he passes on the message. As you might expect, my ex and I eventually break 3 years of silence and I wake up in his apartment the next morning.

Turns out he's been seriously struggling with depression for years. Some aspects of our breakup seem related to its initial manifestation. Since then, we've texted constantly. I've visited twice. Last time I left (2 weeks ago), we hammered out specific issues that might prevent us from having a successful round two relationship and agreed on a roadmap for working on them. I'm a bit apprehensive about getting involved with someone who is depressed; he's concerned that I would have issues with the number of women he's been with since we first dated (not true, really, though he's friendly with all of his exes which I do find a bit strange); he doesn't think he's ""smart enough or good enough for me"" (which I adamantly disagree with). 

We've talked about all the above - don't worry - and have agreed to take the wait-and-see approach. He's said that his plan is to keep on talking often, see each other once or twice a month, and to wait and see if he falls in love with me again. That sounds good to me, and I know that's how building relationships normally goes. He also doesn't want to shut down all other options while we're figuring this stuff out. That's totally understandable given our distance and uncertainty and makes logical sense to me; however, I'm reluctant to invest time in visiting him if he's considering other people. I know I'll have to get over that if this is going to grow, so I'm working on it.

Reddit, I have the feels for this dude. He's attractive and smart and hardworking, his family provides what mine lacks, he'd be a great dad, we want similar things in life, he is goofy and irreverent, and we'd make a crazy power couple. I know he's a little bonkers but I think I'd be good for him. I know he likes me, but I'm fucking terrified to let my feels grow after getting so hurt last time. I know he's also scared of that. So, questions: 1) Does this have any potential whatsoever? 2) Are there any blatant red flags that I'm not seeing or acknowledging? 3) If not, how do I chill the fuck out and let this thing run its course without sabotaging it out of fear and trepidation?

1wv4p2,18,2014-02-02,Me [22 F] and my husband [26 M] are newlyweds struggling with the money and my husband's irresponsible behavior and defensive attitude when I address our money issues is really pissing me off. How do communicate my feelings in a non-hurtful way?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wv4p2/me_22_f_and_my_husband_26_m_are_newlyweds/,"My husband and I have been married for nearly six months, but we’ve known each other since we were children and we dated for five years before getting married.  Like most newlywed couples, we’ve been trying to work out a balance and partnership that plays off of our strengths and weaknesses.  Unfortunately, my husband’s major weakness is in being responsible – namely with money.  I’m not saying he spends recklessly or gambles, but he doesn’t plan ahead any farther than a week with money.  If he has it, then he uses it and if not, then he struggles.

Life has been dealing both of us some harsh blows and I’ve tried my best to stand by him as his wife and support him through it.  We discovered last year that he is getting deployed to Afghanistan.  Then he moved away temporarily because the job prospects were better back in our home town than in the town I live in (I am finishing college).   But the job he got was only paying him slightly above minimum wage ($8/hour).   He was living with his brother and paying rent for the apartment we leased (we split the rent).  However, that was up until this October when the shit hit the fan.  My husband’s car broke down and his sister stole his mother’s debit card and essentially cleaned her bank account out and my husband gave his mom money to get by until her next paycheck.  

I, however, was left stranded without any of my husband’s income for two months because he couldn’t pay his share of rent.  I managed to pay nearly $1250 over two months while going to school and working two part-time jobs.  He offered to pay me back the next month but I refused because he didn’t have enough money to pay me the full amount and him paying me back would’ve bankrupted him and left him unable to pay the next month’s rent anyways.  (I.E. thinking more than a week ahead with money).

That next month (December), I came home for Christmas and my husband was ready to move back in with me since he is leaving again in about two months for Afghanistan.  I kept telling him to plan ahead with his money and start saving now because we have rent to pay and I no longer have nearly as many hours because I am Student Teaching until June and Student Teaching is an unpaid internship.

Well, surprise su-fucking-prise that now it is February and the rent isn’t paid.  My husband’s earnings from his temp job back here and my meager earnings from the time that I CAN get paid to work pay our internet, utilities, my credit card – from paying for his car repair back in September – and a small amount of groceries.  Nevertheless, we owe $540 by the 5th.  Now he’s stranded back in our hometown until tomorrow (hopefully not longer) because he has no money for gas.

I am so upset with him and yet every time I broach the subject with him he says that I’m being condescending and he quits talking about it.  If I’m being condescending it’s because I relied on him to do one simple thing (save money over December since I couldn’t) and he failed me.

Now I’m left to pick up the pieces like I always do.  I’m not saying we are anywhere close to calling our relationship “quits” but I am at my wits end and I don’t know what to do.  All the talks I’ve tried in the past don’t seem to work.  I’m not getting through to my husband and I’m tired of being treated as an afterthought when all of my energy and free time is spent figuring out ways for us to not get evicted!

angry tl:dr: Newlywed husband's life shits on him and instead of wiping the shit off and overcoming obstacles he sits in the shit and makes shit castles.

real tl:dr: Newlywed husband's irresponsible behavior and lack of planning about money are causing issues with our relationship."

1wv6ny,2,2014-02-02,Resume/career advice requested,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1wv6ny/resumecareer_advice_requested/,"Hey guys, just a little background: I originally wanted to go to graduate school in ML, but for now, decided against it. This resulted in a lack of an internship that I might normally acquire if I intended to go into software development (instead I did research). So I feel a bit lacking there, and I’m a bit unsure how to make myself stand out since I also lack a comparable history of code that an internship might provide.

In any case, since I already graduated it seems I’m unlikely to be able to get an internship and should just apply normally. As someone with a little wider variety of background then a normal CS major, I’m not sure what jobs specifically I should be targeting other than a regular software development job, and in that case how I should tailor my resume. Machine learning/big data/etc. interests me still but often require advanced degrees or monumental previous experience, both of which I lack.

Here is the resume:

1wvb1q,1,2014-02-03,I [23F] was cheated on by SO [22M] and I want to forgive him completely but am hung up.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wvb1q/i_23f_was_cheated_on_by_so_22m_and_i_want_to/,"This isn't a throwaway because I don't care who sees this. Last weekend the guy I've been dating for roughly a year now slept with a freshly minted 18-year-old his roommates know. He came over and we had sex and everything was normal on Sunday, but on Monday he calls me at 12:30 in the morning and comes over crying his eyes out and tells me he's done something horrible, keeps me up all night talking about it.

Then, because I've never been the sort to tell people how I feel or opine in general, he gets mad at me because he wants to stay with me and can't figure out if I hate or love him. He refuses to have a serious conversation with me in person because he has ADHD and gets derailed too easily if we talk in person... or something. So we hash it out over Facebook, I don't sleep much of the week, I end up going to on-campus psych and counselling and talking to them (after my roommate came home to find me naked, blackout drunk, and having a panic/crying attack under my bed after he apparently came over and tried to talk to me and then left, which I don't remember). They've set me an appointment for this Wednesday.

After talking about the whole situation with friends, some of them concluded that he probably cheated because I was too emotionally unavailable. However, I don't feel like he was any more available than I was; we barely saw/see each other more than once a week despite having been together for so long. Any time he asked me to do something, I generally would, though the reverse was not true (in fact, any time I asked him to do anything and we weren't on break from university, he was invariably far too busy). He thinks moving in together could fix the not-seeing-each-other part. His argument for why he never sees me is engineering homework, but I have the same amoutn or more (of also engineering) homework he does, and we work roughly the same number of hours per week... I think the honest truth is he'd rather spend time with other people. Which, I get it, you don't have to spend every moment with your SO, and that's why I didn't press the issue til he asked me if anything was bothering me when we started talking in-depth about stuff this week.

I asked him at one point how he'd feel if I had cheated on him, and his response was something along the lines of ""it would have been about time, everyone else I've ever dated has cheated on me."" Well, having only been in a couple *exclusive* relationships, and mostly having only had casual sex, me even deciding to be exclusive with him at all was kind of a big deal. He had to know it was; back when we first talked about going exclusive, right around that time he'd found a pair of panties in his room while moving and asked if they were mine, but they weren't, and he knew how upset I was just by that. 

Further, pretty much the entire time we've been dating he keeps asking me about having a threesome with a mutual friend, despite us talking and laying out that if anyone else is to be included in our sex life, strictly no friends or coworkers allowed. I'm not attracted to this mutual friend, despite having made out with her once while drunk when I first met her. The girl he slept with is over at his and his roommates' apt all the time, and I'm not sure if she's just there to hang out with his roommates. 

He's met my parents, and most of my best friends. He flew out to California to help me drive my car back to our university from my summer internship. Yet I've never met anyone he's related to, or anyone he's friends with besides roommates, plus the offer to go see someone when he knew I wouldn't be able to make it due to a prior committment to my family.

I want to keep dating him because he's funny, generally kind, and sweet, and we share a lot of interests. I'm just not sure if, even given a week of open conversation, overcoming the emotional and sexual disconnect is entirely possible. Yet he has said he wants to stay with me.

My roommates have banned him from the apartment for at least three weeks given that last he was here I ended up blackout drunk under my bed, and I don't really feel like spending the night in his (twin) bed, so basically he's not getting laid until March. Is there any reason I should give him the benefit of the doubt until he's allowed back in my apartment, to see what he does? He's apologized for sleeping with her, but that's all.

Edit: I should like to add that I am by no means clean-linen innocent; I've done plenty of equally bad things in the few relationships I've had, which also factors into my reluctance to pass negative judgement. 

Though most of my friends disliked him from the start, his friends for some reason kept saying we were perfect for each other, which makes me wonder how much he's fucked up in previous relationships, and how much they might want him to not be weeping over girls all the bloody time.

---   
**tl;dr**: Having major misgivings about relationship, then boy cheats on me. Wat do? Am I being an unreasonable, crazy bitch? I'm just so confused and generally hurt. I'm 99% sure I love him, but I'm seriously surprised by the ""I'm emotionally unavailable"" thing."

1wvm6b,14,2014-02-03,I'm engaged to a man who I've been with for 7 years... just now admitting to myself who I really am,[deleted],actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1wvm6b/im_engaged_to_a_man_who_ive_been_with_for_7_years/,"I don't know who to talk to about this. I feel incredibly fragile and frankly, terrified right now, so I would like to ask that if you have criticisms, to keep them to yourselves- I have too much of that going on in my own head. I am severely depressed (not suicidal at the moment, but I do have support for that if it does come up again), and I feel completely alone. I don't know how to make this story short, but I'll give it my best try.

I've been in a relationship with a man for 7 years (engaged for 4, planning on getting married in 1-2 years). He basically rescued me from my dysfunctional family, from whom I am essentially estranged now, and has been supporting me as I have struggled to complete school (Bachelor's in 2008; changing fields and graduating with MA this fall), all while struggling with a shitload of mental health issues. (I'm 29 now, FYI). I have been unable to hold down a job because of these issues, and I am most certainly eligible for disability, if I wanted to go down that road, but that hasn't been necessary, as he has been supporting me financially throughout this entire time. I'm getting better, more rapidly, in the last few months in particular, and hoping to be functional enough to land an internship this fall, and re-enter the workforce next spring, after graduating. I am completely dependent on him. I have *nobody* else on whom I can depend.


He's a wonderful guy. He doesn't hold this over my head- there's no power plays or manipulation going on. He genuinely wants to see me get better (recovering from extensive, severe childhood trauma, an eating disorder, and a lot of other shit which I will disclose if asked). The progress I have made in personal growth over the last few months has included getting in touch with my authentic self. For at least 6 years, I've 'hidden' under the label of bi-sexual, because being a lesbian has not been an option. I am that dependent on him. He knows I'm ""bi-sexual"", and doesn't seem to care, but we are monogamous, and he doesn't believe that any other type of relationship would work or last. For the last 2 years, he has been unable to perform, which has left me sexually frustrated. I mean, I'm not attracted to him in that way, but my body responds to certain sensations, and it feels good. For me, it's the emotional intimacy with him that I miss the most. Our relationship is completely devoid of any type of sexual interaction. He has lost interest. (He is 20 years older, btw). He is seeing a therapist now, but hates talking about it. He can't get on any meds to help him because he has a rather serious heart condition.

All that aside, we're basically just best friends with a deeper level of emotional intimacy, and lots of cuddling. I like that. I love him to death. But now that I've grown to where I am today, I can't stifle my true sexual orientation or repress it any longer. I'm a lesbian, and I hate myself for it. I feel like a complete scumbag. I can't stop thinking about it. I used to be able to just shut those thoughts down, and avoid anything that would bring up feelings I could not act on. It tears me up inside to see a lesbian couple, or to get on a lesbian website... it just hurts so bad to see what I want, who I know I truly am, and know I can't be that. I feel like a traitor. This man has given me everything- and I'm not just talking financial support. He has been there for me through everything, and is always available for me. I am the world to him. And we just started talking about building our 'dream house' on some land he owns- which is the last step before marriage. I feel like a piece of shit hypocrite. 

I have no idea what to do. I've been talking with my therapist about it more, lately, and she's going to try to find some more resources for me, particularly from some of her colleagues who are gay or lesbian. In the meantime, what the hell do I do with this? Now I know why I suppressed this for so long- it hurts like hell, knowing who I really am, and yearning to express that openly, and not being able to. 

I love him and I don't want to leave him, and I don't want to break his heart or abandon the plans we've made together for the future. But I need to be with a woman. That is where I belong. That is being true to myself. I don't know what my options are. I just know that right now, at least until I can support myself financially, I can't do anything about it. I certainly can't talk to him about it. I'm in a very bad place, emotionally, because of this. I almost broke my cutting sobriety streak tonight because of this. I have been crying all day. I can't 'turn off' the self-hatred because I truly believe it is justified and legitimate. I can't fucking sleep, or eat, or think, or do anything.

Thanks for reading, and for any feedback or whatnot you may be able to provide."
1wvr8f,2,2014-02-03,Is learning Android a good step to becoming an employable Java 'allrounder'?,Yayzan,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1wvr8f/is_learning_android_a_good_step_to_becoming_an/,"I'm 1 1/2 months into my journey of becoming a software developer. I have another 7 months ahead of me, 6 of them unemployed to become proficient enough at Java to find an internship. As a side note, if you're interested in what I'm doing, I have a blog at http://repogrammingmylife.blogspot.de/.

My initial intermediate goal was to create an android app as a nice reference I could show future employers. I now have the bare basic java tools under my belt and the groundwork for the app is layed out as a functioning, text based Java program. But as I started delving into android yesterday, I realized that learning it might take up a rather large chunk of my limited time. 

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to learn android,  I am just questioning the benefit of Android for my employability as an intern. For example, the two companies I have scoped out for an internship have nothing to do with android development. But perhaps android is a skill that companies value either way or perhaps learning android will teach me lots of things applicable to non-android stuff.

So, would learning android be beneficial at this point, or should I focus soley on Java and learn things like swing, design pattern, networks, etc."

I wanted to share my story. I am 24, Married, Employed, College educated and currently living my dream. I tried to format the bullet points so you can read what you want to, and get the jist of what you don't want to read - so that's how I'll format it. 

* **Diagnosed in the 7th grade** after failing to do any research for a research paper (National History Day)


* **Cringeworthy Middleschool/ Highschool** experience - no serious female attention and a host of embarrassing social outbursts. ( I think you know what I mean) Never learned how to study. 


* **College**. Began college not even wanting to, but knew it had to be done. I am good at knowing what needs to be done, but just not having the motivation to do it. Was on 55mg Concerta.


* **Dropped out of Engineering** after my third time around Calc 1. Switched to Business. 


* **Stopped taking concerta by my own will**. Junior Year I found it affected the way I acted toward my wife (then girlfriend) after school/work during my ""coming-down"" phase. Grades were affected, but I generally liked the way I wasn't a huge dick off the meds.


* **Junior / Senior year I began working on myself med-free**. J/S year was myriad of late bills and assignments while I began working on myself med-free. Living with engineering roommates (Archetypal, for sure) helped me gain essential life-management skills. New opportunities at my foodservice management job gave me a proper work ethic and responsibility.  Eventually, bills and assignments began coming in on time. 


* **Found a paid internship** with graduation looming. Picked up meds again to help performance in the office. 15mg adderall. Generally did well in the workplace.


* **Got Married**. This one was huge for me. I now had someone depending on me. This was the biggest catalyst in the next phase of my change. 


* **Side Jobs kept me sharp** - I DJ'd, set up local projects, and began a web business to keep me interested in something new. Whenever I've been working on something for more than a year or two, I get bored and motivation and performance drop. 


* **Full time employment**. April 2013 I accepted my first job with same company. New tasks, new location - plenty to keep my brain stimulated. More responsibility meant more motivation to succeed. I found myself excelling at work. 


* **Wife's Depression**. This one is also huge. My wife struggles with depression, and upon moving to a new location, would have very bad episodes. I had to handle many of the day-to-day runnings of the house; cooking, cleaning, bills, earning money. My wife had a few jobs, but it was very hard for us. Again, responsibility bred motivation for me. The relationship with my wife began to break down because of this, however. I got too big-headed and would resent her for not doing anything around the house, which in turn made both of us feel like she was not worth my time. This has been very devastating to our relationship, and we're still working through this. 



* **Job Transfer**. I then moved from the United States to the UK. I had always wanted to live here, so it's a dream come true. I now keep stimulated with travel, new experiences and photography (I stand by the fact that I am not, and never will be, a photograph*er*). The new pay also has sparked an interest in financial well-being. I am paying down loans ahead of time, keeping a zero balance on credit cards, and even thinking of *doing a budget*. 

I'll be around the next few hours if you want to ask questions. There's so much more to tell, but I hate reading blocktext as much as the next person on this sub, so I'll reply to comments.

Very stressed out about this.,unhappy_confused,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1wvxex/depressed_or_internet_addicted_or_something_else/,"I am a 23yr old guy who has been living in the UK since 2007. I came here for university and spent the majority of my time here.After a bad fallout with a girl that I was seeing in my 'friends' circle and getting very isolated in my second year, I went down the dumps. But I think with the help of some coping mechanisms like reading a lot on the internet, videogames,music, etc., I felt I survived. I made a few good friends that year and afterward did a year long internship with a big american company here in the UK. Having not enjoyed the emptiness of the daily 9-5 and the corporate environment and feeling lonely all this while, I realized that I couldnt do this for the rest of my life.Unfortunately as an international student, I had already invested a lot of money and couldnt turn back. While talking to my parents hoping to get some direction or supports, I would get a standard reply saying ""but everyone has to do this. This is life"". Feeling  unsupported and that changing course would be an expensive option I continued on with my final year. Instead of studying intensively and focussing on my project,  I was feeling low, very lonely even though I had lots of friends and attended many parties and social gatherings and was spending a lot of time reading on the internet about alternative economics, environmental issues, society and women. I did it to such an extent that I hardly spent any time on my project and as a result my supervisor warned me that I wouldnt even pass. weeks before the deadline, I found myself very very stressed, thinking about how if I failed I would let my parents down. But somehow with some help from others I managed to submit it. I managed to score a good mark on my project and degree but felt my confidence SAPPED! I figured I wasn't interested in my degree enough to make a career out of it. I clearly remember not enjoying my graduation and feeling quite negative and ill about it in the morning about it. Soon after I again started spending a lot of time on the internet reading not to the extent of avoiding social contact but definitely productivity to the extent that I almost forgot to extend my visa if it hadnt been for my mum reminding me! To this day she is shocked that I forgot. I then moved out to another house in the same city with my friends that I was living with in the summer. All that year I again spent a lot of time on the internet, had 2 brief relationships, some good parties but zero productivity. I was living off my parents feeling regret but soon forgetting about it,  till the next month arrived to pay rent. I landed a part time job with very variable hours so couldnt properly sustain myself. Then when summer arrived I didnt have enough money to travel Europe,which I had always wanted to, and felt bad. But did manage to attend some once in a lifetime gigs that I really wanted to. After summer ended some of my friends left for work and uni whereas I stuck around in the same house but this time with a different set of housemates. All this while I was still reading quite a lot(on the internet) and felt as if I wasnt getting enough stimulation. I was slowly developing the feeling that I should be away from the computer yet couldnt quite manage to effectively do so. Thinking something was very wrong I started exploring depression and diagnosing myself. Then I approached my GP who referred me on to mental health services who classified me as a mild case and referred me on to external counselling services. I feel that it helped me a bit but my productivity is still not good enough.I was recently prescibed a low dose of antidepressant but havent taken it as I am very skeptical and fearful of them. I know that I need to do many daily and big life related things but the mere thought of them makes me feel tired and not wanting to bother to do them.I find myself pushing myself mentally to do them and then wondering why that barrier exists at all. I also have conflicting feelings regarding spending my time. for eg., I feel like going out but also feel that I havent  done the things i need to do. I then think that i can do them later but dont end up doing them and feeling bad about it.
I soon found myself with only a few months remaining on my visa without a direction as to what to do and only a temporary 30 hours per week job that ended the following week. I also needed to find a new place in 2 weeks.  At the time I was really stresed but thanks to a friend I was able to find a place in a beautiful house with a nice family that made me dinner and I had no chores. During that time, I found that my productivity was still very low. I often had things to do like apply for jobs, fix the bike etc but said to myself ""na its not that important"" and then soon swayed over towards the internet. Anyway I wasnt able to find a job in the remaining months and had to return to my home country. Now here I am living with my parents and again find myself spending the same hours on the internet as before, reading or watching videos on the same topics as before. Everytime I sit down to apply for work I end up after a while going back to the internet to distract myself and then feeling bad about it. The days seem to go by without any decent results. And I am not sure what's really wrong. What do you people think? Any advice would be much appreciated :)"
1wvy2z,7,2014-02-03,Two months left in a ten month internship - what should I be doing?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1wvy2z/two_months_left_in_a_ten_month_internship_what/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

As the title states I am coming to the close of a ten month internship at Intel. I have connected with many of the engineers and other employees that I have worked closely with on LinkedIn. This amounts to 20 people in a 150-200 person engineering organization.

Currently, my interactions with other engineers outside of my ~7 person team are limited. What should I be doing to make sure people, outside of my current team, remember me when I apply for full time a few years down the road?

**tl;dr**: took two quarters of university off to extend a software engineering internship at Intel. What should I do to make a lasting impression during my last two months?"
1wwcqc,1,2014-02-03,I have a webdev software internship interview coming up... What should I expect?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1wwcqc/i_have_a_webdev_software_internship_interview/,"So I have my first interview as a programmer on Thursday and I have no idea what to expect.

Internships are supposed to be learning experiences, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be good enough to make the cut. I have been at this for only 6 months hardcore but I've been doing it casually for over a year. My code is messy, I have a lot of bad habits and I don't understand 90% of the stuff people are saying on Reddit / StackOverflow. In my cover letter, I stated that I excel in PHP and JavaScript/jQuery UI's. But I was exaggerating... by a lot. I'm studying right now and I realized that I don't know as much as I thought. I only know DOM's. Until now, I didn't even know what AJAX was. But now I'm studying like crazy so I don't mess up. I truly am mediocre. I hope they're able to work with me because I'm thirsty to learn more but I think they'll just throw me out when they realize that I'm not that good. Better yet even hire me.

I asked him what I should bring and he said nothing. He only wants 30-45 minutes of my time. That makes me think of all the things they could ask me / make me do in that time. This is the biggest interview I've ever had.

They stated that they're looking for somebody who can do:
HTML5/CSS3
JavaScript
PHP

I can do those things, technically and can make a semi-functioning website... It's just that I don't know how well I can do it. I looked at the company github page and the stuff that they were making were just absolutely ridiculous... Am I not at that level or am I just going to learn a lot which is perfectly okay?

What kind of questions have you guys gotten on your low level interviews? "

In the days once the horrific automotive crash that took Paul Walker's life on Gregorian calendar month. 30, several tributes were paid to the handsome 40-year-old actor best acknowledged for his hush-hush protector within the ""Fast &amp;amp; Furious"" movies. He was a good dada to his teenaged female offspring. He was given to generous acts of charity, once in secret buying an expensive band for associate Asian nation war vet and his fiancée. He was a capable action hero, and his likability issue onscreen and off was through the roof. What you did not hear, however, was a lot of effusive praise of his acting talent.

That may modification once ""Hours,"" the primary of his 2 finished movies, arrives in theaters and on VOD this weekend. Set during a point of entry hospital throughout the aftermath of cyclone Katrina, the adventure story is not good, the budget deficiencies square measure apparent, and Walker is just about forced to hold the complete weight of the drama on his well-muscled shoulders.

That's not stunning, considering he's the sole recognizable solid member, and his main co-star winds up being a baby. what's sudden is however well he realizes what's basically a one-person show.

Once the story gets going once a rather clumsy and long gap, film writer Eric Heisserer (""Final Destination 5""), in his directional debut, permits Walker lots of space to quite rise to the occasion. The film winds up being a rather ingenious survival tale crossed with a tension-ratcheting gimmick—somewhat such as ""Speed""'s bomb-on-a bus scenario—that makes each ticking minute count.

First, however, we tend to should with patience learn all the small print of things. after we initial meet his character Nolan Hayes, his pregnant spouse Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez) has gone into labor 5 weeks early. Nolan rushes her to the hospital even as the historic storm starts production. The tragic news that his spouse has died leaves Nolan a lot of numb than tearful, however a minimum of their female offspring is alive. However, a doctor explains the newborn should be fed through associate IV and placed during a ventilator, remaining there for a minimum of forty eight hours.

However, once Katrina unleashes her wrath and therefore the flood waters speedily rise (clips of actual newscasts keep US up to date), the hospital is forced to evacuate. That leaves Nolan and his kid on their own since the ventilator cannot be affected. Then the facility cuts out, the back-up generator fails and Walker's character spends the remainder of the film cranking A battery which will solely be recharged for some minutes at a time.

Much like Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity"" or thespian in ""Cast Away,"" Walker's Nolan finds astonishingly partaking if compelling ways that to pass the time. He speaks to his silent female offspring, telling her concerning her mother whereas coitus interruptus photos and different souvenirs—including her engagement and wedding rings, started out during a rush before going into the delivery room—and putting them atop the ventilator. He hunts down refill baggage for the IV drip, changes a diaper for the primary time, seeks out a sender once cell service goes out, remembers however he and

1wwi45,0,2014-02-03,Professional 25/F Quitting Marijuana after 8 years of heavy use,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1wwi45/professional_25f_quitting_marijuana_after_8_years/,"As a heavy marijuana user for the past 8 years of my life, IT IS possible to kick your smoking addiction even if you rely on getting high every couple hours to get through the day.  I should know, I use to wake and bake, go to school/work, get high on my lunch break, and then come home and smoke at least 3 more bowls.  Once I was home, I would load bowls for myself until I passed out in front of the TV.  I was smoking about 1g a day, and was spending all my money at the dispensary or streets (whichever connect came through first).  For a while, everything was great- I was a college student with a job and I had a low overhead so I spent all my money buying weed.  I didn't care because it was the only thing I felt worth spending my money on.  

I resumed this pattern of life post college- and continued smoking pot in graduate school.  I told myself I would quit once I found an internship but I actually smoked even more due to stress.  Last year, I graduated with my Master's degree and realized it is time for a life change.

My family is against smoking so it was a secret I kept from them.  My friends are all stoners so it was easy to keep getting high with them.  However, soon I found myself dipping low in money because I was in between graduation and finding a full time career.  Even with only a few dollars in my bank account, I still bought weed.  I began to feel guilty and started resenting myself for the behaviors I cannot control.

By this point, I was convinced getting high is part of me.  I felt I couldn't stop because it was all I had.  As my anxiety about graduation and finding a job grew, so did my appetite for pot.  I started buying cannabis in ounces just to make sure my jar was always full.  I would feel panic attacks whenever my jar was getting low.  

This anxious/self-punishing behavior went on for many more months before I realized I was becoming a piece of crap.  I didn't like my messy appearance and wasn't happy with myself anymore.  It took me 8 years to realize what the effects of marijuana had done to me.  BUT I still loved getting high (especially alone in my house) and struggled a lot.

I attempted to ""quit"" on my own.  It was a total lie.  I would pretend if I only smoked 2 bowls in the morning, I was ""decreasing"" my amount.  However by mid afternoon, I would be so anxious that I ended up smoking again.  Night time was the worse- I cannot be alone with my thoughts and felt I needed cannabis to control my emotions.  Every time I thought/felt/experienced any kind of stress or anxiety I would pack myself a bowl.  Nothing mattered... as long as there was weed I was okay and it was all I cared about.

One day as I was discussing my future with my BF I realized... wow I didn't have a future.  He was making great income and I was behind because I couldn't piss clean to qualify for an actual job.  It hurt to think about the future I was giving up on.  I realized I could keep smoking weed and find a shitty part-time job, OR I could face reality and accept the fact I needed to quit to get hired.  

The funny part is my degrees are both in the medical field.  I have extensive training in substance abuse, neurological biology, THC metabolic pathways, and know all about treatment and recovery.  It was easy to advise another person- yet I couldn't help myself.  

I finally made the difficult decision to allow this cannabis jar to run out and I would not buy anymore.  Every day as I watched the amount dwindle, I would feel anxious.  I had questions like ""What am I gonna do?  How do I pass time?  WTF this hour has been going on forever! I just need a hit"".  

Then one day it happened- my jar was empty.  I woke up and stared at the jar.  Then I did something bad- I began scraping for keif first and then resin.  The resin balls were disgusting, and I used a paperclip to dig around the insides of my bowl piece.  I would pull out the resin and then roll it in a ball to put in my bowl and light it.  The taste was nasty but I was living for that ""little bit"" of highness.  I probably pulled out more resin that week than I ever have in my life.  

I felt embarrassed about it and lied to others that I had already quit.  It was easier that way... to pretend I stopped getting high by saying resin isn't weed.  Then the resin ran out and I completely stopped.

I thought about smoking every 15 minutes, every single day and night.  All I wanted was a hit.  The first night without pot, I was angry and then I started crying.  I never felt so worthless about myself.. here I was a grown, professional woman crying because I can't get high.  The first night was hell- I probably slept less than 2 hours.  I threw up, had a headache, and just moped around the living room.  I had no appetite.  I couldn't shut off my brain from its cravings.

At around 3am, I secretly got up and started scraping for resin again!  I found a little piece, smoked it and finally slept.  I felt so dirty because I lied to myself.  Still, I kept telling my friends that I had already quit.  The next day would be a new day, I lied again.

After 3 unsuccessful attempts to not look for resin at night, I managed to break the paper clip because I was scraping so hard.  As the paper clip snapped in half, so did my drive for marijuana.  It finally registered in my head- NO more means NO more.  I put my bong, grinder, and lighters away.

I started up my dusty treadmill and got on a low speed.  I had a new plan- to exercise every time I had a craving.  Exercising and drinking water has been the biggest help to my recovery.  Every time my brain got stuck on thinking ""I need to smoke... just one..."" I would force myself to run.  The harder I craved it, the faster I would run.  The idea was to knock myself out of breath so I'm distracted trying to breathe.  

Of course I still thought about weed.  All my friends still smoke around me so it has been tough making that personal decision for myself.  The first week was the hardest- it was all about thought control and self management.  I kept telling myself that I'm a piece of shit if I can't control my own behaviors.  This makes me no different than a baboon and the difference between humans and animals is that we have critical thinking skills.  I was on a mission to prove to myself that I can be human.

Now that I have been THC-free for a while, I can honestly say marijuana is harmless.  I look back and realize all those times I could have cut down on smoking but chose not to.  I feel EXACTLY the same as a person. I can say marijuana does not change you for the worse as a person- one must learn to harness the power of it.  If used moderately, it is an excellent sleeping/anti-anxiety aid.  However, if you start abusing it and smoke 1g a day, you will find yourself out of luck.  

I'm not ready to start smoking again (yet)- but I want to say taking a marijuana break is a good decision for anyone who is looking for a different perspective of life.  I am excited I had a tolerance break so when I do get high again, I will be 10x higher.  After 8 years, it is time to give it up - for a while.

As a former, heavy daily marijuana user- I want to say I am still in support of marijuana for its medicinal purposes.  If given the option in the future, I pick cannabis over any kind of prescription pills -anyday.  One thing I would do differently is to NOT wake and bake and only smoke in the afternoon-evenings.  I find it helpful to be ""sober"" during day time in order to get shit done at home and at work.  Good luck to anyone who is trying to quit, it's hard but it's definitely possible.

1wwmds,626,2014-02-03,"I just got an abortion, and I feel fine.",garbagemonster,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1wwmds/i_just_got_an_abortion_and_i_feel_fine/,"I know that before my abortion, I was super nervous and it helped me a lot to read the stories of the experiences of girls like me. I am 20 years old, I'm in college. I was on the pill. I had the complete support of my boyfriend, roommate, and my mother.

**When I found out:** I took a pregnancy test at home and the up and down line was very dark, but the other lines were fainter and my roommate and my boyfriend kept trying to convince me that it was probably inconclusive. I knew better. This was on a Friday night, so the following Monday I went to the health center at my college and they confirmed what I already knew. I was pregnant. 

**Finding a clinic:** My next step was to find the right clinic. Believe it or not I used Yelp a lot to make sure I was going to find a place that would feel safe and welcoming. I called many clinics to ask for a quote on the surgical procedure, and I was sure to make sure I asked if they offered sedation and how much more it would cost. All of the clinics wanted to know how much I made per month, and I was very honest about it, but honestly they won't ask for confirmation on your income, so I really could have said a couple hundred dollars less. Hindsight 20/ 20 right? I ended up choosing Women's Health Specialist's. They have locations all over Northern California. The cost was 400 for the procedure and 100 for the sedation, so it was 500 all together. I made the appointment over the phone, but plan to take the day off as you get whatever time they have available, and you'll be nervous beforehand and sleepy after.

**The first leg of my journey:** My roommate agreed to take me, as my boyfriend had to be at an internship the morning of my procedure. The trip there was a little more adventurous than I had planned. My roommate's car is a complete shit box. It has no windshield wipers and the drivers side window is completely missing. The passengers window doesn't roll down at all and the heater as well as the radio are both completely non functional. We had to drive over the ""pass"" through snowy mountains, and the car was freezing cold. We were both wrapped in in our winters warmest, and had blankets piled on our laps. It wasn't raining or snowing so we could see fine out the windshield.... until we got too close to the car in front of us and wet mud slush was sprayed over the entire window. We couldn't see anything so my roommate stuck her head out the window to navigate and I tried the best I could to guide her with what little vision I had out of my window. We were trying to get off at the next exit, and we ran straight into the sign indicating which exit it was. The wheels locked up when she tried to brake and ice didn't help the matter. I could barely see the sign in front of my side of the window and we crashed right into it. My door wouldn't open so we both climbed out the drivers side. The snow was stained with bright green coolant and part of the front right side of the car was dragging on the ground. Despite the damages we got out of there quickly, got off at the exit, and pulled to the side to deal with the damages. I called the clinic immediately to tell them I just got in a car accident and that I was probably going to be a little bit late. They were perfectly okay with it (probably because the wait time at the clinic ended up being 4 1/2 hours in total). My roommate desperately looked around the car for something to clear the window and only turned up some paper towels that smeared the mud around. Finally we were able to find some old iced tea that cleared the window up pretty well.... even though a lot of it froze almost immediately. I'm still not sure how we were able to pull this off, but we were able to drive slowly the 30 minutes to the nearest town, with our fender dragging against the tire the whole way. It was such a weird adventure, and we didn't have cell reception for most of it, but we finally made it to the town. Luckily enough we wound up about 10 minutes away from where my mom works, and THANK GOODNESS, my mom took the rest of the day off from work to drive me the rest of the way to my appointment. My roommate stayed in the parking lot with her beat up car to figure out what she was going to do with it, and how she was going to get home. 

**The second leg of my journey:** At this point I was still 50 minutes away from the clinic and we had an hour to get there. I piled my comfort blankets into my mom's car and I was able to fully appreciate how comforting a working heater and good radio can be. Thankfully the rest of the drive was pretty uneventful and we got to the clinic safely. There were protesters outside of the clinic but I quickly hid my face so I couldn't see them. I only got a glimpse of one woman who had a baby sling around her body and she reached her arm towards our car as we pulled into the parking lot. Luckily there was a highway patrolman standing guard near them preventing them from coming any further than the side walk. A clinic escort met us at our car to walk us to the front door. We were only 5 minutes late. There was a garden path up to the front door of the clinic and from the door you couldn't see the protesters at all and I was very thankful for that. I filled out some paperwork and my mom and I waited in the waiting room. Prepare to do a ton of waiting. We were in the clinic for a total of 4 1/2 hours, and they told me when I got there that a 4 hour wait was pretty normal. I heard that other days of the week they had a shorter wait time because Friday's were the only days that they offered sedation.

**The waiting:** My mom and I did a ton of waiting. I would definitely bring a book or something to do for yourself, AND for the person who brought you. The actually procedure is very short and the vast majority of your time will be nervous sitting. After the first period of waiting they asked me to pee in a cup. That normally wouldn't be too hard but because of the anesthesia I wasn't able to to eat or drink (including water) for 8 hours prior to my appointment time. After I gave them my cup there was more waiting, and then they took my blood pressure and temperature. More waiting, and then they took me to a room to talk to me so I would understand what the procedure was going to entail, and I had to fill out more paperwork. If you do get anesthesia you'll need a driver to take you from the appointment, and the clinic will want to know their name and phone number so they can call them to pick you up. There are two waiting rooms by the way, the public one, and the one for just the girls actually needing services at the clinic. The second room was much nicer with leather chairs, but I chose to wait with my mother in the other one. 

**Ultrasound:** The next time they brought me back they did an internal ultra sound. Definitely one of my least favorite parts of the whole experience. A women lead me into a room and instructed me to take off everything from the waist down when she left the room and to knock on the door when I did. I had a thin papery sheet to cover me up but it wasn't that much of a comfort. I also left my socks on because it was kinda freezing inside. She instructed me to sit up on the butcher paper while she took out a long, skinny plastic probe (the ultrasound wand I guess) and she put a jelly filled condom over the wand. I had to scootch to the end of the table, and the lady strapped my ankles into two stirrups attached to the table. As you probably guessed, it's an INTERNAL ultrasound... so yeah that process was not the most fun and unfortunately I was not knocked out for it. When she was done I told her that I didn't want to see the results of the ultrasound, but she did tell me that I was 6 to 7 weeks along. I got dressed again, and went back outside to wait... again.  The next time they called me back was for a finger prick (very oddly painful) to check my iron levels. The woman in this room told me that the next time I would be called back would be for the actual procedure.

**The procedure:** The wait between the finger prick and the actual procedure was one of the longest waits. I'm not sure if it was because I was nervous, but it seemed to take much much longer. The doctor was a woman, and this time she didn't leave the room for me to undress but was very polite about keeping her back turned while I undressed. This time I had to take my scarf and sweatshirt off (cold!!!) and she gave me a pad to put in my underwear now because she said I wouldn't be with it enough to be able to do it myself after the procedure. I had to do the same process with sitting on the butcher paper, and she helped my legs into stirrups so I didn't ""kick her while I was under"". She pulled down the front of my shirt and put two patches on my chest, one under each collar bone, and she pulled up my shirt and put another patch on my inner left hip. She attached cords to the patches and I watched my nervous heart rate jump around on the monitor. Vagina in the air, I had to made conversation with her while we waited for the anesthesiologist. I'm not sure why but at the time I worried that maybe she was feeling awkward that I was half naked, or maybe she felt bad that she was making me so nervous that my heart rate was jumping around and beeping a ton, so I made an effort to make small talk about her job so she wouldn't feel so bad. I was her first abortion of the day, Friday's are more busy because it's the only day they offer anesthesia, she likes her job, and the recovery shouldn't be bad at all. When the anesthesiologist finally came in, I couldn't help but notice that he was a guy. He was very polite though and asked me a couple questions to make sure I followed my instructions from earlier, no eating 8 hours before procedure, and no drugs 24 hours before. Putting the IV in didn't hurt too bad, it was the rubber band around my arm that pulled my hair that hurt the most. I'm kinda skeptical about needles too so I had to look away when he put it in the back of my hand. He told me what the name of the drug was that he was putting in the IV, and said that in a few seconds it'll feel like I've had a couple of drinks. I focused on the ceiling tiles above me and when they started to blur and slip a little I tried to tell him ""It does feel like I've had a couple drinks and then... I had a... bowl of maraj..... weeds"" and that was the last thing I remember.  

**Recovering:** The doctor lady woke me up and told me I could get dressed. She helped me up slowly and I didn't feel any pain but I was very sluggish and needed help navigating back to my clothes. My underwear was missing, but she told me she already put them on me, and I felt under my collar bone for the patches but they were gone. It was an odd feeling not remembering how clothes got on you, or remembering someone peeling patches off your skin. I remember having difficulties with my sweatshirt, but I don't remember how I got to the recovery room. They told me that they wheel chaired me in but I don't remember it at all. All of us in the recovery room were sitting in big armchairs with puppy pads across the seat. The IV was still in the back of my hand but without a tube so I was very careful not to wiggle it or touch it because I didn't want it to hurt me. Two of the girls had heat pads across their stomachs but when I asked the attendant in the room if I could have one, she told me that they only had two left and the other ones broke. There wasn't any pain but I did feel oddly out of it. I sat there for awhile until the woman asked me to go to the bathroom to check on my bleeding. It was minimal. I finally asked for some water because it now had been a lot longer than 8 hours since my last meal, or drink of water. I tried to make conversation with the other girls in the room, but they all were too out of it. After about 30 minutes they said I was free to go if I felt okay, and someone walked with me as I slowly made my way back out to the waiting room where my mom was. She gathered up my things and another attendant escorted my mom and I out to our car. 

**Driving home:** The drive home was super uneventful. I completely bundled myself up in my comfort blankets and fell asleep. At one point I woke up suddenly and demanded that we stop at KFC because I was ravenously hungry from not eating for 18 hours (it was a lot longer than the 8 hours because I ate before I went to bed but not up until the point where I had to stop). After eating we stopped at a target and I picked up a heating pad and a lot of pads because they told me that I would be spotting for the next 2 to 3 weeks. 

**TL;DR:** I had an abortion and I am 100% okay with my decision. This is an extremely long winded account of my abortion because I want people to know exactly what they are going in for with no surprises. Please feel free to PM me to ask me questions or you can e-mail me at abortionfriend@live.com"
1wwoq5,7,2014-02-03,Former heavy Marijuana user- Quitting after 8 years 25/F,[deleted],stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1wwoq5/former_heavy_marijuana_user_quitting_after_8/,"As a heavy marijuana user for the past 8 years of my life, IT IS possible to kick your smoking addiction even if you rely on getting high every couple hours to get through the day. I should know, I use to wake and bake, go to school/work, get high on my lunch break, and then come home and smoke at least 3 more bowls. Once I was home, I would load bowls for myself until I passed out in front of the TV. I was smoking about 1g a day, and was spending all my money at the dispensary or streets (whichever connect came through first). For a while, everything was great- I was a college student with a job and I had a low overhead so I spent all my money buying weed. I didn't care because it was the only thing I felt worth spending my money on.

I resumed this pattern of life post college- and continued smoking pot in graduate school. I told myself I would quit once I found an internship but I actually smoked even more due to stress. Last year, I graduated with my Master's degree and realized it is time for a life change.

My family is against smoking so it was a secret I kept from them. My friends are all stoners so it was easy to keep getting high with them. However, soon I found myself dipping low in money because I was in between graduation and finding a full time career. Even with only a few dollars in my bank account, I still bought weed. I began to feel guilty and started resenting myself for the behaviors I cannot control.

By this point, I was convinced getting high is part of me. I felt I couldn't stop because it was all I had. As my anxiety about graduation and finding a job grew, so did my appetite for pot. I started buying cannabis in ounces just to make sure my jar was always full. I would feel panic attacks whenever my jar was getting low.

This anxious/self-punishing behavior went on for many more months before I realized I was becoming a piece of crap. I didn't like my messy appearance and wasn't happy with myself anymore. It took me 8 years to realize what the effects of marijuana had done to me. BUT I still loved getting high (especially alone in my house) and struggled a lot.

I attempted to ""quit"" on my own. It was a total lie. I would pretend if I only smoked 2 bowls in the morning, I was ""decreasing"" my amount. However by mid afternoon, I would be so anxious that I ended up smoking again. Night time was the worse- I cannot be alone with my thoughts and felt I needed cannabis to control my emotions. Every time I thought/felt/experienced any kind of stress or anxiety I would pack myself a bowl. Nothing mattered... as long as there was weed I was okay and it was all I cared about.

One day as I was discussing my future with my BF I realized... wow I didn't have a future. He was making great income and I was behind because I couldn't piss clean to qualify for an actual job. It hurt to think about the future I was giving up on. I realized I could keep smoking weed and find a shitty part-time job, OR I could face reality and accept the fact I needed to quit to get hired.

The funny part is my degrees are both in the medical field. I have extensive training in substance abuse, neurological biology, THC metabolic pathways, and know all about treatment and recovery. It was easy to advise another person- yet I couldn't help myself.

I finally made the difficult decision to allow this cannabis jar to run out and I would not buy anymore. Every day as I watched the amount dwindle, I would feel anxious. I had questions like ""What am I gonna do? How do I pass time? WTF this hour has been going on forever! I just need a hit"".

Then one day it happened- my jar was empty. I woke up and stared at the jar. Then I did something bad- I began scraping for keif first and then resin. The resin balls were disgusting, and I used a paperclip to dig around the insides of my bowl piece. I would pull out the resin and then roll it in a ball to put in my bowl and light it. The taste was nasty but I was living for that ""little bit"" of highness. I probably pulled out more resin that week than I ever have in my life.

I felt embarrassed about it and lied to others that I had already quit. It was easier that way... to pretend I stopped getting high by saying resin isn't weed. Then the resin ran out and I completely stopped.

I thought about smoking every 15 minutes, every single day and night. All I wanted was a hit. The first night without pot, I was angry and then I started crying. I never felt so worthless about myself.. here I was a grown, professional woman crying because I can't get high. The first night was hell- I probably slept less than 2 hours. I threw up, had a headache, and just moped around the living room. I had no appetite. I couldn't shut off my brain from its cravings.

At around 3am, I secretly got up and started scraping for resin again! I found a little piece, smoked it and finally slept. I felt so dirty because I lied to myself. Still, I kept telling my friends that I had already quit. The next day would be a new day, I lied again.

After 3 unsuccessful attempts to not look for resin at night, I managed to break the paper clip because I was scraping so hard. As the paper clip snapped in half, so did my drive for marijuana. It finally registered in my head- NO more means NO more. I put my bong, grinder, and lighters away.

I started up my dusty treadmill and got on a low speed. I had a new plan- to exercise every time I had a craving. Exercising and drinking water has been the biggest help to my recovery. Every time my brain got stuck on thinking ""I need to smoke... just one..."" I would force myself to run. The harder I craved it, the faster I would run. The idea was to knock myself out of breath so I'm distracted trying to breathe.

Of course I still thought about weed. All my friends still smoke around me so it has been tough making that personal decision for myself. The first week was the hardest- it was all about thought control and self management. I kept telling myself that I'm a piece of shit if I can't control my own behaviors. This makes me no different than a baboon and the difference between humans and animals is that we have critical thinking skills. I was on a mission to prove to myself that I can be human.

Now that I have been THC-free for a while, I can honestly say marijuana is harmless. I look back and realize all those times I could have cut down on smoking but chose not to. I feel EXACTLY the same as a person. I can say marijuana does not change you for the worse as a person- one must learn to harness the power of it. If used moderately, it is an excellent sleeping/anti-anxiety aid. However, if you start abusing it and smoke 1g a day, you will find yourself out of luck.

I'm not ready to start smoking again (yet)- but I want to say taking a marijuana break is a good decision for anyone who is looking for a different perspective of life. I am excited I had a tolerance break so when I do get high again, I will be 10x higher. After 8 years, it is time to give it up - for a while.

As a former, heavy daily marijuana user- I want to say I am still in support of marijuana for its medicinal purposes. If given the option in the future, I pick cannabis over any kind of prescription pills -anyday. One thing I would do differently is to NOT wake and bake and only smoke in the afternoon-evenings. I find it helpful to be ""sober"" during day time in order to get shit done at home and at work. Good luck to anyone who is trying to quit, it's hard but it's definitely possible.

1wwv18,7,2014-02-03,Am I [23F] setting myself up for failure with my bf [23M]?,throw13away13x,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wwv18/am_i_23f_setting_myself_up_for_failure_with_my_bf/,"**The Background**

He and I met on OkC  and then started dating in mid-October 2011. Relationship was met with protest from my mom [55/F] since day one, mainly due to his lifestyle (i.e., city student life riding bikes as transportation) and appearance at that time.

Despite the constant pressure from my household at that point, including my mother not talking to me/aggressively ignoring for weeks, I continued to see him and pursue the relationship as I completed my undergrad studies.
The relationship was intense from its onset. I pulled away from a lot of my friends and submerged into the new bf quickly. Truth be told, a lot of them needed to be shed.  We met a lot in the city during my internship and by February 2012 he even took me to a jeweler for a ring fitting. Marriage was talked about often.

My parents met him in January, shortly after I met his. My dad found him to be alright; my mom was convinced he was disrespectful. 


**The First Move-In**

Around the time I graduated in spring, he had a bike riding accident which led to a broken bone. As he was returning to his apartment for the recovery, he offered that I officially leave a lot of things in the space and, basically, a softly move in.

After graduating, I got a job and worked in the city. I stayed with him a lot, though I would lie to my parents or exclude details about him here and there.

We enjoyed some really great months, despite his stress over his injury preventing him to complete school on time and my parents. There were issues with him using social media to flirt with other girls at some points, but he made amends quickly and vocally when that occurred – “I don’t care about having an account on X; I’ll delete it for us to be my priority!” I found that stuff by stalking online, so I accepted my wrong-doing there and was upfront about it.


**The First Break-Up**

By the fall, we were really living domestically as a unit at his place. There was a wedding coming up – my cousin – which he was invited to go to with me, against the usual judgment of my parents.

That wedding comes up and he seems to really stressed with school, so I offer him the chance to not attend and, instead, suggest he enjoy a trip of his own or hang out with friends. He seems reluctant, but agrees. His plans are to go to NYC for a photography adventure – a hobby he was growing fond of and getting good at. I go to that wedding with my dad and see family without the ability to introduce the bf.

I decide to start some hobbies of my own during that time, including committing to my yoga practice. Boyfriend gets mad that I’m doing that to distance myself. Things are tense and I start stalking for things online again. I find them – including that he met up with a girl during his NYC daytrip.

When I bring that up, he gets defensive. Later I find more information – more stalking – that he had been flirting with her for weeks. I tell him I need to talk since I learned of this; I say that even if I didn’t find something, I was not acting in a way that felt like a healthy relationship, so I wanted to break up.  I bring bags and pack up my things from the apartment.


**First Back Together**

After two and a half months of finding my own way of life after things ended, he reached out via text. I was seeing people socially at that time and had had some successful dates, but his message was impactful. It was apologetic and sincere.

It was December and we re-united in time for Christmas and we then spent  a lot of my vacation time from work together connecting. I hid this from my parents.

But by start of 2013, I told my parents. They disapproved but were appreciative that I was honest.

Things felt better than ever after we realized what it was like to be apart. I opened up to him about everything that occurred with the other dates during our breakup and I felt it was reciprocated. We worked to stabilize.

During the coming months, things normalized again and I brought clothes and my things back to his place. We talked about moving into together and began looking at places.

We were really set to move in together at the start of that summer. It was finally coming together!


**The Second Break-Up**

Things began to get tense around spring. His libido was gone and he was stressed a lot. One night, while I was at the house alone, I go to leave a message to surprise him in his computer’s file titled “work.” I discover that it is a file of p0rn. My heart sinks – mainly since he has always been vehemently vocal about his feelings against it (though, I always take guys saying that with a grain of  salt, just because I know that humans are conflicting). Later that same night, he comes home and falls asleep. I look at his phone and find texts of a deeply sweet nature to his first (ex) gf.  They hint about trying to arrange to see each other. I don’t sleep that night and he realizes I’m not in bed. He asks if something is wrong. I, though not wanting to wreck his night and steal his rest, opt to be upfront instead of lie. He gets angry, but then incredibly apologetic.

By the end of that week, we break up.

He and I arrange a time I can get my things. I use my key, get my things, find that his computer already has conversations with other girls—and leave the key, as determined.

We do not see each other all summer. I work very hard to move on and find a place of my own in a different part of the city.

I move into my place – the last day of August.


**The Second Back Together**

He emails that very move-in weekend. It’s a long, long letter about how much he ruined the best thing he had and what’s changed.

I wait a week and then respond, against my own advice to myself.

We get back together.
I stalk everything of his I can find online.
We break up because I get paranoid about his exes and him lying again.

We get back together. I feel that we pour our hearts open and then things are re-kindled. We talk about moving out of state together and really getting married and moving ahead.

Spend most of my Christmas vacation together, as well as New Years.

I then find out, by stalking, that he was hooking up with an ex all during our last mini-break up. She writes very sexual things and took pictures waking up in his room for her Instagram.

We have a fight and I don’t see him for almost a week as I think about things.


**Now**

We’ve been back together and things are working well now, so I wanted to be open. I just told my mom yesterday and she flipped out. “I trust your judgment on everything but this.”

EDIT: He also now wants me to move in with him. I see that as a big offering of his honesty.
_____________

**TL;DR: How much significance should I place on past infidelity and a parental disapproval? While I am finally in living situation and financial place to say “none,” I feel like I need to ask myself that since I’ve [23F] been hurt multiple times in the past by my bf [23M] of almost 3 years and by my own paranoia/jealousy.**

1wx2p8,18,2014-02-03,Me (25F) and my Boyfriend (26M) is still in love with his ex,ucdsh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wx2p8/me_25f_and_my_boyfriend_26m_is_still_in_love_with/,"Yeah, I feel like half the posts here are pretty much this exact situation, so I tried to take notes on the advice other people have gotten from similar situations, but I kind of feel like I have to get this out even if it sounds cliché/boring, but it's really weighing me down and I don't really have any good friends these days who I can talk.

I need to say this... I'm sorry, but yes, I snooped. I'm a terrible person and I snooped on his laptop :(

My boyfriend, let's call him Chris, and I have been together over 2 years. About 3-4 years ago, he was seeing another girl (let's call her Teresa). Let me give some backstory... it's a bit complicated but I should give some background.

Teresa and I went to the same college and were co-workers at one point, casual-good friends. Chris, went to a different college about 6 hours away. One summer he took an internship at the college Teresa and I both went to. While he was there for the summer, they met and got involved and he fell pretty hard for her. They attempted a relationship after the internship ended, but Teresa rejected him because she was ""scarred by her last boyfriend who was 'abusive'"". 

Fast forward a year-- I met him (not knowing initially that he had dated Teresa) and we started dating. He always assured me that he was over her and wanted to be with me. He was really the model boyfriend, we had (have) a great relationship. We even re-located together... unfortunately really close to where Teresa now lives....

For the past 3 months or so after we moved, he's been acting a little distant and off. I figured that it was just because we were both new to the area and still working on making friends/settling in. But a few days ago, he was in the shower and he left his phone on the coffee table and I saw his phone light up as he got a facebook notification-- a message from HER. Yeah, I feel guilty about what I did next, but I couldn't help it... I snuck on his laptop real quick (SHAME ON ME!) and checked his facebook. 

Turns out they have been messaging each other pretty regularly 1-2 a month. I know... no big deal, right? And for the most part the messages are pretty innocent except for a couple... They also referenced a series of text messages so I guess they've been texting (NO, I didn't check his phone although I was severely tempted) too. Some examples... he said he still listens to playlists she made him and that it makes him miss her. He referred to the summer they spent together as ""the best one of his life."" They both said they have regrets.

I have to be honest, these messages feel inappropriate. Am I crazy? He seems to send them or text her when he's drunk. As much as I hate to admit it, she hasn't REALLY said anything that ""crosses the line"", it's mostly him. I don't know what to do and the flashback I keep having is that a year ago on New Years Eve, Chris and our friends partied and got drunk (with a lot of people who are also good friends with Teresa) and she came up as a conversation topic for some reason. In private, one of his friends said something along the lines of Chris never fully being able to get over Teresa. That Chris would never leave me on his own but that if Teresa dumped her boyfriend and told Chris she loved him back, he'd go with her. 

I feel so petty for rambling about this, but it's been haunting me. Am I being paranoid and should I just let it lie?

EDIT: Thanks for your input, everyone... I will try to work up the courage to talk to him tonight. Thanks for letting me rant and being supportive.

**tl;dr**: Found out my boyfriend has been talking to his ex, I suspect he's still in love with her. Do I confront him? Am I being a crazy jealous girlfriend?"

So I just quit my job because I just could not stand the supervisors at the company. I worked there for 6 months doing data entry work, and during that 6 months, I did a 10 week administrative internship. Before that, I was an after-school teacher and worked at a wines &amp; spirits store.

Anyways, I graduated back in 2010 with a BA and I am looking for a career position. For awhile I thought about going to law school but decided to decline offers. 

Anyways, I've been applying for any basic office position and have been going to interviews for  mostly inside sales (base salary included), tried to break into recruiting field but zero luck, and while I have an administrative internship experience, I've been getting zero luck with that field as well. 

What can I do? I'm clueless at this point. I've been learning HTML/CSS and started to learn Javascript but I am still a work in progress.

I almost went back to school for a second Bachelor in Computer Informations System (but decided not to because of fiscal reason). I would like to break into IT though but no clue where to start.

Any advice or comment would be greatly appreciated. "
1wxim6,4,2014-02-03,"Finding and getting internships, post-college?",Shmabury,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1wxim6/finding_and_getting_internships_postcollege/,"I hope I'm not rehashing [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19yr8v/am_i_too_old_for_internships/) too much. That discussion is encouraging, but I'm asking a slightly different question.

I'm interested in getting into a full software engineering career. Searching for opportunities has been difficult without a CS degree, and having an internship under my belt would help. But based on their listings, the majority of internships are *explicitly* for undergraduate CS students who have not graduated yet. I'm hesitant to apply to these because they probably get plenty of undergraduate applicants to choose from; they probably have the leeway to ignore qualified applicants who don't meet their stated requirements.

Nevertheless, I'm sure that some companies would ultimately not mind hiring a college graduate, especially if it's a good fit. So my questions are:

- What are some ways that I could approach these internships? Is it OK to cold-apply/cold-email, or should I focus solely on networking (not my strong suit, but I can push myself to do it)?
- How would a recruiter view my application? Would I come across as a viable candidate, or an idiot who didn't read the basic requirements?
- What sorts of companies or programs would be more likely to consider me? My guess: smaller companies without red-tape-filled HR departments. But they would also have fewer positions open.

For reference, here's my background:

- I don't have a CS degree (I graduated 3 years ago in physics). I took a bunch of computer science courses because I enjoyed them. My GPA was not impressive because labs sucked time and focus away from other courses.
- Lately I have been taking online courses to fill in academic holes (notably, algorithms).
- I can code competently. I'm not someone who would miss a fizzbuzz interview question. I'm intelligent and have a mind for this stuff.
- I love to do side projects on my own when I get interested in something; some of them are on Github, but those don't showcase all of my languages/knowledge.
- I've had one software-related job: a 3-month contract position writing procedures in SQL and some C# code. I was learning these languages on the fly, but otherwise the work seemed simple to me.
- Because I've held a paid position and need to pay rent+bills, I'm aiming for paid internships.

For what it's worth, this isn't the only career path I'm considering; I think I would be good at data science, and I'm considering doing a graduate certificate this fall. In this case I think a summer internship or temporary job in either software engineering or data analysis would still be helpful.

Thanks for your advice!"

I am doing more administrative stuff as well as a lot of design work and planning. I am not in the trenches as I once was before. Frankly the trenches have changed so much, that when I was asked the question by an intern I found myself uncomfortable giving an answer that I felt would be relevant. 

I told him frankly to keep some sort of removable media whether it be a flash drive or external usb on hand. 

Have Server ISO's ready for re-installs or new builds.  

Make sure you know the restore process of whatever software you are using. Backwards and forwards. 

And backup backup , backup. As much as I hate data sprawl, Managers hate to hear that there is not viable backup even more. I recommend at least 2 backup methods using different software if possible. 

Pay adamant attention to your storage, it is not a place to dump things there are performance considerations as well.  keep a close eye on it. 

Don't be afraid to call the vendor, yes I know sometimes they have less of a clue than you do. But the perception to management is that YOU are taking all the necessary steps to solve the issue. (while you wait on hold with the vendor continue to look into the issue.) 

What specific tools do you guys recommend? (I know mine was more advice but it felt more practical than saying I use Malwarebytes and Rkill.)"
1wxq6j,6,2014-02-03,Internship Qualifications,FURyannnn,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1wxq6j/internship_qualifications/,"Hi all!

I'm currently a junior at college (Computer Science major) and I'm looking at applying for an internship in web development. I've found a company near my home that would be an ideal place to work. However, they list two requirements, one of which I cannot meet at the moment.

They are:

* A strong grasp of object-oriented design and programming.

* Exposure to Test-Driven or Test-Assisted development (JUnit, NUnit, etc).

I have plenty of experience with the former (using Java) but little to none with the latter. Will this be a deal-breaker? Furthermore, they have some additional preferred experience as follows:

* Knowledge of the Microsoft .Net platform and with the C# programming language.
* Knowledge of Drupal or WordPress and the PHP programming language.
* Experience with web application development (both desktop and mobile).
* Understanding of relational databases; experience with Microsoft SQL Server in particular
* ORM technologies such as Entity Framework and NHibernate.
* Sitecore or other content management systems.
* Familiarity with ASP.NET, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

I have developed web applications (I'm currently working with jQuery UI on a mobile version of a site) with Rails before and have experience with JS, CSS, and HTML. I've also worked extensively with SQL (and SQL Server in particular, so that helps!) 

Even though I do not meet all the requirements, I'm considering applying anyways. It can't hurt, can it? I applied once last year but that was before I had ANY experience with web development whatsover. It actually allowed me to get a database internship so no complaints there.

Any advice would be great. Thanks!"
1wxwie,0,2014-02-03,I [21M] met a girl [19F] on a cruise four years ago. We have always wanted to be together. I've been dating my girlfriend [20F] for 1.5 years.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wxwie/i_21m_met_a_girl_19f_on_a_cruise_four_years_ago/,"Hi /r/relationships
Four years ago I met a girl on a week long cruise. We had so much fun together in the limited amount of time. When I first laid eyes on her I instantly approached her (which I have never done to a woman I was fond of before). After the cruise we both went home. I went back to Nor Cali, and she went back to the east coast. We have always kept in very close contact, we would write letters, video chat, mail items, etc.

Presently, she now goes to college in Arizona and I go to college in southern California. (6 hour drive from one another). We are finally getting closer to finally be together again. We are pursuing our BA's having internships, really maturing. We would like to have a relationship once we can physically be together long term. However, I've had a girlfriend for a year and a half now that I also really adore. I love her family so much and her as well. They take great care of me and my girlfriend loves me so so so much. I love her too, but I feel like the girl from the cruise is my soul mate. I dream of the girl from the cruise and have her always in the back of my head. Despite only hanging out with her for one week, we've kept in such close contact for over 4 years now. We always wanted to have a relationship and we finally live so close to each other!!

I don't know what to do I truly adore these two woman and they adore me. I don't want to break hearts. I don't know which woman is the right one for me :(. I love both of them so much. I don't want to break up with my girlfriend to potentially be with the girl from the cruise, because what if it doesn't work out?? Or if I continue to be with my girlfriend, I will always think about the girl from the cruise.. I will always still talk to her. I'll continue to wonder ""what if we met up together again."" I don't know Reddit... has anybody been in this situation?

---   
**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

Met a girl on a cruise a few years ago. She lived on the east coast I lived on the west. Always kept in contact, always wanted to have a long term relationship. We now live 6 hours away from one another. I've been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 years now. I adore both of them so much. They are both in love with me. Don't know what to do.."
1wxzmt,1,2014-02-03,[Crit: Heavy] Personal Narrative on First Date Experience (1900 words),[deleted],write,https://www.reddit.com/r/write/comments/1wxzmt/crit_heavy_personal_narrative_on_first_date/,"I am sitting in the driver’s seat of my mom’s green jeep at midnight in Canby, a farm town two hours south of Portland. I can hear the jeep’s v6 engine hum its low tone and the wiper blades pulsing away the rain, too slowly. I should turn the speed of the blades up a notch, but instead I turn them off. The rain gets louder, like a rolling curtain of applause above me in congratulations for turning eighteen years old moments ago. She left me. I know that now as I look out the passenger window, into country darkness, at the tiny porchlight above her door and the window with closed curtains to its right. 

“May I walk you to the door?” I remember weakly asking. My body was frozen in the driving position when I asked this—hands on the wheel, head aimed foreword with the headlights—poised for either a yes or no, my heart thunking in my ears. I wanted her to say yes. Truth is, I wanted to embrace her at the steps, bring her close, tilt her head and cup her chin just below the ears and kiss her. Just like in Gone With the Wind, or any other romance. Dating her never would have worked out, but kissing her to see what kissing’s all about, and to fulfill the promise I made in seventh grade to kiss a girl before turning eighteen, could have worked. She politely declined and got out and went inside. I remember watching the front door close and looking at the clock behind the steering wheel glow a dim 12:03.

A sensation like molten iron runs down the center of my back and up my arms to the steering wheel. My hands grip the wheel so tightly they are shaking. I want to tear the thing in half. “What’s the point… nothing matters… it’s all nothing in the end, why live” I say, gushing the words incoherently in a string together. I abruptly switch off the headlights, release the park, and slam the gas pedal. Blindly, I accelerate down one of Canby’s empty roads fit for tractors and chicken trucks, away from her, away from failure. Somehow I remain on the road. Maybe it is the orange black sky contrasting the trees and road like a flattened yinyang that keeps me from dragging the wheel left or right too sharply into a tree, sign, or the river. Nothing matters, I am thinking again. I did not even ask her to prom in person. 

A month back, I had a friend stuff a tennis ball with my name on it into her backpack during lunch.  That day I drove home early from school and waited for her call in the kitchen, cooking macaroni on the stovetop. When the phone rang, a surge of excitement hit me like an electric fork poking me in the chest, and I answered her call without saying anything. “I’d love to go with you,” she said. It was as if she said it in person. 

While eating the pasta, I thought about the events of the day. I was annoyed with myself for not staying at school. Going home early felt like an act of cowardice. Why not just man up, I thought. Yet again, my shyness got the best of me. On the first day of high school, I approached a group of classmates who were discussing a topic that interested me, probably video games or the latest technology, but I do not remember. One of them noticed me standing in the back and asked, “Why are you here?” I felt like an intern walking into a room full of CEOs discussing financial strategy and chomping at cigars. Another memory cropped up of the high school bully shouting, “Fatty fatty!” at me in the locker room. I should have asked her in person, should have taken her hand when she accepted the tennis ball or, better yet, should have done so with flowers, in class, singing with a guitar in my lap and a song composed with her name in it. 

The next day, I went with my mom to Men’s Wearhouse to find a suit. I wanted the best rental I could find, the eyelash batting kind, one that would dazzle her. In the store, rows of suits in red and pink and white hung on the back wall, exquisite among the black and gray ones. The white suit reminded me of my grandfather who had received a white rental on accident for my parent’s wedding. As the family story goes, he looked resplendent on the dance floor doing the waltz with my grandmother. Better yet, they had not spoken to each other in years and there they were, dancing. 

A tall, maybe six foot eight, man with gages for earrings and a pink bowtie guided me through each style of suit. When I asked him about the more colorful options, he laughed and said I would stick out like a sore thum. He helped me settle for a black tuxedo with a vivid green vest, color enough to at least stand out, and dazzle. 

After driving a mile, I pull off to the side and shut the engine off. To my left are fir trees and railroad tracks running parallel to the road. The rain on the tracks sounds like an overfilled gutter. Occasionally, a large splash rings out on the metal. My eyes are closed.

My date and I began the prom night arriving forty minutes late to Rose’s Restaurant because I had driven to the wrong location. The four other couples we were supposed to sit with had already finished eating by the time we sat down to order. I did not eat much of my caeser salad, the quickest meal on the menu, and neither did she eat hers. I felt nauseous.

Less than an hour later, she was leading me with her hand onto the dance floor. The ballroom was massive, with two story high ceilings and curtains hanging to the floor. The DJ in the back lit up the darkened room acoustically with four refrigerator-sized speakers and visually with strobing reds, blues, greens, and yellows and disco balls and lasers.  Macklemore’s “Can’t Hold Us” blared into the throng of dancing, twerking, and moshing teens, their bodies an undulating mass of arms with one another. We joined them for the next few songs. 

By the third song, my stomach ached. It was when I was caught in the middle with a shoulder gouging my chest and someone’s knee kicking me down low that I realized it was too much. I was going to be sick. My tie felt like a burning rope around my neck being dragged and yanked around by the dancers. I ditched my date for the bathroom in a sprint, straining for air. 

For an hour I hid in one of the stalls with my shirt off. My bald government teacher had seen me surfing the walls with my hand toward the bathroom and gotten me water. At least in the stalls the music took on a muffled, soothing sound where I could recoup for the last dance.

Knowing I could not abandon my date, especially for the last song, I gulped a last bit of water, put on my shirt, minus the tie, and punched open the bathroom door. This last dance was serious business, as everyone knows that at the end, all dates kiss. I strode down the hall to the ballroom with my shoulders back and chest out. There she was, leaning on the wall to the right of the main doors with a glass of orange juice up to her lips. Her flame orange hair shimmered in the disco light escaping from cracks of the doorway. For the first time I noticed the emerald green dress she was wearing, simple in design but fitted precisely to her track-runners frame. Without words, I took her orange juice and promenaded her onto the dance floor.

The DJ had turned all the lights off, save for the disco ball which cast a slowly drifting starscape of lights on us. “I Won’t Give Up” by Jason Mraz began to play. I had never been this close to a woman before. My ear touched her ear while we slowly turned step-by-step in the darkness. I felt every detail of her body vividly as she pressed close to me. Her head was a scratchy blur on my shoulder, like winter wool too close to see clearly, and her perfume gave off a hallucinogenic melody of vanilla and high-desert pine. I was gone, in another place of unrivaled peace.

Gradually, the song came to a close. In the pleasant silence after the lights came on, I looked into her eyes and she looked into mine. We stood there, motionless; my six-foot frame in an unbuttoned, shiny green vest complemented her dress and her soft, slim form, like Beauty and the Beast gone twenty-first century. I did not want the moment to end. Rather than kiss her, like the rest of the couples around us were doing, I leaned forward to where my lips touched her ear and gruffly whispered, “Your ear is wet,” which was the first thing to come to mind. Bam, like a gun, the moment fell apart. She shoved me away to get in the exit line. I followed after a few seconds of hasty introspection, tried to grab her hand, but she crossed her arms and looked away. 

Fat raindrops pelt the window hard, sounding like TV static. In the darkness I suck in salty tear drops and gurgle out, “That’s just not me.” My ears ring with the echoes the students I sit next to every day narrating their encounters with parties, alcohol, women and men, sports, kissing, and loving. The coil inside me snaps. In sudden fury, I punch the steering wheel and dashboard, bang the windows and claw at the seats; I lose it there and calm only when I’m gasping to breath under all the self-pitying tears. Minutes pass with me sagging in the driver’s side—I think of the birthday cake tomorrow morning, which I choose not to eat as punishment.

“Sometimes,” I start before taking another breath, “Sometimes you got to be someone else first to find out who you really are.” A surge of rain collides onto the roof of the car. It’s strange how rain sounds just like the ocean, well down to the cresting waves and shoreline. I roll onto my side and wipe the tears from my face to see out the window. I feel better then. Relaxed. I know I am not that suave guy I spent so much time donning the mask of during the school days. The social guy, the attention seeker and partygoer—a half mask, more correctly, like the Phantom. Silence is not my sin; it is part of who I am. Off in the distance I see a blurry yellow light coming down the tracks, flash, flash, flash between the trees. It is one of the big brown trains with cars spanning as long as a mile. I do not wait to count how many. By the time the train passes, I am going home.

I'm a 26 year old wanting to go to WGU for my BS Human Resource Management degree.

In 2005-2006 I attended one year at Pennsylvania State University. Its decently difficult to get into - I only remember I had an 1180/1600 SAT.

The largest issue about that experience is I probably passed 4/10 classes, with the remaining 6/10 as failures (F's). The others were probably B's, and C's. At the time the brick and mortar wasn't right for me, and in fact still is not for me. 

My career as a web programmer though has gone very well! I went from an intern to a vp level in a small business in 2 years. However, I realized it wasn't right for me. 

I am 100% an independent learner and Google taught me everything about my IT career. That is why I feel WGU is right for me. The HR business degree will bring me to where I need to be in my life.

Will it harm my chances pulling my college transcripts with 6 failures and 4 passes? I *know* they want some college experience, but mine was terrible!"

i need some career advice. I've heard conflicting advice from friends, and don't have time to see a counselor for at least a week or two, so I just want some feedback from people in the industry to help me think a little.

quick info about myself:
enrolled in accelerated masters of accountancy degree

graduating with accounting degree this june 2014

overall gpa: 3.5, major gpa: 3.4

so being in this accelerated masters gives me 1 extra accounting class during my undergrad than I otherwise would have, which means another Major class I can get an A in.
and I'm also retaking an easy accounting class that I got a C in to get an A in it. so by the end of this semester my GPA should be slightly better.


I thought I had things planned out, where I'd finish my masters by june 2015, spend a year taking the CPA and go into public audit. THEN, after about 3 years, maybe come back to school, and get into the finance world.
however, I'm feeling it might be naive of me to assume I can get a better job in Finance as opposed to staying in accounting, even if I went back to school to get an MBA in finance or whatever.

here's where the conflicting advice from friends comes in: some of my friends feel working in public accounting and getting my CPA is a great way to establish myself in the business world, before moving into finance. I personally like this option the most, because it has the most versatility and gives me a chance to work in public accounting. If I get sick of it, go back to grad school and get an MBA.

however, others have said getting my CPA would almost pigeonhole me as an Accountant, and it wouldn't be a proper use of my time if I ultimately want to work in the finance world.

what makes things worse is I've already had a basic accounting internship, and am currently doing a tax internship, both of which I couldn't see myself doing as a career. auditing seems interesting and is the next job I'd like to try out, but I'm worried I'll get an internship in that and not like it like I thought I would. 

to make things even more complicated, I know Finance is a broad industry, so I don't even really know where to start to get an idea of what I'd wanna do.

what do you guys think? should I stay the course and finish the masters + CPA? just start applying for finance jobs with my accounting degree and forget about the masters + CPA? something else maybe?

and of course, thanks for your time"

How would I best go about doing this? 

I have been focusing my major on policy and site planning, so while I understand the processes of GIS and can follow tutorials, I'm too new to go from ArcGIS in school to GeoMedia in the workplace. I'd like to make an impression so any tutorials I can crush out in the next month would be great for projects. 



I want to be able to plot points on a map and have attribute table data that can be accessed and manipulated and updated in MS Access or Excel. 
I'm new to the GeoMedia. Today I was able to make a simple table of just column titles in Excel, attached it to a warehouse, and was able to then add attribute data to feature class ""points"". I even was able to map them to the road network by address matching, but the Excel file didn't update and I couldn't edit the data outside of GeoMedia.

Today I don't seem to have this same confidence. I don't feel like a man who knows himself and has nothing to be ashamed of. I feel like a boy who can't get laid and still lives with his parents at the age of 23. At the end of the day I have feelings of inadequacy and I begin to think that I am missing out on my youth. I hear crazy stories from my coworkers and classmates and here I am playing video games alone...again. 

I know that I have plenty to be happy about, but my mood seems to fluctuate from confident to depressed. I've been taking meds for depression and add for about a year and they have helped me immensely. I still find that I sometimes drink a cup of coffee or buy a red bull so that I can experience t hat manic caffeine rush that makes me feel great. 

I often don't feel like going out and doing something and choose to ""relax"" at home. I think that if I don't step up my game I will become the 40 year old virgin. I mean can I possibly have a relationship if I have such a lackluster social life?"

First and foremost, happy belated new year! I hope you have been doing well since we last spoke in November.


I just wanted to reach out to you with respect to an internship for this upcoming summer. I remember XXXX mentioning to me that you all discussed having an intern last summer, and weren't sure if that meant a firm wide or investment banking intern, but as you know I am interested in investment banking. While I understand that an intern might not be needed, I know that I have some exceptional skills and qualities that would be worth considering.


With that being said, I would like to set up a meeting to speak with you, and anyone else necessary from the investment banking team, to discuss my qualifications, experience, and value that I would bring to the table as an intern.


I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.


Best,

1wyoyk,23,2014-02-04,How I got better - my testimony and advice for new players,DeltaEks,smashbros,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1wyoyk/how_i_got_better_my_testimony_and_advice_for_new/,"I've been playing video games since I was 6 years old. Relevantly, I've been playing Smash Bros games since 1999. I have been playing SSBM with a competitive mindset for about 7 months, and hopefully I will be attending my first in-person tournament this weekend. I don't have any special notoriety or claims to fame under my belt and I know I still don't have that much experience, but I have grown so much as a competitor not only in the game, but as a person. Here are some tips that I have learned over this past year that I hope will be helpful.

**Lose**

If you don't lose you'll never get better. I used to get down on myself because I couldn't beat anyone I faced. Heck, even some random person who hadn't played the game in a few years was beating me. I was really bad, and I knew it. However, I didn't realize what my problem was until I started appreciating my losses and what they taught me. I became conscious of why I lost, I asked questions, took notes, set up training routines. Losing is the only way you will know how you can improve.

**Attach yourself to your main character**

When I used to play Smash Bros for fun there were three characters I played most often: Kirby, Mario, and Ness (Lucas in Brawl). I only needed to worry about beating my brother and my friends, so as long as I got good enough to beat them I was happy. Tier lists were nothing, only house rules stood between the viability of a character. When I revisited my childhood to enter into the competitive realm, I abandoned Ness, my favorite character, for Dr. Mario. As the months passed I changed mains quite a bit: Dr. Mario to Ice Climbers to Peach, to Ganondorf, to Peach again. I thought I was going to stick to Peach because she was the only top tier character I really understood. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I actually hated Peach and I couldn't play more than 30 minutes without getting bored of her. I re-found my love for Ness and have vowed to get good with him no matter how badly he sucks. Let me tell you, it feels great to kick butt with a disadvantaged character, especially when you have a sentimental connection to said character.

**Play every day**

I tend to be obsessive over games I want to get good at. It's just in my personality. Even through a summer internship and a grueling college senior semester I couldn't help but divide my attention to Melee. I don't recommend sacrificing grades, but unfortunately that's kind of what it lead to for me (thankfully I still passed them all, by the skin of my teeth). Fun fact: I play with the online dolphin community and I owe them for everything I currently know about competitive Melee. We have some pretty skilled players and I was definitely thrown into the deep end right away. However, the community was great and considering my social anxious tenancies I feel I wouldn't have been able to learn and grow as well as I did from a community in-person. Online play definitely strengthened me for the real world of Melee, and being able to play someone every day was a huge plus.

**Analyze videos**

This is actually a really important step, and something I can also be a bit obsessive over as well. Every day for lunch during last semester I would get something to eat and find a competitive Melee video to watch. I questioned techniques, how players baited or combo'd. I learned all the terminology, the rules, the strengths and weaknesses of a character. When I wanted to know a specific match-up I would search for it. Videos are an amazing source of knowledge. There is no reason you shouldn't take advantage.

**Have fun... OR ELSE**

They're not kidding when they say this is the most important rule. When you're having fun, you play your best. There would be times where I'm just having a bad day and I find myself feeling worse after getting beat by someone. If you start to find yourself in this situation STOP and either fix it asap or just take a break and come back tomorrow. If you're not having fun you will start to become predictable as well, starting to lean on bad habits and reflexes and not giving 100%. Trying too hard will never allow you to play at maximum potential.

Thanks for reading, I hope it was worth all this typing. Feel free to ask any questions or whatever.

**TL;DR**: Read the bold words."
1wyshq,1,2014-02-04,How can I get my life started now?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1wyshq/how_can_i_get_my_life_started_now/,"I'm 21 and currently work at a hospital making about $10 an hour (I work in transport, basically I just admit patients from the ER to rooms). I was in school for computer engineering, and my plan was to finish my associates and internship then look for work designing software, maybe take some extra classes on the side while pulling in decent money. However, my school lost some paperwork and I wasn't informed until the very end of the semester that my financial aid hadn't gone through. Long story short I need to come up with about $5,000 to pay off my past tuition before I can finish my last semester and do my internship. 

I love computers and technology, but I don't want to be stuck doing what I'm doing right now as I inch my way back to school. I'm tired of living at home and I honestly am tired of living in this state (NH). I feel like I would be much happier to move somewhere like WA where technology is a bigger deal, so that leads me to my big question..

What kind of jobs could I quickly become capable of? If I had to pay around $1000 for a course that would be do-able, I just can't take out loans until my tuition is settled. I've got the basics of programming and electrical engineering under my belt, but not enough to get a job. I was looking into working as an EEG technician or something since the certification courses are relatively quick and it mostly revolves around setting up and monitoring equipment, and the fact that I work in the medical field would probably make finding an entry level position easier. I just need something that will pay enough that I could get a cheap apartment and live on my own while saving up to pay off my school. Eventually I want to get back on track, but if I need to inch my way towards that goal then I at least want to have some freedom while doing so."
1wyuwc,884,2014-02-04,My Story of Getting A Job at Naughty Dog,Allen_Chou,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1wyuwc/my_story_of_getting_a_job_at_naughty_dog/,"Hi, all:  
  
  
Here's my story of getting a job at Naughty Dog. The post finally got approved by their PR :)  
  
Their PR specifically asked me not to divulge any details on the interview questions. Sorry about that.   
  
http://allenchou.net/2014/02/joining-naughty-dogs-kennel/  
  
  
I got an offer from Naughty Dog at the beginning of last November in 2013, and I’ve accepted it. I will start working for Naughty Dog mid-May this year after my graduation from DigiPen Institute of Technology at the end of April. I was told that this is the first time Naughty Dog has given an offer to a college grad. Naughty Dog has been my dream company for so many years (since junior high if I recall correctly), and that was the best day of my life!  
  
Some of my friends at DigiPen were curious about how this entire thing happened and asked me to write a blog post about it, so here it is. I wrote this post right after the offer, and it took a while for me to actually publish it because I was waiting for Naughty Dog’s PR to review this post. It got approved last week, and here it is :)  
  
**It All Started at GDC 2013**  
  
Earlier this year, I went to GDC with a couple of my friends from DigiPen. We were not able to afford the all-access pass, so we bought the cheapest expo hall pass, which gave us 3-day access to the GDC expo hall. That being our first time to GDC, our plan was to practice meeting people from the industry and selling ourselves.  
  
We spent the first morning just wandering around the expo hall, checking out various booths and demos. We were very lost and did not know what to do in the midst of such massive event. After fooling around for long enough, my friend and I started with the smaller booths; we gave out a few resumes and business cards, and we talked to several recruiters. We then got bored and headed out for lunch; afterwards, we resumed our mindless quest in the expo hall.  
  
And all of a sudden, something caught my friend’s eye.  
  
“Hey. That lady over there is wearing a Naughty Dog shirt. We should go talk to her.”  
  
“No…it’s so awkward. (I’d really like to talk to her, though.)”  
  
“I’m just gonna go for it. Come on.”  
And so we went.  
  
My friend tapped her on the shoulder and introduced us to her. It turned out that she was a recruiter from Naughty Dog.  
  
“I’m on my way to meet one of the lead programmers from Naughty Dog, you guys want to come talk to him?”  
  
“Yeah!”  
We couldn’t believe that we were so lucky!  
  
So we followed her to the lecture hall to meet with the lead programmer, and we spent a couple hours chatting together, mostly about how to prepare ourselves for the game industry as a student.  
  
That is how we made our first connection with Naughty Dog.  
  
After GDC, I still kept in touch with the recruiter, asking her various questions on how I can apply for Naughty Dog when I graduate.  
  
My plan was to apply for Naughty Dog about three months before graduation. I would have had plenty of time to study for the interview (the lead programmer told me at GDC: “Always study for your interviews!”). But as you know, things don’t usually turn out as you have planned.  
  
**And There Came Microsoft**  
  
In 2012, I passed the first-round on-campus interview with Microsoft for a summer internship, but I didn’t get into the final-round on-site interview. Microsoft automatically entered me to the final round on-site interview for a full-time position after my graduation around late October 2013.  
  
The day after my on-site interview with Microsoft, I was informed that I got an offer with a two-week deadline. Normally, one would have been very excited: Microsoft is one of the best companies to work for as a software engineer. But I had something else in mind: “If I take this offer, this means good-bye to the game industry I’ve always dreamed of for at least a few years.”  
  
I called my dad for advice.  
  
“Congratulations. But haven’t you always wanted to work for that one game company (Naughty Dog)?”  
  
“Yeah. My plan was to apply for Naughty Dog next year, but now I have a two-week deadline from Microsoft,” I sighed.  
  
“What are you waiting for then? Don’t you know the recruiter? Ask them if they can give you an early interview!”  
  
*The Phone Interviews**  
  
In the next morning, I wrote an email to the Naughty Dog recruiter, explaining my situation. She told me that they could start an accelerated interview process for me, so I could know whether I would get an offer from Naughty Dog before Microsoft’s deadline.  
  
Then, I got a phone call from the recruiter later the same day at 2:30pm.  
  
“Allen, we’re gonna give you a first-round technical phone interview at 4pm. Get your phone charged. Get ready, and don’t freak out.”  
  
Well, I freaked out.  
  
I grabbed my earphones and started listening to meditation music, trying to calm myself down at DigiPen’s parking lot before the phone interview.  
  
It was time. I reserved a meeting room and got myself some papers. The phone interview lasted only 15 minutes.  
  
Immediately after it finished, I got a phone call from the recruiter again.  
  
“Allen. You got 100% on the first round. Second round is at 5pm. Get ready. Don’t freak out.”  
  
Well, I freaked out again. I listened to more meditation music at the parking lot as I waited for the next interview.  
  
The second round was longer and more technical. This time it lasted around an hour.  
  
After the phone interview, the recruiter called again.  
  
“Allen. We’re gonna fly you over next week for an on-site interview.”  
  
I had three years to prepare for the entrance exams for high school and college, but I only got one week to prepare for probably the most important test in my life! I was so excited and nervous at the same time.  
  
The week before the on-site interview was a hectic one. I had to take classes at DigiPen during the day, and study for the interview at night. I read through all my old class notes and whatever books I thought were relevant. Luckily, some professors were kind enough to give me extensions for homework assignments after I told them about the interview, so I had a little more extra time to study.  
  
**The On-Site Interview**  
  
They flew me to the LAX airport on a Sunday afternoon. I spent my final hours in the hotel that night reading though the class notes and a physics textbook I brought with me (that was the heaviest thing in my carry-on luggage).  
  
The next morning, I arrived at Naughty Dog. And so my on-site interview started. I was interviewed by one of the co-presidents of Naughty Dog and two lead programmers. It was indeed a very technical interview. I got stuck a little bit on a couple questions; however, I was able to come up with answers to every question in the end. Time passed by so fast that I didn’t realize that it was almost time for lunch.  
  
After having lunch with the two lead programmers, I was told by the recruiter to meet with the co-president in his office.  
  
“So this is the final round,” I told myself.  
  
I took a deep breath, and walked in to the co-president’s office.  
  
“Allen. Have a seat,” said the co-president.  
  
I sat down, nervously waiting for whatever difficult technical questions he prepared for me during the final round.  
  
“We’ve decided to give you an offer.”  
  
My jaw dropped, literally.  
  
“…What?”  
  
“After the interview, we thought we liked you, so we’re giving you an offer.”  
  
I got an offer from Naughty Dog! I still couldn’t believe it when I walked outside the office building, dragging my luggage, also carrying the Naughty Dog mug and t-shirts they gave me.  
  
That was an unbelievably crazy week, and my dream of working at Naughty Dog has come true. This entire thing happened only because my friend and I ran into a recruiter from Naughty Dog at GDC by accident.  "
1wyxc0,3,2014-02-04,"[Critique: Heavy] Narrative on first dating experience. Does anything glare off the page? Is the pacing okay? Do you see a ""thesis"" of some sort? (1900 words)",[deleted],WritersGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1wyxc0/critique_heavy_narrative_on_first_dating/,"I am sitting in the driver’s seat of my parent’s green jeep at midnight in Canby, a farm town an hour south of Portland. I can hear the jeep’s v6 engine hum its low tone and the wiper blades pulsing away the rain, too slowly. I should turn the speed of the blades up a notch, but instead I turn them off. The rain gets louder, like a rolling curtain of applause above me in congratulations for turning eighteen years old moments ago. She left me. I know that now as I look out the passenger window, into country darkness, at the tiny porchlight above her door and the window with closed curtains to its right.

“May I walk you to the door?” I remember weakly asking. My body was frozen in the driving position when I asked this—hands on the wheel, head aimed foreword with the headlights—poised for either a yes or no, my heart thunking in my ears. I wanted her to say yes. Truth is, I wanted to embrace her at the steps, bring her close, tilt her head and cup her chin just below the ears and kiss her. Just like in Gone With the Wind, or any other romance. Dating her never would have worked out, but kissing her to see what kissing’s all about, and to fulfill the promise I made in seventh grade to kiss a girl before turning eighteen, could have worked. She politely declined and got out and went inside. I remember watching the front door close and looking at the clock behind the steering wheel glow a dim 12:03.

A sensation like molten iron runs down the center of my back and up my arms to the steering wheel. My hands grip the wheel so tightly they are shaking. I want to tear the thing in half. “What’s the point… nothing matters… it’s all nothing in the end, why live” I say, gushing the words incoherently in a string together. I abruptly switch off the headlights, release the park, and slam the gas pedal. Blindly, I accelerate down one of Canby’s empty roads fit for tractors and chicken trucks, away from her, away from failure. Somehow I remain on the road. Maybe it’s the orange black sky contrasting the trees and road like a flattened yinyang that keeps me from dragging the wheel left or right too sharply into a tree, sign, or the river. Nothing matters, I am thinking again. I did not even ask her to prom in person.

A month back, I had a friend stuff a tennis ball with my name on it into her backpack during lunch. That day I drove home early from school and waited for her call in the kitchen, cooking macaroni on the stovetop. When the phone rang, a surge of excitement hit me like an electric fork poking me in the chest, and I answered her call without saying anything. “I’d love to go with you,” she said. It was as if she said it in person.

While eating the pasta, I thought about the events of the day. I was annoyed with myself for not staying at school. Going home early felt like an act of cowardice. Why not just man up, I thought. Yet again, my shyness got the best of me. On the first day of high school, I approached a group of classmates who were discussing a topic that interested me, probably video games or the latest technology, but I do not remember. One of them noticed me standing in the back and asked, “Why are you here?” I felt like an intern walking into a room full of CEOs discussing financial strategy and chomping at cigars. Another memory cropped up of the high school bully shouting, “Fatty fatty!” at me in the locker room. I should have asked her in person, should have taken her hand when she accepted the tennis ball or, better yet, should have done so with flowers, in class, singing with a guitar in my lap and a song composed with her name in it.

The next day, I went with my mom to Men’s Wearhouse to find a suit. I wanted the best rental I could find, the eyelash batting kind, one that would dazzle her. In the store, rows of suits in red and pink and white hung on the back wall, exquisite among the black and gray ones. The white suit reminded me of my grandfather who had received a white rental on accident for my parent’s wedding. As the family story goes, he looked resplendent on the dance floor waltzing with my grandmother. Better yet, they had not spoken to each other in years and there they were, dancing.

A tall, maybe six foot eight, man with gauges earrings and a pink bowtie guided me through each style of suit. When I asked him about the more colorful options, he laughed and said I would stick out like a sore thumb. He helped me settle for a black tuxedo with a vivid green vest, color enough to at least stand out, and dazzle.

After driving a mile, I pull off to the side and shut the engine off. To my left are fir trees and railroad tracks running parallel to the road. The rain on the tracks sounds like an overfilled gutter. Occasionally, a large splash rings out on the metal. My eyes are closed.

My date and I began the prom night arriving forty minutes late to Rose’s Restaurant because I had driven to the wrong location. The four other couples we were supposed to sit with had already finished eating by the time we sat down to order. I did not eat much of my caeser salad, the quickest meal on the menu, and neither did she eat hers. I felt nauseous.

Less than an hour later, she was leading me with her hand onto the dance floor. The ballroom was massive, with two story high ceilings and curtains hanging to the floor. The DJ in the back lit up the darkened room acoustically with four refrigerator-sized speakers and visually with strobing reds, blues, greens, and yellows and disco balls and lasers. Macklemore’s “Can’t Hold Us” blared into the throng of dancing, twerking, and moshing teens, their bodies an undulating mass of arms with one another. We joined them for the next few songs.

By the third song, my stomach ached. It was when I was caught in the middle with a shoulder gouging my chest and someone’s knee kicking me down low that I realized it was too much. I was going to be sick. My tie felt like a burning rope around my neck being dragged and yanked around by the dancers. I ditched my date for the bathroom in a sprint, straining for air.

For an hour I hid in one of the stalls with my shirt off. My bald government teacher had seen me surfing the walls with my hand toward the bathroom and gotten me water. At least in the stalls the music took on a muffled, soothing sound where I could recoup for the last dance.

Knowing I could not abandon my date, especially for the last song, I gulped a last bit of water, put on my shirt, minus the tie, and punched open the bathroom door. This last dance was serious business, as everyone knows that at the end, all dates kiss. I strode down the hall to the ballroom with my shoulders back and chest out. There she was, leaning on the wall to the right of the main doors with a glass of orange juice up to her lips. Her flame orange hair shimmered in the disco light escaping from cracks of the doorway. For the first time I noticed the emerald green dress she was wearing, simple in design but fitted precisely to her track-runners frame. Without words, I took her orange juice and promenaded her onto the dance floor.

The DJ had turned all the lights off, save for the disco ball which cast a slowly drifting starscape of lights on us. “I Won’t Give Up” by Jason Mraz began to play. I had never been this close to a woman before. My ear touched her ear while we slowly turned step-by-step in the darkness. I felt every detail of her body vividly as she pressed close to me. Her head was a scratchy blur on my shoulder, like winter wool too close to see clearly, and her perfume gave off a hallucinogenic melody of vanilla and high-desert pine. I was gone, in another place of unrivaled peace.

Gradually, the song came to a close. In the pleasant silence after the lights came on, I looked into her eyes and she looked into mine. We stood there, motionless; my six-foot frame in an unbuttoned, shiny green vest complemented her dress and her soft, slim form, like Beauty and the Beast gone twenty-first century. I did not want the moment to end. Rather than kiss her, like the rest of the couples around us were doing, I leaned forward to where my lips touched her ear and gruffly whispered, “Your ear is wet,” which was the first thing to come to mind. Bam, like a gun, the moment fell apart. She shoved me away to get in the exit line. I followed after a few seconds of hasty introspection, tried to grab her hand, but she crossed her arms and looked away.

Fat raindrops pelt the window hard, sounding like TV static. In the darkness I suck in salty tear drops and gurgle out, “That’s just not me.” My ears ring with the echoes the students I sit next to every day narrating their encounters with parties, alcohol, women and men, sports, kissing, and loving. The coil inside me snaps. In sudden fury, I punch the steering wheel and dashboard, bang the windows and claw at the seats; I lose it there and calm only when I’m gasping to breath under all the self-pitying tears. Minutes pass with me sagging in the driver’s side—I think of the birthday cake tomorrow morning, which I choose not to eat as punishment.

“Sometimes,” I start before taking another breath, “Sometimes you got to be someone else first to find out who you really are.” A surge of rain collides onto the roof of the car. It’s strange how rain sounds just like the ocean, well down to the cresting waves and shoreline. I roll onto my side and wipe the tears from my face to see out the window. I feel better then. Relaxed. I know I am not that suave guy I spent so much time donning the mask of during the school days. The social guy, the attention seeker and partygoer—a half mask, more correctly, like the Phantom. Silence is not my sin; it is part of who I am. Off in the distance I see a blurry yellow light coming down the tracks, flash, flash, flash between the trees. It is one of the big brown trains with cars spanning as long as a mile. I do not wait to count how many. By the time the train passes, I am going home.

They have always bombarded me verbally about my behavior, my characteristics and goals in life. Especially my mother, whom has brought up her dissapointments in me every time we were together. Not one day goes by without her reconization of my failures. My mom, my sisters, aunts, uncles and even family friends are all part taking in this bombardment. They discuss how disappointed they are of my height, the way I ate, why I eat so little, why I'm dating out of our Asian race, why I gotten a degree in business and every possible bickering topic you can think of that relates to life. They compared me to other child of same age through out my teens and young adult life. My mom would ask questions such as ""You ""see such and such"" making this amount of money by doing ""such as such"". Why can't you make that much money? Everyday I experience pressure and consultant from my mother regarding my life and what I am supposed to do with it. When I was earning my 4 year undergrad degree, she constantly phone me and told me that going to college was a waste of my time and money. She explained that I needed to work in the family business and that's the only way to make a lot of money. She explained that even with a degree and getting a company job, I will only be slaving and earning shit. I won't be able to support my self and I won't even manage to support my wife if I had one. I appreciate the hardship my mother and sisters endured to provide for me. Without them, I wouldn't be able to stand where I stand today and have what I have. However, I can't be the person my mother want me to be. I want live an American dream. Have a degree, work a successful white collar career, have a loving wife of my choice, a few kids and a dog. I don't care for the amount of money I earn, just as long as I can support myself and a family. Moreover, A) I didn't want to spend 12 hours a day 7 days a week in the family business. B) I am tired of the family business, my whole life was surrounded by it. From the age of 7 to 20, I would always be present at the family business and help out until closing. And because of this, I never made many childhood friends, I never interacted with friends outside of elementary, high school and college. I resulted in having a few friends that I cherish dearly. I want to break away from my mother's expectations and crave my own career path. I now have graduated with two business subject degrees with money from a scholarship I obtained in high school. I'm making my dream come true. But there's still one more obstacle I need to overcome in achieving my independence. And that is finding a job with my degree, work and internship experience. I realized that finding a career was extremely difficult for me. Even with work and internship experience, I fail at getting a job. I'm prying and subjecting myself to several job applications a week. Hoping that, soon I'll be able to make my dream come true. It has been about 9 months since my graduation and search for employment . My time is limited, I know my mother is demanding me to switch gears soon. I fear I am unable to live a life style I want. I am so close to the finish line."
1wzaxo,12,2014-02-04,tired. depressed. lonely. done.,finallydecidedtopost,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1wzaxo/tired_depressed_lonely_done/,"I'll start this post by apologizing for the long wall of text that is to follow. I have been a lurker here for almost four years fighting my personal battle against depression/suicide and now I have reached a breaking point. I'm personally hoping writing this will somehow relieve some of that pain so here it goes.

My depression probably started my sophomore/junior year of high school. I attended a high school of generally well-off (middle-&gt;high class) students. During freshman year, I was oblivious to the world and stayed sheltered by my computer. But during the next three years, I started experiencing high school. For the most part I had fun, made friends and the like. During those years I developed a crush for a female friend who I would probably call my first close friend. It was the generic high school one-sided affection that carried on for almost two years. I never had the courage to take it further. However, during the middle of junior year she found a boyfriend. This is probably when I would say my depression started.

Throughout my life I had never had any real friends until her. (Other friends would just play video games with me or ignore me.) But when she got a boyfriend, we drifted a part. Slowly at first but by senior year we no longer held a conversation for more than a couple minutes. I felt alone and isolated. The pain started off small but as I realized I had no one to share my feelings with, it grew worse and worse. I tried making another close friend, another real friend. (most of the guys I was friends with were immature and focused mostly on gaming.) That actually happened throughout the first bit of senior year. She was another person I could talk to. Our friendship grew (not without bumps-sometimes quite large) but by prom season, I actually managed to ask her to prom. There I fucked up. Lost her friendship. And re-entered depression. 

I should have been happy. I had just gotten into a top 20 University but I wasn't. I had no one to share it with. No one to talk to and I entered college more depressed than ever. Freshman year of college I  was a hermit. Stayed in my room, missed half my classes and made no attempt to make new friends. I somehow still ended up reconnecting with one of my friends from high school. Over the year, she became the one reason I didn't want to commit suicide then and there. Personally I thought we were close enough to start a relationship but again I didn't have the courage. And again she found a boyfriend. And again I lost my third and last close friend.

And now here I am. It's been a hard year trying to find a reason to live. I've failed at almost everything since getting to college. Classes, internships and friendships. I cry myself to sleep every night thinking about my future and about how I'll end alone, working a dead-end job (Janitor) with no social interaction. It sounds generic and cliche but this nightmare is how I sleep every night. I haven't had a real conversation with anyone in almost half a year. Never had a relationship my entire life and at three points of my life I lost three of my closest friends due to my cowardice/stupidity.  My now friends and I do homework together and then we leave. I've thought about suicide now almost on a daily basis. 

I've done a poor job telling the story but it's hard to think. I'm not a good person. I've done many things I regret. I lie, I cheat, my ego is huge and I suck at talking. I'm ugly, overweight and lack any skills. Looking back, I wondered why I even exist. If I was to die now, the world would have one less mouth to feed, my peers would have one less student to compete with, my parents wouldn't have to pay thousands for tuition; the world would run exactly the same except a little part of the problem would be gone.

I doubt any one will have made it this far. I'm not sure if writing this was even the right choice. I've just seen the types of posts on /r/SW and I now believe I am at risk of taking the next step (regardless of my cowardice.) Thanks for anyone who has read this and I won't waste anymore of your time. "

So anyhoo, I made the rounds looking for a good placement, and I've been acccepted at two places: A fairly large private school, working under their IT administrator; and at a company where I'd work as the resident IT support for their branch (apparently they have been relying on someone on their staff who's somewhat computer savvy, but they want someone there full time).

Normally I'd be tempted to take the school position, since I would be working under someone who's been in the field for a while, and could better inform me on many issues and topics. However, the insurance company has expressed a strong interest in hiring me after my internship period has ended (if all goes well), even going so far as to ask my desired salary. 

So... I don't really know what to do. Any suggestions?

1wztp1,2,2014-02-04,Trying to overcome so much,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1wztp1/trying_to_overcome_so_much/,"So I broke up with a girl that I loved about a month ago.  I'm in my mid twenties, have only had 3 relationships.  None of the relationships were very healthy, all of them ended poorly.  Growing up, my father had a domineering personality so I never was allowed to contact girls before college, much less have a girlfriend.  As a result, I'm constantly insecure/uncertain about myself when I'm in a relationship.  I tend to rush things in a relationship and this usually turns girls off.


My first gf (or at least a girl I thought was my gf) was in first year of college.  She would come over to my room to watch movies on weekends, we'd hang out and eat together, over Christmas break she visited her grandma who happened to live 15 min from my parents’ home and we went to the theater together.  I tried to hold her hands during the movie.  After we got back to school, her friend told me that I was moving too fast for her in trying to hold her hands.  It didn't help that another guy on my floor who I considered a friend started making moves on her.  Before long, the two of them hooked up.  I was disappointed, but more at my guy friend than the girl (we had already signed a lease together for our sophomore year of college).  Also, for someone who was scared of holding hands too fast she certainly was comfortable making out with him pretty quickly.


The second girlfriend I got (and again, I don't know if this really counts) started off towards the end of 3rd year.  Again, we did pretty typical date stuff: watched movies, ate meals together, talked all the time.  At the beginning of summer, I started an internship which happened to be near where she lived.  On our first date during the summer, there was a tropical thunderstorm.  Literally, street lights were out, trees were knocked over, most restaurants were closed.  She was trying to take me to her fav restaurants, but bc everything was shut down we ended up eating at McDonalds lol.  We held hands as we walked to the car though and I was really happy.  Everything was going well until she went on a study abroad program in France.  Before she left, I thought it'd be cute to give her a stuffed animal from my childhood, to remind her of me.  However, when she came back, she changed so much.  I tried to stay off social media bc I know I can get jealous, but I had to know why she stopped talking to me, being really short with her answers, etc.  I thought she had found another guy; later I found out this wasn't the case but whatever the reason she just made me feel like I was doing all the work in trying to talk with her so I just gave up.


So...basically during these first 2 ""relationships"" I hadn't even kissed a girl.  I think the first girl made me fearful of initiating any type of physical intimacy with a girl, since her friend told me that was the reason she got scared off.  Thinking back on this, this was probably a bullshit excuse and I just didn’t recognize that I was friend zoned.  
Between the 4th year of college and my most recent ex, I managed to make out with a few girls and have unsuccessful sex with 3 girls (unsuccessful bc I have ED and PE).


Enter my most previous relationship.  When we started off, I had to pinch myself.  I couldn’t believe a girl like her existed.  She was smart, funny, liked video games, was a triathlete (amazing body), read the same books as I did, liked the same TV shows, cared about the future, etc etc.  She was an inspiration to me so I started eating better, exercising more, and started studying the GMATs for business school.  We started dating sometime this past September.  I probably would have fucked up our relationship quickly, but I actually have become best friends with another girl who helped me tell me when to hold back.  My girlfriend and I hung out nearly every week.  We made out several times, and tried to have sex as well.  However, this time my ED was so bad I couldn’t even get any lift off.  After this experience, I tried explaining what my issue was but she seemed to think it was just performance anxiety.  


I know I had porn induced ED though, so I started NoFap.  Unfortunately, this was also the time our relationship got rocky.  Several things coincided at once: (1) She started this training program at work which made her inaccessible to talk during the day (2) she also was dealing with her ex hassling her (3) she was in the middle of moving apartments (4) I think I started growing super anxious due to NoFap throwing off my brain chemistry (5) I started falling in love with her since she was the first girlfriend I tried to have sex with (6) I was also probably dealing with inadequacy issues since our first attempt at sex sucked so bad that I wanted to explain.  
Ultimately, what happened was that the 2 weeks heading into the holidays, we were unable to meet up (she kept canceling/being too busy to hang out).  She also had already made new year’s plans which did not include me.  I thought this meant we were broken up, so I basically told her we should just be friends (I actually meant it bc at this point, I still really liked her).  I also read a relationship book at this time, and it basically said that if things are heading for a breakup the only way to potentially rescue it is to make the other person feel a sense of loss.  Her response to the breakup was that I was projecting my insecurities, and seemed angry at me for breaking things off.  I actually took this as a positive sign, and called her.  Basically we agreed to meet up and talk about our relationship.  Foolish me.  After the new year, she was busy the first two weekends.  The third weekend, she blocked me on social media and stopped all communication.  I sent her a message saying she was a hypocrite.  Her response was basically, “yeah, good-bye.”


So the reason I’m venting all this stuff out is lately I’ve been fantasizing about her more often.  I know we only went out for 3 months, but as I’ve admitted, I haven’t had a whole lot of experience with girls or relationships so I think I probably fall harder and faster than most guys.  It’s also a pretty stressful time in my life.  I’m on Day 60 of NoFap, I’m studying GMATs to prepare for business school, I’ve been training for a 10k, I have some issues with my health, and I’m also dealing with one of my few good friends in the area being mad at me.  On top of all this, I think I deal with a bit of an identity crisis when I’m dating.  Due to my insecurity (which I think stems from abandonment/emotional unavailability issues from my parents as a child), I tend to only try to date really hot girls (like 7s or above).  I believe I’ve had the opportunity to date more women (actually…if I’m being honest I know I have) but I only really feel vested to pursue a girl if she’s an 8 or above.  The thing with me is…on the inside I’m a nerd.  However, I do know how to dress well (I’ve been asked if I’m a metrosexual which would make my roommates crack up cuz I’ve worn stained clothing around the house), and I can be fairly charismatic when I have the energy to  (studied PUA material).  Basically, I think the girls I go after tend to be ones who are more difficult to deal with on the account of them being chased after their entire lives, and it doesn’t help that I’m so terrible at navigating relationships.  


TLDR: haven’t had much experience with dating/being in a relationship.  I rush things which leads to me ruining things.  Trying to do a lot right now, feeling overwhelmed.

[Version 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fgu212lvclhvkpt/Reddit%20Resume%20Critique%202.pdf) (Removed contradiction in projects and irrelevant point in web admin as pointed out of \u\yellowjacketcoder)

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student from University of Toronto looking forward to a summer internship in the USA. I took some time off from school after my 2nd year for an internship at a multinational enterprise software corporation. I'd like to find a position at a San Francisco start-up to get a feel for the environment and pace.

I've been using Indeed.com for the majority of my search. I've also been looking through AngelList, Internship.com and HackerNews. My school's career fairs and career centre postings are mostly Canadian companies, which I am not as interested in currently. If someone can point me to some resources, I would very much appreciate it.

I understand I lack substantial programming and I'm working towards fixing this. I've been learning from Udacity and Coursera courses as a starting point and I have some ideas lined up. I don't think I will be able to complete them before the internship application period for this summer closes but I will be using my github as source control for the code and I will put them on my resume when I have a substantial portion completed, even if incomplete, so that potential employers will have the opportunity to look at them.

Thank you!"

1x08ih,9,2014-02-04,GF in New York and me traveling Europe. My LDR situation...,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1x08ih/gf_in_new_york_and_me_traveling_europe_my_ldr/,"I just found this subreddit. Thought I'd share my situation and get everyones thoughts. I also would love to know success stories etc. 

My gf is 20 and I am 24. I met here through a friend. She is Swedish and I am Australian. I had been living in Europe 4 years and took a trip to Sweden where I later met her after she played a music gig at a town festival in a city called Uppsala. It's important to note the my gf is a musician in a pretty well known band. 

I ended up staying and moving to Sweden from England to simply stay with her and because I love Sweden (Scandinavian lover). We were together 5 months and I had to move from my apartment (Stockholm apartments are very expensive and hard to find). I ended up moving in with her, we lived together for 10 months.

My gf left for her internship just before New Years. We never thought we'd end up doing a LDR but we fell in love and well why fuck something up that makes you both happy? We decided to go through with a LDR and it's been nearly 6 weeks, to be honest it's easier than I thought.

I decided to travel around Europe (again) and left on the 2nd of Jan. I wanted to visit some countries I hadn't seen and because travel is awesome. My gf and me find it super hard at times and for a while I was being a paranoid fool (this however passed a few weeks back). I miss everything about her but skype, facebook and other social media outlets and apps allow us to maintain heaps on contact. 

Things that bother me:

Firstly, I sometimes feel I am restricting her from having fun and being 20. I feel like her having a bf while abroad makes her have less fun. 

Second, I worry about other guys hitting on her, I know she would never cheat on me but don't know how to overcome this thing about other guys making their moves and my girl. 

Third, will things be different when I see her again in April? will she still love me? will it be awkward?

Fourth, what's the best way to keep the spark while apart?

Any advice, success stories and/or questions feel free.

1x0aio,274,2014-02-04,Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Mindcrack,Chilangosta,mindcrack,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1x0aio/everything_i_need_to_know_i_learned_from_mindcrack/,"**Intro**

A year and a half ago I wasn't doing so well. I'd gotten married just six months previously, and while our marriage was great, I wasn't doing so well in the rest of my life. And it wasn't a sudden thing; my life had kinda been sliding for a while before that as well.

I had a number of responsibilities that I just was letting slide. School, work, community stuff - I just couldn't get it to all juggle. Once in a while it would seem like I was getting things going again, and then boom, something else would happen and it felt like the whole Jenga tower just would fall over again...

**[Drowns Sorrows in Youtube]**

Then I started watching Mindcrack. I was an avid Minecraft player, but I was getting so busy that I wasn't able to get my Minecraft fix in by playing :0 and so I started watching first Etho, then SethBling (before he was one of the guys) and then I got sucked into some epic UHC episodes and because of that, started watching Pause and Beef and Doc and then I discovered Bdubs and fell in LOVE with his building style, and I went back and saw King of the Ladder, and Guude's Fun House, and the pranks, and I just started watching the community in general.

**Warm Fuzzies**

It may seem like it's all fun and games, but underneath it all lies a lot of really good, heartwarming stuff that I believe sets a good example for those that need someone to look to. It was really neat to see the livestreams to donate to charity, and the community response to help out with GennyB's cat care, and Baj's cats when he needed to find a place for them, and more recently the Bdubs family announcement! and it just is great.

More specifically though, as I started to watch these guys I became impressed with the amount of dedication and preparation it took to ""play"" like they do. This is work, and while I know it sometimes weighs on them, it also is really inspirational. I started to notice how the Etho and Bdubs (and the others as well) would start a project by gathering resources, preparing the terrain, setting up co-ops with other players, and getting it all set up in general *before* starting to work. And it had a profound effect on me. I started thinking through my days more, my future more, and almost without realizing it I began to plan the more important things in my life. It started off with my meals ('cause food is near and dear to my heart!) and with my notes from class, little things like that. Then I started to work on bigger projects in my life: organizing my desk, cleaning up after myself more, actually preparing for class beforehand so I wasn't so lost. I started putting more into my work, looking at my future career and what I wanted to do with my life. I even started to enjoy the preparation, because I knew that in my small preparations I was preparing the ground for something great.

Because there was something behind all the preparations that the Mindcrack guys make. They knew that after all the hard work came the rewards, and they had the discipline and foresight to stick to it, even when it was a *lot* of work in some cases (e.g. Ad's Casino, the Arena, the Great Flood, and many, many more). And that stuck with me. And it's made a significant difference in my life.

**Takeaways**

* My grades have gone from a D-C average to a B+-A average
* I actually understand what's being taught in class because I come prepared
* I enjoy school *soooo* much more now, which is a bigger deal even than the previous points to me
* My living conditions are much cleaner, and it makes me happy
* My relationship with my wife and friends is better
* I remember important events and dates much better
* I'm in my second internship and looking forward to a third this summer
* I have potential job offers awaiting me in a field that I *love* to work in
* I know what I want to do with my life
* I have time for my hobbies (including Minecraft) without feeling guilty for not doing other important things

In sum, I'm really, really grateful to the guys on the Mindcrack server for showing me how to live up to my dreams and meet the challenges of life. I know they don't have it easy, but they made it easier for me. I'll keep watching and keep donating for as long as they are around, because they've made me a better person, and I bet they make life better for all of you too. In more than just entertaining ways.

Oh, and we recently discovered we're expecting a baby, right around when Bdubs is! I'm stoked to be a dad with Bdubs; every time he says something about his kid it makes me happy because it reminds me of what I have to look forward to. And I hope to share these videos someday with my kids because I really believe that they are some of the best the Internet (and the world) have to offer!

###TL;DR Everything I need to know in life I learned from Mindcrack.###

Thanks guys!"
1x0bel,1,2014-02-04,Tech writing intern. My boss asked me to do something that seems off... is this normal?,pleasehelptechwtr,techwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/techwriting/comments/1x0bel/tech_writing_intern_my_boss_asked_me_to_do/,"I recently accepted a technical writing internship at my college. I'm supposed to document a software process. Unfortunately, I am the department's first intern, and they didn't think through how to handle interns. I only go two days a week, but it's week four, and they still can't decide the purpose of the document or the intended audience. It's extremely frustrating. But that's not what I need to ask...

The person I work under is taking heat from someone a few levels up the org chart. I don't fully understand the issue, but I am being asked to move ALL of the work on my hard drive (including personal notes) to a SharePoint folder that can be viewed by everyone above me. I am being asked to work on a live server that can be viewed by them at any time.

My work isn't a secret, it's just that I am not accustomed to every word being tagged and monitored. I have to make every mistake in public. 

Is this how you guys work? This is my first paid tech writing gig, so I really don't know if this is normal. There's nothing I can do about it (I'm just an intern), but I'd like to know if this is a common practice in the industry. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

1x0f2s,3,2014-02-04,I have a goal and I'm going to see it out.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1x0f2s/i_have_a_goal_and_im_going_to_see_it_out/,"A few days before NYE, I was delivering a pizza to this one girl's house. When I opened the door, some guy with a Brooklyn accent gasped when he saw me and dragged me into the house. Weird shit happens to me every day so I just roll with it without freaking out. He sat me down and wanted to know what my story was, where I'm from, how my life is, yada yada. So I spill most of my beans. I tell him about my shitty childhood, losing all of my friends in college, how I just graduated and have been looking for a job. He goes off on a tangent about how they weren't really good for me anyway, how I should just let the bad wash off of me, and build my own family from my current friends. He tells me that 2014 is going to be the best year of my life and he's going to put as much energy into my future as he can. Not being much of a spiritual person, I just nod and smile. We then get up and hug each other before we go our seperate ways. 

The thing that's still bugging me about this is that I didn't tell him what would make my year the best ever. My depression has evolved over the last year to the point where my goals and ambitions have fallen to the side for a proper chance at a quick death. I used to want a family, close friends, and a happy life like the guy said but I don't want that stuff anymore. Not saying that this stranger's words are the truth or anything like that, but I'm just entertaining the thought. Because honestly, I can see me dying this year as my best year ever. 

Buuuuuuut, I don't have a decent job or a peaceful place I want to do it in (yay homelessness). I have this image in my head that I can't shake of my suicide and I don't think I would be able to get away with it if I was to cut corners. Ergo, I need money. So I've got a plan set up. There's a few things I still kind of want to experience before I die so I've got a list of goals in order to help me get there. 

1. Volunteer more, especially at my former internship site. A position is going to become available in March as one guy is going to leave for Oklahoma with his family and all of the people who have interned there before have gotten jobs when a position became available. Plus, I'm one of those people who has free time as their worst enemy so I think more time helping others is less time for self pity. 
2. Apply for jobs for only an hour a day. All this job hunting and failed interviews (HR people are straight up evil in my personal opinion) is probably stressing me out more than I need to be. Unlike others, I have a deadline on my unemployment so I shouldn't be stressing me out with my 20+ applications a day. Plus, I work about 15 hours a week at the pizza place. I don't bring in tips anymore but it's enough to where I can afford to eat.
3. Acquire an actual job.
4. Fix my car (reason I'm only working 15 hours a week).
5. Get an apartment. Preferably only a single. 
6. Buy a motorcycle. I've been wanting one for a few years now and I want to see what it's like. If possible, I want to get a black one and do a pain job on it with a few pink flowers/stars/waves. 
7. Read all of the books on my to-read list. This is going to take the longest. I'm kind of a slow reader and I have about 30 different books on my current list. Books are about the only thing that give me any joy anymore and the day I lose interest in them will be the worst day of my life.
8. Buy a gun and my favorite bottle of wine. You know the rest. 

The way I see it, this gives me enough time for something to happen to change my views/priorities to where I actually want to live another year or two. If not, I get what I want and no one loses.  "
1x0f7p,2,2014-02-04,My girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) almost completely broke. I'm trying to hold it together.,girlfriendtroubles21,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1x0f7p/my_girlfriend_21f_and_i_21m_almost_completely/,"This is pretty long winded so bare with me:

I have been with my girlfriend for almost four years. We immediately started dating our Freshman year of college. We both came from some real difficult backgrounds that are pretty relevant to our relationship. 

She comes from an abusive household (both physical and mental) which also translated into her relationships throughout High School (physical, mental and sexual). She basically spiraled out of control the summer before college and hooked up with anyone she could because of this. She came into college feeling completely broken and unloved.

I came from a family with an absent father and spent most of my high school life helping my mom keep our family together and work to pay rent. That left me unconfident in myself, very socially awkward and extremely lonely. I never had luck with girls and I never had too much time to dedicate to them with my family. I dated sparsely but came into college an unconfident, lonely man who was looking to turn things around.

So I met my girlfriend and we became fast best friends and a fast couple. We pretty much went from meeting briefly at orientation and together and had sex in 15 days. Yes, looking back it was an absolutely terrible time to get together with both of our backgrounds and we have had our troubles because of it. Our whole first year together she treated me like garbage, but I stayed with her and wanted to help her through her problems. It was an incredibly hard first year but we got through it. I had made great strides in helping her, she no longer wanted to give her body to anyone, she had more friends, was more confident, and she realized how bad she treated me and felt horrible.

She did an incredible amount for me as well. I was no longer lonely, I was incredibly more confident, my finances and life are more in order and I was more sociable. However, to help her I pretty much dedicated all of my time to her. Classic get absorbed with my Freshman year girlfriend and disregard friends.

Our sophomore year we worked more on rebuilding our social lives. She is part of a sorority and became closer with them. I did not stay friends with the group of people I hung out with them. This created a rift between the two of us because she would want to hang out with her friends and it was ""weird"" if her group hung out with me or something like that. I was always very sociable with her friends and from what I could tell they liked me.

The end of sophomore year and the start of our 3rd year I made a true group of friends. However, we both got significantly more busy with classes and work. We both focus hard on school, from our backgrounds we don't have much money of support form out families so we would just work. Our lives pretty much became work, see each other at night and pretty much just stay in because of our exhaustion. This has carried on mostly up to this point. We still did lots of fun things with her sorority events, we went on a bunch of vacations, but things were, what I realize now, very boring. 

We had lived apart for all of this. However, for this fall my girlfriend needed a roommate. She couldn't find anyone to live with and had been hinting heavily that I should ask her, since I would probably be most nights anyway. We came to a mutual agreement that we would. I began contacting realtors and sending her listings which she never commented much on. So now we get to last week.

I had made a comment about emailing a realtor and she lost it. The basic gist was she said she wasn't happy. She said she was bored all the time and our relationship didn't feel special anymore. She would comment how she would feel excited talking to older guys at her internship and when they went out after work as a team. She also dropped she didn't want to live with me and only thought it would hopefully fix our relationship but realized it wouldn't. She also said I was ""too sweet and kind, not manly and forceful"" and wasn't attracted to me anymore. Of course to send totally mixed signals she said she still loved me and cared but the passion is gone.

I wasn't completely shocked, but I was pretty shocked when she said she needed a ""break"" to sort out her feelings. The conversation ended with is agreeing to not really see each other for a little while and talk sparsely as she figured out what she wanted. We met up for brunch last weekend, talked some more, hugged, made out, and I convinced her to agree to dinner on Thursday and to consider going on a Valentine's Day trip I had planned.

I will preface the next part by saying I love my girlfriend with all of my heart. I literally think the sun shines out of this girls ass. I would and have done anything for her. We got past the bad places we were in before and I have loved her through them. I don't want this relationship to break. I realized I wrote a lot of bad about her, but she is the most caring, funny, kind, smartest, sexiest person I know. I don't know what I would do without her.

I do understand her complaints. I know if I just sit back and let her think it would be a no brainer. I need to show her that things in our relationship will change. I want them to change too, it is getting boring just coming home exhausted. So I am taking her out dancing and dinner Thursday (she LOVES to dance) and hopefully skiing next weekend. I know these gestures won't be the deciding factor but I need to show her I am dedicated to making things better. I am not going to let this just shatter.

I guess I am just really looking for advice on the situation. I love her so much, but at the same time I am mad at her, yet I understand. I just want my best friend/girlfriend back. And if it doesn't work out I don't just want to roll over and let it.

tl;dr My girlfriend says she is not longer ""in love"" with me but loves me and cares for me. I need to re-ignite that spark because she is the most important thing to me and I still feel that spark for her."

Does Big4 hire accountants with no professional accounting experience? Or do they hire interns who are recent graduates? Because I would not mind doing internship after graduation and do full-time after that.

I slipped below a 3.0 last semester and I've been trying my best to stop the bleeding while still teaching myself coding and small projects in my spare time.

The thing that really worries me is that I've been applying to interships and jobs since sophmore year and I while nearly all the interviews go well, once they see my 2.8 GPA it's basically over, and give me the ""You did great, but we don't like your grades"" speech I've gotten so used to I can almost finish it for them.

I took my first real programming job 6 months ago. It is a programmer's dream job. Relaxed environment, free snacks/soda/coffee, really smart coworkers, awesome boss who treats us like his family.

I'm not a programmer, and I don't want to be. I'm not a horribly smart guy, and I don't like to stare at code and solve pretty complex problems 8+ hours a day. I've started to hate my life. I cry at least once a week (before this job I rarely ever cried, even under great stress), I don't sleep well even though I still exercise 5-6 times a week. 

The thing that makes me want to kick myself is that I knew I didn't like programming while I was still in school. I took 2 internships during college and HATED them both.

1x1y05,3,2014-02-04,I'm a credit noob with some (several) questions. Please!,nlw92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1x1y05/im_a_credit_noob_with_some_several_questions/,"I just found out about this subreddit, and I can already tell it's going to extremely useful. I've been trying to research credit options and decide what kind of credit card I should get, but it's all sort of going right over my head. 

About me: I'm a recent college graduate (graduated in December), still employed at the tutoring center I worked part-time but looking for something full-time.  I have no student loans because I got scholarships out the ass. I just got married (also in December, big month for me), and my husband has a year of college left (he also has no loans). I'm 21, he's 24. He works full-time (paid internship at a chemical company, and he makes roughly $13/hr). We're financially comfortable because we're frugal and live in a town that has a really low cost of living.

I've got a car loan which will be paid off in April (woo!) that my grandpa co-signed for. I've never missed a payment, but I have been a few days late before.  No more than two days late, tops, but still late. My husband has all of our bills in his name, but has never taken out a loan for anything. Other than my almost-paid-off car, we have no debt.

We're looking to trade in his car he's had since he was 18 for something newer and a bit more reliable. We have a bit of money saved up, but we really want to build credit. We want to take out a &lt;$7,000 loan in one (or both? does that happen?) of our names, and we're also looking at credit cards to build credit so we can have a decent credit score for when we want to buy a house in two or three years. 

So I have some questions:

What kind of credit cards do you guys suggest for a young couple? We've talked about it, and we would only use the credit card to pay our bills, and then pay off the balance monthly on the  due date. I went to a website, but I was lost on all the different types of cards and interests and APRs. 

Does it ruin your credit score if a car payment has been a couple of days late? I've never been more than 2 days late, and it's only happend maybe twice in the 3  years I've had this loan, but I don't know how this stuff works. At all. 

Would a five year loan build more credit than a three year loan for the same amount? Or vice versa?

Would it build our credit faster if we both had seperate credit cards? In this situation, I would use mine for gas and he would use his for bills. We're both responsible and understand that these cards would be used for NOTHING else but bills and gas, and only for amounts that we can pay off monthly.

What kind of loans can a young couple with hardly any credit get? I have very little credit (I don't know an exact number) and I'm pretty sure he has none. 

Where can I see what my credit score is that's safe?

I'm sorry this is so long, but I'm so new at this. In college, it was just make sure my checks get to the right places at the right times, but now that we're planning on buying a home in a few years I want to get a head start so that we're not screwed when it comes time to apply for big loans. "

I have studied various subjects in computer sciences and engineering (optimization, graphs, AI, image processing, multi-threading, embedded systems, signal processing, modelisation) but the subject I like the most is computer graphics. 

Last year I have been working for a research lab in France (as an intern). My job consisted in making a framework for surface reconstruction from point clouds and mesh sculpting. During this internship I learnt a lot about computational geometry and C++ ([CGAL involved](http://www.cgal.org/?__shortid__=hYtX)). I'm also used to regularly make progress report.

I got academic programming experience in C, asm, java, javascript, matlab and all kind of APIs including SDL, SFML, Qt, OpenGL, WebGL, GLSL, CGAL. My ""main"" language is C++ though.

I'd like to work in any area related to computer graphics, but most of all I want to be interested in the subject I'm working on. And I'm interested in a lot of things, so any general programming job is potentially a job I'd like to do!

1x2dpu,6,2014-02-05,"There, and Hopefully Back Again: A Vapor's Tale. By SigmaQuotient",SigmaQuotient,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1x2dpu/there_and_hopefully_back_again_a_vapors_tale_by/,"In a room in a house there lived a Vapor, not a nasty dirty wet room, filled with... Oh.. sorry.
Hi all, I am sigmaQuotient and I am here to share a fun little adventure I had today pertaining to the advancement in my vaping experience. Well.. Enjoy! or don't. 
So today..I suppose technically yesterday since it is 2am EST. I had to get up far earlier than I normally awaken to this world. I was on a quest to take my beloved to the Philly airport for a plane to an internship. Living in the Berks County area, this was a good hour and a half escort quest. So no mindless mob killing or collection quests mind you.
I successfully dropped her off, with a departure filled with kisses and promises of some sweet sweet candy (BAM!) later. As I took the wrong turns, leading me deeper into the city of brotherly love...mayhap carnal.. who knows, but I hope not. Anyway, I was sitting at a traffic light contemplating where being swept out my door may take me. I figured.. HEY! I can go visit The Vapor Chef! After slambamming the coordinates into my phone, I realized ""Bummer, its kinda out of my way, and I have to go to work in a few hours.."" So, sadly I made my way back to the road that goes on and on, down to the door where it began.
Something blasted my mind with rays of intrigue and past memories of a vape shop in Phoenixville. I thought, ""well.. why the fuck not eh?"" So with my trusty steed, Sheila, The Dodge Neon, I plotted my course to lands only partially known. My destination was Liberty Vapor. While this may not seem like much to most, I have only been vaping for 4 months and have never visited a true shop. 
My vape life was a collage of websurfing for the best prices and information. With a hodgepodge of parts from different corners of the Interwebs. My vape at my side is my trusty Vamo V5 with a pink Protank II(I was under the assumption it was red, but the wonderful woman in my life has pointed out.. it is pink) with a rebuilt coil I did myself!
So I drove up the snow drifted streets of Phoenixville to find a wonderful little shop with a sign saying ""Liberty Vapor"" So I dismounted, leaving Sheila to her own accord, and proceeded to enter the shop...
I am immediately hit my the sweet sweet smell of juice. Oh and BY THE GODS it was glorious. It is a clean, beautifully put together store. I kick the snow from my boots and head inside. I sit at the bar and discuss I am a vapor and happened to stop in while on a journey. I was welcomed with open arms by these Cadillac's of men, these...Adonis's of Vapor. I set to discussing vaping while sampling their juices. All of which were lovely. 
I was tempted to purchase myself my first mech, but thought long and hard. Being reminded that I still had a journey, and Sheila needed food and rest. I decided against the purchase of batteries, mech, and RDA. Instead, I indulged myself in their Stars N Stripes juice, which is a wonderfully fresh blend of Strawberry, Blueberry, and Cream. I felt Uncle Sam firmly patting my buttocks as I decided upon it. I smiled and internally shuttered with an orgasm that George Washington probably felt as he beat up British kids. I also picked up my first RDA! an IGO-W4. So after trading currency for supplies, I said my heart felt good byes. In hopes that on my return to the airport, I will return with my lady love and show her the wonders of the shop.
 I mounted my vigilant metallic steed Sheila and drove off into the west... and kinda North. I returned home after many miles, and made my way into the room that is not nasty or dirty. I proceeded to level up my coil making skill and build my first RDA(From 28ga Kanthal and Sterile cotton) which I then took to work with me. I have been using it all day and night, and Love it!
So now, here I sit, recapping my journey with you all, and puffing away on my juice and new RDA. I hope you enjoyed my journey. It was quite fun, and mayhap in the next week, I will venture forth to the cozy tavernesque wonder which is Liberty Vapor. 
Take Care and have a wonderful night.

1x2h5u,2,2014-02-05,My [23 F] girlfriend cheated on me [23 M] after 3 years...,provoked_pinion,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x2h5u/my_23_f_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_23_m_after_3/,"So a recap on the relationship... my ex Sarah always had a crush on me, we have worked together at the same store for 7 years, and go to the same university, in the same hall. I always guessed she liked me, I wasnt too attracted to her. I dated one of her friends for a year, but there was significant time (year plus) before anything started to happen between Sarah and I. Over this time we became good friends, and one night, drunk she came from her room on the couch I was sleeping on, and started cuddling me. Confirming through mutual friends she had feelings for me, I drunkely decide to accept cuddles....This stirred some feelings up for me.. I was confused, feeling guilty and figured I would ask her out, and simply end it if I chose to. I was her first boyfriend, and her first sexual partner

My feelings grew and we dated for three years, going on multiple trips, some with her family, one to Europe. Going to school she gots a 8 month long co-op internship in a city two hours away. We make it for 7 months but by this point I know somehing has been wrong for about 2 months and I am trying to keep it together knowing she will move back within a month...hoping this will help. Halloween rolls around, I have school assignments due and I idiotically tell her to go party with friends. I trusted her

Sarah is sometimes the type of drunk girl that loves attention and will do anything to get it, usually drinking herself into a puking mess. Halloween I figure was one of those nights for Sarah and she decides to kiss her brothers best friend. She texts me at 1130 saying how much she loves me... A week roll by and the distance between us is growing. I barely get any response from texts, and she won't answer my phone calls. (I don't know yet). 

She comes home on the weekend and I immediately ask her if she wants to hangout or is she going to dump me? She starts crying shouts ""YES... ""
I ask her why? 
""Because we have been growing apart....""
""Well we have been long distance, and it has been hard but we are so close...""
""But yes but we don't share the same politcal or religious views..""
I now start getting angry and suspicious and ask her what the real reason is... After bugging her for a half hour she finally blurts out I CHEATED..I flipped out, going off in a manic rage. I go to my friends house and tell him the news. He looks really guilty and says...
""ya, I know she called me the night it happened, she was really drunk... She wasn't going to tell you... I had to give her an ultimatum of either her or me, tell you.""

So now it has been 4 months and she decided to come work at the same store as me. Awkward. I didn't talk to her till last week. I saw her at school she waved and I said hi, like a moron. I don't want to give off the impression I forgive. I can't forgive she betrayed me, and did something all her friends, all my friends, and even myself thought I was the more likely to do. Cheat. Betray everything. We were slowly talking about marriage! In this frame of mind I texted her saying I still haven't forgave. The conversation evolved into the topic of if we could be friends. Truth is I miss her, all I want is random coffee hangouts. She doesn't think it is possible and we are back to no talking. I know, I am pathetic

Now after this story I have two questions...
1. Do you think I should be friends with her?

To piss you off I will close with this stupid question... 

Should I delete her from facebook? I don't know the ettiqute of the web...

1x2hlk,2,2014-02-05,Ketostix. I have no idea what I'm doing...,Moynolicious,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1x2hlk/ketostix_i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing/,"Hi all,

So yesterday my ketostix finally arrived in the mail (damned local pharmacist wouldn't give them to me!) so this morning I said I'd give it a go as I'd a sneaking suspicion that I was out of ketosis.

I've been on keto for about three weeks, I'm really enjoying it. I'm liking the new recipies and I lost 10lbs in the first fortnight. The only issue is, this week I've seen my weight slowly creeping up and I've gained another 3lbs this week. I really don't know what gives.

When I peed on the stick this morning I got a dark shade, roughly between the last and second last colours. Kind of a dark reddy purple. Does this mean I'm in ketosis? If so shouldn't I continue to see weight loss? The only factor I can think of that I didn't have these past two weeks is that I started an internship so have been having coffee in the mornings at work (almond milk &amp; stevia) but I track everything in MFP and I don't seem to go over 50g of carbs.

I'm not really sure if this post makes any sense, it's a bit rambling. I guess what I'm asking is what does my ketostix reading mean and what can I do to boost my fat burning again?

**TL;DR** Ketostix were dark, but I'm gaining weight. Wondering what I'm doing wrong?"

1x2p8d,10,2014-02-05,Sometimes there's just too much to overcome: reflections a month after my ex [23F] and I [25M] of 2 years broke up.,ElColombo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x2p8d/sometimes_theres_just_too_much_to_overcome/,"##tl;dr: We met, we loved, we tried, we lost, I will miss her dearly and wish her all the best.

---   
Almost a month ago, my ex (23f) and I (25m) broke up.

We met in college about 3 years ago and after developing a very intense and involved friendship, we started dating about a year later. She was an international student from Taiwan and I was a guy from the suburbs just north of NYC. We spent a year together dating at the university together before I graduated and moved back home in December of 2012. This was when our long-distance relationship started.

The year was filled with its ups and downs. Being apart after having essentially lived together for almost a year tested our relationship, our trust, and the love we shared. Her graduation this past December became the turning point in our relationship.

Before we started dating, we realized that there were feelings brewing and we discussed what would become of a relationship given the possibility that she may have to return to Taiwan after graduation. We decided that we would make the most of it and deal with whatever hand we were dealt when the time arrived. If she needed to leave, so be it; we would deal with it then if it came to that. Neither of us wanted to get married for papers; we wanted to do this by working towards our own stable lives. We slowly began working towards a future for ourselves.

Truth be told, I did not help our cause by starting my year terribly. I took a break for a few months to sit back and relax, not realizing how hard it would be for me to find a job, much less in my own career field. Months passed and the odd jobs I took didn't last. I was stuck in financial limbo, clawing my way to stay afloat. It was a constant source of stress. The feeling of working consecutive low-paying jobs did nothing for my self-esteem. It wasn't until September that I landed a steady job at a factory in another state for just above minimum wage. I was not the happiest, but it provided stability. It lasted up until about December when I left that job to work as a Chinese delivery guy throughout the month of December, a job I still have on weekends. I work a second during the week now too.

Her year was very different. She balanced internships and jobs, all while studying hard to graduate early. She lived a busy schedule. We met just about once a month for anywhere in between three days to a week at a time. Considering what other long-distance relationships have to work through, we had it pretty good. Nonetheless, the distance slowly affected us and changed the nature of the relationship. I could manage, but it was never something she was really comfortable with; we were a dynamite couple together in person and a different couple apart. We looked forward to those monthly visits and always had a blast together up until the moment we had to part again.

The weeks leading up to graduation were stressful. I provided all the support and love I could as finals and deadlines for papers loomed ever closer. Soon, she would finally be able to reap the fruits of her hard labor. To celebrate her graduation, her mother arranged a trip from Taiwan to be with us. It would be the first time I'd meet either parent. I drove us up to school. The week I spent with them at and after graduation was fantastic. We would see her mom off two weeks later and spend the New Year together in my city.

Upon arrival in my city, it was clear that something had changed.

&gt;""Last month, I was sure that you were the one for me. Now, I'm not sure if we're gonna last the year.""

It hit me as a complete surprise. That night, she asked me if I was sure that she was my forever girl. I didn't hesitate answering.

On our last night together, she told me:

&gt;I wish I didn't have to leave because when we're together, everything is perfect.

By the end of her visit, she wanted to take some time to think about things. My heart sank in fear of the worst. About a week of waiting later, the video call came. It started off well; we shared stories of our days apart. She asked if I had done any thinking over the break.

&gt;""I want you to know that whatever your decision is, I will understand and accept it because I know that you'll have thought it through.""

My chest tightened as the conversation led closer to the moment I had been dreading since the break.

&gt;""I spent some time thinking about it and I realized...that I love you...but only as a best friend.""

Heartbreaking doesn't even come close.

&gt;""I want to us stay friends though because I don't want to throw away the years and memories we have had up to this point.""

I felt the same way. I accepted that this must have been a very difficult decision for her to make. We continued talking and even managed a few smiles towards the end. We made plans to chat again soon.

In a separate letter to my mom, she wrote that she and I didn't have the same goals, priorities or expectations anymore and that for her our romantic relationship was at an end. She saw us taking different paths and thanked her for accepting her into our family and for the hospitality she received over the years.

We sent reddit links to each other almost daily just like we used to and sent a few texts back and forth, but that important feeling that we shared was gone. It was a big loss. I was shaken. Her absence in my heart was deafening. It was really over. The relationship was really done and gone. She was no longer my girl. I held onto those messages and links because as much as they hurt, they held a certain comfort, a familiarity that made me feel as warm as much as they brought me to tears. I later realized that this was very unhealthy, so a few days later I sent her this message:

&gt;Hey XXXXXX,

&gt;I hope you've been well.

&gt;The messages and links you've been sending me lately have been great and entertaining, but I'm sorry to say that I made a mistake in wanting such casual contact so soon.

&gt;I'm still in a lot of pain and as exciting as every link you send me is, it really hurts. I need some space and time to heal.

&gt;I know this may come as a disappointment to you considering you were hoping to have all of us play League together again soon, but it's for the best that I have time to myself to help me get my emotions all sorted out. Wouldn't want to get into team fights late into a match and have your carry unable to carry on, you know.

&gt;I want you to know that I'm still interested in being friends in the future if you are too; it's just not the right time for me.

&gt;With your web class probably in full swing by now, your job starting soon, your editing position filling your days with awful writing, and god knows how many other things you're planning on throwing yourself into, I wish you lots and lots of success with all of it. Know that I'm rooting for you.

&gt;I'll be working my butt off too. And browsing Reddit.

&gt;Your friend, ElColombo

I must have read through that letter 400 times, trying to build up the courage to send it. It was hard penning it but I understood that it needed to be done. I didn't expect to receive a letter back, but one came.

&gt;I understand completely. To be honest I've been thinking the same thing, but was too stubborn to admit it because I was the one who insisted on remaining friends. I'm sorry that the contact has been causing you pain; you're right, it's still way too early.

&gt;Take all the time you need. When you feel good and ready, I will be here.

&gt;Thank you, XXXXXX

I broke down reading that last line. I still do.

I don't believe I was a very bad man. My successes were far and few. I struggled with depression and long strings of consecutive failures. But I can sit here and tell you all that I never wavered in my love for her. In my support of her and her goals. In the belief that we could work through these hard times and come out the outer side stronger, together. I tried my best to give her the comforts of family and friends here in the states. In the face of so many obstacles, I really tried.

Now, a month later, I sit here after what feels like an eternity of thinking, talking, listening, crying, and moping to say that as sad as I still am that she is not in my life nor love me anymore, I believe the breakup was the best thing to happen to us. It served as the great motivator to keep improving myself, but not for someone else this time. I'm doing it for myself now. I also came to understand that as we were, we were never going to succeed. I was stuck in a terrible place and she was at a turning point in her life with so many roads available to her. We had discussed getting an apartment together, but we had no end date or solid plans. We didn't cheat, we didn't fight, we were always supportive but the circumstances beat us.

I promised myself that I would only consider contacting my ex not only after I had the financial and social stability I want to have, but can also accept that she will also move forward and do what's best for her, in love and in life. I want to make sure I can be happy for her own success and happiness. Because she deserves it and our relationship was completely worth it. It will be a long time. I will miss this girl not just as a lover, but also as my best friend.

If I could talk to her now, I would tell her this:

&gt;Thank you for all the great memories and moments we were able to share together. The love we had will find its place in our pasts and I will treasure it and remember it fondly. Thank you for giving me your support through those rough times last year. I told you how much your words and kindness meant to me then and I want you to know that your encouragement has helped me get to this point. I hope that we can both grow from this.

&gt;It's alright that we didn't last forever; I'm just glad we had the chance to meet and experience life with each other for a while. I don't know when we'll talk or if our paths will cross again, but I wish you all the best.

&gt;Take care.

&gt;Your friend, ElColombo

Thank you for reading."
1x36rb,1,2014-02-05,Advice on career fair,[deleted],UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1x36rb/advice_on_career_fair/,"So I'm a sophomore in Computer Engineering hoping to get some sort of internship this summer. I've thrown my resume around a bit online, but I'm planning to go to our upcoming engineering career fairs.

I've heard general ideas and strategies, and actually went to the Fall ECS fair. But it went pretty bad; most of the recruiters there took my resume, asked generic questions, and then brushed me off. Now I know Juniors generally have a better chance, and my resume wasn't that great to begin with (no real fancy projects to talk about), but it was still pretty demotivating, and I ended up only going to a few companies before saying ""fuck it"" and leaving.

I'm reasonably far along with classes, taking 391 right now and have a decent GPA. I'm just wondering if anyone has advice on how to give myself a better shot?"

I really want to have a good job in the future, hopefully at a big company, so that I could have an impact and work on a widely used product.

However, I'm having a problem with school. My grades are mostly average as I can not bring myself to learn for my exams. I have two maths courses and the practical use of what we study has never been exposed to us, and I percieve it as a purely theoretical subject which I forget the day after the exam. This problem occurs at other subjects as well, although they are very interesting. I got a 10/10 grade at the practical exam and a 6/10 at the theoretical one, as I find it hard to learn things by word.

My question is, can grades affect me in my career? Is it enough to be good but with average grades? How did grades affect your career?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I can't thank you enough. My question is rather simple: why did you decide to call it ""Ethernet?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qqrh?context=5)|The luminiferous ""ether"" was an omnipresent passive medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves.
[What is the next big interface/protocol according to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qpot?context=5)|Automotive. Cars will have three networks.  (1) Within the car.  (2) From the car up to the Internet. And (3) among cars.  IEEE 802 is ramping up for these standards now, I hope.
[Hi Bob, thanks for coming to reddit. I hate to be this guy, because you've clearly done so much to develop technology that drives modern society. Not to mention no one should be held by predictions made decades earlier or else we'd all look stupid, but I'm fascinated by how societies try and see how the world is changing. You once made a prediction that wireless networking would die out in the 1990s. Can you explain why it seemed at the time that this was this was going to happen and when you realized that your prediction may have needed adjustment? Bonus question: in your opinion, why are we always so terrible at predicting the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qpuf?context=5)|Wireless DID die out in the 1990s, when the radios were bigger than the PCs, but then came roaring back.  Ethernet followed on Alohanet circa 1979, and so now it's come full circle to WiFi.  We are pretty good a predicting the future, but not very good at getting the timing right.
[Thanks for answering, that's an interesting take. Do you know of any specific example in history where a prediction was very inaccurate for the period but ultimately came to fruition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7sx3s?context=5)|Took a long time for interactive time-shared minicomputers to replace batch-processing mainframes.  Then is took a long time for The Year of the LAN to happen -- I kept predicting it year after year.
[Bob, I use black. CAT5 in my systems. Opinions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7rfv0?context=5)|Ethernet cables should be yellow.  And that's that.
[How do you feel about the current state of play (100G coming too late + too expensive, the approach of the IEEE being that 40Gbit was a good intermediary step\) in the ethernet field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7ry8l?context=5)|Moves from 10G to 40G to 100G to 400G to TE are part of the Ethernet ethic, which says built it and they will come (eventually). 
[Also - thank you for giving me a career :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7ry8l?context=5)|Ethernet had back-off for flow/congestion control, which then migrated up into TCP/IP also. Got the idea from the Santa Monica Freeway traffic lights.
[Why 40 and 400 instead of 50 and 500?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7v27v?context=5)|Ethernet speeds tended to increase 10X.  Telephony speeds tended to increase 4X. At 10Gbps or so they converged and the two industries had to reconsider their improvement steps. I'm up for 1Tbps next.
[Hey Bob! I've got an odd question if you don't mind...  Like most of us here, have you ever tried to plug an Ethernet cable into its respective port just to realize the device you're plugging it into only has a phone jack?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7tiu7?context=5)|Cannot begin to tell you how many times I've tried to plug Ethernet into the wrong socket -- today even, in this hotel room.  What is amazing, actually, is how many times it works!
[What gives you the right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7to2m?context=5)|Right to do what?
[Hm, I'm not sure.. That's just my go-to AMA question. No one ever answers.. Uh.. The right to change the world in such a positive way? How dare you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7tui9?context=5)|Am still trying to please my parents, who are in Heaven rooting for me.
[Hi Bob, cheers from MIT CSAIL! I'm a lowly grad student and a huge fan.  My question is: what goes into designing a protocol? How do you start building one? To me, it always seems like protocols reflect the way people speak (not transmitting at the same time, stopping if someone else starts transmitting, etc.\) but how do you get this idea to be a robust protocol? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7r77p?context=5)|Protocol design is an art.  It's important to leave things open for unexpected uses -- generality.  TCP/IP/Ethernet were invented in 1973, and along came the web in 1989. Whoa!  Also, mutual suspicion among protocol parties adds robustness.
[Do you agree with what Jon Postel is quoted as saying (""Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept""\) ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7ro7m?context=5)|Jon Postel (RIP) is who we need around here these days, alas. A firm but gentle man with huge good ideas.  I have no idea what he meant by the quote, but I'm sure I'd agree.
[What initially compelled you to develop Ethernet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qzmo?context=5)|At Xerox Parc we were, if you can imagine it, putting a personal computer on every desk. I got the job of extending the Internet into our buildings to the PCs so they could print and access the Internet (then Arpanet). Lucky me.
[Dear Mr. Metcalfe,  First, thank you for all your brilliant work over the years.  My question is how do you feel about the NSA collecting everything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7r4ur?context=5)|America needs an NSA, because we have dangerous enemies.  Perhaps they've been over-doing it lately. I am worried that the current administration will destroy NSA in the current scandal.
[I always romanticize what it was like back in the day creating the technology we currrently utilize daily. What was it like working with Xerox and ALOHAnet? What is the most romantic memory you have the tech industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7s0xb?context=5)|Spent a month in Hawaii studying Alohanet isn early 1970s -- recommend that. Xerox Parc was heaven on Earth -- did not own an alarm clock.
[Hey Bob I am a big fan ever since I learned about your work while I was studying to become an engineer. One thing I havent quite figured out is why you dislike open sources(sores\) software? Would love to know the exact reasons behind your dislike of that approach to software development.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qogy?context=5)|OK, the question was, which way to deliver a modern operating system?  The advanced American software company (eg Microsoft) or a non-profit group of open-source volunteers.  This is a false dichotomy.  I attacked Windows at the same time as open sores.  Nether has delivered on that new OS I'm looking for.  Just more old time-sharing systems.
[What's your favourite internet pun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qvvy?context=5)|Internet evangelist Vint Cerf goes around saying ""IP on everything.""
[What's your view on chipotle charging extra for guacamole? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7upfm?context=5)|Pay it.
[What are your thoughts on connecting little widgets and devices to the internet? Wireless or hard-wired? Does my toaster really need to be connected to the internet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qos6?context=5)|Yes, your toaster needs to be connected to the Internet. Emerging networks are both wireless and wired (fibered). For example, LTE packets go right onto fibered Ethernets -- LTE = Leads To Ethernet.
[How far did you envision Ethernet would endure?  Did you expect to see the evolution of 10M to 100M, through 100G and coming before too long 400G?  Did you consider Ethernet's applicability as a possible WAN medium way back when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7s3fq?context=5)|Ethernet has surprised a lot of people, especially me. Questions like yours depend on the semantics -- what you think Ethernet is. Ethernet in the WAN (killing SONET!) and Carrier Ethernet were big surprises to me. Look at Carrier Ethernet, now $100B/year.
[It's weird I'm sitting here in a Computer Networks class browsing reddit and I saw this AMA it's like a sign I should start paying attention to class or something.  Can you explain the OSI layer model? that's what the prof is doing but I'm not listening... I'll read it if you answer though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7vgpt?context=5)|The OSI model is a way of organizing and dividing the functions of a network, especially the Internet. I have lived a rich full life at layers 1 and 2 and sometimes 3 and 4 of the OSI model. All the fun gets had at layer 7.
[Am I allowed to worship you for your invention?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7tz3z?context=5)|You may worship me, but only if it causes you to learn, to work, to communicate, to team up, to achieve great things yourself. I hope to serve you as a provocation.
[Was your invention intended to be as huge as it was? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7sx6z?context=5)|Depends on which year.  At the start, in 1973, the goal was mainly to print on our new laser printer.  By 1980, world domination was the goal.
[Hey Bob!  In a recent interview with Bob Krause he tells a tale about how Steve Jobs influenced the development of 10BaseT (as opposed to the coax and vampire taps before\).  Is Bob right?  Can you tell anything else about how we got from coax to RJ45 connectors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7re15?context=5)|Bill Krause's story about Steve Jobs (RIP) complaining about Ethernet cables is certainly true. Steve would not shut up about it. So, he got AppleTalk developed, which was cheaper and slower and less cable ridden and non-standard. Took a long time to talk Steve into Ethernet, but by then it was quite different. Still he was unhappy with all the wires, and pushed for WiFi.
[Did your invention make you wildly rich? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7rvmn?context=5)|Selling, not inventing, Ethernet left me with a fortune which is a significant fraction of a milliGates.
[Knock knock.  Who's there?  Ether.  Ether who?  Ether bunny.  Knock knock.  Who's there?  Moe.  Moe who?  Moe ether bunnies.  Knock knock.  Who's there?  Ethan.  Ethan who?  Ethan moe ether bunnies.  Knock knock.  Who's there?  Consumption.  Consumption who?  Consumption be done about all these ether bunnies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7vid2?context=5)|Unfortunately, I have no effective control over what actually gets carried in Ethernet packets.
[OrangeWhite, Orange, GreenWhite, Blue, Bluewhite, Green, BrownWhite, Brown.  Still one of my favorite parts of my job.  Did you ever expect Ethernet (at least the physical media\) to be installed in homes as much as businesses? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7v5p5?context=5)|Yes, I did, but not until 1982, when we started selling Ethernet for the new IBM PC, many of which were going into homes with more than one.
[Bob,  First let me say thank you.  I used to work at a network test equipment company, and knowledge of ethernet is so entrenched that it's kind of hard to believe there was a time that there wasn't ethernet.  It's like you invented arithmetic.  Now on to my ridiculous question: I have a hazy memory of reading an article that you used to drink copious quantities of diet soda every day... like 24 cans.  I can't find a reference to this anywhere on line, so it's likely that it's the result of my imperfect memory, but still, I have to ask: is this true? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7t7pl?context=5)|Worse! I used to drink a case of (classic) Coke everyday, which is not good for anybody. Weight gain. Mania. Switched to diet, but now just avoid soft drinks, especially carbonated sugar water. Regular water is good for you.
[Bob, i love you! if you had to fight one inventor  from history  who would you choose and why.  Also side question do you think you could win in a fight against Bj novak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qpi2?context=5)|Careful, bar fighting is one of my hobbies.
[How should the Internet be governed? In particular, what should the role of government be? thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7rzqx?context=5)|Governments are running amok these days, and I'm worried.
[For the future of humanity - excepting Ethernet and asteroid mining - what technology do you most eagerly await? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7reny?context=5)|Excepting Ethernet and asteroid mining, hm, I am eagerly awaiting the Internet's coming disruption of education -- MOOCs and their descendants. Also, healthcare, more personal and preventative, thanks to networking.
[Hey Bob! We make our interns make ethernet cables all the time!  What did you eat today? Do you remember what you ate the day you finally got Ethernet to work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7schm?context=5)|Today, so far, a scone.  Day Ethernet first worked, Hunan. 
[What is your current stance on net neutrality and how do you propose to fix the balance between access and proprietary content?  Also... 100 cat5 cables or 1 cat500 cable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qqxp?context=5)|Am neutral on net neutrality. Way too complicated. Busy elsewhere.
[I take it you don't get a penny for every Ethernet cable sold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7rbgs?context=5)|Used to get $1 per port, but now only a penny per packet. Business model innovation.
[I have a Computer Networks exam tomorrow. If the creator of Ethernet would wish me luck, it couldn't go wrong, could it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7y98k?context=5)|Good luck on your Computer Networks exam tomorrow. Get sleep, drink lots of water, have fun.
[Which color of ethernet cable is fastest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7u1ei?context=5)|I bet there are differences of signal propagation among cable colors, but they are all close to the speed of light, so the differences don't generally show up in network performance. You are pulling my leg.
[What's your stance on governments' interference with regards to monitoring or controlling the Internet? Like the NSA scandal or the UK porn filters?  What do you think will be the next big step forward in computers/networking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7suy1?context=5)|Automotive networking.  Healthcare monitoring.
[Holy hell, I almost feel like your level of knowledge and topic-area will be way over the heads of the average IAmA suscriber..  My question:  Why Yellow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7tm0i?context=5)|Yellow was the color we chose at Xerox Parc to distinguish Ethernet cables in the ceiling from all of the others. See no reason to change now.
[What do you thing about people saying that Ethernet is at the end of it's days? With Wireless AC creeping up on 2Gbps almost, what are your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7s3qa?context=5)|Depends mostly on what the meaning of the word ""Ethernet"" is. If you think Ethernet is an RJ-45, then it's on it's way out. If you think WiFi is ""wireless phy Ethernet"" then not so much.  Ethernet does not have collisions anymore, and some people think those were the essence. I think Ethernet is a brand or a business model, one worth sticking to.
[Favorite sandwich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qw0c?context=5)|Pastrami. I'm a health nut.
[Will I ever catch you on 6th street one of these weekends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7r16z?context=5)|I am on 6th street every day. Live across from Whole Foods Market HQ. Or do you mean the bars further east?
[Where you involved with making Gigabit ethernet?  And do they still belong to you?  And can I please use it for umm... Science, ya science.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7t0s4?context=5)|No. No. Yes.
[Until I saw the banana for scale, I was convinced it wasn't really you. First, thank you for your amazing contributions to what is now such an integral part of my life. Second, what are you working on these days, and is technology still as much fun for you as when you started out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qq3y?context=5)|My mission today is being a UTAustin Professor of Innovation and helping Austin be a better Silicon Valley. My focus is startups out of research universities, and not just websites.  Innovation drives the virtuous cycle between freedom and prosperity. I wish I had more time to program.
[How did you feel about TCP/IP being chosen over OSI as the de-facto communications protocol on the Internet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7srup?context=5)|TCP/IP and OIS and XNS and DECnet and Wangnet and ... were all pretty much equivalent. What let TCP/IP win was the persistence of Vint Cerf and the interoperability ethic of TCP/IP (not simply conformance). Also, the use of universities and startups to advance TCP/IP rather than incumbent monopolies.
[Ahoy Bob, what are your thoughts on security issues for all of our connectedness. It seems like it will just be a constant race between the 'good' guys and the hackers only with more at stake, like moving vehicles and the inner workings of our homes. What say you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7rj0u?context=5)|Internet security will never be a solved thing, but we can do a lot better than now. Ethernet makes no contribution, assuming the higher levels of protocol have it handled, which they do not.
[Hello Bob,  Any thoughts on recording and transmitting smells, scents, odors via ethernet based robots? Tia. See you on the water in Owls Head this  summer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7sb1v?context=5)|Only a question of time before we have a standard for digitizing smells.
 |Am looking forward to the ocean smells of Owls Head this coming Summer.
[Did 3Com have a specific downfall that you can pinpoint? Or was it just time to merge resources with HP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7tjgu?context=5)|Were I a better person, there would be no Cisco today.  We let them outsell us, and they achieved escape velocity. I am proud to say 3Com is now doing well inside HP. Since I now sort of founded HP, I have asked them to change its name to HMP.
[Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA and for providing people everywhere with the means to fill their computers with pictures of cats.   Where do you see the future of electronic technology heading in relation to the general population's ""dependence"" on gadgets? Would you like to see technology become further integrated with everyday life, or do you think we should restrain from adding more?   Do you think there should be limits to which aspects of life we apply electronic technology to? Should there be boundaries?   Do you have any predictions about specific emerging or existing technologies?  Dan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7sp6k?context=5)|Do not think we should avoid technology for fear of dependence. We should better engineer our gadgets not to fail, or to have soft landings. Boundaries? No. Choices? Yes. Have you seen ""her?""
[I have not but I will look in to it. After playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution I have become interested in whether or not we as a society will have to deal with ethical dillemas of biomechanical enhancement on the scale portrayed in the game. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7tfh6?context=5)|When you watch the movie her, remember what we humans did to the Neanderthals.
[SDN, exciting thing or marketing BS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qxot?context=5)|SDN will change names several more times, but something akin to it, say network virtualization, is a coming thing, like for processors and storage.
[Are you working on any new inventions now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7scfp?context=5)|Am working on inventions related to the process of startups out of research universities.  They make the world go round, but not well enough yet.
[You probably met Edsger Dijkstra being a Longhorn and all.  Do you have any interesting stories about him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7qupo?context=5)|Before my time.
[What do you think is the best approach to deploying internet to far-reaching places of the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7su1g?context=5)|That's happening. Best approach is proliferating Free Enterprise.
[What is the toughest challenge you found when you designed/implemented Ethernet? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7rzpl?context=5)|There were two, initially, RS-232-C, which connected dumb terminals to time-shared minicomputers, and Sneakernet.  Why would you need Ethernet if you could just copy your document onto a floppy and carry it over to the printer?
[Have you ever hiked Patagonia with Yvon Chouinard? Have you ever met him? if yes, what do you think about his business philosophies? Like “At Patagonia, making a profit is not the goal because the Zen master would say profits happen 'when you do everything else right'.” ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7s0c2?context=5)|Just back from hiking Patagonia, to see the glaciers. As for profit, it is not a four-letter word. Profit is proof of added value. Make some money today. It is annoying that when you ask someone what their company does, they to often start by saying it's a non-profit, as if that's what defines them. Wrong lens.
[Favorite RFC (your's or someone else's\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7xl0d?context=5)|Mine: RFC #89, January 1971.
[Clearly, ethernet, be it wireless or wired, makes the internet useful. When I was first introduced to it, I had to also be introduced to token rings. I have a few questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7vpii?context=5)|Great questions.
[The first one is, when you designed Ethernet, did you first attempt to use phone cords, or did you rule them out in advance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7vpii?context=5)|Phone cords were considered or Ethernet in 1973, but we were trying to eliminate the rats nest of cables created in phone closets and by RS-232-C. And our first, thick coax could be tapped without bring the network down. We also considered using electrical wiring, but that proved too hard. Today we are carrying power on Ethernet cables -- the cables have been turned.
[The second one is I wonder what your views are on innovation as linked to corporate business. The IT field is littered with the corpses of would-have-been technologies that were pretty clever due to what I'd describe as corporate non-support or adoption.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x3fiq/all_your_ethernets_are_belong_to_me_im_bob/cf7vpii?context=5)|Inventions are a dime a dozen and most are not improvements. That being said, the status quo wins too many battle, or delays innovations for far too long. I am working on that as a UTAustin Professor of Innovation.
[The last one I have is if you had to re-invent ethernet, would you think more about encryption within its standards now? For instance, would you think of encrypting frame windows in some clever way?

Was this speed determined by a review of proposed application requirements? No. Was this speed limited by the attenuation of signals through a mile of half-inch coaxial cable? No. This speed was ~10,000 faster than the RS-232-C 300-baud connections we all had on our desks the day before Ethernet. The speed of Ethernet was determined by how many MSI chips we could cram into the Xerox Parc Alto's option slot and how much we could move into Alto microcode. We ended up using a 170ns system clock off the Alto's backplane and Manchester encoding (two transitions per bit), hence 2.94Mbps. This speed worked out because in those days the cross-country trunk lines of the Internet ran at 50Kbps (not Gbps, not Mbps, Kbps).

Let's face it, it would be a really cool thing to do. I know it would be my dream job, so this thread is asking questions about how to help make that happen. (I know it's a long shot, and I'm currently in college studying computer science with possible minors in art and/or business to help me have a nice backup).

I know that there is a lot of teamwork that goes into video game design, and that video game programmers actually have very little say in how the game turns out. I'd like to be somebody who helps actually come up with the ideas for video games. I chose to study a bit of business to help develop soft skills and learn more about marketing. I also chose to study art because I'm fairly good at it (I paid for my first year of college with art commissions), and I thought even just going into character and setting design would be very satisfying for me.

Now onto my questions. What should I do and/or learn to help improve my chances of achieving this long-shot dream? I've been told that developing some games on my own and marketing them on someplace like steam would help, or if I can make successful mods for something like a fallout game. What else can I do? Should I learn any specific languages? Would making my own game be better because it shows I understand the whole process or would focusing on mods be better because it shows my ability to work with an already-established project? Are there specific languages I should learn? Should I look into the working of any specific game engines? How much hardware do I need to know? Should I look for specific kinds of internships? If I get a job developing software or just doing coding for video games when I get out of college, does that mean I've shot my chances for actually getting into the design portion of gaming, or does it help since I'm at least doing something potentially relative?

I know this is a really long shot, but it's my dream. I'd really love to make it happen, and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
1x3yiv,23,2014-02-05,Was college a crutch for having a social life?,GezzySinger,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1x3yiv/was_college_a_crutch_for_having_a_social_life/,"Sorry for the wall of text...

I feel like now that I have graduated and am living in my college town working, I'm completely on my own here. Like, when I was in school, I had a roommate, was in multiple clubs, and had lots of classes with different people in them. Because of my involvement, I was automatically included in many social events. Not necessarily because people wanted to be with me, but because I was grouped together with a certain population. It was easy for me to go to social events with people who were nice to me and somehow thought I was cool, but as soon as people left for student teaching and internships, I started to see my social life dwindle away. As soon as I graduated, BOOM. Darkness. 

Now I don't live on campus anymore, and sure as hell don't find myself at campus bars, but I'm straddling this difficult choice between trying to reach out to the people I am ""friends"" with who are still in school and trying to have a social life that I can still enjoy as ""a grown up"" or just trying to find new friends who are in the same life stage as I am. 

On the one hand, it would be really easy (maybe) to reconnect with these people that I already know and try to go out or at least spend time with them. But I keep getting this feeling that none of them really want to see me anymore. Like, they're glad I'm gone and hope I stay that way, even though I'm just down the road. The people in my old singing group really want nothing to do with me from what I've gathered, because I kind of fucked that relationship up. My old roommate barely talks to me anymore, but I kind of fucked that up too. Other than that, my friends all moved away and keeping up our friendships is really hard because I feel like I wasn't an important enough friend to them to keep in their lives after they left town. I kind of fucked up all of my relationships and I wish I could just fix them. I have tried to just turn a new leaf and show that I am a different person with different priorities, but I don't think any of them care to listen. So fuck.

Well, I guess my other option is to try to make new friends. It's kind of difficult seeing as my only other coworker at my main day job is basically my boss and really isn't my kind of person. I work as a server at night and on weekends, but the other servers are either a lot younger than me or a lot older than me, and lead really different lives than I do. Their social lives are kind of trashy in my opinion and I don't really WANT to hang out with them.

So, how do I meet these people who are like me? They've gotta be out there. Go to a local bar when one of my favorite bands is playing? Sounds perfect. In fact, I even planned to do that once, but chickened out because the idea of going somewhere social alone with no plans to meet up with someone familiar makes me sick to my stomach.

So now I usually go home at night, turn on the tv, and take pictures of my cat. I never thought my life would end up like this. I feel handicapped. But mainly, I feel like I did this to myself. I let my SA ruin otherwise good friendships and left myself lonely for the future, and I don't know what else to do."

I'd be more than happy to answer any questions or go over more details.

I was just offered a position to work for an NBA team as their in-house graphic designer without even having to apply for the gig. Here's how:


* Earned Div. 1 athletic scholarship - allowing me to network within inside my school's Athletic Dept.

* Got injured my senior year, with all the extra time I still wanted to help out my school and the Athletic Dept.

* Noticed a major need for graphics and visuals 

* Begged and pleaded for the head of marketing to allow me to help out with designs

* Basically created my own internship position

* Created graphics and visuals for athletic dept. for the remaining 6 months of school.

* Cold-called EVERY single pro sports franchise/college with Div. 1 sports to see if I could intern after I finished school

* Created a Behance page to showcase my designs and to further network with professionals

* Follow and tweet at professionals that are doing what I want to do - pick their brains!

* Out of the 300+ or so I contacted, I'd say 90% didn't even bother responding and the most that did so ""no"". But it was those handful of connections that yes/maybe/or let me connect you with someone that might, that got me where I am today.

* Graduated school with a degree in Education/Pyschology

* Ended up accepting a paid internship with an NFL team for 9 months.

* Got a call from one of the same connections I made while still in school that said ""Hey I have a position open, it's your's if you want it""

**Main takeaway from my experience = have a solid/relevant portfolio and NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK**


Like I said, I'd be more than happy to answer questions or go over some more details

I need help, or just someone to talk to. I'm only thirteen, and today my boyfriend (now ex boyfriend) broke up with me. I don't want to hear ""You're too young to date!"" Or whatever else you can come up with, because I know. I believed that with all my heart. But I gave in and dated the guy. 

Today I he told me he wants to break up. I told him that it was fine, and we went our separate ways. I teared up a little, but I wasn't sobbing, I didn't beg him to stay with me. I thought it would be hard, but I was okay.

Was. But I went to my closest friends and told them what happened. I told them that ""I thought it would be hard, but I'm okay."" And that ""I can do better."" At that point, I was feeling pretty good about myself. But then two of the three friends I confided in started yelling at me. Saying how I didn't appreciate him enough, and that now I'm acting like I don't care. I felt (and still feel) incredibly hurt and upset, that the people I trusted are turning against me because supposedly ""I wasn't a good enough girlfriend."" At thirteen. He was my first boyfriend. I don't know what I should of been doing. I didn't even know I was doing something wrong. Eventually, my closest and most trusted friend sent me this: 

okay, here is what im going to say:

i understand that sean broke up with you, not the other way around. i know exactly why he did it too, because i was the ONLY one he talked to about it. he wasnt happy because no matter what he did for you, you didnt seem to care. AT ALL. i think you were too blind to see it, or you didnt see it because you didnt give a shit about him in the first place. dont worry, i know that you told riley that you werent sure if you liked him for him, or because you liked the thought of him liking you. think about that...what do you say now? also, think about this, not only during your relationship did you hurt sean by not responding to his feelings, but during your relationship you hurt the group. your ego has grown too strong, otherwise i would be taking partial sides with you, but due to what has been going on the past few weeks, it needs to stop. want to know what it was that has been happening? well, things have been awkward because you think so highly of yourself that everybody else has to go last. your ego! dont even get me started! ""Im a barbie, i am cute, i am perfect!"" your ego...has ruined our friendship...this has come to an end. i chose sean because i knew he could be happier, i know pretty much everything about him, things that only tom and i know, etc. also because you said you could do better. HE GAVE YOU EVERYTHING A GIRL COULD POSSIBLY WANT! HOW COULD YOU HURT SOMEBODY WHO WOULD SACRIFICE THEIR LIFE TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE HAPPY?! *sigh* dont be sad. be happy. you have such burdens, like me and sean, out of your life now. oh, and he could do WAY fucking better than some cold hearted...no. im done. fuck you, and goodnight.
And look on the bright side, now you can focus on your career.

So now I'm crying because I lost my best friend, when I didn't mean to do anything wrong, and I feel bad that I'm more upset over loosing  her than I am about loosing my first boyfriend. But at the same time, I don't get why it's a problem to like myself. I know it makes it seem like every five minutes I compliment my self.  I don't. But I am comfortable in my developing thirteen year old body. I do think that I'm beautiful.  I do think that I'm perfect, but I also think that everyone is perfect in their own way. I didn't know it was a problem to love yourself. And about the whole ""And look on the bright side, now you can focus on my career. "" that came about because I'm applying to a internship at my local zoo, which is something I've been wanting to do since I was three.

Two X, I feel hurt and betrayed. The people I trusted turned against me, and I feel completely alone. My closest friend used my dreams against me, and I am just lost and upset and I don't know how I'll go to school tomorrow.

Plus I have awful cramps right now.

1x4p3u,3,2014-02-05,"As a senior at college, I could really use some advice.",go_on_without_me,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1x4p3u/as_a_senior_at_college_i_could_really_use_some/,"I'm in my second to last semester of college, and I've known for a while that sysadmin seems much more interesting to me than coding, though I could take a job in coding as my first job if I needed to.


My university offers a course in sysadmin, which I took.  However, the professor felt that sysadmin is something that you can't really teach, especially not in a single semester.  He focused instead on giving us the tools we would need if we were to pursue the path of a sysadmin (becoming a better power user in Vim, writing bash scripts, regular expressions, learning important commands that we don't necessarily learn in more coding-oriented classes, etc.)


I'm faced with a dilemma of whether or not to pursue an internship this summer.  I've had one internship already at a company called TASC.  Now an internship is pretty much a win/win, you usually get some money, and something good on your resume.  However, over the past semester and into this one, I've been having very bad spikes of depression.  I'm medicated for it, as well as PTSD, anxiety, and epilepsy, but it just seems to keep coming back.


I will be taking an online class over the summer, and if I were to not go into an internship, I would be expanding on that.  My idea would be to go back and do some of the old sysadmin labs again, as it was a few semesters ago that I took it, as well as looking for places where I could learn more of the skills that a sysadmin needs (for instance, due to course scheduling, I'm not going to be able to take my university's Database class).


The reason that I worry about not getting an internship is that I'm worried that my resume won't be impressive enough.  Right now it consists mostly of the computer related clubs I'm in, the fact that I'm in Upsilon Pi Epsilon, a scholarship that I was awarded for computer science (just a local one from my school), and then there's my work at TASC, and my 3.7 GPA and 3.8 major GPA.


The specific reason that I'm worried about going for an internship is that I don't want to break down.  Over the summer I will have nowhere to live but with my parents, and, without going into too much detail, they're the source of my PTSD (I have amnesia of 10 years of my childhood, so I can't really go into much detail anyways).  I worry that if my PTSD acts up and I have a spike in depression, that I may actually act on the plans I've kind of accidentally planned out.


I'm sorry if this sounds like a pity party, but I'm honestly very torn and I can't decide.  If avoiding an internship this summer will make finding a job that much harder, then it may be worth the risk this summer to avoid any worse risk further down the road.


Thank you to anyone and everyone who has any advice whatsoever!"
1x4qc7,1,2014-02-05,Coworkers plan to take me to a strip club- help?,letsgrillsteak,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1x4qc7/coworkers_plan_to_take_me_to_a_strip_club_help/,"Alright, so check it out.

I'm an intern at an office, and I've worked there for a month. I'll be there until August, so about 7 months I'll be there.

Anyway, my coworkers are cool and whatever, and we talk about shit and hang out right? Well my 21st birthday is coming up in the next few months, and of course they want to take me out to celebrate (I'm in a new city, too far to meet up with college friends).

It sounds like they're pretty set on taking me to a strip club. 

First of all, they don't know I'm gay (and single). Second, Most of them are pretty republican, so I'm not sure how shit will fly if I told them (or if they found out somehow?). I have no idea how I would give them the fyi in the first place.

But here's another thing: I think going to a strip club sounds like a blast. Seriously, having a naked woman sit on my lap and titties in my face actually sounds pretty fun, despite my sexual/relationship preferences. Sounds like an adventure to me.

So it's an interesting situation. I don't know how they, knowing my sexual preferences, would feel about taking me to a strip club. Would it be like a big joke? Or would they be uncomfortable, resulting in me being uncomfortable? It's a great mystery. 

If I did nothing until my birthday, they would take me assuming I'm all straight and shit. And while I would probably have a good time, it would likely end up being a big act on my part. And if they found out *after* they took me? How would they react? Would it be funny, or would they feel bad...? Hard to tell- how it would go down might partially depend on my own actions.

So, readers, without even knowing these people or the dynamic of the office, **any ideas?**

[As the music director for a non-profit public radio station, do you ever feel a duty to expose KCRW’s listeners to “important” music which may not be popular among your listeners?  Or does the station’s reliance on listener donations necessitate the dumbing-down of music programming to ensure sufficient funding?  Is that why more eclectic, but less popular, DJs such as Tom Schnabel are no longer on the air?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81gvt?context=5)|Well, you always want to strike a balance between things that are familiar, and things that are going to be a new discovery. A lot of our listeners tune in for music discovery specifically, so that's a priority for us. And over the years, we've been able to present many many artists with their first airplay in the states. So whether it's Adele, or Norah Jones, or whomever, it's almost like the list runs really long. So that's an honor and a privilege, but to your question, you want to strike a balance between things that are accessible and things that are just much more progressive. I still think that our sweet spot is pretty far left of center. I mean our world is far more independent and in most cases unfamiliar to the mainstream.
 |Specifically for Tom, he's still at the station and he hosts an online music blog called Rythm Planet ([Link to blogs.kcrw.com](http://blogs.kcrw.com/rhythmplanet/) so he is still with us. He was our very first music director in the late 1800s. 
[Jason, thank you for doing this. You've been my favorite DJ for as long as I can remember.  Morning Becomes Eclectic is the best show on the radio.  What are your favorite small clubs to see bands in LA? What is the coolest place you've ever DJ'd at? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81g1s?context=5)|Good questions! For local venues, I like the El Rey and I like the Fonda (even though it's a little bit bigger) and for nightclubs, I think Sound is best. And there's a new spot called DBA which is great too. As far as favorite DJ sets, that's really hard to say because it's like 2 decades of playing. Sometimes if I imagine a map of Southern California in my mind, I could drop a flag at so many locations over the years. But I would say a special honor was playing the Governor's Ball, which is the Oscar's after party, which I've played twice. And also Coachella is a personal favorite because I haven't missed a single Coachella and I've played there 3 times now. 
[As a person who has pretty much been a part of the Los Angeles ""EDM"" scene since the get-go, what aspect of this recent boom in popularity has been the most surprising for you?  Also, any crazy story you care to share about the old school warehouse days?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82g01?context=5)|Well you know to see EDM on Superbowl commercials, major motion pictures, basically the highest level of popular exposure is pretty remarkable. And also these events, whether it's EDC or Hard or Ultra in Miami, it's pretty astonishing. I didn't expect that it would become as big as it has gotten. But it's certainly validating for those of us who had a sense of its potential very early on, the power of connecting and a different way to experience music unlike rock n roll.  As far as the old days, lots of very funny stories. One time I was at a rave and I stumbled down the wrong hallway and came upon a Quinceneara that was happening at the same time. We threw a rave on Catalina called Gilligan's Island in the casino that's out there and I just remember people as the boat was leaving the next morning running down the dock trying to jump on the boat at the last minute. I remember a rave in a bullring in east LA and the Orb played. Fond memories of a really influential event called Organic in 1996, probably the ultimate lineup of any rave, it had Underworld, Orbital, Meat Beat Manifesto, The Orb and the Chemical Brothers. And actually I really hope that we can get a 20 year anniversary of Organic event together. So that would be coming up in a couple of years. Countless memories, breaking into warehouses. I knew these promoters that would go downtown and they would put padlocks on different doors and they would come back a few weeks later and if the padlock had been cutoff they knew they could not use that warehouse, but it was a great way to test whether people were actually using the space. Sort of a reverse psychology there. So if the padlock was still on, they knew it was open season. Map points were also a really big part of the scene. Before everybody had a cell phone, the party would have a voicemail and you would call the voicemail number and you would get directions to a map point. You would go there, pay your money and get a map to the rave. There was always a sense of adventure in the scene. It needed to be illicit and sort of dangerous. That was a big part of it. So you and your friends would drive for hours trying to find these places, and you get there and it would be a giant room or giant sound system, something very special about all of that. I don't run around looking for underground parties anymore, so I don't even know if that scene exists. But I'm sure it does.
[Hey Jason! Long time listener, first time writer.  How much would it cost for you to DJ my wedding?  And for the follow-up, will you be the groom at my wedding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81oxv?context=5)|I do not play weddings, it's just potentially a minefield with music, so I steer clear of that. We should probably have dinner first. 
[My question is, what is a common thread you've seen in bands/artists who have started out small/unknown and have broken into wider success? What advice would you give to the struggling independent musicians out there that hope to gain wider exposure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81qg2?context=5)|As far as common thread, I think you just need to love what you do, playing music and making that connection to people. Look at a band like the National right now. Their trajectory is over multiple albums, they are from the midwest (Cincinnati) and now they are headlining festivals. I like that trajectory where it's a slower build, you work to establish an audience over time and over multiple records. It's tough when you go big on your first record. Look at MGMT. They clearly don't like their early success. They have been trying to get away from the music they wrote in college ever since they put the album out. 
[I love KCRW and listening to it in my car is one of the top 5 things I miss about not living in LA anymore.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81m1u?context=5)|Yeah, Henry really is crazy. He's outta control, he's a special individual. I recruited him and he's been great. One thing I really appreciate about him is how he has so much passion in what he does, and when you hear that in his voice, you're pretty much going to give anything a chance, no matter what he plays, you're going to sit there and go Ok, if you're that into it I'm happy to check it out.
[Can you really put on anything you want (that's not cursing\)?  Like could you find some random band from anywhere and put them on the air, or do you have certain sources that you're 'allowed' to choose from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81m1u?context=5)|Well first, to quote Peter Parker's Spider-Man, with great power comes great responsibility.So I can play anything I want, but I need to be mindful of the audience and the radio station's reputation, and our credibility, so I take all of that very seriously and my goal is to play the best music possible. I jokingly say sometimes that I listen to bad music so you don't have to. And KCRW is an important filter for people, and you know, in a pop culture landscape where there's more choices and access than ever before it can really make your head spin. But that puts KCRW in a more important position.
[Hi Jason, thanks for coming here.  What bands from the past decade or so do you think will hold up as classics of the era? By that I mean the bands that will remain the most culturally and musically important in the coming decades.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81lwn?context=5)|Wow. That is a tough one. I'll say that it was great to see Daft Punk receive 5 Grammys just a couple weekends ago. That for me was special because i presented their first DJ appearance in Los Angeles and have worked closely with them over the years, specifically on Tron: Legacy, so to see them validated at that level was pretty special. People know me as a real pioneer for electronic dance music, and they are obviously such a part of that too. The EDM movement over the past couple of decades has been my most significant genre and is my sort of ""British Invasion"" if you will.
 |As far as other bands, it's really hard to say who will endure, especially these days it seems like you know pop music and culture moves so quickly now because of digital and the internet, you are just seeing things turning over more rapidly. I think that when record labels were in more of a powerful position, they would really help to refine artists over time, but now when artists break on the internet, it's a little more disposable. 
[Jason I've been listening to you and KCRW since I was 15-16 and it has become the soundtrack to my life, I'd first off like to thank you and the staff for everything you guys do!  1st question: How is your voice so smooth and soothing? Rumor has it, it sends men and women alike into states of delirium. 2nd question: What is your favorite 90's 1 hit wonder, I'll go easy and let you pick 3 :\]. Lastly if you were to be stuck with 5 albums to listen for the rest of eternity what would they be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81v7n?context=5)|1st question: Proximity effect, look it up. 2nd question: Blackstreet's No Diggity, Eels' Novocaine for the Soul, The Breeders' Cannonball. 3: I'll take a shot. I would say The Who's Quadrophenia, The Clash London Calling, Kate Bush's Hounds of Love, Radiohead OK Computer, and Massive Attack's Blue Lines.
[THANK YOU JASON AND KCRW FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR LA!! RADIO ISN'T DEAD.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81v7n?context=5)|You're totally right, I consider those proprietary.
[P.S. You always have the best background tracks/interludes between sets or when you talk, I'm beginning to think you keep all those instrumentals as your own little gems, and are sending me on a musical scavenger hunt.  P.P.S. Please start doing audiobooks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81v7n?context=5)|And people call about the interludes and I either ignore them outright or give them the wrong information.
[If you could have been apart of any movie to provide music for what would it be? Do you think you could improve it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82wwl?context=5)|Well earlier I mentioned wanting to hang out with Stanley Kubrick. I guess a bunch of his films, but A Clockwork Orange definitely changed my whole worldview when I saw it as a teenager. I think that being involved in that process would have been pretty amazing. I think the genius of Kubrick is that he is a complete filmmaker. I think it really was a case of Kubrick appropriating and placing the ideas, not a traditional film score. But any of Kubrick's films would have been great to have worked on. I really liked There Will Be Blood in more recent times. Gotta credit The Social network and Trent Reznor because it was so unconventional and represented the film so well.
 |One of the things that people don't realize is that composers will come onto a picture when there's already a temp score in place. And the effect of that is usually limiting creatively. Because the direction and the sensibility has already been set in place. And so the conversation is usually with the director saying something like do something like this, I know it's the temp, it's from another film but we're used to that. It's a negative spiral. Sometimes you have directors like David Fincher for instance who involve a composer very early on and there is never a temp. Because a director like Fincher will appreciate the pitfall of doing that. So he involves someone in that process from even the script phase, getting ideas going. That's what we did with Tron: Legacy and Daft Punk. Daft Punk were on that project for 2-3 years wire to wire. On the set we were playing demos they had made. It helped to inform a scene and inform actors on a mood. So not everybody has that luxury because it doesn't make sense for a working composer to set aside 3 years for 1 film but the great films and the great directors (back to Kubrick), these are people that are approaching it with a holistic vision and that's when you get great results. 
[JB! Long time listener/supporter of KCRW and MBE. I have built a lot of my music library around your selections and have a great amount of respect for what you and your KCRW colleagues do for artists. That said, what genre(s\), if any, do you have your eye on for 2014 and who's albums are you anticipating most? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81vrc?context=5)|Good question. New music trends are trancehall and gravewave (a mix of witch house and chill wave, it's the next thing). No I'm joking I just made that up.
 |The Beck album is superb. So is the Broken Bells record. Those 2 albums are early candidates for the best of the year when all is said and done.
[I went to a PACKED sold out Tame Impala show one time, and you stood right next to us.  There was a good 2 foot radius of space/respect around you so you were not crowded.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81o33?context=5)|Practice.

[How do you line up your music supervision gigs ... do producers/directors reach out to you directly, or is it vice versa?  Also, how many of movie/tv/game projects per year can you ideally work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81of4?context=5)|Well the music director position here at the station is my priority and takes up most of my time. The other projects such as films, commercials, video games, I will consider on a case by case basis. Honestly they are really about relationships. Directors that I've worked with over time, projects that I feel have a certain creative reward, in other words I'm not just looking for anything to pick up. I don't have a set number I try to do, it's just about interesting opportunities that come up that I'm excited about and working with good people.
[You play incredible music, and your voice is as soothing as Bob Ross'. Those are the highest compliments I've ever given someone. Are you just constantly listening to new music or do you have interns helping out? What do you think of the Broken Bells new album? Who's your favorite band of 2010+?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82dm1?context=5)|Love the new Broken Bells. I listen to all the music. I don't know how I could assign someone like an intern to do that for me. It does not really compute for me. And as far as a favorite band post 2010, let's say M83.
[Jason, I need to know.  Who cuts your hair, player? And can I walk in and say give me the Bentley? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf845bj?context=5)|I go to Yuki Sharoni in Beverly Hills, the mecca of hair salons. 
[Hi Jason! Love the show and glad to have discovered it. Thanks for all the music you play. You've really opened my ears!  What made you pursue the music life? Was it an artist or a DJ that you listened to when you were younger? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81zs9?context=5)|When I was young I was totally fascinated with radio and subculture. By that I mean style and graffiti and music in the city. And so I think without having a set plan I have always known what excites me, what interests me and have naturally been drawn to music and culture. I have always loved radio as a medium. I think partly because it engages the imagination. I think music videos and video in general it establishes too much. It tells you too much. I always liked radio being theater of the imagination and that's what drew me to KCRW originally because there was this exotic music programming and really unusual radio drama that I had never heard before. I'm not talking about the BBC presents Shakespeare, it was weird radio drama like an intimate conversation that you should not be listening to. So I think KCRW always drew my interest from just being very young. 
[1\) How does one become a KCRW DJ, is there anything specific that you look for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81j6l?context=5)|1 well I started at KCRW as a phone volunteer in the main office and traditionally that's how people get involved and find their way and many of our DJs had their start as volunteers so that's certainly 1 way. We don't really go out and recruit people so much. Henry is an exception but he's an exception in a lot of ways. Get involved is the easy answer. It's public radio and there's a lot of ways that you can.
[2\) What was the inspiration for bringing back Metropolis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81j6l?context=5)|2 When I became music director my responsibilities broadened significantly. While my passions for electronic dance music remained, I didn't really have the outlet. It was by popular demand, enough people over time asked me about it and ultimately our general manager brought it up and asked me to bring it back. And so we devised a saturday night program and that's my forum for just pure unadulterated Metropolis.
[3\) How do you think the electronic music scene in Southern California has changed in the last decade, and where do you see it going in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81j6l?context=5)|3 Well Los Angeles has always been a beacon for dance music culture. It's probably a combination of reasons (weather, the aspirational spirit, interesting venues, British expats) and so from the early 90s we really picked up from a lot of what was happening in Europe. Over the years it has evolved and we have made it our own in lots of ways. There have been growing pains where the rave scene has had major issues with people being injured, dying, it's just a matter of managing the masses and safety. There have been growing pains. But we do have the biggest dance music promoters in the country whether it's Insomniac who do a number of events including the Electric Daisy Carnival which is the largest single event in the country (used to be in LA for many years), also the Hard Festival, and then megaclubs like Avalon and Create. And also a lot of the leading Djs have relocated here like Tiesto and Zedd. So Los Angeles is undeniably the US capital of dance music. As far as where it is going, it's hard to predict the future but wherever it's going I will be there. 
[Boxers or Briefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81nax?context=5)|Briefs.
[Jason! Awesome job all the time, love MBE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82dd5?context=5)|There are so many different ways to do this nowadays. I think it's very important for an artist to have a strong aesthetic. It's more than the music which needs to be great, but it's an artistic statement that extends beyond that in terms of whatever imaging or affiliation they make. It's really important. And it's definitely not lost on me the effort that is made. I can't really offer a magic bullet in terms of what a solution is for people across the board. But aesthetics are important. For instance if you send me a CDR with some writing and a sharpie, I would prefer to find you based on a compelling statement musically and artistically. So be careful about the partnerships that you strike. Generally people are more forgiving of commercial endorsements and brands, people understand that it's a necessary evil of sorts. But try to be discriminating of who you get in bed with. There are lots of opportunities out there. Music is a special magic that connects all of us. As human beings it's our connective tissue. So if you are able to make that magic, just protect it and respect it and you might have to turn some things down if you don't feel good about it. As far as great marketing, it's more about respecting your craft and finding the right people to help you get the word out. 
[Since you're neck deep in the industry and see a lot of musicians moving towards more innovative ways of making money (*due to the old ways not working as well*\), such as utilizing themselves as brands and integrating alongside partners such as movies (*Pharrell + Despicable Me 2 and his 24 Hours of Happy website or even Bieber getting the digital video makeover from addidas*\) and more - **What have you seen in the digital music marketing world that you feel has been really effective in spreading awareness of the artist, brand and getting listeners and fans excited?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82dd5?context=5)| 
[Hello, Have been a KCRW member for a while, listen to you in the morning at work, and very excited for this summer's line up at the bowl. anywho, living behind the orange curtain, there aren't many shows down here.  KCRW did an event at the Segrestrom Center a couple years  back, and that was it, no mas.  Any chance it might happen again? Or any KCRW events in Orange County for that matter? Thanks and keep up the good work :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf8298g?context=5)|I totally hear you. And it's really a matter of limited staff and resources. We would love to do more events down there, it's just about finding the time and the energy honestly. We enjoy coming down there and also the reception that we get is always terrific. People really appreciate the effort and that is an important audience for us. But sometimes all we can do is focus on the more immediate community in central LA, but please know that we definitely are trying to find more opportunities down there. 
[When would be the most convenient time during a DJ set to approach you and ask questions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82w9l?context=5)|Never...
[Hello Jason, I was wondering how it was working on the music for the Matrix? And also, what is your favorite fruit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81whr?context=5)|I love raspberries.  But on the Matrix, amazing project, a good 3 years of my life working with the Wachowskis. Just totally inspiring. A long time ago. Wonderful to be around such creative people. The first Matrix was such a game changer. I also got a Grammy nomination for that soundtrack. Unfortunately I lost to Phil Collins for Tarzan. It's true, I was on the edge of my seat when they made the announcement and then they said Phil Collins.
 |The funny thing about working on a  film is that you are too close to it. You see a film in pieces and at the end of it you've seen it 50 times or more so it becomes really difficult to even tell anymore. I knew it was great but it's so hard because your perception is so off. I don't think I knew it would have the kind of pop culture impact that it did. It's just impossible to say that. But amazing group of people, visionaries, and it changed my life.
[MBE is hands down my favorite way to discover new music. Thanks so much for all that you do. Probably a hard question, but which in-studio guest session surprised you the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81lfo?context=5)|Hmmm. Well, I think I hope for surprise every day in terms of what people are bringing to that stage. It's a rarity that any radio station would allow live bands nearly every day to play their hearts out live for the radio audience, it's almost old timey, it doesn't happen anymore. So I hope for the sense of surprise and excitement for everybody. I think the last band that really made me kind of stop and my jaw drop was White Denim. They've been in studio a few times, they're from Austin, Texas, and they are just so good as musicians, they are completely in a zone when they play. It's almost startling to watch. Probably the best live band I know that I've played at KCRW. I mean, everybody's good, but there's something about White Denim, they take it to another level.  Oh, and they're at the Troubadour on Friday!
[Jason. As a curator for the KCRW world festival shows @ the Hollywood bowl, have you thought about bringing house music to the bowl? Something like say Masters at work? a Reunion of Nuyorican Soul? With some contemparies to show the evolution?  I think 30 plus years on House music is having a revival currently. Any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81vmh?context=5)|House music is definitely having a revival, largely due to Disclosure, 2 young brothers from England. Their Grammy nominated album Settle is a nod to classic soulful house music. As far as the Bowl, booking is not easy and it has to be done so far in advance so a lot of times ideas will go on a back burner but it's a good one, house music night. We did have the Basement Jaxx from London there 6 or 7 years ago and that was a great night of house music. But the genre has definitely seen a resurgence and that's just the cyclical nature of the dance music world. I think it's down to move in a different direction in time, probably Trance will make a comeback. 
[Hey Jason!  You've played Coachella 3 times, and even did the voiceover for their trailer. How did you first get involved with the festival? What were your thoughts on the introduction of the new Yuma tent last year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81jvb?context=5)|Yuma is very cool. It's the result of the Sahara tent getting overblown. The EDM takeover of Sahara, Yuma is the answer to that. And it puts music first. And low on spectacle. It's very much an environment where you can feel the sound.  I think it's a brilliant innovation on Coachella's part, and Coachella is a very influential festival. I would guess that other festivals like ACL or Lollapalooza or Sasquatch will probably follow suit. But it's basically an answer to the EDM bombast of Sahara. 
[Hello Jason, what did you have for lunch yesterday?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82fj6?context=5)|I went to The Counter (location undisclosed but I love The Counter). 
[Jason, hi. Listening to your show on KCRW for a long time ... nearly 20 years. I volunteered during a few membership drives during your shift too.  I'm sure you've had many offers to accept jobs elsewhere. What's kept you in the KCRW studio for all this time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf827v5?context=5)|It's more of an extended family, and you know, it's home. It's like a big house of crazy people and you know the little secret place where you can sneak off and get a little work done, and the place where you're going to run into somebody, it's just sort of a touchstone over the years. So I'm just totally a KCRW person, I listen to the radio station when I'm not here, and I'm here every day. I have been here a really long time. It's really strange, I didn't think I would be a lifer, but it's sort of working out that way. As long as I wake up and I'm excited to come here and excited to play that first record and that first set and figure out how I'm going to inspire people and do something special on the radio, I just don't see a reason to stop. It's really special to find a purpose and a calling. Not everybody finds that. We all make sacrifices here to do what we do, we take less money than we might make or we have to make other compromises in our life but it's worth it. 
[What are your current favorite restaurants in LA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf83sjg?context=5)|I love inc. because it's a culinary adventure. I also like Scopa on the west side for italian, and Tar &amp; Roses is also good. We definitely have it good in LA for food.
[Hi Jason, do you have any advice for an aspiring producer/DJ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81mcu?context=5)|Probably find your community. When I think back to the days when I was just getting started, you're naturally gravitating towards your friends and like minded people, whether it's at your college radio station or a live music scene. But don't take any of that for granted. It's amazing to me, looking around at some of my peers today who are successful, are friends I've had for a long time. And you know you really never know. If you find people with a shared passion for something… music, a club scene, a live music scene, everybody has a skill set. And so you probably know a person who can act as a manager or as a promoter or as an art director or as a lighting person, there are so many different ways to express your talents and your passion. I feel like it's easy to overlook these people who are right in front of you a lot of the time, especially when you're hanging out with your friends.
[Hey Jason, really appreciate you doing this. I'm a huge fan of KCRW and a member.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81mfs?context=5)|We host roughly 150 live musicians every year, so it's difficult to pinpoint a few. But personally I loved Underworld. They're a british electronic act and they were just great. But I have a chance to speak with a wide range of artists from Neil Young to Broken Bells. It's pretty crazy. So I really just want to facilitate a good conversation and provide a little insight into an artist's creative process. And there are good and there are bad, but I think my goal ultimately is just a solid conversation. Nick Cave, he's an intimidating figure and an amazing artist, but if you just sort of listen to his music, he seems like a pretty serious customer. That was a real triumph getting a better than good interview with him. It's funny because he is someone who during our conversation talked about the importance of creative tension, and sometimes when you step out of your comfort zone, you bring your best effort, because of the anxiety, because of the tension. And I thought a lot about that when he talked about that and it's true. Having those butterflies really means that you care about something going into it. A lot of artists have dysfunction or they have a certain reputation and from my position you're thrust into a place with someone you don't really know and you have to try to get this conversation done so whether it's Sigur Ros or Ryan Adams, everybody is complicated. So some of my main principles are to be gracious and welcoming. For us, the art is the most important thing. We all rally around the art and the artist. So one of the most important things is to just show our respect for that and our care for that.
[Just wanted to ask, in your time as host of Morning Becomes Eclectic, who has been your favorite in studio performance and any good stories from the people that have played?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81mfs?context=5)|Also as an addition to that, if I can promote our fundraiser tomorrow, we have a very unique place here, we have a very unique philosophy here, and that is only made possible by listener support. We don't answer to a corporation or a boardroom, we are free to share our passions for music and art and culture, and really, honestly the only way we are able to do that is that individuals decide to pick up the phone or go online and support us. It's a very 1 to 1 relationship. So if you want to keep that spirit alive here at KCRW which has made such a huge difference for artists over the years, we hope you will make a pledge starting tomorrow.
[Thank you for the years of great interviews and not dumbing down electronica and having such a great taste and ear for great music!  Who would you say are your favorite all-time electronic music artists that influenced you in the biggest way?  Also, if you could open for any electronic music act, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82d8q?context=5)|I don't know who I would want to open for. Maybe Daft Punk just for the sake of it? Also the year they have had. It would be great to open for them.
[Long time listener here, loved Metropolis for years, glad it came back.  How do you find some of your tracks? Great selection as always. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81jfl?context=5)|I'm a fan, first, so I'm always on the lookout for leading indicators, whether it's producers or labels or different recommendations or things that are buzzing online. It's sort of a lifestyle. You're just immersed in a music scene that you love. So I think that when you're approaching it that way with an open mind and excitement for what you do that really helps.  Also maybe people will mention things and I will pick up on that and pursue it. Also I review a lot of music, people send me music constantly, I'll get hundreds of submissions a week so I try and go through as much as possible, typically in the evenings. 
[Speaking of listener support, could you break down, roughly, how is the money from donations distributed in order to keep KCRW on air? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf82mwg?context=5)|Roughly 70% of our operating budget comes from listener donations. The rest of it is from major donors, corporate grants, things like that. people can hear that on the air, it's not quite a commercial but you will hear credits for different people. It's like our version of an advertisement. But 70% is a lion's share. Also we are working on a new building which is part of Santa Monica college but hopefully in a couple of years we will have that finished. That's a huge commitment, but there is something called a Capital campaign where we go to more institutions, organizations like the Annenberg foundation and things like that for support. So it's not so much the listeners for that one. But we are excited to move into a new facility in a couple of years in Santa Monica. It's a big deal and it's been taking a long time.
[Where do you get all those awesome t-shirts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf820xk?context=5)|I am photographed a lot, so I have to be thinking about my shirt selection. I really like All Saints. I know it's just a mall store, but I think it's because they are from England that I really like them. For more unusual fashions, I like Opening Ceremony. But I have to keep mixing it up, it's true, because I take photos with all the bands that come through and I can't be seen wearing the same shirt every day.
[Ready for torturous question? Your favorite LA taco spot. Go Bentley! Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf821jr?context=5)|El Galleon.

But I love those folks, they do great work and we're still friends.
[Yay hi Jason! Is there a particular artist you have not yet had the pleasure of interviewing that you would just love to talk to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1x4k3o/jason_bentley_host_of_kcrw_la_radios_morning/cf81n0y?context=5)|Maybe that will be my fallback career if this radio thing doesn't work out, I will do yoga and meditation tapes.

I picked up an internship with a company who brought me on as a full-time programmer in the private sector, but due to personal reasons I found 
out after about a year that I wanted to try something with a little more user interaction.


My degree is pretty well-rounded IT, two years of hands on work (Networking, Hardware, Database, .NET development) and another two years with focus on business administration. I'd like to look at other fields of IT such as Helpdesk or System administration, somewhere that would allow me to grow professionally but it seems like there aren't a whole lot of entry level jobs for this that are posted right now.

 
I've looked at the following sites:

1x52gw,2,2014-02-05,SAVE time/money and transfer to small college? Still get internships??,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1x52gw/save_timemoney_and_transfer_to_small_college/,"I go to university in Canada at a popular university in a major city, the CS program is very good and I have known peers to have gotten internships at Amazon and Facebook. I think the school has connections with bigger companies because of it's prominence. 

However, I recently changed programs from arts to CS and at my current school I would have to stay an extra year on top of all the required CS courses (1-1.5 years) since my previous electives in arts aren't acceptable for the CS program. This totals an extra 2-2.5 years of schooling.
Is it worth it to stay at this school and do 2-2.5 years since I know of people who have gone to companies where I want to work. Or should I transfer to a another public university in a much smaller town that isn't as well connected, but I wouldn't be having to redo electives and I could graduate by doing the core courses in 1-1.5 years? 

I would be saving a lot of MONEY and time doing this but will I still get internships? Will applying online make up for lack of career fairs?"

She's mellow, level headed, basically non-nuisance/warm company. She's helped me out, non financially, in the past and I reciprocate. We're both students and I work fully time as a research intern but It doesn't pay. She works on weekends. 

  Every thing's good with one exception, she just spilt a whole jug of water on my brand new mac book pro. I come from lower middle class and my family doesn't have the money, I'm chipping in on the phone and computer payments currently. 

   The damage was minimal, but serious, and apple is charging $755. The equipment no longer worked. I neither have that money, nor am I responsible for the spillage. Also, she's currently letting me couch surf (just a few days) while I transition apartments, and she's asking around for part time work for me, so in that context those factors complicate my considerations.

1x5d46,3,2014-02-05,Nothing to Hide - The Perpetual Intern,cantrememberr,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1x5d46/nothing_to_hide_the_perpetual_intern/,"Hello everyone. Hope your day or night is going well.

I am going to post this from my main account, not a throwaway, because screw it. I have nothing to hide. LOL.

I am feeling a bit ashamed and pretty panicky when I write this. I just realized something, it dawned upon me and HIT ME, and now I need to take deep breaths. Here goes. (Haha why is this so dramatic?)

I graduated college in Spring 2013 and have been underemployed ever since. I was employed for the summer in a paid fellowship that I loved and learned a lot from. In the fall to now, I took on a paid internship in a field that I would like to work in the future. During other times, I job search and have submitted hundreds of applications and interviewed with dozens of companies with no full time job at the moment.

Here I am. Despite my usual full time job searching routine, I have been applying to these exciting fellowship opportunities that last a summer or year at most. For a long, long, time I was scared to apply to a full time job because I didn't want to commit. I was scared that I would feel chained down to my full time job, and that would be the rest of my life.

I sought to apply to these temporary internships and fellowships that last a couple of months because that seemed exciting and dynamic to me.

However, I believe I am heading down the road of being a **perpetual intern**. I started interning (unpaid and paid) in college and am still continuing today! Where will it end? Yes, there is something wrong with the current employment system that punishes recent college graduates for not having enough ""work experience"" that seemingly only be filled with internships (many of which are unpaid).

**My realization at this moment:** I need to actively demand for work. I need to move beyond my fears of being ""tied down"" to a full time job, because a full time job provides security, stability (for the most part) and much more. I would respect me if I had a full time job. My family and friends would respect me a lot more if I had a full time job. 

My dear readers, thank you for your time. Does anyone else feel this way? Let's rant/rage/talk/laugh/CRY???! together. **To all unemployed/underemployed recent graduates out there, I feel you!!** "

Advice on getting back in?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1x5n1j/got_a_bs_in_cs_4_years_ago_but_went_straight_into/,"I graduated 4 years ago with a BS in comp sci from a school that is well-known, but not for its CS program. I had a hard time with the program, graduated with a poor GPA, and wanted to step away from CS. Since graduation I've been working in an unrelated field. My work environment is wonderful, but there is no room for progression, and I find myself wishing I was tackling different and more challenging problems.

I've started programming again in my free time, which I enjoy and am working on some projects. I also have a couple of programming projects lined up with coworkers outside of work hours. I feel positively about this stuff, like I have the spark back from when I was actively enjoying programming, before I finished college. I plan to finish some projects then start looking for a programming job.

I have the CS degree but, personal projects aside, I don't have work experience in CS that I could put on a resume. Could I expect this to be sufficient in starting a programming job without having to be an intern first? Am I going to be treated like a ""recent grad"" and they'll want to see stuff like my GPA? Not sure if it matters, but I live in NYC so there shouldn't be a shortage of companies to apply to, right?

Also, I feel like I can't remember a lot of what I learned in college (there's just flashes of bitwise math, assembly, structures, hashes, matrix math, formal languages, svn and makefiles, dijkstra's algorithm, etc, etc, etc), other than just doing programming projects I want to do, is there some good way to dredge that knowledge back up, refresh it?

What would be my best investment of time to make myself a better candidate? Get a magisters degree in CS? Contribute to open-source projects? Find a job at a startup? Learn new skills?

The movie starts with a tour of the new Metropolis “Memorial” Museum in honor of those who passed away during the “Terraforming Incident” of the previous film. We later see that from the crashed Kryptonian ships, radioactive crystals have broken off and been displayed in the museum and are said to be worth millions of dollars. After an explosion, we cut to a news report being told by Viki Vail in Metropolis where 6 guys are holding the museum hostage. The first appearance of Superman will be shortly after Clark Kent disappears from reporting on the current robbery and from there we can have a classic superman transformation scene (Minus the whole phone booth thing). Superman then, swoops into action making another big example of his immense power for intimidation. But as the robbers start loading up the bags, he begins to feel the same way he felt on General Zod’s ship, with his body slowly becoming mortal and dyeing away. Cut to Gotham city where Billionaires Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor attend a gala in honor of the Wayne Foundation helping rebuild Metropolis with Lexcorp. In this instance we see what business men Lex and Bruce are exchanging ideas for the future of their cities whilst they give their thoughts about this new Superman who effectively caused the destruction of half a city.

Lois Lane and new Daily Planet intern, Jimmy are there out of interest for Lex but then Lois gets distracted by Bruce.

EDIT:
-I may add some conflict in the relationship between Lois and Clark, making it seem like he’s being an arrogant, overprotective boyfriend since he can’t hope to lose her – Kind of like the relationship between Connor and Megan in “Young Justice”.

This will show the audience how much of a ladies man Bruce is and will show an even stronger difference when compared to his night life. Then people instantly get silent, as a TV screen displayed at the gala switches to the news report and talks about Superman’s weak mental and physical state. Bruce then makes up an excuse and leaves Lois alone with Lex and runs off into the night. At this point, Lex could look at the screen and give a small smile indicating that there’s a weakness to this menace that he can exploit. Cut back the robbery, Superman is tied up and is slowly dying whilst the police have the place surrounded. All the lights turn off and we get our second action scene. Although Batman would not be seen in this sequence (Being a myth in the eyes of the citizens), we’ll know who the robbers are dealing with by seeing the cape, Batarangs and quick-cut fighting scenes. So Batman, through some “Arkham City” action, picks off the robbers one by one and ties them up. He looks over at Superman and says, “You’ll be alright… Clark!” The cops then storm the museum and see Batman lurking in the shadows. Here we’ll see than Batman is indeed, an outlaw as he’ll beat up the cops attempting to arrest him and then escape with a gas bomb. The cops then untie superman, put the deadly crystals back, but notice that one is missing, Superman has an idea of who might have stolen it.

In the next scene, Bruce is in the Batcave analyzing the Kryptonite and Alfred could remark, “I haven’t seen you down here in quite some time” since this is an older and seasoned batman. He also notices the many bruises and cuts on his body and the torn up Batsuit. We then get a wide angle shot of the entire cave. As bats swarm all around, the camera pans down and we see Jason Todd’s (The second Robin who died in “Under the Red Hood”) Robin suit and the Bat-Tank. Then Alfred sees the Kryptonite, looks to the left, and says “Quite the collection you’ve made since his discovery”, we see Kryptonian scout ship parts, General Zod’s armor, and Jor-El’s command key he gave to Kal.

EDIT:
-The command Key thing may change in time as Lex Luthor might need it to access the vessel’s holographic recordings

So Batman has basically been hording this new alien tech and analyzing ways in which Superman can be sustained, should he ever turn on the public (Like in the animated film “Justice League: Doom”). Cut to Lexcorp, Lex Luthor has also done his share of scavenging as he was able to salvage the Kryptonian vessel with Jor-El’s holographic recordings salvaged. He learns all about Kryptonian history and Superman’s true identity along with his weakness when exposed to the green crystals. Cut to the daily planet, as Clark is laying down on his desk, tired and weak from the other day, Perry White comes in and tells him he should take the rest of the day off and is quite frustrated how he wasn’t there during the robbery to take photos.

Lois Lane gets invited to the Wayne Manor on her last night in Gotham before she returns to Metropolis.

EDIT:
-Now, Lois is not an idiot, she wouldn't blindly accept a dinner date with a guy she just met the other day, but seeing as how she’s angry at Clark, and we could add in a moment where on the TV she sees Superman carrying a wounded woman out of the crime scene after the robbery, she agrees out of jealousy.

This will transition into a scene that reflects the original Batman film from 1989 where they’re having dinner together. It starts to rain and though the window, we see Superman looking with a face of envy and flies off to his mother’s farm to visit. He tells her how he’s haunted by the events of the last film what with breaking Zod’s neck and allowing thousands more to die in the process. She tells him that he shouldn’t be too hard on himself and should focus on making the world a better place. Then, Lex Luthor himself comes down on a helicopter with a swat team and they attempt to arrest Clark for being Superman.

EDIT:
-This scene varies in my head in terms of who should be the one to arrest Superman, I had the idea since there has to be a Wonder Woman in there somewhere, it could be CIA Agent Diana Prince who steps out of the chopper saying “Mr. Kent, Agent Prince CIA, you are under arrest for crimes against humanity, you have the right to remain silent etc.”

Clark of course thinks its Batman who figured out his identity and told Lex/the government seeing as how they’re business partners with connections. So he flies back to Gotham city to grab Lois but sees that she’s not there. He instantly assumes she was kidnapped (When really she’s on a plane headed back to Metropolis). He receives a note telling him to head to the Indian Ocean (The location where the first Terraformer hit in the first film) which has now been reduced to a barren wasteland with dunes of sand and rock. This is where the fight between Superman and Batman will take place, seeing as how both the gravity levels have not yet evened out and there’s some nuclear fallout which effectively caused the Kryptonite to be formed and the sky to blackout and block the sun.

So Superman lands and looks around at the crumbling mountains, and uses his X-Ray vision to see if he can track Batman’s location. Suddenly, out the sand, the Bat-Tank jumps out firing countless missiles at Superman knocking him down. The tank then accelerates towards him and Batman ejects and extends his cape briefly making a bat symbol in the sky and dives down. The tank then rams Superman and explodes. After Batman lands, Superman then flies towards him ready to attack. The gears in Batman’s right arm grind back and lunge forward punching Superman, creating a big shockwave with every hit. Superman gets angry and punches Batman a few meters back. While he flies back, Batman does a backflip and throws 2 Batarangs with Kryptonite tips, stabbing Superman in the arm and chest. They then detonate and Superman loses balance and falls to the floor. He looks up and Batman lands another punch, jumps over Superman, grabs his cape, and then slams him on the ground. Superman then gets pissed, and picks up Batman, this then reveals that he’s wearing a modified version of Zod’s armor which he salvaged. He then gets a flashback of Zod removing his armor. After seeing who Batman is under his mask (With X-Ray vision), he creates a possible scenario in his head where Luthor reclaims the armor and gives it to Bruce Wayne. Superman then slams Batman through the ground and they end up in a cave. Batman disappears into the shadows right before Superman lands and then throws a sonic radar onto Superman causing hundreds of bats to swarm him. Superman then throws punch after punch but keeps missing batman. Batman’s and Superman’s fists then collide causing another shockwave but cracking Batman’s bones and breaking through the modified gauntlet. Batman then raises his left hand and sprays a longer lasting agent of powdered Kryptonite and then kicks Superman in the face.

Bruce then, takes off his torn mask and says his famous line, “I want you to remember, Clark, in all the years to come, in your most private moments, I want you to remember my hand at your throat. I want you to remember the one man who beat you."" Lex Luthor, in a later scene announces a nuclear doomsday weapon headed for the United States launched by Russia (Which he, himself launched in order to get credit for stopping it) and is laced with tons of Kryptonite so Superman can’t stop it.

EDIT:
-Now we’ve already had alien threats made in the previous film and using that as an excuse would keep the audience wondering why we haven’t seen anything introducing this threat to begin with. Russia is a more likely foe, being the main nuclear opponent/rival to the United States. Plus, in Frank Miller’s story, it was the Soviet Union who launched an EMP missile at the US cutting all the power.

We then zoom out of a TV screen inside Wayne Manor where Superman is healing and Batman is repairing the Batsuit. He then tells Clark his whole story and how he is in no way affiliated with Lex and that he isn’t the problem they should focus on (The irony being, that Lex is clearly pulling all the strings in this big plan) Superman asks Batman why he couldn’t just talk it through with him rather than having a big meaningless fight, Bruce tells him it’s because he wanted to show that Superman has weaknesses and that if one man can discover his identity and a way to defeat him, then it’s possible others will in time (Showing how incompetent and vulnerable Batman thinks he is). Superman remarks “I have to go save them” then zooms into action and Batman gets into his jet and follows.

Superman tries to get close to the nuke but gets weakened and starts falling through the air, crashing into Batman’s jet wing on his way down. Batman then ejects and fires a grapple gun to the rocket and latches onto it with new magnetic attachments on his suit. He sees that it’s been laced with Kryptonite and manages to disable the rocket, shortly before a Lexcorp counter weapon guns it down and destroys it after Batman disables it. Cut back to the Batcave, Bruce is analyzing data he collected from the rocket after disarming it and sees it was launched by Lexcorp and the nuclear war threat was a hoax. The movie ends at the daily planet where Clark is reunited once again with Lois, Perry then turns on the TV and we see a presidential campaign held by none other than Lex Luthor saying, “Where was Superman at our time of need? He destroys half of our great city, and nearly lets the Russians finish the job! Thanks to Lexcorp, we were able to avoid the attack and I promise to keep this country safe should an event like this ever occur again.” And that’s my general theory craft.

EDIT:
-Now you can see that since the last film, the steaks have gone up. Not only have the morals of the first film been addressed, but the plot wholes and inconsistencies have been wrapped up. People weren’t too sure about trusting Superman, he then saves the world (Although at a terrible cost) and everyone’s happy. In the second film we see him become an outlaw just like Batman and the fact that Luthor becomes president makes him even more powerful than the both of them combined (Politically)."
1x5xjg,0,2014-02-06,"My (M/22) fiancee (F/21) and I are getting married in a year, and I kind feel like a bum.",MyFakeProfile,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x5xjg/my_m22_fiancee_f21_and_i_are_getting_married_in_a/,"I've (M/22) been together with my fiancee (F/21) for just over a year and we plan to be married next year. 


Basically, we have been given $2000 by my fiancee's parents towards the wedding. They implied (from what I could tell) that if we needed any more help that we should definitely ask them, but that we should take very close care of how we budgeted that money because, ""Hey, there might be more, there might not."" 


A condition that they gave us with the money was that they ""preferred"" we used $900 of that $2000 for the venue that they were wanting. Fine. Totally cool with that (on account of the fact that over a month ago they said that they were not even coming to the wedding). 


If they want to give us money and pay for the venue/whatnot- cool. Awesome.


But now my fiancee and I are butting heads a little about where money is coming from. 


I just started working at a 15 hr/week making $13 an hour (part time possition that will hopefully turn into a full time job by the time that we get married next year) that is also counting as an internship. I am also living with my parents back at home for the moment now that I don't live on my college campus anymore. 
It's a rough commute (over an hour), but I don't have to pay rent, food or laundry (and a few bucks to help with gas isn't too bad either).


My fiancee lives on her campus Monday-Thursday, comes back to the area and stays at her parents' house Thursday-Sunday where she works in town at her job as much as they will allow her before she goes back to campus again Sunday night. Her parents are slightly less helpful towards her, but it's just a difference in culture between her family and mine.


I've been trying to help out as much as I can with wedding planning while working and taking online classes to finish my degree (final semester of undergrad taking 26 credit hours to finish degree on schedule- May of 14. Woo!) I feel like there are times where she says she wants my help, but is just saying that out of obligation.


Photography. We've looked into a couple of photographers (mostly personal friends who have their own photography businesses) and the cheapest they would give us was $950. Woof. But! Her older brother and sister-in-law told us a little while ago that if we used the photographer that they used for their wedding, they would pay for it. 


That's all well and good, but we both looked at the pictures on the photographer's facebook page and neither of us were too terribly impressed. They were...good. Acceptable if someone else was paying for them. But we were still wanting to look around. 


After finding we couldn't afford any of the people we were talking to, we decided we were fine with what we had and would survive. A couple days ago, I saw a friend of a friend online who we had not considered for photography. I sent him a message and asked if he did weddings, and if so, how much. I then let my fiancee know that I had contacted him and things went from there. 


I told her about the guy, she said that she thought we had settled for her brother's photographer. I told her that we had, but we had been doing research and I figured we hadn't looked into this person yet and it wouldn't hurt to ask. She told me that if she is paying for it, then she is going with the free option. This caught me off guard because I was under the impression that we were BOTH paying for our wedding. She told me that one of us needed to be saving money and that it was a lot easier for me to save money since her parents don't help her out as much as mine help me. 


She then told me that traditionally, the bride's parents pay for the wedding, and since they were *only* giving us $2000, she was taking the responsibility of the rest on herself and because, ""That's traditionally how it's done"" (that the bride's side takes care of the wedding). She then added in, ""And by the way, when are you getting another job?""


I told her that I was under the impression that we were both paying for things but she said I needed to be saving my money for when we get started as a couple. True. And I plan to do that. And pay for our Honeymoon and work out an apartment. But I also feel like she is treating money as an all or nothing deal.


Is this really a money thing or is this a control thing? Should I worry about it either way? OR! Should I try to work out another job so that I can put her mind at ease, showing that money, though potentially difficult, will not be impossible? Should I try to see if she is willing to rely on my help or should I just continue saving?


**tl;dr; - Fiancee claims she is the only one who is paying for our wedding (and is stubborn and won't accept very much outside help). Can't decide if she is using that as a final word on decision making for our wedding or if she is concerned and I should try to get another job to put her mind at ease.**

1. First of all, I noticed a lot of internship positions at relevant engineering firms in Malaysia seem to be for those who are already in their engineering course or those who have just graduated. Is it likely that I will be able to get a position as someone who has yet to enter University?  


1. Will an internship for the next 6 months increase my employability once i'm out of university? Or am i better off enjoying my life and travelling, etc?   



1. Any international Engineering students in the UK or HK who have managed to get placements there? Likewise are there any who have had visa problems and were forced to return to their home countries? I want to know what my chances of getting employed overseas are.

1x61pi,4,2014-02-06,Man of Steel Sequel Fan Fiction,TheRadReticle,FanFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1x61pi/man_of_steel_sequel_fan_fiction/,"So since the Man of Steel sequel has been pushed back to 2016 with a rather questionable cast of actors, I thought it would be a good idea to take another look at a possible theory of how I think this film will play out.

The movie starts with a tour of the new Metropolis “Memorial” Museum in honor of those who passed away during the “Terraforming Incident” of the previous film. We later see that from the crashed Kryptonian ships, radioactive crystals have broken off and been displayed in the museum and are said to be worth millions of dollars. After an explosion, we cut to a news report being told by Viki Vail in Metropolis where 6 guys are holding the museum hostage. The first appearance of Superman will be shortly after Clark Kent disappears from reporting on the current robbery and from there we can have a classic superman transformation scene (Minus the whole phone booth thing). Superman then, swoops into action making another big example of his immense power for intimidation. But as the robbers start loading up the bags, he begins to feel the same way he felt on General Zod’s ship, with his body is slowly becoming mortal and dyeing away. Cut to Gotham city where Billionaires Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor attend a gala in honor of the Wayne Foundation helping rebuild Metropolis with Lexcorp. In this instance we see what business men Lex and Bruce are exchanging ideas for the future of their cities whilst they give their thoughts about this new Superman who effectively caused the destruction of half a city.

Lois Lane and new Daily Planet intern, Jimmy are there out of interest for Lex but then Lois gets distracted by Bruce.

Currently I study psychology in an European country. However, my goal is to work in China after graduation. Therefore, I would like to take the necessary steps now and acquire the skills which will help me in China. 
Besides psychology (which mostly prepares me for a career in Human Ressources) I am also interested in computer science. Please note that teaching English is not an option for me since my native languages are German and Russian (was brought up bilingual). 
In conclusion: what can or should I do now to prepare for a career in China? What level of Mandarin should I have? (are intermediate skills an advantage?) Should I aim for Foreing Companies or Chinese companies? Is it possible or advised to do an internship in China?

1x6fib,2,2014-02-06,I've messed up too many times.,Wilybobonut,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1x6fib/ive_messed_up_too_many_times/,"I don't know how to put it properly.

I've always tried to be good person. I know that I'm lazy and mostly look out for myself, but I've never gone out of my way to personally hurt people(Physically or Emotionally) and I stand by that. The issue is that I have an anger problem. Mostly triggered by my mother and I have a very hard time controlling it. I've lost my temper with her before, once kicking a hole in a plaster wall, roaring at the top of my lungs at her around my younger brothers and now most recently punching a hole in a door.

I obviously never meant to do any of those things. I just lashed out and suddenly there's the damage in front of me and then suddenly my entire family is against me, my mother won't talk to me, and I'm forced to leave home.

I don't want to live with my mum, I've been working hard to move out and get a house with some friends, and I finally managed to get an internship as a cartoonist which means I'll get a bonus in my welfare and I can save for a deposit. I was going on holiday with my Girlfriend at the end of the month and everything seemed to be working out.

But then I come downstairs and my mum isn't talking to me, I ask her whats the matter and she says that I'm not participating with the family, that all I do is nothing and come downstairs and eat. I tried talking with her calmly but I just got more and more angry until she sent me to my room. Me. A 21 year old being sent to my room?

I just sat there taking it all in. I just came downstairs to do some sketches and hang out with my family and I get all this. It upset me. So I slammed my fist on the table got up and punched the kitchen door.

She then said ""Now I want you to leave the house. Pack your bag and leave"". I asked her where will I go and she said ""I don't care.""

Everything just came flooding in. Every bad feeling and every horrible moment just came flooding and I didn't know what to do anymore. I'd fucked up again. Everything meant nothing in that one moment and it just hit me. I'd thought about suicide before but never actually thought it a good enough excuse. But this was the last straw.

""Nobody would care"" I was thinking. I tried to find something long enough that I could tie around the bunk bed post and also fit around my neck. I ended up finding a scarf that my girlfriend bought me and managed to tie the right knots. The first try didn't work too well, the second try seemed to work better, as no oxygen was going through, and everything started going black around me. That alone was terrifying. That was the closest I'd come to actually dying. If I had stayed in that position for any longer and I would have passed out and that would have been the end of it.

I stopped though. It was too frightening. I texted my counceller who I haven't spoken in a while and I'm still waiting for an answer. I texted my girlfriend to let her know what happened(I left out the suicide bit) and I'm still waiting for an answer. I emailed my uncle in australia and still waiting for an answer.

My mum just said that she's going out in 20 minutes, and want me out of the house before she goes. So I guess this is it.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. Didn't really help."

I started in May for my internship and got an offer and started full time in December after I graduated. 

I work at a financial center and the main guy and my boss gave me a great offer in the long run, but terrible pay up front. The plan was for me to go through a few tax seasons and get experience as well as my CPA and MPaCC. Then they wanted me to open up a tax and insurance office in another town close by. It sounded like a great opportunity and I took it.

But now, as I am seeing how the small business works during tax season and others I do not see myself wanting to be here long term or have my own firm in the future. The pay right now is not good and no benefits do not help. They said they would help pay for Becker and MPaCC. But when I was talking to my boss the other day she said she didn't know if they could help at all. 

I majored in accounting because I really loved the financial part of it and bookkeeping and payroll for small businesses is not anything I would like to do as my career. 

Sorry I am rambling, my question is: should I start studying and pay fully for becker on my own like I was planning to do right after tax season or wait until I find a new job and then see if there would be any help. I am willing to pay for becker and start studying for CPA but do not want to waste my time or money if it would not help in this job search.

Thanks!"
1x6te5,173,2014-02-06,Copy and pasting is fine.,runner64,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1x6te5/copy_and_pasting_is_fine/,"I'm going to start this off by saying: I have a degree in web design. My one major project in my year of working at $university is a database-driven web application written in PHP and SQL. So, I know my way around a database. And my boss knows it.         

Recently, we moved our issue tracking system from an externally to an internally hosted one. The new one is all written in PHP and everything is saved in a database. I know this new ticketing system pretty well, because my last workplace used it.   
As part of the initiative to move to the new ticketing system, Bossman came up with about 3 dozen categories that tickets could be sorted into. Since none of the old, imported tickets had correct categories, it was decided that these tickets would need to be categorized. By me. This is an 8-year backlog of closed tickets totaling more than 20,000. The only way to access them is via the ticketing system, and there's no way to mark, in the system, which ones I've done.   
I'm supposed to start at the beginning. I'll copy paste the ticket number into an excel spreadsheet. Then copy-paste the current category. Then type the new category.      
Twenty. Thousand. Times.   
Unless of course I can copy the table and write an app to assist. 
Nope. I'm not allowed to have the password to access the database via phpmyadmin. Our office manager, who is stumped by the practical application of a VGA cable, has access. But I don't. I explain how much easier it would be to do this from within an app. Nope. Not allowed access.     
I now have 3 months to copy-paste 20,000 ticket numbers into an excel sheet, presumably while staring at my degree and sobbing quietly.   
             

Or so he thinks.   
See, the database is hosted on a virtual machine. And that image is hosted on a server. And I know the guy who tends the server. So I get a copy of the VM image. And I get the tables out. And I upload them into MAMP. And in 48 hours, I've written an application that will display a single, random ticket, next to a dropdown menu. The new category is selected from the dropdown. A single button is pressed. The ticket number, current category, and new category are written to a table. And a new random ticket is displayed. Foolproof.      
I hosted the tool and sicced the interns on it. They've done 5,000 tickets in less than a week. I'm going to be done ahead of schedule. And I don't need to spend 12 weeks copy-pasting.     
My boss has not figured out how I got the database copy.

1x6tuh,1,2014-02-06,Kind of a weird situation... advice on getting started?,icanfeelusfallingg,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1x6tuh/kind_of_a_weird_situation_advice_on_getting/,"Hi /r/fitness!

So I want to start lifting weights. I'm a very overweight 20/f and I don't want to lose it all through cardio because I'm afraid of loose skin.

I have no problem going online and finding some beginner workouts (I think I'm going to go with bodybuilding.com's Jamie Eason's LiveFit Trainer!) and I have no problem figuring out how to do them and all that.

The only problem is the gym... I'm a university student and I work for our school's media company... I have 25 people working under me and EVERY TIME I'm at the gym I see at least one of my interns, and some of them clearly lift. And usually I see other people I know from class, etc.

Also, the area where I want to lift, is in the middle of the cardio floor and near the lockers so literally EVERYONE passes by there.

So how do I get over my embarrassment? I'm worried my interns aren't going to take me seriously at work if they see me at the gym looking like a moron trying to figure out how to lift. And it's embarrassing to see people I know."
1x6x0r,1081,2014-02-06,I got pregnant at 19 and chose to keep it.,mn270411,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1x6x0r/i_got_pregnant_at_19_and_chose_to_keep_it/,"I have been seeing a lot of posts from women who have gotten abortions and were happy with their choice, and that right there makes me proud to be a woman, that we have that right to choose what we can do with OUR bodies, whether people like it or not. I never had an abortion, but it was helpful to see what the details were that went into it. I think a lot of women are uninformed with that and it’s great that there are resources to understand better. On that note, I chose the opposite of an abortion. I kept the baby and I am going to tell you how it can work out this way as well. Just to let you all know, I am NOT against abortion AT ALL. It just wasn’t the choice I wanted to make. So here it goes:

**Finding out:** I got pregnant at 19 years old by my boyfriend. He lived in Europe and I lived in the US. I was living and travelling in Europe before this and that is how we met and fell madly in love. We kept the long distance thing up because we knew it was worth it and when he came to visit for a summer it happened and then I didn’t find out I was pregnant until after he left. I was just over 2 weeks (maybe 3) late with my period. At first I was concerned why I didn’t get it, but thought, “oh, it will come eventually”. Then my boobs started to get very very sore. I told my mom about this and how I was late and she told me to take a test. I skyped my boyfriend saying that I thought I am late with my period and I will take a test tomorrow morning. We were both convincing each other that I am definitely not pregnant.  The next morning I woke up, went to the store, got home set up skype, peed on the stick and came back to the computer sobbing. My boyfriend knowing that from those sobs, I was in fact, pregnant. We had sex “only” a few times unprotected, but that’s all it took. I told him that I am going to keep it and if he wants to stay with me he can, but at the same time if he doesn’t, he totally has the choice to have no part in it if he wants. Since he was from a different country, it would have been very simple for him to say that he doesn’t want to do this with me, but he didn’t, he said, “We will be together and do this together because I love you.” 

**Being Pregnant :** I went to a doctor who told me again I was pregnant . I said I was keeping it and he said okay. At 8 weeks I heard the most beautiful sound ever, my baby’s heartbeat. We decided that my boyfriend would stay in his country to finish a year of uni and then he will move here when he is done. I told my family of our decision and they freaked out and for months threatened to kick me out of the house and telling me they were going to force me to get an abortion. They did not agree with my decision at all and said none of this will work out. I was devastated and along with the INSANE pregnancy hormones I was a wreck. I was alone without the love of my life and my family shunned me. They did not speak to me or help me through a very hard time in my life. My friends were there as much as they could be!  I decided that I know that I am keeping this baby and I will be as happy and healthy as I can be regardless of all the negativity. I loved being pregnant. I did not have much morning sickness and realizing this little baby was growing inside of me was one of the coolest things I have ever experienced. The bigger my belly grew the more beautiful I thought I was. I did get horrible heartburn but that was it. I was also lucky enough not to get any stretch marks! My boyfriend and I skyped every day, spoke for hours, called each other, emailed, messaged ,etc. He was very supportive the entire time. It just killed us both that we were across the world from each other. We decided when he visited for Christmas that we will get married. We did and it was one of the best days of my life. He went back to school then came back again for the birth of our child. 

**The birth:** I had to find out by myself (along with the many other doctor visits I went to alone) at 20 weeks that I was having a girl!!!! The ultrasound was so perfect. She LOOKED JUST LIKE A REAL BABY!! It was wonderful. The last month I was HUGE! Soooo big and uncomfortable. I worked 30 hours a week standing up and was at school for 4 hours every night my entire pregnancy, so I was miserable towards the end, but so ready to have this baby!!!! My husband came in for the week of my due date. The doctor said that if the baby isn’t here by a week after my due date then I will be induced. Which means they will start to put me in labor. She did not come on her own during the week so we had the day scheduled that I would go in and have this baby! We went in at 6 am and I was so scared, but my husband calmed me down and we were talking about how we finally get to meet this little one. I was 1 cm for 6 hours and the pitocin was taking forever, so they popped my water bag to get it going quicker. That was one of the weirdest feelings ever. I was layed on the bed and they put a mat underneath me and when it popped it was just this warm uncomfortable liquid everywhere! Haha it was horrible!! No pain, just very very uncomfortable. Then 2 hours laterI started to contract. I am not kidding when I tell you that it was the worst pain I have EVER experienced in my life. It felt like knives were going in and out of my back. I was swearing like a sailor and begged for the epidural. They gave me the epidural (burned so bad!!!) which was also one of the weirdest/ best things I have ever had done to me in my life. The pain immediately stopped. It was heavenly! I went to sleep and then HOURS later they came in telling me I am 9cm and the baby will be here any minute. The doctor rushed, the nurses rushed in, I was in no pain and so ready. They told me to push, I did. Push again, I did. Once more, I did. Then BOOM this alien looking thing was in the doctor’s arms!!! I felt not a single thing the entire 10 minutes of pushing this baby out. Me and my husband were crying and he told me I was his hero. This was the best moment of my life. We got to hold our beautiful 9lb 2oz 22in long daughter, at last!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

**Recovery:** They stitched me up, because the baby was so big it tore down there. They gave me really good pain killers, so it was fine. Just kinda weird knowing I have stitches there, ewwww, but worth it. We were in a recovery room for 3 days and at night the baby went with the nurses so I could sleep and get my hormones all back in place. We were on cloud 9. So happy and so in love with this person we only just met. My family came around and so did my husbands (alllllll the way from Europe!) because during the last few months of my pregnancy they realized that they should have supported us in whatever decisions we chose. They came in the room and saw the baby and all started crying and they were also so in love with her. 

**How we made it work:** I had one year of school, but realized I needed something else to support my baby. I enrolled in an 8 month certificate program at a school that promised to get you a job after it’s finished. I had to go every day for 4 hours and couldn’t miss a day. It did exactly that though! I had the baby during my program and they gave me time off to have the baby. I got back into it and then I interned at an office and got the job after my internship. I also worked 30 hours a week as a “barista” making minimum wage, but it was something! I saved every penny and I also got medical help through Public Aid and was qualified to receive WIC (women infant children) that gave me checks to use at stores to buy baby food and formula if I needed it. I advise every young pregnant person to try to use the government help, because it is for people like YOU. There are so many resources to use. Food stamps, WIC, childcare assistance, housing assistance, financial aid, etc. Do not feel embarrassed, etc because this is how you get on your feet and then you can try to get a job and make your own money (best feeling ever!). I used it for a year and then finally made enough money so I didn’t need anymore help. I DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!! I worked my ass off, I was alone a lot, I studied and did everything I could to make sure me, my husband, and baby would have a good life. 3 years later and I am at the same job supporting my family while my husband works part time and is in school full time and watches our daughter in the day. I love them more and more every single day. Like the women who have said they do not regret getting an abortion, I do not ever regret keeping the baby. They are both very hard and both can work out! 

Sorry it’s so long and all over the place! Feel free to ask any questions. 

Edit: Well I wanted this to be my throwaway but it's too cute NOT to post a picture of my little girl. http://i.imgur.com/81pSKzT.jpg 


Edit #2: [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/xbNCwzn.jpg) that I am in fact a woman since someone is calling me out on being a ""white conservative male, who has never gone through childbirth."""

1x7p1f,1,2014-02-06,Im 24 (M) She s F(22). In so much pain.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x7p1f/im_24_m_she_s_f22_in_so_much_pain/,"I met my girlfriend working for the Disney internship program. We were together for 3 months before her program ended and 

she had to go back home and i stayed for another 2 and a half months without her.We decided to move in together after my 

program ended.


A few weeks before she was to move down here , she saw a high school friend she was in love with in a park at 3 am (she was 

honest about seeing a guy not the love part). She told me they ve never been together because he s in the air force and she 

didn't think she was good enough for him. The guy told her he had feelings for her. It wasn't till she moved here that she told me 

she loved the guy.


In Miami she was miserable , hated her job , hated the people , the traffic,Everything.

The reason i went to disney was to have fun and have the college experience i never had. At work i start to notice their s a girl 

who likes me. Didn't really pay attention to her , not my type and i was hanging around another girl at that time.


I meet my gf in a club and we start to hang out. We were official a week or two after we met. But my roommates throw a small 

party later that month and they tell me to invite girls. So i invite my coworkers and they also bring the co worker who likes me . 

We all start drinking and dancing and suddenly im kissing the coworker. We kissed a few times that night and one more time 

at work about two weeks after . ( i felt terrible after , my ex cheated on me with a friend and i always thought cheating was 

the most disgusting thing ever) I was tired of being the 

safe guy , the nice guy.


Throughout my program nothing else happens with this girl or any other girl. The co worker found a bf and i had my gf. Her bf 

did cheat on her and she started talking to me more at work and through text late in my program (her program ended before 

mine)


My gf tells me about the feelings about her guy friend and i freak out . When i get mad i don't really scream, want to talk , or get 

physical. What i do is just ignore the person until my anger passes.So she doesn't get the point of being honest with me if im 

gonna treat her like that. I was really great full she was honest with me.


I receive a Facebook message from the co worker saying how much she loved me , and that she wishes that we would of been 

single when we were in the program because she felt that i was her ideal guy and that we were similar and stuff.

So the coworker texts me from time to time about school and parents and stuff like that , occasionally the drunk texts about 

wanting too be with me. I pay little attention , she s 2000 miles away and it felt good being appreciated when my gf told me 

about the guy friend. My gf tells me about the guy friend and packs her bags a few times and i start texting my coworker more 

.My gf finds out and tells me to stop texting her. So i do tell my coworker to stop texting me , even though she does send me a 

handful of texts, it wasn't anything like the texts before and she got bored because i only texted her one letter or one word 

answers and she told me i suck and she also sent me group holiday messages.


We r still having some problems because she hates miami.


But things get a bit better , a few hours before new years she tells me she loves me and that she wants to stay. We go back 

home make love and i start to get a few happy new year messages. I open it in front of her not thinking much of it . But one 

reads ""Happy new year can't wait to see you"". My gf gets furious. I ask what she meant and she responds I want to see you but 

my gf doesn't see this message.After that night i promised to cut all contact with the coworker. I told the coworker i wanted zero 

contact from her , so I erased her from FB and my phone.We kind of work things out , but then she tells me that she got in 

contact with her guy friend after she saw my co workers text.


I forgave her and right when i was taking her to the airport she tells me that they had talked about getting together . I got 

furious and ignored her the whole way. (she went back home for a week to visit family). While she was their we patched things 

up. She told me she wasn't gna see him. When i pick her up from the airport she tells me they had breakfast together and 

talked. I got angry and had a huge fight that night.


Again we make up and demand she erase his fb and number which she did.

We decided to move back to her town. She s in Jacksonville and the plan was for me to meet her their and then drive together to 

her town. I was suppose to go today . But she called me yesterday saying she wants nothing to do with me because the 

messaged the coworker and asked if we ever did anything and the coworker said we did kiss. My gf had asked me that very same 

question like 3 times , And i always said no. She said she would have forgiven me for it but i was too ashamed and afraid she 

was gonna leave me for it.

tldr: Gf caught me being dishonest about a coworker . She moved in with me being in love with another guy. I forgave her and 

she chose me , she told me she loved me.I love her so much , but she says she can't trust me. I love her so much, i know we

 would of been so happy back in her hometown 

. I'm going to  regret losing her for the rest of my life. She s the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't want to give 

up on her . She s so special. "

1x7rll,12,2014-02-06,"Anxiety is a state of mind that can be exacerbated by the antagonizing need for answers. We're all human and honestly a little bit of hypochondriacs, especially with the access we have. Story inside",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1x7rll/anxiety_is_a_state_of_mind_that_can_be/,"Anyone in agreement with my title? I know it seems slightly pessimistic and for all of the ""suffers"" probably a bit misconstrued because, ""we're actually inflicted!"". I have recently been tossing this idea around in my head considering that I have been in a struggle with what I believed to be depression/anxiety/ocd...etc, and I thought that my life wasn't in my own control anymore. It seemed that I might as well hand over my ability to reason to my newly anointed ""crazy, endlessly-running, sad"" mind. This was my exact thought process for a year and a half up until now. 

I found the idea to call myself mentally unstable after I seemingly lost control of my thought process and allowed dark, repressed thoughts to take the reins over a couple weeks time until one day where I caved. The year before this I had walked onto a Division 1 mid-major swim team without prior training aside from dedicating every minute of my previous summer to transforming myself into a grade A athlete. My mind was focused on nothing else and this was good for me, as I had finally found a way to disassociate myself from my half year of sadness after a breakup and a shitty freshman roommate. My sophomore year was promising, as I began the year with the least experience, the best build and a whole lot of room for improvement on the team. Come the third month of training and my season is plagued by a very fucked shoulder and I was forced to watch my teammates succeed from the bench, not to mention I had just recently tried to find happiness in one of the most beautiful girls I have ever known. I tried to repeat my prior relationship the same way as my first and immediately my infidelities came out. She obviously was excited at first but saw my sad motives and moved on. At the end of the year I knew that my athletic career was over and I had literally no clue where I stood with women, not to mention I had developed a weird anxiety where I was constantly checking to make sure I wasn't going to piss myself in class. God Dammit. I basically thought I had no hope for anything. Later on I broke down to my parents about how scared this made me feel while omitting the anxiety issues. I lost all hope for life and I was sad as shit. 

Enter the summer before junior year and I have started my first internship with a broken ego. My boss was quite possibly the most abusive person I think I will ever meet and one of my coworkers was a closet homosexual. I know that's a brash thing to say but it was discussed around the workplace and it was quite obvious. The reason that is relevant is because of a developed new thought process that made me terrified of becoming gay. Funny, right? I had never had these thoughts previous and became terrified of myself. The sheer thought of homosexuality destroyed my well being and it made me turn from a confident individual who had never had any issues being outgoing into a nervous, shy person who would have rather sat in my room and stare off into space. Fast forward past the summer and I had scavenged the internet for the ""answers"" to what was going on. This was on top of the fact that I had entered myself into a peer-pressured lifestyle of a fraternity. I unfortunately and fortunately am one of the better looking guys at my school and felt pressure from everyone I knew, even when it wasn't as present as I made it out to be. I would later on learn that this pressure was a self-pursued fantasy. Good-looking people can still be scared shit-less, when approaching the opposite sex when sober.

H.O.C.D. and Depression: ""A debilitating combo that affects very few OCD sufferers around the world. The normal patient has constant spikes in anxiety when placed in a situation involving sexual contact or where possible sexual connotations are present. Usually the patient is not gay and has never had previous desires for homosexual contact. The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."" Perfect, I found my answer. I was an OCD kid who simply couldn't get rid of some thoughts. Now remember, I was so deep into my own thoughts that the ""H.O.C.D."" was actually ruining my life. I kept reading deeper and deeper into my issues and decided to couple my new life with a bad habit of smoking weed 2/3 times a day, even after a previous bad experience with pot immediately following my first breakup. I thought to much, cast my health to the dregs and made bad decisions all year. I played friendship like it was an instrument and didn't really hold anything dear. It was like I had thrown in the towel and allowed my thoughts to capture who I actually was. 

I knew I needed help, so I went to see a therapist at school. It seemed like the perfect chance to take a step to recovery, even though I still had no genuine understanding of my issues but still a good opportunity. The only issue was that I was assigned a gay therapist. Perfect. I gave him half assed answers the entire time and eventually gave up on the sessions without disclosing my OCD fears. 

Fast-forward into the spring and was at a loss for what I was going to do with myself. I hated myself, It felt like there was nothing I could do and the fact that I kept reading into my issues from other peoples, similar but still subjective problems, did not help. The next summer came and my anxiety was at an all time high. I vividly remember having horrific panic attacks, where my body was almost uncontrollable. I hated where I was and I hated who I had become. 

This past fall, I finally found some courage to change my life. I went to a new therapist and a psychologist at school and told them everything. It felt good and honestly even though I honestly thought I was insane, I definitely noticed a change in my thoughts the day after my sessions. This revelation did come with a price though. The price was a new sense of purpose in life and my submissive anxiety filled character started to fade away. Once I harnessed that, I started smoking less and eventually became more engulfed in my health. I tried acid a few times too, which I thought was just going to make me crazy but it actually did the opposite, It allowed me to grow even when I did have one bad trip. Continue up to now and I have apologized to the people I have hurt, removed some bad seeds from my friendship group and stopped grasping others specific issues as answers to my own issues (I'm looking at you reddit). I have begun to write occasionally and although I still suffer from the occasional bad thought, I find it now more subjective in my case and I rely on myself to change my life and thought process. The things that finally brought me back to some sort of reasonable mental state were not relying on my thoughts to predict my happiness and making my actions key in defining who I actually am. I'm not going to say I'm happy all the time and I'm not going to say I'm sad all the time either, but I have changed and have embraced my growth from youth to manhood as a beautiful part of life, no matter how terrifying it is. I have also realized that being shitty to women and collecting sexual partners is a terrifying way to live life and it won't collect happiness for you, especially if thats not how you lived life upto college. Taking note of the world around me and not fitting all of my problems into each and every single moment of my life has proved key in my recovery. Moving moment to moment is better than continuing a thought filled, action-less life, but then again that's subjective for me. 

P.S. Acid is a beautiful drug and you won't go crazy from it unless you have a legitimate family history of schizophrenia or something of the like. 

TL;DR: OCD and other mental health issues are real, but become exacerbated to the point of finding yourself in a horrible pit of despair. Don't rely on reading others experience to change you, change yourself and trust your instincts over your harmful thoughts. 

I commend you if you actually read all that. Also please note that this isn't my full story, I had a wild year and a half dealing with this so there is more than just this page."
1x7v5v,6,2014-02-06,Question about summer job,reddit_asdfghjkl,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1x7v5v/question_about_summer_job/,So I'm a freshman at UCLA and am interested in getting a job here during the summer. Where are the best places to look for summer jobs around here? And are there any jobs where I'd be provided housing. Is it going to be too expensive to pay for housing down here during the summer since i'll be making minimum wage or close to it presumably. I'm an engineer so ideally I'd look for an internship but I've found it's really heard as a freshman. I probably should talk to someone else about this but I was just looking for an advice beforehand.
1x7x0l,0,2014-02-06,"An accountant by the skin of my teeth, is there hope?",accfledgling,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1x7x0l/an_accountant_by_the_skin_of_my_teeth_is_there/,"I just got my BSBA in accounting (actually, with a concentration in CPA-prep taxation). Not to get overly personal, but I've had some circumstances in my personal life over the course of 2013 that were, at best, very difficult for me. As a result, my GPA is a 2.5. I have an associates in computer science in which I graduated with a 3.87, sigma kappa delta, phi theta kappa, mu alpha theta... There's just a very clear distinction in the way I've performed at this level and the way I performed before I had those concerns in my life. As a side note, between the change from CS and accounting, I think I have enough total semester hours (153) to sit for the CPA exam in some states.

I have experience volunteering for a tax site that served low-income families, and this will be my 3rd year doing so, but I feel afraid. I'm afraid that my GPA is too low and that I won't be able to find any where to get practical experience beyond tax prep. Most internships I've seen want a 3.0 or higher, so I haven't been eligible to even apply.

I guess I'd just like to ask /r/Acccounting as a collective, what would you advise me to do?"
1x7y48,1,2014-02-06,CS Grad get some advice in terms of future planning?,digerati32,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1x7y48/cs_grad_get_some_advice_in_terms_of_future/,"Hi r/jobs, I was hoping to get some insight into what would be the best path for me to take at this point. r/cscareerquestions didn't turn up anything, so was hoping you could help! 


**Background**

I have a degree in CS, with 16months of internship experience, and about 8 months of full time experience, at two different companies. Most of my experience is in making Android and some iOS apps, with some server side work.


**Further Education?** 

I am wondering if I should go back to school to do a Masters in CS/Applied Computing, or pursue a PMP and get some project management experience. My overall goal is to increase my salary, and work on more meaningful projects, at small-medium sized companies while targeting to work at a larger company in about 5-10 years down the line in a management role.

**Concerns** 

What I am concerned about is that there is a huge push towards Machine Learning / ""Big Data"" (I am not 100% clear on what is meant by this), and that I am lacking this valuable toolset. However, they both seem like really big, unapproachable topics, so I am wondering if it is better to go to school to learn them, or go to school to gain a PMP. Which would be more valuable in 10 years?


**Ideal Future Plans** 

An ideal goal in life would be to manage my own company, but I want to have a strong grasp of the tools before I venture down that path. I also would like to target a path that has a 100k+ salary :).


I hope that was clear!! Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

I am a college student. In 2011 (I was 20), I was charged with petty theft under $50. I did a plea of no contest and asked for a deferred disposition.

I completed the terms asked of me. There was no conviction, but what about probation?

This application is for a program that helps students apply for internships. Consequently I do not want to lie or hide information but I do not want to mark yes and disqualify myself if their definition of ""probation"" is more sinister than I am thinking.

I asked through an email if by probation they meant the probation you receive after a citation or the type of probation where you have to check in with someone, wear a bracelet, or be confined some way. They responded with ""I am not concerned about a driving ticket.  However if you have a police record that could be seen, I am interested in regards to that.  This would need to be known ahead of time in case there should need to be a security clearance needed.""

Hopefully this clarifies things from the thread I posted last night.

1x88sq,17,2014-02-06,A few words from the past year. One year today.,superusah,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1x88sq/a_few_words_from_the_past_year_one_year_today/,"On this day 1 year ago I was on a snowfilled beach in northeren Denmark in a car with my SO.
I had a big lump of hash and a bag of beers. A few kilometers in-land was the rehap facility that I'ed  requested a spot in. I was very scared. We drove passed the place three times. Every time I said ”Go past, I'll just have one more joint and a beer before I go in.” 


The first 10 days were horrible. My anxity and prejudice were working overtime. My SO came to visit the 2nd weekend, and when she was about to leave, I ended up in a panic attack behind the facility. A state of snot, tears and uncontrollable breathing made my SO refusing to leave me. The fear in me saw an oppotunity to get away and took it. I got in the car with her and we left. The addict in me was relieved. Not because I would now go home and feed him, but because he'd get a break from the beating he took daily in therapy. 4 days later the head of the facility came to our house. We had a long talk and I went back up north with him. 

The next 2 months were rough. Again, anxity and prejudice were my biggest issues with my fellow 'inmates'. I was one of those clients that expected a rehab clinic to be a round the clock operation. ”What am I suppose to do outside of therapy?!”. I was signed up for 6 months. 

3 months in we were going on a trip. To this sports/activity place. To have fun. I lasted 24 hours, then called my SO, packed my bag and started walking. I couldn't handle the social aspect of it. I wanted (sometimes demaneded) treatment! Not fooling around in a swimming pool or on a badminton court. I was home for a week that time. Yet again, the head of the facility come to our house. This time with a propersition: Instead of living at the facility, I would live in the halfway house that was part of the facility, attending therapy every day, but go and live with people who had already done their time in rehab and were now moving on.

With relieve I said yes. Weighing my options which were 1) stay at the facility, in misery, maybe even bail entirely. 2) Go to a ”safe place” but miss the chance of actually dealing with the issues that made me miserable in the first place. 

Thankfully my therapist was not as black and white as I, and said that we'd have a much better platform for dealing with my issues when I felt more comfortable. 

And he was right. 

The next 3 months were incredible. While still attending therapy everyday at the facility, I also started as an intern at a bikeshop. With all cards on the table which felt so nice. I was becoming a proud addict instead of a deceiving and shameful prick. 6 months in and my gratuation ceremony was comming up. I was granted another 6 months in the halfway house were I already was, but I kindly refused.

 One day in September I toled everybody that I was done. I was ready to move along. I wanted to move back home, build a touring bike, and go cycling in Europe for a month. 

I only met support. Which felt great. I was – maybe for the first time in my life- proud of myself.

I spent October plannning, buying and building the bike. 
Took off and rode around in Germany for a week, and decided I couldn't do this by myself, yet. 
I was scared, cold and lonely. The neon beer signs were getting more and more bright. So I called my SO and she drove down and picked me up outside Hamburg and we drove home. 

Next few days were filled with dissapointment, regret, anger and relief. 

These last couple of months have been a challenge. This was not what I thought beeing clean would be like 10 months ago in the dark northen Jutland. I am slowly re-entering society, starting an internship at a bikeshop on monday. I've started a mobile-bike-repair company and everything is scary and unknown.

 And I guess that's what it's suppose to be. I've just never realised it because I've been safe and warm in my addiction- But I must say, this new scary life is pretty rewarding. And loving myself for the first time is absolutly incredible. I've started my new life now. One year clean today.

This may have been asked plenty of times, and I've searched around without any solid successful stories or advice. How does one market themselves when they do not have a degree?

Background:
I've always had a strong interest and passion for computers and programming. I started back when when I was in elementary school, VB5 at the time, and was hooked. I've taken HS classes and college classes on vb, c++, c and python. I've always tried to do side projects/ideas however they were usually too great to complete myself. 

I had an internship that allowed me to learn new tools and languages that I picked up on and excelled in fairly quickly. I've been trying to emphasis that during my job hunt journey to show that I am capable. 

When I have a project, idea or challenge, I go ""hyper-manic"". Applying 110% at it where I will spend my weekends and off the clock time to learn more, try out different ideas and enjoy it the whole time.

Unfortunately I don't have many/any samples of work and can't seem to find an idea that has sparked that feeling I get when I work at a job."

1x8w1f,4,2014-02-06,"My friends are always ""sick""",[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1x8w1f/my_friends_are_always_sick/,"I love my friends. They're cool people and I love them and enjoy hanging out with them whenever I can. That said, some of them tend do this annoying ""sick"" act. Some of them don't commit, which is equally as irritating.

One of my friends is the fucking worst hypochondriac I've ever met. She's always sick, or she's coming down with something. She skips work at least one a week, usually for some bullshit excuse, like ""I have a headache"" or ""I'm too tired."" I don't know how she can hold down a job pulling that shit. My mom is a doctor and has her own practice. If any of her office staff pull this shit (and a lot of them have) she'd fire their asses. Consequently, I never learned how to ""play sick"" when I was young. My mom could always tell if I was faking, so I just stopped doing it and fucking grew up.

And you know what? I sometimes get a headache. A lot of times, I'm tired too. But you know what? Tough shit. Take some aspirin. Get more sleep, do *something* besides lie there looking for sympathy and moping about being sick. The last time I took a sick day was three years ago. When I had horrible back pain last year after breaking my tailbone, I didn't miss a single class or skip work. Another friend of mine was *proud* of the fact that she only attended four class sessions *all semester*. What the fuck? What a goddamn waste of tuition money.

This lends itself to another issue I have with my friends: lack of commitment. There are a lot of things I'm not good at, but I think I'm a great friend. Having a bad day and want someone to talk to? I'm there. Can't afford to splurge for ice cream? I got you covered. Want to meet up? I'm there early. I'll always look over your little faults (until I reach a breaking point, like now). And yet, when *I* have a bad day or want to meet up, my friends will say sure, but not before letting me know how much of a fucking chore it is. ""Oh, *this* Saturday? Oh. Okay... I hope I can get ___ done by then..."" And then they'll show up half an hour late and say ""can't stay long"" every 15 minutes. I recognize that my friends have lives and commitments beyond me, but when it happens this often, I have to wonder.

 This is why I hardly ever ask friends to hang out. They have to ask me. I feel like I'm such a burden when I'm not doing something beneficial for them. It's led me to have trust/self-esteem issues. Am I annoying? Do people think I'm too dumb to hang out with? Am I embarrassing to be around? I ask myself this a lot now.

Now, granted, not all of my friends do this. In particular, one friend I made in grad school is the nicest dude ever; he's a great person and a great friend. One day, I had a horrible thing happen to me that led me to quit my internship. I usually don't ask for help because as stated above, I feel like a selfish jerk when I do. I did that night, though, and boom, he was at my place in 20 minutes with a case of beer. He stayed long after I had calmed down, and I was incredibly grateful for it. I wish I had more friends like him (if there's one positive thing I can give to this rant, I guess this is it). 

So, this rant got off topic, whoops. This was originally supposed to be a rant about friends being annoying hypochondriacs, but now it's how my friends take advantage of me and how I now have self-esteem issues. Still, it feels good to let it out."
1x8wrv,3,2014-02-06,Tactfully declining a previously accepted internship?,PhilABustArr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1x8wrv/tactfully_declining_a_previously_accepted/,"Hey all! I accepted an internship for the summer in November, but I am finding more and more things out about the internship that I am not fond of. The nature of the work will be far more IT than technical and I'm becoming increasingly aware that the company is corporate and cold (sent me information on the formal dress code required and required a hair follicle drug test pre-employment screening, which I passed but did not like to do).

These warning signs are making me think it'll be more advantageous for me to decline the internship and take summer courses instead so I can get ahead and get a technical position the following summer with a far more modern company. However, how should I approach turning down this position? I do not want to develop a bad reputation for turning it down, but I just do not think this position is for me.

1x8y8t,3,2014-02-06,Oh my god WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE. [non-trad],[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1x8y8t/oh_my_god_what_am_i_doing_with_my_life_nontrad/,"My entire life, my parents pushed me to be a doctor. That's why for the ensuing 27 years, I did my best to avoid it. Now I'm rethinking that.

Let's just cut to the chase here: I flunked out of undergrad, twice. When I finally went back, I barely graduated. I've failed and retaken classes MULTIPLE times. Cs get degrees, you dig? I think my cumulative GPA is something like 2.9 and my science GPA around a 2.7(?) -- I've actually been a little too afraid to calculate it. It took me 6 years to graduate.

If I have one thing going for me, though, it's that I'm a damn good test taker. Despite my shit undergrad GPA, I scored 98th percentile+ on the GRE, which got me accepted into grad school on probationary status. All I had to do was maintain a 3.0+ and I would be fully accepted. I managed to do that. I actually graduated last year with a MS in Neurobiology and a 3.67, pretty much all science courses. Only blemish on THAT is that I took a research credit and my advisor graded me as ""nonsatisfactory."" (We didn't really get along. Also, it was computational neuroscience and I'm a poor programmer. Give me wet lab work any day.)

Post graduation, I got a 6 month internship in a cancer research lab at a medical school. Turns out, I'm good in the lab. Really good with my hands, especially when it comes to mouse surgery. The gears started turning: sure is a waste to use this on mice and not on people... 

So I'm seriously considering applying for medical school now. I actually took a month off after my internship ended to do some shadowing at the medical school. I shadowed some neurosurgeons, though I understand they don't have quite the workload other doctors do. But I totally dug it - I love interacting with people, I think I'm pretty bright and can handle the intellectual rigor...

I don't really care for money or prestige. I mean, they're nice to have, but I don't need to make tons of money. Bank of Mommy and Daddy said they would finance my med school education, if I managed to get in. I have no desire to work 70 hour weeks to earn $400,000 a year to pay back med school debt. Actually, I think I would be happiest as a hospitalist, 14 shifts a month, plenty of other time to pursue other interests. For me, that would be volunteering at a low-income women's clinic at least one day a week. I've been married for 3 years, and we're thinking about starting a family soon, too.

My cancer research internship got my name on 3 papers, 1 already published and 2 coming out sometime later this year, hopefully.

In my current unemployed state, I've signed up to volunteer at a feminist women's health center. It's probably going to be mostly administrative, but I don't mind, I'm actually pretty dedicated to the cause. I suspect it might look kinda shitty that I didn't start volunteering until this year though, just in time to apply to med school. My excuse: I've been self-employed (while in school) and paying my husband's way through college, and now grad school.

But then there's that undergrad history holding me back. It seems pretty insurmountable, to be honest. Should I even really try? I've already signed up for the MCAT and started studying. I have a feeling I'll do pretty well -- I took a cold practice, having not done any chem, o-chem, physics or basic biology in ~5 years, and managed a 25. Pretty balanced, too. I've signed up to take the MCAT on May 22nd this year. Currently working my way through Examkrackers, and perversely, finding it kinda fun. (Where was this motivation in undergrad??)

I keep wavering back and forth on whether I should go for it. Part of me says that with my undergrad, there's no way I'd get in, so why am I wasting my time and energy? Another part of me is all Rob Schneider, ""YOUU CAN DO EEET!"" as long as I get my MCAT squared away.

Sorry this is so long. I know low undergrad grades aren't uncommon, but I think the rest of my situation is pretty different, and I need all the advice I can get. All my friends who ended up in med school went the traditional route, so they're not much help."

I'm in a fog right now and I just need to get my thoughts down and some feedback.

I'm 19 years old. I'm the last of 2 boys (So I have a brother who is 23). Growing up, I was a complete mama's boy. I love my mom, my dad equally but my mom is my favorite person in the world. My brother moved out when he was 18. I commute to my University, meaning I still live in the same 10ft x 10ft room I have spent the past 16 years of my life.

All of my friends, with the exception of two of my closet guy friends, have moved out. Living at home has some awesome, awesome perks, but I am slowly suffocating here.

I'll run some examples. I spent a solid 3 or 4 months back in 2013 planning to partake in a Study Abroad opportunity with my University. They were going to send me to Tokyo, all expenses paid, to study at Waseda Univeristy which is a very prominent school in Japan. I sent over 200 e-mails, drove to countless Study Abroad fairs, met with counselor after counselor after counselor, crammed my first three semesters so I would have free time during my 4th semester, all just to hear my parents say ""We don't think you are responsible enough"". 

Classic excuse, and for most kids my age, a viable one; but the thing is I am responsible. I've never become involved in drugs, maintained a 3.4 GPA, I'm part of student government and 4 clubs on campus, never been in a car accident or have been pulled over or have had any troubles with authorities, and at the age of 16 I got an internship in politics which I still hold today. I have only the highest ambitions, but my parents continue to claim that I have no responsibility because I have never lived in a dorm or on my own for any period of my life. As true as this is, I have spent so much of my life alone and to myself. Thinking about it, it's really depressing me. If I was allowed to follow my dreams, I would be in Japan right now, exploring a culture that fascinates me; but rather I am sitting in my box shape room, spending my nights on reddit until 2am, thinking about my life and my future as my youth slowly disappears. I have brought this up to a lot of people. Family, friends, colleagues, advisers. Most people tell me that, yeah, i'm missing some awesome opportunities. My academic advisers have even attempted to persuade me to just pursue Study Abroad without my parents permission.

Anyways, it seems like every day something happens here. We have had a lot of respect issues in the past. Yesterday I ended up walking 3 miles in the midst of a snowstorm to the house of one of the two friends who I still have. I needed to get out of the house after my dad took my keys because I slept till 1:30pm and never woke up to shovel the snow. Tonight, I was planning on going to the gym. They wouldn't let me leave because it was past 10pm and the next town over has a ""Heroin Problem"".

I'm not sure what it is. I think it's just the typical Last-Bird-Leaving-The-Nest situation and mom doesn't want to let go, but I just want to get out there and experience the world while I am still young and not tied down with a family or job. I just feel like they have one arm around me, and the other arm is out swinging at all the dangerous things that can harm me in life. The world is a mean, mean place and the only way I am going to toughen up is if I take a few punches and stick my finger in the fire to realize ""wow, that shit is hot"". I do not want to tip-toe through life just to arrive safely at death.

It will come in time, but... I'm fighting a pretty intense battle by myself right now. I don't feel like anyone is on my side. Every night I think about this, about my independence and individuality, about if I am not following my dreams now, will I ever follow my dreams in the future? Or will I just wash up in the 9 to 5 grind and end up paying off my mortgage for the rest of my life. I'm not sure but thanks for reading.

---   
**tl;dr**: My parents claim I am not responsible. I want to experience independence but I am stuck at home.

Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Fringe

There’s a lot to be said in a really impersonal sense for being an undergrad at an Ivy League School.  The potential for increasing numbers of emerging luminaries in the arts and sciences to come is unlimited, as long as the saturated state of opportunities to meet the desires and aspirations of young minds is preserved at institutions like Brown.  A situation like ours can only be understood as the latest of many renaissances that dot recorded history.  

They tend to mark paradigm shifts in the sciences, semantics, religion and the arts.  

Our generation is waking up to a similar age of regeneration in which the creative power of our minds and our hearts can be amplified exponentially by unprecedented new access to information and communication.  

Much as the progenitors of occultism since the Italian Renaissance resurrected the corpus of paganism, christendom, the classics of philosophy, mathematics, and music, *because they had the tools to do it,* today we stand at the focal point of the fulfillment of one grand cosmic cycle, and the beginning of a newer, longer one.
 
Our hand in shaping the future is doing so at the most crucial of such moments to arise so far in what is widely held credibly to be the history, unprecedented, manifest in the awakening of a sentient planet.  We stand at the turning point.

So what?

Our predecessors discovered how to distinguish between a science of the mind, and one of bodies; with any luck, we will discover how to unify those now disparate pursuits.  Parapsychological research and emergent, previously inarticulable possibilities among quantum phenomena are receiving a coherent voice and silent patronage as they become legitimate fields of inquiry and speculation today.
Science has recognized how to think quantum in a number of ways and expresses it in multiple voices about not what’s out there and in here, or over here and not over there, but something common to both and animating them.  

We see traces of this kaleidoscopic vision from nanophysics to biology, the virtual violability of laws of thermodynamics in dissipative systems, and the recent cross-pollination of information theory and ecology.  None of these resemble Newton (a dedicated bastion of renaissance esotericism in his own time) and no one quite knows how to put it without immediately either accepting an enormous proof to demonstrate a new paradigm immediately, or look very silly.

But in all earnestness, we’re experiencing today more than ever, the proverbial farce to the purported tragedy that the occult, sometimes defined as “rejected knowledge,” has sustained in its history.  Syncretic explanation of the past forms presentist affirmation and autonomous thought in the present expresses and influences the future.  

Copernicus and Giordano Bruno were both minds that could traverse three engagements with time: they could be in time, outside of time, or against time, as it fitted them to articulate a spirit that was alive and being reborn into culture and society around the time of their work.

We’ve long since integrated the Knowledge=Power book report of the sociological humanities and are dimly aware of it; but do we know how the restructuring of these things for social change feels when we purge the same prejudices and illusory sources of separation from ourselves?  We can build memory palaces at the stroke of a key yet we’re bored of “changing the world.”  

We go through the motions and try to get a non-evil internship or publish research that hopefully non-evil people will use to non-objectionable ends, the silent, hidden ideal being one of creating a worldview and a project of inquiry that is impossible to misuse.  A universal measure of ethics, autonomy, action, space and time.  At any one time we may find ourselves trying to stop the world from changing, trying to transcend change, or try to be with change.  We need a centered consciousness conversant with all these forms of becoming.

None of us realizes that one of us will, probably very suddenly, be the victorious typewriter monkey and make the discovery that breaks capitalism, finance, famine, shortage, meaning, apathy, life the universe in everything all wide open orbiting around a coherent point.  No one remembers that that is the constitution of a fully integrated individual, one who can respond to everything.  

Renaissance People are in growing supply, and it’s as if we legitimately fear house arrest or public execution, so much so that we all hesitate to express ourselves creatively, hesitate to approach the unknown every day in our disciplines.  When, in fact  the worst fate possible would be to die regarded as somewhat silly, only become a reservoir of insight, wisdom and instruction for a similar, future soul.

Or we can fear the inquisition; remain complacent and insist that theory best left refined until it magically sprouts legs and takes to the grassroots level of its own accord; ruminate confidently how this whole mind business is inside the skull and it’s only a matter of time before science cracks it wide open; vegetate in the orthodoxy and maybe find peace in old age; and perhaps be of quaint interest to casual genealogists and nostalgic displaced aristocratic family vestiges.  

*But by no means should we realize that the world out there and the world inside us is the same process doing the same thing, and begin to think about it in a way that might just harmonize it and help it express unity.  That’s for the new agers, the totalitarians, the monists and the nihilists, all those people whose worldviews are radically attuned to experience, and their bibliographies a little spotty, not resembling real scholarship.  Because they’re talking systematically at length about telepathy, astrology, UFOs, intelligent design, astral projection or psychokinesis.  They don’t know anything about the wonders of our theory, or else they wouldn’t be wasting their time on what’s actually nonsense.  All that stuff is in your head or on paper, how could it change the world?*  

Only once it passes through the hands of scholars like us and into the mind of future innovators.  Giordano Bruno speculated that ours was not the only world orbiting the only star, anticipating the full consequences of Copernicus and Galileo’s formulations by whole centuries.  

If we all take the same potshots and be radically close with the changing world while we have both the chance and the will, we can actually take part in the healing of the world and do our part ushering in the beginning of a new age.  

See the change you want to be in the world and manifest your contribution accordingly.  

Express interest in the occult, ask questions about hidden things, embody love for the unknown and the mysterious.  Read and write, think, live and act the analogical, the irrational, the mythical, the enlightened.  

If you can donate to a university whose merits, future, and purpose are all uncertain from a cosmic perspective, you can afford by chance to take part in the speculation and action that will set examples for those yet to come, who might foster a new world, stoked by the faith we had in them, as our forebears had in us.

Raid Report: Failure

Emboldened by my previous raiding victory, I decided to raid sector 14 again. I figured that if we beat them once we could totally do it again. I was hoping to gather building supplies so I could start to build a town for my citizen slaves to live in. Living in tents kinda sucks... Turns out I was wrong...

My army is completely awful at being an army. I suffered major losses to the party I sent out. Turns out that my Interns do not know how to fight like at all... The only reason why we won the first raid was because we had the element of surprise. Today sector 14 was ready to fight back... The Tigers are still fierce warriors so today wasn't a complete loss and I managed to loot some building supplies but the death toll was far to high for my liking...

In other news, a weird disease is spreading throughout my camp. It's probably from the radiation but I have no idea... If there are any doctors out their who would like to join my forces, you will be promoted to a position of power. Since my society is based on slaves you will have slaves waiting on you hand and foot... It'll be pretty cool...

This has only resulted to 3 job interviews and 0 offers.

I've had 2 internships in my field programming. I have had a programming job contracting for an engineering company for over a year.

I was also a terrible student that graduated with a 2.97 gpa at a somewhat unknown university (ECSU). But shouldn't my experience trump that?

I'm frustrated because I hear of all these great opportunities for CS majors and see none. Is it because I had a low gpa? Is it because of my university degree?

I've also applied to many grad schools that have rejected me.

My company has a take it or leave it policy when it comes to raise negotiations, salary, and promotion. There is absolutely no growth in my company. A co-worker that has had 2 promotions and 7 years of experience only makes 60k.

Maybe I should just be grateful and continue. But with my peers surpassing me in every way, I can't help but feel frustrated.

I hope this, my first substantial post, proves worthwhile. Here's what you need to know.

- I am a graduate student training to be a counselor. I have been doing an internship at the counseling center at our university's campus since early January. I see about 10 ""real"" clients a week, all university students. Early returns are that I'm very good at what I do.

- I have been dating a lovely woman for a couple of months. She is also training to be a counselor.

Here's the fun part.

My 30th birthday is in 10 days. As a gift to me, my GF wants to act out some of my sexual fantasies with me. Teacher-student has always been kind of a big one for me, with me being the teacher. Something very hot about that power differential, and my GF loves to be dominated. However, a couple of days ago, she made a counter-offer: Counselor-client. The scenario she laid out for me is this:
 

*She is a senior in high school (she'll be wearing a schoolgirl outfit), and she comes to see me for counseling around a teacher whom she tried to seduce. Something went wrong, but that's for me to find out about in our ""session."" I would be a particularly unethical counselor, getting her to admit she has a insatiable need to be fucked by a powerful man, making her describe everything, etc., clearly getting off on it myself while appearing to be helpful. Eventually, I would indicate that she needs a different kind of treatment which will require meeting in a hotel, and we would schedule a time to meet in the hotel a few days later.*

*In the hotel (and again she'll be a schoolgirl), I would dominate her progressively. My special brand of therapy. I haven't figured out the details, but eventually the black leather will come out, and she will be bound and fucked as part of her treatment (my GF is very much into that, it's definitely growing on me).*

 
So, that's what my GF has proposed. She is awaiting the green light from me. I'm very intrigued and turned on by the idea, but I have some hesitation as well. I am a newly-practicing counselor, and I am working hard to establish an ethical practice. I need to be able to separate this sexual fantasy completely from my real life as a counselor, and I would love some advice from you guys about that. Are these waters a little too murky to enter? Have any of you successfully compartmentalized a fantasy wherein you inhabit a role that you normally play in life (maybe your job?), but in the fantasy you do things in that same role you would never ever do in real life?

Also, let's say I go forward with this fantasy, which is how I'm leaning now. I would love some more ideas about how to play it out. Anybody have a fantasy of being taken advantage of by a psychologist or counselor?

**tl;dr:** I'm a counselor in real life. My gf wants to play out a fantasy with me where she's a student and I am her counselor and I take advantage of her sexually. I'm very intrigued by the idea, but concerned that it will mess with my mind and possibly affect my real practice. Want feedback. Also, I want advice and suggestions on spicing up the fantasy further assuming I go forward with it."
1xa9w3,9,2014-02-07,"Service Industry Blues, or another rant about my quick descent to despair and worthlessness",minwagethekiller,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1xa9w3/service_industry_blues_or_another_rant_about_my/,"So I graduated from a good east coast public university a touch over three years ago, saddled with more debt than I can afford, a bleak economy, but hopeful. I graduated with a political science degree, not because I'm a lazy liberal arts person, but because I am exceptionally passionate about it. I also had experience working at the school radio station for a few years, in addition to being a writer for the school newspaper on the editorial board for an equivalent amount of time, including winning a best column award. 

Additionally, I had a paid internship in Virginia at the State House for a State Rep, and I have worked for a national election campaign.

However, now for the last two and a half years, I have done nothing but work as a server at a ""fine dining"" restaurant chain here in a moderate sized east coast city. As in, it's not Steak and Shake, but it's still the same world. My job, despite being only a night shift/second shift dinner job, puts my stress level at 150 percent on a daily basis. My coworkers are all out to prove they're smarter than everyone else, petty politics, interpersonal squabbles, et al. 

I'm not sure how much longer I can take it. I work every shift I can get, but make no money. I have applied for jobs across the country, but never hear anything back. I've tried for local jobs in my fields I have experience in, and heard nothing.

I've never had an issue at my job, but every shift I go in, I assume I'm one flubup away from being fired. I have no interest in this job anymore, my stress level about jobs, bills, etc is at 150 percent from the moment I wake up, and I can barely keep the lights on, while the owners talk about vacations and their mercedez benz. 

I don't want a hand out, or think I'm entitled. It just gets hard to be a nearly 30 year old female, and not be able to pay my bills even with a full time job. I've tried networking through friends, and had interviews, yet nothing comes of it.

I see people post on here about having been unemployed for six months, two years, and it just baffles my mind. I work five to seven days a week, depending on the week, and I still can't keep up with my bills. I try to live as frugally as possible, I don't have a car payment, I don't have a lot of the things other people take for granted, but after nearly 36 months with one employer and no purchases over 100 dollars (computers, Ipads, new phone, etc) I still if I were to get fired tomorrow would have zero savings, no safety net, no way to protect myself financially.

And it only makes me angrier when I feel like I'm supposed to be grateful for my employer for even giving me a job. I can't pay the bills, or keep up with them, or get ahead in any way shape or form. I haven't had a ""vacation"" in as long as I can remember. And I mean where I had even 48 hours, where I didn't need to be working, or feel guilty that I wasn't, and didn't have bills to worry about. 

I grew up in Northern New York, so I'm used to the cold, and my family worked hard, but it at least seemed like they were able to get ahead eventually. Now I'm frozen to the bone, destitute and just about out of ideas. I just watched the opening episode of season five of Community, and Jeff Winger's comment seemed perfect for my life - ""Look, I might be broke, desperate, and nearly homeless, but I still got one thing deep down inside that gives me power — *repo man takes his whiskey away* — yep, that was it. That was all I had."" 

It seems the time I spent in college should have instead have been spent trying to build a restaurant chain in the U.S. Don't have to pay your employees shit, no health care, no concerns, just pocket the money and laugh all the way to the bank.

**TL;DR** I am tired of working full time for poverty wages, never being able to get ahead, and being told day in and day out to be ""thankful"" for the opportunity.I want to make the world a better place, do something that requires independent thought. *Oh, and do this while being able to keep the lights on without having to have three jobs.

I am 36 and the father of three children all under 10 and I live in central Wisconsin. I spent almost a decade between selling cars and insurance before realizing that the economy would not support my future. This led me to pursue my Bachelors in Accounting. As of now I have less than 3 semesters until I graduate and my current GPA is hovering around 3.6. At my school the Bachelor program is 120 credits.

Here is my dilema; I would like to enter public accounting but as I do more research I am scared that I will not be able to work the long hours that seem to be required. If I instead go the private route, I do not have any job experience that would most likely be required for hiring consideration. At this point I am pursuing internships for the upcoming summer but have not had any concrete leads. 

My question is, being that I am late to the game, what can I do to put myself in the best position for success in the Accounting field? Should I consider going on for a Masters or CPA before re-entering the workforce? Would a CMA give me an advantage in landing a private position right out of school?

1xan2d,3,2014-02-07,Is it possible to actually improve?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1xan2d/is_it_possible_to_actually_improve/,"I managed to get myself stuck in a ""Competitive Programming"" class this semester and so far it's been total hell. I can never solve any of the problems and it's really shown me how horrible of a programmer I am. 

I'm starting to (again) reconsider finishing my degree and my personal worth. From what I've been told, you're either good at this or you're not and that if someone is as bad as I am it's better to just cut your losses and change careers. Well I've already lost a lot and am in debt, so I don't know what to do at this point.  

According to other people in this class (who are doing fine) this type of programming is how you actually get a job, and considering that they all have jobs at Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc I'm assuming that they're right. I've never gotten any internships opportunities and it sounds like it's because I'm so useless as a programmer. 

How do you actually improve? Solving problems doesn't seem to do, working on projects doesn't seem to do it, reading books also does nothing. Is it actually impossible to get better at programming once you're learned the basics?"
1xap6k,6,2014-02-07,"...contract cancelled, now what?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1xap6k/contract_cancelled_now_what/,"I've been an au pair for the past 6 months in Vienna, Austria and also working as a personal assistant for the magistrate of a finance consulting company and english tutor on the side.  However, without going into so many details, a lot of drama is going down in my host family for my au pair job, the kids are moving in with their grandparents, and now, I am obviously no longer needed.  I have two weeks or so left to live here.  
  
This au pair placement was supposed to be my filler/gap year before I head to graduate school in the fall.  So I was planning on just staying in the EU and doing a bit of traveling and work until then. However, now that my au pair contract is cancelled, my visa is essentially void, but only if it is reported that I am no longer employed (which they said they won't do).  So, until August, I (kind of) have residency here.  
  
I've been looking at internship placements and temp positions to fill in the time, since I would plan on leaving in the fall.  I'm not sure where to start.  I have a degree in history, am planning on studying research and policy management for cultural heritage.  I've also been looking at editing and publishing internships, since my humanities background is essentially academic writing, editing, and research based.  I also have work experience in radio and web content management.  
  
I know that BUNAC has an intern in the UK that I am eligible for and can apply for it from Austria, but other than that, I don't know of anything else.  
  
I guess the main thing I am worried about is the urgency in finding something and visa issues.  Everything is up in the air.  I could go home, but that is my last resort.  What can I do?"
1xaqf3,1,2014-02-07,Crossroads in Life: Feedback Request,Waywarrd-Son,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1xaqf3/crossroads_in_life_feedback_request/,"Hello. I'm an international college senior studying Computer Information Systems from a Business school. I'm from the middle east, from a still developing oil-producing country. 

In the past few years, I've been cruising through college while everyone around me was losing their minds about getting a job and being employed. That idea never sat well with me. I didn't see the benefit of fulfilling someone else's dreams and goals. I saw myself as being responsible for planning out my life and do the things I want to do. 

While kids were chasing down internships, I was volunteering my time with developing one or two information systems around campus. I'm not a particularly gifted programmer, nor am I business savant. I'm a mix of both, and as a result, I can envision many projects from start to finish and am resourceful in getting them done. 

In the past year, I've changed my whole outlook on life. I was at one point clinging to the idea of being employed and 'successful' in the traditional way. I was either going to be a professor or some sort of developer. This made me unhappy, and I focused on reworking my priorities in life.

Without boring you with the details (if I haven't already). I want my life to add value to the general human condition. If I can through my own efforts raise enough money for, lets say helping rehabilitate education in my home country, then that's a life well-earned for me. Besides being able to take care of myself and my loved ones, all my ambitions for success in the traditional sense (buckets of cash) will go towards these efforts. When I die, I want to leave behind a legacy with the same sentiment, and I want it to continue to improve the human condition. I know this sounds kind of like I'm this crazy hippie, but it's pretty far from it.

For starters, I fucking hate hippies. Just kidding. Seriously though, I want to have money, and I want to have a lot of it. But I want to use it in a way other than buying material goods. I want to have life experiences and create memories all around the world, and I want to value on a global scale.

That's all well and good, but I'm trying to figure out the game plan in the short run. 

Right now, I'm on the verge of graduating and my visa is about to time out. I've been working on a promising civic collaboration platform with three other friends and it has been pretty promising so far. We think we can pitch to different college campuses and we think that there's a good chance of it catching on. Having said that, two of the three have already locked into jobs. This means that the pattern of working on this tool as a secondary objective will continue well into their careers.

I can go into graduate school and elongate my stay that way. Eventually, however, I will have to get employed to afford living in the States on my own. Even with that, however, I cant match the support system they have in place. I feel that they're playing it safe while I'm risking most of what I have on this. I think that this is relatively unfair, because they can just continue working their day job and be perfectly content with this project taking a secondary role in their life while I cannot. I don't have a support system to go home to (in the middle east), nor do I have security in the United States. 

On the other hand, a new opportunity has revealed itself back home. In one of the universities, an opportunity to implement an information system could potentially save hundreds of thousands of hours.For this opportunity, my brother would be a partner(marketing) and we would have to bring on another partner to help with operations. If we succeed, I would not have to worry about money again, and I can start building my legacy. If I fail, however, I would be set back to a significant degree. My scholarship would run out, meaning that I cannot continue towards graduate school. This would translate into the united states being inaccessible for a while until I can reapply to school or get hired as foreign talent (unlikely).

On a personal level, I don't see myself as being able to start a family with someone from my region because our ideas and philosophies just don't usually align. I've made great friendships in the united states and I've met someone as well. To help make this decision, I've broken up with my girlfriend (I don't want a new relationship to compromise my judgement) and have been studying both my brother and my three partners in the united states.

I feel that the project in the united states risks failure because all the other partners are not as committed to this idea, despite the potential. With the second project, the chance of success is definitely there, but the risks are high. It looks like I'm playing it too safe with one project, and I'm being too risky with the other.

What do you guys think?

If you have read this far, I love you.

[1\) A typical day at work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k6mx?context=5)|A typical day at work is atypical. I have schedules, meetings, and projects I work on. 80 percent of the time, it gets disrupted by a project in the field that needs attention. So if you have ADD, my job is a great place to be.
[2\) A really awesome day at work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k6mx?context=5)|A really awesome day at work is when a customer calls us up with a question that has really stumped them and we reach back into our company, pull all of our resources together and come up with a solution to help them.

[ last, you looking for Mechanical Engineers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k6mx?context=5)|On the pit crew, we're a volunteer team and always looking for talent. From a company perspective, Boeing is always hiring, and there are always different jobs posted on their career page.
[The man said *Mad Max*!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lf9d?context=5)|That is correct Mad Max!
[What was your first car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9kl1k?context=5)|1969 MGB convertible. I was 14. I brought it home, and my parents freaked out. It was a wreck, and they didn't think I'd be able to rebuild it, but I did, and then I was a 15-year-old with a car and no licence. 
[When we 88 mph are we gonna see some serious shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k8e6?context=5)|My flux capacitor is operationally unavailable.
[Can we go faster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k3he?context=5)|It's only illegal until you get caught. In today's society, it's all about fuel economy. In Europe there are cars that get 70 miles to the gallon, and they allow them to travel a lot faster than here. If our infrastructure supported it and the technology was allowed to be, it's quite possible. 
[As petroleum is a finite resource, do you see any of the renewable resources for vehicles catching on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k9hu?context=5)|There are over 1000 records that can be achieved for 4 wheel vehicles. One variable is engine type. Another is fuel type. We have seen vehicles with biofuel, hydrogen fuel cell, and electric battery power specific classes. A lot of racing technology is being brought to Bonneville through education, namely higher learning institutions. So a lot  of the cars that are out there are being brought by universities.
 |Technology such as biofuel are one of the areas that Boeing in involved in as an alternative fuel source. We have demonstrated its viability on both commercial and military platforms.  
[What is the best joke at your workplace?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lpe5?context=5)|What's the definition of an introverted engineer? … Stares at his own feet. What's the definition of an extroverted engineer? … Stares at other people's feet.  Had to play it safe.
 |There was one good laugh while working on the space station, specifically the commode.   Think about it...visualize,  defecating in zero gravity. Yes the basic laws of physics state for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction.  First order of  business is restraining the astronaut on the seat so they don't fly off while off gassing.  Second order is make sure there is a suction device to keep the floating particles away from the body, and the case of space station a fan, but not just any fan, a fecal fan. Depending when the fan comes on and off The percent utilization is called a duty cycle and if there is a failure the Shit can actually hit the fan.  Try writing the technical manual for that failure mode and fault isolation procedure.  
[Do you strictly just build these cars, or do you actually get the opportunity to drive them as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9kwgp?context=5)|I do drive the car, and in fact as I was building it, it is designed specifically for my dimensions and body... helps me maintain my weight.
[Awesome! So were you driving when you reached the 207 mark?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lkea?context=5)|Yes, I was.
[How easy was it to transition from space craft to rocket cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k3lq?context=5)|We don't work on rocket cars. The transition from a space environment to a land speed racing environment involves a lot of similarities but a lot of differences. In space you have a harsh environment, predominantly because it's a vacuum and you have extreme temperature swings. In land speed racing, it's corrosive, and you have a lot of heat. In both, your assembling a system for a basic purpose, but each one is designed using the same principles and practices of engineering. 
[1\) At what speed do aerodynamics start to play an important role in the vehicle construction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lb3e?context=5)|1) There's the speed region before the speed of sound, and the speed region after the speed of sound. Depending upon the type of vehicle, each region must be accounted for independently. For my vehicle, I hope I never achieve the speed of sound, because it probably won't stay together. And therefore, we're dealing in the incompressible fluid flow. For my specific vehicle, aerodynamics plays an important role throughout the speed region. However, it's most important around 200 MPH, where the coefficient of drag or frontal area of the car is impacted by the drag force of the air acting on it.
[2\) what would happen to your cars if they had aerodynamics such as the ones in the so called ""beige cars""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lb3e?context=5)|2) If I had aerodynamics, the speed of my car would be greatly improved. However, the rules of my racing class preclude many of the features that would be found in a ""beige car design.""
[Is the movie Worlds Fastest Indian in your top 10?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9l4r5?context=5)|Yes it is!
 |It was a must see, recommended by friends, prior to my first experience. A lot of truth in that movie.
[I understand that the lack of friction between the tires on your vehicle and the surface of the Salt Flats makes it hard to get traction, for instance off the starting line.   Is there a point at which this lack of traction benefits you in going for higher speeds or is the difference in friction between asphalt and the salt surface negligible?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lfuw?context=5)|My first year we calculated how much the car needed to weigh to overcome drag forces with the horsepower that the engine produced. We were unable, due to schedule, to actually balance the car correctly and decided to go to Bonneville anyway. We started off fine until the car reached 172 MPH at which point the drag forces acting on the car became equal to the traction forces of the tires and the more gas we gave, the more the tires would spin. When we came back and analysed the data our mathematical model said that we should have spun our tires based on the actual weight of the car at 174 MPH. We subsequently added 600 lbs of lead to the car and were able to go 200 MPH the following year.
[If so, where is that point/speed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lfuw?context=5)|The coefficient of friction really doesn’t enhance the effects of speed; it hurts it. So the slower you go the less of an impact, the faster you go the more of an impact. Unless you are trying to set a speed record using a sled where there are no rotating wheels only propulsion and runners.
[Hey nice meeting you. Two questions   Did your parents believe you would grow up to be something different?  What did you want to be when you were a kid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9l97t?context=5)|I was the ADD, hyperactive, Ritalin poster child and wanted to get into everything. My mom would often come downstairs to find her blender in pieces because I wanted to know how it worked. My dad was also a professional engineer and he was able to channel much of my energy to helping repair cars, build electronic kits and help build a family lake house in New Hampshire that included electrical wiring, copper plumbing and finished carpentry work - all while I was a teenager. I, on the other hand, wanted to make jewellery but my parents knew better and channeled me back to engineering. 
[Do you still make jewelry as a hobby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9srmb?context=5)|Last piece I designed was the ring on my wife's hand, but I had a professional jeweler make it.
[Awesome! What's it like in zero gravity? I've always wanted to experience it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9ktlt?context=5)|No experience there, but when you're designing long-term manned spaceflight environments, all of the muscle memory activities we tend to do on Earth have no benefit, and the body starts to atrophy. So exercise using resistance-type devices--bands and springs--is crucial to maintaining health for when you come back.
[What's the benefit of building these cars that can go over 200 mph to society?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9km8p?context=5)|As an engineer, I am a lifelong learner. When I decided to go back to school and get my graduate degree, there was a 20 year stand between my undergraduate and graduate. The reason I chose to get a degree was to stay competitive in the workplace. Experience only takes you so far.
 |What's the benefit of building these cars that can go over 200 mph to society? By being able to apply the principles and theories learned in the classroom to an actual application, I benefit, my company benefits, and my customers benefit - because I'm a better engineer.
 |And I have a really cool car after all is said and done.
[I'm an aerospace engineering student, and I've been fortunate enough to have a friend use the phrase ""come on, it's not rocket science"" with me, to which I replied ""obviously, if it was I wouldn't have any trouble understanding it""  Also, do you have any advice for someone looking to get into the space industry? I had a point where my grades were kinda bad. I have a handle on it now, but my GPA won't recover by the time I graduate. Is it still possible for me to get a job in the space industry right out of school? Is it better to just take what I can get out of college and move into the space industry when I get a chance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lh6v?context=5)|Everybody has a bad day, me included. I relate to your one-bad-semester scenario, and had a few in my undergrad as well. Yes, you can recover, and it may require finding the right fit.
[How are you a rocket scientist if you're building cars? Something seems fishy here! Joking aside this is really awesome! What's the hardest part about what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lipt?context=5)|The hardest part of my job is when a political answer trumps the technical answer. It leaves you scratching your head and asking, Why? And the hardest part of the racing experience is keeping my geographically disparate team engaged so that we can be prepared for the following racing season.
[Favorite race car driver and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9kq6q?context=5)|I think one of my faves is John Force (NHRA top-fuel drag racer) and the reason is he has staying power. He spans many decades and generations and even at the age he is today, he is still a force to be reckoned with.
[Can I come help? I'm pretty handy, and I make a fucking delicious cup of coffee to keep you on your A-game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lq87?context=5)|Hey, if you can make coffee, you're in!

[How can you go trough the alienating task of school? just siting listening a dump telling you trivial things and giving you meaningless homework? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9kwjg?context=5)|Aeropace is a global industry and can take you in many directions. Communications, defense, commerical aviation or others. There are numerous opportunities for internships, however, many of them are highly competitive. My advice is to not only be very good at your schoolwork but to also round out your interests with extra-curricular activities that augment your learning.
 |Make it fun, don't have a box from which you have to think out of, and do something novel like...actually designing building and testing a car that provided over 30 credits of research papers and entertainment.
[What are the cars you build mostly made of? Is there any fear that they will break apart at such high speeds? Thank you for doing this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9stnu?context=5)|Frame construction is mandrel bent 2x4x0.125 wall steel tubing.  The floor is 0.25 inch thick plate steel.  The roll cage is 1.75 inch DOM steel tubing custom bent and triangulated for all load conditions with 0.125 plate steel gussets at all intersecting load paths.  Some very good welds to hold it all together; along with a huge investment in high grade bolts, holds the rest where it needs to be.  The one thing about land speed cars is weight is good to a certain point for the required traction.  Building the structure to have good bones makes it safe.  There is always a risk of failure; however, aerospace training helps identify single fault tolerant solutions to design problems.  It is all about safety.
[Mr Scientist, how do you think modern human kind will live wtihout the long distance communication devices like handphone, internet, etc??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9k7lv?context=5)|Ask Kevin Coster and his horse. In today's society, information is what will win or lose the battle. And at some point, if the information system goes down, it may greatly impede our society as a whole. I was fortunate growing up in the transition from analog phone systems to the digital world. I know how to use slide rule.
 |Follow up answer:  Today society is so plugged in with texting, chat and e-mail, the art of conversation is a lost art.   If it all goes away tomorrow, it will be a quiet place for a while...that is until people learn to get out of the house, up from their desks and interact one on one.
[This might get buried (hopefully not\) but is it safe to assume your a gear head? Also what's your favorite car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9ueau?context=5)|Gear head is appropriate.  I have many favorite cars. The 1962 chevy II is a classic style.  The early 6/67 GTO is cool.  I like the pre-1973 corvette.  I am also fond of older British metal Sunbeam Tiger (Get smart), and the 60's vintage Jag XKE.  If I were to pick a favorite today it is my 1962 Chevy 11 model 100 2 door with a big honking V8 and four speed.

[What are the flats like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9ldzv?context=5)|So you make the trip from Washington State to Utah in a truck hauling a trailer, and you see the town of Wendover, Nevada. In the background, you see a bunch of flat, white landscape. As you make your way to the salt flats and drive ""the end of the road,"" you enter a white, dry salt lakebed with a speck two miles out in front of you in the middle. As you continue to drive, the speck become larger and larger until you finally realize you're in the middle of a very unique city that's reminiscent of the oasis found by Mel Gibson in the movie Mad Max: the Road Warrior.

What's the realistic expectation of a random guy tinkering in his basement actually breaking a small displacement record like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9y275?context=5)|There are many 125 cc records to be had ranging from Mild 31 mph (production - production vintage engine P-PV) to Wild over 150 mph (streamliner modified engine fuel S-F).  Chances are pretty good.  MY neighbor took a 50cc moped to Bonneville and hot lapped for a week.  No record, but a ton of fun. 
[As an engineering student, how do I get involved in the aerospace industry? What positions or companies should I work for in order to gain technical experience in this field instead of getting lost in paperwork positions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lwh2?context=5)|I prefer the larger companies because of the diversification of assignments, and the bigger the company the bigger challenges they tend to sign up for.  Almost all companies have an employment webpage and many offer college internships, he company I work for included.  Recently we did a trial high school internship as a method of shaping the future of aerospace, and honestly, some of the talent and quality of youth is humbling.
[Had you always wanted to do this? Or better worded, when was the first time you sat down and thought... ""Hmm, this is what I want to do""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cfaxomz?context=5)|I always had an interest in cars a byproduct of helping my dad work on the family cars at a young age.  One of my first art projects in 3rd grade was to cut a picture out of a magazine and varnish it to a sanded piece of wood, I chose a funny car from one of the car magazines.  I fell into Bonneville by happenstance during my graduate degree in engineering and was invited to participate on a pit crew after writing a detailed research paper of life cycle costs of a racing engine, that was predicated on reliability, horsepower, and  material selection.  The paper received a favorable grade and I was on the pit crew of a 30mph Lakester.

It is a good way to step back form the problem and reassess.  To solve a problem you must fixate on the problem, but also ensure you are receptive to open ideas.  Example;  We were doing smoke test on an airplane and when we dove form 40K to 25K feet in the ""firefighting""mode smoke would migrate forward into the flight deck, not good.  I came up with the bright idea to open the Lavatory doors and flush the Vacuum toilets during the test and what do you know it sucked all the smoke down the flusher.  We subsequently installed a valve in the vacuum line and the problem was fixed.  The idea came from my work on space station and working with commodes.
[Hi there! Thanks for the AMA!!  One question. What would you have to say to those thinking of becoming a rocket scientist but are needing some *propulsion* in the right direction, right out of high school? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9ld2k?context=5)|There is a lot of opportunity youth today in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). People like myself often mentor middle and high school students on what it means to be an engineer. There are activities like first robotics that help people engage in the team sport of building a robot to meet a specific objective. Or there is always trying to find someone who will be your mentor. Seek out an individual that you want to be like and ask them to help you.
[I build amateur rockets for fun and studied physics in high school / college. I designed an experimental system that I'd like to build. In short, it would use helium weather balloons to take a gyroscopically stabilized platform up as far as possible. Sensors would wait for a zero point in acceleration (i.e. - when the balloons pop, but before the system begins to fall\), and begin the ignition sequence. The gyroscopes keep the platform steady from alterations in angle of launch due to wind or other factors. The rocket would be a two or three stage designed to achieve a sub orbit or orbit and would be tracked via a cell phone. Ultimate goal for this system is to discover applications of civilian rocketry.  Is this feasible? If so, any tips for us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9ysz8?context=5)|I am good up tot he point of ""tracking with Cell Phone"".  The major consideration for tracking is signal strength and frequency band.  Cell phone might not cut it, unless you could use the cell phone as the front end to something with less hysteresis.  There are already high altitude balloon experiments being conducted; however, I am not aware of any that launch a rocket, mostly sensor platforms.  The other consideration is the variability in ""Balloon Pops"" is a very hard transition from a timing perspective to Launch.  And the launch sequence will require precision timing to coincide with the rocket which must have its own stabilization controls to ensure it launches in the proper trajectory.  Work the problem backwards and you will see it differently.
[I am an architect student studying the flats. Does the salt corrode the metal? How has the recent flooding been affecting the racing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cfa3yql?context=5)|Look back to chemistry and the periodic table.  Steel frames, Aluminum heads on engine, cast iron blocks, Stainless steel fittings and bolts, Lead ballast, and a sprinkling of other alloys; mixed with Salt (Potassium Chloride, yes Potassium not Sodium) and a very high humidity (moisture) and you got yourself one giant electrolysis process going on.  The first year we brought the car to Bonneville in 2010 we did not have time to paint the newly constructed frame and roll cage.  The second we rolled the car off the trailer it started to acquire surface rust.
 |The flooding has put a stop to the racing and it impacted the 2013 season post Speedweek 2013 in its entirety.  All subsequent events were cancelled.
[How do you feel about the fact that one can achieve those speeds with a motorcycle and a little bit of money?

Rotary engines have far less moving parts and are therefore much simpler.  that is good from a reliability and supportability perspective.  The rotary engine can also withstand much higher Revolutions per minute (RPM); which is going to be required because one of he downfalls of a rotary engine is lack of torque, and torque is a function of Horsepower (HP).  Rotary engines also consume more oil because of the way they are designed, and if I remember correctly have seal issues.
 |Piton engines tend to get better gas mileage, can develop huge amounts of torque (function of Cylinder bore and Crankshaft Stroke) that will produce Horsepower.

His recommendation to find the missing pieces was X-ray, while mine was Ultrasound using a megahertz probe.  Apparently there are benefits to working in aerospace and understanding non-destructive test on non-ferrous materials.  He over ruled and took the X-rays, found nothing and then we pulled an ultrasound form the maternity ward and successfully found the wood pieces.  He did say towards the end of my stay...""I learned something today"".
[How much does the surface you are driving on matter for speed, and what's the best surface to drive fast on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9lqxt?context=5)|The traction force between a tire and the road has a specific coefficient of friction. That is what keeps you from spinning your wheels or sliding off the road on a turn. That value is about 0.75, for whoever cares. Driving on the salt flats has a coefficient of friction of nearly half that. So it varies depending on the environment. The salt may look flat and hard, however salt absorbes water and there's a reason they call it a dry lake bed. So think about if you were driving on a wet slushy road, with your foot to the floor, going 200 mph. The best surface is hard, flat, and probably a runway or concrete.
[I once went slightly under 190mph in a 1994 Toyota Supra.^*  Can you tell me all the ways that was stupid?  ^* On a *closed course*.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xaheg/i_am_a_rocket_scientist_who_builds_cars_that_race/cf9zs7t?context=5)|Depends.  Where did you do it and what was the risk to others.  I have done some less than safe speed attempts in my youth, some safe and some just plain insane.  Today I look through a different lens, an outward lens answering this simple question, relating to basic physics for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction (good movie butterfly effect):  If my plan goes south, what is the worst thing that could happen and who would it impact.  Racing down a highway with other people not only places you at risk, but everyone else, almost all of whom did not sign up for additional risk. 
[I've seen video of cars with regular bodies running at Bonneville.

To answer your question the small little coups like Honda and mustangs go really fast; however, also tend to catch air and flip.  There is a youTube from El mirage dry lake bed showing a car flipping many times at 240 mph.  Everyone OK, not the car.

If I could predict that I would be a rich man. It comes down to technology and where the research and development money is spent and today the technology of the internal combustion engine is fairly old, however, there are things that they can use to improve it.

Have a few questions.,Ch4inz0r,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1xba1m/internship_offer_at_a_bank_have_a_few_questions/,"To preface this, I will say that my ""ultimate"" career goal would be to work at one (or more) big tech companies. Google, MS, Facebook, etc.

So I have received an offer for a summer internship at one of the [big four banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_\(banking\)#USA). It is dealing with the technology that make securities, equity trading, capital markets and all that stuff possible. I have very little idea what these even are. I'm a quick learner and the pay is decent for my area, so I can put up with the steep learning curve.

1. What are some of the technologies used in this line of work? I'd like to get a head start before the summer and look at some of them. When I asked the interviewer about this he said ""We have everything available to you and all is bleeding edge."" He was not willing to mention anything specific other than Java, C++, and Python at that time.
2. **How will taking this internship and listing it on my resume affect my future employability at the tech companies I mentioned?**
3.  More specifically, will I get stuck in banking and finance? It does seem interesting dealing with trading and risk management and should provide some problem solving opportunities. However, like I said, I don't know much about it and I don't foresee being crazy about it. 
4. I have an interview coming up with the same company, but this position would deal with Retirement Technologies (401k and other stuff like that). I feel like that would be more boring, but I'm only going by the name of the position. Would this be better for me to achieve my ""ultimate"" goal?

If it helps, I'm a junior in college living in one of the main banking hubs in the country. Seriously, it seems like over 75% of all the available positions are banking related. I am totally willing and wanting to move in one of the tech hubs.

The bolded question is my main concern, but would appreciate to get answers to the others as well.

If you stuck around and read all that, you are super awesome and I thank you in advance."

So I used to post on here sometimes, and now days I usually just lurk..

My backstory:
 I started losing weight at the end of my sophomore year of college. By October of my junior year, I had went from 265lbs all the way down to 165lbs.... Basically 100lbs in less than  year. I did through vigorously counting calories and picked up running...

I had to learn how to ""maintain"" quick, and damn was it hard. I kept putting myself down time after time for eating anything remotely bad.. I was pretty good about it though... I kept around 160-165 for a good solid year, throughout my junior year of college. 

Through out this whole process I picked up a love for running, and it has taken off. Now I run usually 5 days a week averaging about 20-25 miles a week. I used to run 7 days a week, but quickly found out that while I wasn't seeing issues with my body, it still wasn't good to be running 7 days a week..

Flash forward to today.. I'm in the middle of senior year of college. This semester, I have an internship, school, girlfriend, and being an RA on campus to juggle on my plate. I have noticed I stress eat sometimes now, and that while at work even at times when I pack my own lunch, my coworkers will say that they are bringing lunch back and I'll feel forced to eat that. Also we have special meetings or events where stuff will be catered and all that jazz. I hadn't weighed myself since August, and I weighed in last week at 170lbs.. While not bad, I just feel nasty.

I feel like I can do better, and I should do better. I still usually fit in my 20-25 miles a week, and I still log my calories.. However, I notice A LOT more days of where I go way over my calorie limit, and just over eat.

I'm so afraid of going back to the old me, the fat me, the unhappy me. I don't want it, but at times it feels like I'm on a burning plane, and there's nothing I can do."
1xbxyz,3,2014-02-07,Lonely man in a new city (MF),Bibbleisthetits,Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/1xbxyz/lonely_man_in_a_new_city_mf/,"Lexington, or Lex,  didn’t know where his life was going, all he knew was he needed to get back to California one day. Life hasn’t been easy for him this past year with his fiancé of 8 years leaving him for one of his interns, his dad dying from a stroke at such a young age and moving away from his family to follow his dream job. But even the job wasn’t panning out the way he had hoped. From day one it was obvious that his boss had it out for him so to make a friend in the office was a huge help to take away from the stress of having his every move picked apart and analyzed. Hannah was a bright young face, always able to see the humor in every situation and it didn’t hurt when she joked about his sexual prowess and gave him that look that would even make a baker lose his cream filling. So, being miles from home and having only one real friend, it was obvious why he started to develop feelings for her. 

	One night after work he decided to bridge the gap and ask her out for drinks, she didn’t seem too anxious but it was plain to see on her face that she had been waiting for his invitation for quite some time. It was a casual date, joking about work and their childhood, parents and siblings, it was almost too good to be true for Lex. He had noticed her from the first day he stepped into the new job when she dropped some paperwork next to the copier. When she bent down to collect the papers, her blouse opened up just slightly to reveal a hint of her beautiful breasts but the moment was over as fast as it began. She looked up, smiled at him and walked away. So Lex did his best to be subtle but to “accidentally” run into her around the office. Now as the night progressed they lightly teased each other with slaps on the arm and winks from behind their drinks. But now it was getting late and last call was just behind them. To Lex’s surprise Hannah actually suggested they go back to her place, she had an apartment with a nice view and a new bottle of wine that she hadn’t opened yet.  The sexual tension between them was palatable as they made their way across the crowded city and up to her 60th floor apartment.  As the elevator rose to her floor he decided to go for it and try to kiss her but timing was never Lex’s strong suit and as he leaned in, the elevator doors opened and she walked out leaving him puckered up to thin air. But she looked back and with that same sly grin that she gave him on his first day at work, nudged her head towards her place. She playfully ran off towards the door as he gave chase and as they got there he reached her and wrapped his arms around her and held her close. She felt like a summers day, like when you’re laying on the beach with no cares in the world. He spun her around and gently pushed her against her door, he wasn’t going to miss this time. She looked up into his kiss and gave back the same emotion that he had for her. They stood there holding each other and seeing nothing but the other ones lips for what felt like hours but must have only been a minute before she pulled away and grabbed his hand and led him into the room. 


	It was a very nice house, small entryway that led down into a nicely sized living room. Staring ahead was a glass window that was open from one wall to the other and you could see the New York skylights twinkle in the distance. As he was standing there enjoying the view, Hannah came back with two glasses of wine. He felt like just throwing the wine aside and taking her right there for all of New York to see but calmed himself down. This woman was amazing and if anything was to happen tonight, he wanted to enjoy more of her company first. So they sat and got comfortable on her couch as they danced around small talk for a few minutes before Hannah threw her leg over him and stared into his eyes and said “I’m not one of those quiet women that let something good pass by, if I want something then I take it”. Then she pulled his hair back and kissed his neck, slowly at first but then she eventually moved back to his lips and started grinding against his hard cock. She could feel it getting bigger as she slowly teased him with her tongue and hands. And as he kissed her back he started slowly unbuttoning her shirt and teasing her back and hips with his hands. Lex then stands up, carrying Hannah into her waiting bed and lays her down as he kisses her from her cheek, to collar bone, down to her hard pink nipples. She squirms and lets out a soft moan as each inch he moves down her body sends a line of electricity through her head and finger tips. She lifts her cute ass up as Lex slowly pulled down her pants and kisses his way up from her ankles to the inside of her thigh to her cute little button. Hannah arches her back as he pleases her and runs her fingers through his hair with each passing lick. He hears her breathing faster and as she starts to scream out he grabs her hips and pulls her towards anxious mouth. Lex moves up in the bed to lay right beside her and she looks down, somewhere along the way he took off his pants and she was surprised at how big he was. It was her turn to please him but he insisted on tasting her as well, so she threw her legs over his head and went to town on him. Hannah enjoyed this part of the game, feeling the man shift under her mouth and reading his body to know what he liked more. A few minutes go by and Lex picks her up and spins her around with his masculine arms and sets her on his lap. They are both out of breath and sweat has just started pouring down their faces. They smile and lean in and enjoy the passion that is so evident between them as they kiss. Hannah stands up ever so slightly and stares into Lex’s eyes as she grabs his hard cock and slides it gently inside her. Her gasp is so slight and sexy that they both just stop for a moment before she pushes him on his back and takes him just how she wants him. He looks up at her body, eyes closed and hands on his chest and lets her take command of him. This is new to him being with a dominating woman but he enjoys knowing that she knows what she is doing and doing it with such force and recklessness. He grabs her supple ass and flips her over and she giggles. This woman is sexy, funny and utterly adorable in every way. He pulls out and slowly slips back in, teasing her because he knows that she wants him to just pound her like a nail. Hannah can’t take it anymore, “Please take me, I want you to cum for me. I want you now!”.  He stops teasing and just goes for it. Minutes pass with their legs wrapped and their faces pressed together, breathing heavily. She was breathing faster and faster, he was pulling her close and right when he felt her approaching climax he came and collapsed next to her. They laid there in the sweat and heat of their passion and just let the quietness of the night take them in. 

	They must have fallen asleep because it was now morning and she was getting out of the shower. He laid up and was captivated by her beauty, it was a sight that he could quickly get used to. They had to get ready for work before they were late but the question was, could they keep their passion in their back pocket while they were at work or was this office romance going to get a little more exciting?

1xcb2v,3,2014-02-08,New ME Grad looking for continuing education advice.,CafeAmerican0,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1xcb2v/new_me_grad_looking_for_continuing_education/,"**Background:** 
Im 24 and received a BS in Mechanical engineering last year from a pretty decent state university. For the past year and a half I have been working in the HVAC industry and I am starting to realize this is not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. This was also the only offer I was given post graduation so I took it instead of being unemployed. Since Jr year of my undergrad I have been trying to enter into the Aerospace industry but have not received not 1 response from the numerous applications that I have turned into the giants (Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman) etc (Not even an interview)... My grade point average upon graduation is 3.03. I messed up my first 2 years and have been playing catch up since my 3rd year. During my Jr year I worked in lab that gave me hands on experience with Thermodynamic Modeling, SolidWorks 3D modeling, using thermocouples, soldering etc.. I made the mistake of not looking for internships my first two years. 

**Now:**
Anyways now I am becoming very anxious and am thinking that my grades and lack of experience are what is keeping me from being recruited. I am considering going back to school to boost up my grades and possibly gaining more experience. I do need some guidance though... Should I go back and pursue a masters in Mechanical Engineering? I was also possibly thinking Systems Engineering or computer engineering since many of the job post look for programing skills (I only have done light modeling in Matlab). Also since I only have basic experience with programing (Matlab) should I maybe consider an 2nd Bachelors in any of the above to pair with my mechanical engineering degree? 

Ultimately do you guys/gals feel I need to go back to school to gain more experience and boost my grades or am I fine with what I currently have and just need to try harder at looking? 

I am getting pretty desperate and any help or guidance would be truly appreciated! Thanks!   "
1xcfcb,1,2014-02-08,"Me [24F] boyfriend [22M] 1.5 yrs, why do i feel so worthless &amp; what do I do?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xcfcb/me_24f_boyfriend_22m_15_yrs_why_do_i_feel_so/,"I don't know what's going on anymore. Half of me thinks he just doesn't give a shit and the other thinks I ask too much or I've stretched him too thin. I just want some outsider advice. 

Let me start off by saying how wonderful my boyfriend is. I appreciate so much all the good in him and have so much respect for who he is as a person. I know I’m blessed to have gotten to know him and I want him to feel respected and loved. I've fucked that up in the past, but I've taken responsibility and I have really been trying. Everything just keeps getting messed up and  I just don’t know if that matters to him anymore. So if it doesn’t I want to give him the freedom to move on.

When I first met my boyfriend almost two years ago we bonded over being music loving/creating people whose main desire was to be professional musicians making our own stuff and touring. We had a ton of musical taste in common, which not to sound like some indie assholes, was a bit astounding. We’re both admittedly urber-nerds for roots blues, bluegrass, folk, rock, metal, afro-beat,world music, prog rock,jazz ect.  More than music pretty much every area of our life we had a freakish amount in common. Our outlandish, goofy, sarcastic sense of humor was the same as well. Movies, art, books, life-experiences whatever it was we seemed to mesh really well. We both expressed our amazement at this and over the next few months more and more surfaced that we had in common. We just got each other, and even our differences were interesting to each other and somehow worked. I’ve never been as physically attracted to someone till him (he sort of looks like Andrew WK and that’s my motherfucking jazz, plus he slays at every instrument and is 6’4”…basically my wet dream) and the feeling was mutual according to him. Except I look slightly less like Andrew wk and cant play the harmonica like Sonny Boy Williams. Fucker… In the beginning it was bizarrely awesome how in sync we were. Our close friends saw it and commented on it so we knew we weren’t crazy. Now when we bring it up we realize how much we've taken it for granted. Or he has, because it just has become old news I guess. I still appreciate it a lot, in fact I feel sort of gooberish for bringing it up in front of him….

He used to love my voice and music. We have so many songs and unfinished projects together. We were in a band together but it broke up because some other members were flakey.  We’ve argued over it, stupid bullshit that blew up. Now seems like he could care less and we never make music anymore. He was derogatory about a project I’d worked on and knocked me down a few times about the way I had been singing. Usually I’m good with criticism but it was heavy in addition to the space growing between us. I had lost confidence in myself, maybe for good reason. But I'm still working, still trying any way, on my own. Sucks a lot we don’t do anything together. I’ve brought it up in different ways but he just blows it off or has an excuse. Well, I’m finally in a band that I’m stoked on and he’s been supportive, I guess. It just feels hollow, like he doesn’t mean it and is uninterested. So I see no point in sharing anymore, but I really wish he still believed in me and was even ¼ as excited to do things together as he was in the beginning. Maybe he didn’t even mean it then, who fucking knows.

My views on religion and his clashed pretty hard 8/9 months in. but he and I worked on it and decided to go on a spiritual journey together of sorts. After all, I recognized I didn’t know everything and I was still growing and learning, but bickering over other bullshit knocked us off course. One of the big issues was from a boozy night where one of his asshole high school friends called my friend a ""bitch"" when we had been nothing but kind to him all night. It was really out of the blue and I sort of lost my shit when the guy continued to yell at and threaten my best friend with physical violence. In my boyfriend's defense he hadn't really been paying attention and was playing guitar and talking with some buddies at the beginning of the argument. Still once I caught his eye and he tuned in he took a long time to react and defend me. I was sore about that for a while. I don't want to get any guy in a fight, but fuck this guy who yelled at us did so with no provocation. That incident haunted us for a while ,but we got over it. He proved himself in other ways and we worked through it. He isn't a pussy by any means. The guy is 6""5' with hands like baseball mitts, he's not scared of a fight he just truly wasn't aware of what was going on till it was very heated.  Honestly, I gave him a lot of shit about it. 

Things got really bad when we went on a two vacations in a row. We didn’t mean to schedule it that way it just happened. The second was with his family on a tiny island he was burnt out on from too many family trips in his youth. It got to be that all he wanted to do was get high or sleep. I spent time with his family away from him or walking around the island by myself, which was nice. But it sucked that I was there with his family having to do all the explaining as to why we weren’t together and what was up with his mood.  We both were a bit sick of each other afterwards, but he was cruel about it and it really threw me for a loop. I really just tried to make the best of it and he was a stick in the mud. Which was up until that point, really unlike him. He’s hyper and had always been a lot of fun. In fact at times I found it hard to be around him because he was too go-go-go, but I saw that he was trying to entertain me and make me laugh and had a lot of self-confidence. He didn’t care if he looked like an idiot if it made me smile, he was secure in himself and I appreciated that. Then he became quiet, passive aggressive and was always tired. He admitted he was depressed didn’t want to be social but it seemed fishy because he wasn’t like that with his friends. Friends he had expressed dissatisfaction with because they “brought him down” were “only into partying” ect ect…his words not mine. But it bit me in the ass when I started agreeing with him and ever since it seems like he chooses them over me. 

I have expressed concern over a few of his friendships and even went as far to say as I really disliked them, but 90% of his friends I love. In fact I’ve become really close with them and their girlfriends. They invite me to parties that it seems he just wants to ignore me at for the most. He used to be my buddy, my partner in crime. Now he wont let me leave but really makes me feel like shit about myself with this distant bullshit. I don’t have as many friends as him but I have close ones I focus on more. I get along really well with my family so I spend a lot of time with them. My older brothers and sisters are hilarious and rad and love him, but while I really go out of my way to spend time with his family (even though I don’t have much in common with them) he snubs mine a lot. 

I never see him check out other girls, but I see them check him out. I don't think he's cheating. 

In the beginning I could relax around him immediately, I was enamored with him and still am but he's drifted. I've pointed it out. Tried a million approaches. Lots of openness and talking on my end…just trying to find a solution, but he tapers out of the conversation pretty quick and doesn’t seem to listen or care. I’ve tried to leave but he tells me he doesn’t want that. So what then? I cant seem to do anything right anymore or make him happy. And that hurts and leaves me feeling so powerless and shitty, but I cant walk away…
Is he just trying to get me to leave because he doesn't want to do the work? I don't seek out confrontation by any means. I just speak up when I feel it's important. Unfortunately I've it's felt ""important"" for months now. I've exhausted him, but he doesn't ever say much and I just get more and more upset. I feel like a drowning person and he's just watching complacently from the shore.  

All he says he wants is me to ""Relax"". I try. I want to! So why does he get so passive aggressive with me and ignore me? It seems like he's pushing me away on purpose, or maybe I'm just not important to him. I don't need to be the fucking center of his life, but he used to be so fucking into me it was almost too much. He used to not care what anyone thought and bounce off the walls trying to make me laugh and we had so much fun together. 
I'm a naturally relaxed, easy going person, but it sucks when you're with someone you love and you feel like they make you do all the work. How did the roles reverse so much?
I constantly wonder if he'd even talk to me if I didn't initiate a conversation. I pretend so much that everything is fine and I'm happy but the sadness in me builds and builds. I've never been this depressed in my life. Mostly I just feel so embarrassed of myself, so worthless and pathetic. I don't want sympathy I just want to respect myself and I'm such a weak piece of shit I can't fucking figure out if I should go or stay.  

He never makes the plans anymore. I mean I don’t need a fucking candle light dinner, never have, but shit even if he said “babe lets go to Del Taco then play air hockey” I’d be down as fuck. I’m pretty easy to please. He asks what I'm doing and I tell him I'm not busy, then nothing… I'll invite him to shows I'm playing or suggest we do something and he'll agree. But I drive to him constantly. He drives from orange county to LA to work every day so he’s complains about the drive. I offer to drive, whatever. I know he’s tired from work and my work isn’t as physical as his. But fuck, I’m tired too dude and I’m still trying. We will have fun, but I always feel like he'd rather be somewhere else and I've told him that


This has been going on for over 6 months.  I’m convinced that 90% of that is his unwillingness to just snap out of it and be in a better mood. Or be present or stop phoning it in. Why tell me to stay? Why tell me you love me? Our good times seem shorter and shorter. I can't tell if I'm reading into everything he does too much because I'm so stressed and it all has felt unresolved for months or if it really is this fucked. Am I over-reacting? Maybe if I didn't bring it up every week…god I just get so beat down thinking about it. Ive become too sensitive maybe &amp; I hate how he's changed but realize some if it is my fault from cruel shit I've said.

Is this because I struggle with manic depression? He’s called me co-dependant a few times.  I give him space a lot. We see each other maybe twice a week. Recently we’ve gone a week or two not seeing each other at all, my choice. But only because I thought space would help, it hasn’t and I wish we could just relax together. I don’t need to be entertained. I can read a book or entertain myself, I just like being with him. We don’t even have to talk and he knows that.
I have a full life on my own too…I work full time and I have friends and hobbies (I’m in a band, I take drum lessons, I intern at an art shop, I read, I write, run, yoga, have a great relationship with my family) my life is exceedingly full even without the time I spend with him. But I choose to make time for him, it’s not because I HAVE to have male attention.  I'm self-sufficient but I miss this piece in my life where love was, as cheesy as it sounds. I've fucked things,I can be angry, a mean drunk, cruel, contentious I’m not a saint.I have apologized and tried to really change for the better, for him, but also for myself. I've been trying very hard to grow as a person because I want to…and I've said sorry and tried to take responsibility when I was wrong. We’ve had so many good times, is it over? I just don't know what to do anymore. 

If anyone can make sense of this please leave me a comment. 

tl;dr Are things over, they are so back and forth from amazing to blaaah?"

Where do I begin?,epitone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1xcgoq/feeling_overwhelmed_by_all_this_info_where_do_i/,"So maybe it could be because I've been staying up late working on a web development project with my childhood friend for the past week and a half, or maybe it's just plain old anxiousness, but I've been feeling really overwhelmed with all the things I feel like I should be doing as a CompSci major.

I'm only just beginning my Intro to Java class at a community college (completed 30 credits more or less so technically that'd make me a first semester sophmore?) and I've been trying to get a proverbial leg up on the competition by coming around and trying to learn as much information as I can, but it's all so overwhelming!

Between the applying for internships (is it even possible to get one as a sophmore?) and schoolwork and attempting to start on side projects for my portfolio, I feel like my head is going to fly clear off.  Am I trying to do too much too early? What did you guys do to try and balance all this out? Is there any easy way to break this down into bite-size chunks?"
1xcgp4,2,2014-02-08,South African looking to legally immigrate to the USA. Any advice?,[deleted],immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1xcgp4/south_african_looking_to_legally_immigrate_to_the/,"Hi Reddit,

I am a South African, age 23 living in Cape Town. I have completed high-school &amp; got my certificate. I didn't study any further as I always wanted to study filmmaking in the United States but never could as I never saved up enough money to do so. 

I have been working in the show-business (television) for my eighth year now. I started out as a timekeeper when I was 16 &amp; moved through all the position's to end up doing what I'm doing now, which is VT playout. So that means I play out all pre-recorded content whether it be from a non-linear editing application or hardware. I have two jobs currently working on a live breakfast show as well as a live kids show. They are the only two daily live broadcast's in Cape Town so I have exhausted my work possibilities. I see myself as being extremely fortunate to have a job, though. 

I have always wanted to immigrate to the US. My mother is a British citizen as she married a British guy a couple of years ago &amp; my father is a South African. I've been googling around recently to find ways that I could enter the great country of America but things aren't looking that positive. 

So the reason I gave up looking to go to the US before was that I was arrested with A joint on me. I payed a fine back then (to not get my dad involved seeing as he would've kicked my lilly-white ass into a blueberry colored paste) which was actually an admission of  the crime , that I signed &amp; I was charged with possession (not minor because it was a joint only- posession). That was a week after a turned 18. Two years later I was caught by police holding a banky of weed (about 10 grams) &amp; wow, I was held overnight because it was the second time I had been caught with weed! Went to court to contest it this time but my green horn lawyer was the joke of the courtroom &amp; I was found guilty. ( the case I watched while waiting got my hopes up seeing as the guy also got caught with weed except two garbage bags FULL in the township &amp; he got off without a charge! There I was for a banky! [but got charged anyway])

This killed all hope within me to be able to go to the US (or any first-world country) because I believe that with a criminal-record my life was as good as over. I am doomed to live &amp; die in South Africa regardless of whether the country was doing okay or not. 

Now my need to go to the US to work &amp; live is burning stronger than ever. I need a new start, I want to be able to flourish &amp; not just get by. There doesn't seem to be a way to get into the US without huge bulk sums of cash. I want to leave everything &amp; everyone behind &amp; live my own life in the greatest country in the world (USA). But I don't have huge amount's of money just lying around. I have an apartment I bought when I was 21, the bank technically owns it because I haven't payed it off yet but I believe I can make a good R200 000,00 ($18047,00) profit if I sell it now. 

I didn't study here because I always wanted to study filmmaking in the US, seeing as studying a film &amp; television here in SA would've been a waste of time &amp; money. 

What route could I take to become a US Citizen or get a green-card? I have no one in America that would sponsor me, no family, no ties whatsoever.  

I have seen on the internets that joining the army is another way of getting into the US but I cannot do so without a green-card? So I would have to apply for a student-visa to get a green-card &amp; then apply to be recruited in the army? As you can see this must be pretty dire as I am a stoner who is willing to join the army to show my allegiance to the US. 

Is there any advice any one could offer? I have thought about calling up all the television stations US-Side &amp; stating my experience &amp; saying I am willing to work as an intern forever! With two jobs &amp; working hours from 4AM to 5PM, I am working myself to the bone &amp; I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. 

I have went through the immigration subreddit &amp; it seems impossible to legally immigrate to the US. I can't seek asylum because South Africa actually isn't as bad most of the other countries in Africa but I'm hoping someone could suggest something, anything! 

I could go to the UK I guess because my mom is there but that isn't the fresh start I want. I want to live &amp; work within the USA. 

ANY advice or input will be greatly appreciated even the sarcastic ""cool story, bro"" comments. Thanks in advance.

1xckbo,10,2014-02-08,Do you ever feel like you need overcompensate for INFP weaknesses?,cowmoo,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1xckbo/do_you_ever_feel_like_you_need_overcompensate_for/,"Hi /r/infp peeps, 

Do you ever feel like you need overcompensate for the INFP weaknesses? Despite that fact that we are apparently suppose to be ""smart, creative and idealistic,"" we are also reportedly ""emotional moody, prone to lateness, confusion, irresponsibility; focus on fantasies?"" (http://similarminds.com/jung/infp.html)

Vincent Van Goh cut his ear off because he couldn't take it anymore; Princess Diana acts brutally to her compassion and insecurities without care for the proper Royal presentation. I wonder if they were ever self-aware to the point that they either accepted their erratic personalities to embrace both the good or bad, or somehow managed to mitigate their lulls to keep their creative cycles rolling. Please discuss your personal experience/take on this. 

My take: I dropped English in favor of CS in undergrad because I thought that I fancied myself too much and instead should go for a steady career to ""have a more realistic dream and keep on dreaming."" But after pursing that career for 5.5 years, I realize that I couldn't care less for the ""startup passion"" nor the ambition to climb the ladder and care more about helping interns learn programming or daydreaming myself at work than coding some crap so that people can consume more on the Web. 

Being a skinny guy who had mostly creative and geeky interests in college, I thought that I was more provoked by the novels, movies and music to ""daydream what could be"" instead of ever finishing or following through on any concrete plans I daydreamt about. So I took up basketball to try something different and concrete. But I find that I enjoy the creative process of basketball the most, the part where you discover, become slowly aware of your own body's mechanics and tweak them when you are shooting hoops or practicing a move in the gym all by yourself - more than playing with other people! Even in games, I get off more on a good pass or contributing to a ""good vibe"" to my teammates than actually winning the game or scoring points.  

Have you guys or gals tried to ""fix"" or ""mitigate"" parts of your INFP personalities and what sort of results/reflections have you come away with? "

1xcpbe,8,2014-02-08,Funding for Unpaid Internships,absurdfatalism,Drexel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drexel/comments/1xcpbe/funding_for_unpaid_internships/,"So my girlfriend goes to UPenn (you know, that small community college across the street) and she just found out about an awesome program they have there. Some context:

The Social Work program she is in encourages internships, sort of like Drexel has co-ops. Now as you might imagine, some of the most interesting internship options are unpaid. In Social Work this is due to the fact that the most interesting, policy changing, community centric, grass roots, life impacting (the list goes on...) organizations do not have the funding to pay interns as they are usually small and underfunded. Either that or the internship is with such a well known company that the prestige is enough to allow them to not pay (ex. ACLU over a local soup kitchen - though, in that example neither would pay probably).

UPenn has started to offer money (I've heard, starring at $3,000 for a summer -&gt; ~ $7.50 an hour...) to encourage their students to take unpaid internships. The catch?:

Those students that receive that funding must keep/update an online blog documenting their employment experience. Do you see where the 'marketing department' at UPenn must have been involved with this?

Now, those 'oh I wish I could work there, I just can't afford to be unpaid' awesome job opportunities are being filled with UPenn students. First, it is now even easier for UPenn to get their name in the door of all of the most interesting/great organizations. Second, they get an entire summer of personalized online advertising (the blog) that just repeats the message 'UPenn students have employment opportunities with great companies'.

You can stop reading hear and just think, wow, Drexel should try that for their Social Workers. However, being an engineer (not a social worker), I started to think that this may even benefit 'us' (the other majors) as well.

Having done 3 co-ops, I can tell you there are a couple of unpaid co-ops that normally get laughed at by the engineering students. I've heard the unpaid co-op is more common for liberal arts majors but is still often looked down upon as a last option. 

But think about this next time you see an unpaid internship: if that place peaks your interest then you shouldn't have to worry about money stopping you from working there. It's reasonable to think that more people would be happy if their employment was based more on interest than on financial reward.

I assert that Drexel should attempt a similar program. Drexel should get their students out into those fantastic opportunities and prosper from the essentially massive advertising campaign.

1xcv0d,2,2014-02-08,"I'm [22F] in a serious relationship, but my friends/family don't think my boyfriend [23M] is as serious about me.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1xcv0d/im_22f_in_a_serious_relationship_but_my/,"My boyfriend [23/M] and I [22/F] have been together for almost 10 months  now, and since 3 months ago we have been long distance. We love each other and have talked about being serious. Recently we talked about ending the long distance part of our relationship by moving together to a different state. He is currently going through a variety of military training, but knows he is going to his first station on November of this year. The idea is that I would move with him when he goes in November. By November, I would have graduated from college with great grades and internship experience. I also have money saved up, and have already started thinking about the city that I plan to move to. He will be more established in his job as he'll no longer be in training phase, and he has a steady and comfortable income. 
Although this change in my life is scary, I am excited for many reasons.  I'll get to experience a new place, I will finally be with my SO and basically it's a start to a new adult life. 



I expressed this idea to friends and family, and a lot have them have been less than supportive. I am a person that likes to get the opinions of the people I love in these situations. I think it's better to be ""at harmony"" with them. I know I should make my own choices, which I ultimately am, but the dissonance between the choices I make and the views my loved ones have really gnaws at me. Friends and family have been less than stellar for a number of reasons. 



* This is my first relationship. I feel like people often discredit or look down on my situation because my SO is my first, and they automatically conclude our relationship will end eventually. While I understand most people date around before they settle down with a person, I don't think this has to be a set ""rule."" I don't feel the desire to see if ""the grass is greener."" I also think we're both pretty mature and have a good ""base"". We have career goals and direction. 



* There have been some bumps in the road, and like any other person, I talk to my friends and family about them. I think from talking about so many negative aspects, my friends and family have concluded that my boyfriend isn't serious about me, or isn't making me happy. They often see me upset, but I have come to terms with myself (and am seeking therapy for it) that I am an emotionally reactive person. Happy things make me cry. Sad things make me cry. I have an issue with anxiety. I think, like most people, I talk about the bad more than I talk about the good. 


I just think, it would be unnatural if my relationship were the regular ""normal"" kind where people saw each other often and I was always upset, but our relationship is long distance as well as military. Yes, I may be a little unhappy now, but that's because I am away from him. 


With our bumps, we always try to talk it out and resolve it that way. I always bring up issues I feel we're having. For example, early on in our relationship, we had a talk about religion. His family is fairly Christian, whereas I am agnostic. I was worried he wouldn't accept that about me, but he said he would love me regardless. 


During Christmas/his birthday, I planned an expensive dinner and a show and treated him out. He didn't get me anything. When I brought it up at the end of the night, he apologized and said I was totally right about the issue and that it would never happen again. I chalked it up to him being caught up in his busy training, as he had just moved away and got started doing that, and I understand it is very stressful and he was still adjusting.


Last time he came home to visit on break, he had 3.5 days. He spent a fair amount of time with me, but he also had to see his family, friends and grandparents in those days. I was sad I didn't get to see him more, but I also respected that he wanted to spend equal time with his friends and family. On the day before he was to leave, he came over and brought his best friend over unannounced. His best friend lives about 5 mins away from me. I was upset because I wasn't expecting his friend, and I expected to spend time with my SO alone, not hanging out with his friend also. I told him this, and he said he just wanted to introduce me to him, since he always talks about how serious he is about me. My friends and family have told me that if he were serious, he would make it a priority to see me most, but I think that's unfair. 


For the last two situations, I know, and he tells me, that he never deliberately does things because he doesn't care or he wants to hurt me. And I think he does things without thinking about them. I can tell sometimes he doesn't think things through and he's a little absentminded, and I understand that about him. Whenever something bothers me, I make sure to let him know so that he understands.


From situations like the last two, I think my mom or my friends think he's not serious about us. But I feel like he is. I just don't want to be blinded by love. I'm afraid that all the things I say to defend him are not validated, and it's only because I want to convince myself. 


I brought up the moving idea to my parents last night, and my dad told me I should concentrate on my career first and not make such big decisions like moving after dating for such a short time. But I can't see how it's making anything progress and work with my SO if I chose to stay in my current city and continue long distance. It's not like I am moving to a city with no opportunities in my field; in fact the city is larger. My parents always tell me not to put 100% of my feelings into this because they don't want to see me get hurt. They harp on the fact that most people go through 3 or 4 relationships before they settle. But I don't think it's fair to withhold my feelings to save myself. That's selfish. And I'm sure those people who've had 3 or 4 relationships have been brutally hurt. That's why they have the experience. If I stay in my current city and get a job, I will have dug even deeper roots. When, then, will I make a decision to finally pick up and leave? My view is that I just need to take the risk and move. I never intended to stay in my current city anyway, and this is a good reason to branch out and experience a new city.


Actions speak louder than words, and if he were serious, his actions will show, but as long as we're a military relationship, the dynamic is that I will have to bend to him. He gets ordered where to move to, and I must make the decision if I want to follow, which I am OK with. So how else are his actions supposed to show that he's serious about me? He tells me he loves me more etc. but my friends/family says that is all talk. 


My SO always tells me how much he loves me, he's affectionate, and he tries to call/text me often. He always keeps me in the loop about his military stuff, because those things affect us. We've talked about me moving with him, and he's always hesitant, saying, ""IF you still want to move with me."" He's let things slip in the past that hint he sees a future with me. 




TL;DR - Even through the bumps along the road, I [22/F] feel that my boyfriend [23/M] is serious about us and our future, but my friends and family are doubtful. Now I'm unsure if I am making the right decisions and it's putting a strain on my side of the relationship. How do I know if I being objective and making the right decisions, or if I am just blinded by love? "
1xd9w0,3,2014-02-08,Undergraduate looking to future job prospects,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1xd9w0/undergraduate_looking_to_future_job_prospects/,"Hi /r/Consulting,

First to say - I'm a 2nd year Industrial Economics student at University of Nottingham, England. 

These last 5 months have been horrible for me. Through failing with numerical tests (honestly silly by me to do some hungover/ill/tired/not doing it with a friend) even after I score high 80% in my maths tests, and failing an interview with PwC, I'm basically at a position where I'm not going to have a summer internship this summer.

What can I do to improve my prospects of getting a job when I graduate? I feel / been told, it's incredibly hard to break into consulting as a graduate without summer internships, so I'm just not sure what I can do ! I have a 63% average (after two exams flopping from my grandma dying [i know its not an excuse really but it did affect me]) and looking to push this up to 70% by this year (and hopefully keep it at 70%+ when i graduate). What are my prospects with 60%+ (2:1) and 
70% (1:1)? 

I would be looking for working for a well named firm preferably in the future, would i be able to straight up or would I have to work at a smaller, less known firm (I'm talking not even well known boutique firms like L.E.K) and try and work my way up through good work ethic/success? 

Thanks in advance ! "

A brief bit about me: I’m 23 years old with brown hair and green eyes. I’m 5’5” about 115 pounds. I have a nice butt (look at my post history for pics of it) and B cup boobs. I’ve always been told I’m “very cute.” I’ve gotten “sexy” and “pretty” more in the last couple of years it seems like. I grew up in a very straight-laced family and I have for the most part always appeared to be straight-laced as well. I’m kind of your typical all-American girl, was in a sorority in college etc. I realized in my teens that I have an abnormally high sex drive. I acted on it some, but didn’t start sleeping around a lot until I turned 20. I’m pretty much what most would describe as a sex addict now, but my family and friends would never suspect. So, on to the story, this happened about two years ago. 

I moved to New York City for the summer for an internship. The internship was pretty boring, but some of the people that I worked with were really fun. It was the first time I had lived away from home, so having people around that were welcoming and fun was nice. There was a girl from work we’ll call Heather that I got to be pretty good friends with and she would invite me to hangout with her on the weekends. We would usually go out to bars with a group of her friends, which was definitely appealing to me since I had just turned 21. 

The weekend before my last weekend in NYC Heather invited me to go to a party at this apartment. She was friends with a girl that was friends with the guys that lived there. I met up with her to go eat dinner at this sushi place before the party. I always dress fairly conservatively and that night was no different. I had on skinny jeans, some flats, and a top that wasn’t too revealing. We got to the party and it was a madhouse. We could barely find room to squeeze in, but we managed. We worked our way over to where the drinks were and started drinking. There were quite a few attractive guys there, but there were also quite a few attractive girls. I was thinking how I probably should have dressed a little more revealing if I wanted to attract any attention. A couple of guys came up to talk to us early on, but we weren’t really into them. Heather actually had a boyfriend, but he had other plans that night. She was my official “wing-woman” for the night. 

Later on in the night there was a guy named Max, who was a law school student, that came up and started talking to us and I thought he was pretty attractive. He was tall, a little muscular, and had a cute but not amazing face. He was really funny too, which helped. He talked me into taking a shot with him and after that we were kind of attached at the hip for the next couple of hours. He started being more flirtatious and bold, even occasionally teasingly grabbing my butt. I acted slightly offended and would slap his hand, but in reality I was really turned on and liked it. Like I said, my sex drive is always insane, but when I drink my hormones jump to another level. I really wanted him to take me in one of the rooms and have his way with me, but I’m never that bold about instigating. I like to let guys take the lead. 

The party started winding down and eventually there were only about ten people left. Heather told me she was ready to leave. I told her I was going to stay and hang out with Max a little more. I found out earlier on that he was one of the two guys that lived at the apartment. She just laughed and told me to have fun. 

Heather was only gone for about ten minutes before Max asked me if I wanted to go to his bedroom, so we could be alone. I said yes and we headed to his room. He shut the door behind us and just as soon as it closed he grabbed my face and we started kissing. He walked me back to the wall until my back was up against it. We continued to kiss and before I knew it he was unbuttoning my jeans. He slid them down slightly and slid his hand down and began rubbing my wet pussy. I wanted him inside me so badly. I reached down with my right hand and began rubbing his cock from outside his pants. I quickly became bored with that and unbuckled his belt and pants. I slid his pants and underwear down and dropped to my knees. I was staring at his cock. It was nice and very thick and probably around seven inches long. I stroked it a few times with my hand before taking it into my mouth. His thickness made my mouth feel very full and I loved it. I began sucking long and hard strokes. I tried taking all of him in my mouth until his cock nearly hit the back of my throat. He was moaning and making very sexy noises. I released his cock from my mouth and began licking and sucking on his balls while I stroked his cock. I wanted him inside me. 

He said we should go over to his bed. We walked over to his bed and I took all of my clothes off and so did he. I climbed onto his bed and he was still standing on the side. He grabbed me and flipped me around facing away from him and bent me over on all fours. He buried his face in my pussy from behind. I love it when guys do this, so it was really turning me on. I could feel his tongue maneuvering trying to find my clit and I was moaning wildly. Finally he couldn’t take it anymore and he got up behind me and slid his thick cock in my pussy. He was going slowly and it felt wonderful. I could feel every inch of him filling me up. After going slow for a good while he began fucking me harder and harder. I felt an orgasm coming on and I braced myself before exploding. I began moaning and screaming as I came. He began being more rough and pulled my hair as I came. It made me scream even louder with pleasure. 

He flipped me over onto my back and slid his cock back in my pussy again. We were both covered in sweat now and I felt his sweat drip down onto my body. It always turns me on feeling a guy work hard at fucking me and feeling him sweat. There is something very manly about it. He continued with the rough tone he began setting moments before. He was thrusting in and out of me quickly. He was pulling my hair with one of his hands. He kept saying, “You like that don’t you sexy?” I would respond, “Yeah, fuck me hard. Please fuck me hard.” I wasn’t just saying that to turn him on. I really wanted him to. I felt insatiable at that point. I just wanted to be fucked all night. After slamming his cock in and out of me for a while longer he told me he was about to cum. He pulled out of me and shot his cum all over my stomach. It was a lot and it felt so warm. I love that feeling of warmth on my skin. I asked if he had a towel. He said he’d have to go to the bathroom to grab one. 

He left the room and went into the hallway to get to the bathroom to grab a towel. He came back and I wiped his cum off of my stomach. I put my panties back on and threw my shirt on. He asked why I was putting my clothes on. I said I needed to pee. He said that everyone was pretty much gone. He said there is one guy on the couch watching TV with his roommate and that’s all. The hallway was away from the living area, so I just stepped out into the hall and went into the bathroom with my panties and shirt on. 

I was in there for a few minutes and when I walked out I heard Max in the kitchen, which was at the other end of the hallway. I looked down that way and Max and his roommate Kevin were standing there. I didn’t realize that Kevin was his roommate earlier, but I saw Kevin earlier at the party and I was extremely attracted to him. He was really tall, dark hair, ice blue eyes, and in really good shape. He was just almost modelish looking. He was a fellow law school student. Kevin said, “ohh damn, looking good!” Max laughed and said, “She looks even better naked.” Kevin said, “Oh really? Hmm I want to see.” I stood frozen. I didn’t know how to respond. I knew I should try to act offended for being objectified. In reality I wanted to be really slutty. I wanted to just take my clothes off right there, but I didn’t. Max said, “Sorry, didn’t mean to embarrass you.” Kevin said, “but really let’s see.” I looked at Max and he looked back as if to tell me he was cool with it. I was drunk enough still to be bold, so I just lifted my shirt up and quickly showed him my tits. He said, “Damn, that’s it. Come to my room.” 

I thought he was joking at first, but he walked into the hallway and grabbed my hand and he led me into his bedroom. My head was spinning. I felt so dirty, but I loved it. I wanted to resist to make myself seem more ladylike, but deep down I didn’t want to. He walked me over and laid me down on his bed. Max stood in the doorway and laughed and said, “you son of a bitch.” He definitely didn’t seem to mind what was happening. Kevin slid my shirt off and began kissing my neck down to my chest. He was teasing and sucking on my nipples. My nipples quickly got hard and I was gushing wet. Max was still standing in the doorway watching. Kevin stood up and unbuckled his belt and dropped his jeans. He stood beside the bed and I leaned up and took his cock in my mouth. His wasn’t quite as thick as Max’s, but it was longer. He was probably around eight inches. I felt so slutty that Max was watching this, but it was turning me on. Kevin just stood at the side of the bed and was basically face fucking me. During the course of this he reached down and slid my panties off. He continued to slide his cock in and out of my mouth occasionally hitting the back of my throat and slightly gagging me. 

He finally got up on the bed and he slid his cock in my pussy as a I lay on my back. I put my legs up on his shoulders and he started pounding me. He felt so strong. He was grunting and I could feel his hips slam into me. I felt my body begin to tense up and shockwaves flowed throughout it. I orgasmed harder than I had earlier. My pussy was gushing wet. The sounds of his cock slamming in and out of me began getting sloppier and sloppier as I continued to get more turned on. He flipped me over and got me up on all fours. His cock slid back in me with ease. I felt like a wild animal just wanting to satisfy all of my desires. He continued pounding me hard. 

A couple of minutes later Max appears beside the bed. I think he was watching the whole time, but I’m not sure. Either way, I guess he was recharged and decided to try to join in the action. He was beside the bed naked and rock hard. The angle was awkward, so I felt like I couldn’t really take him in my mouth. I told him to get on the bed in front of me. He sat down on the bed in front of me with his back against the wall. Kevin continued to fuck me from behind as I took Max’s cock back into my mouth. This was really not how I expected the night to turn out. I felt so full on both ends. It was an amazing feeling. The harder Kevin pounded me the harder I sucked on Max’s cock. If he was going too hard I had to take Max’s cock from my mouth, so I could moan. We stayed in this position for a really long time. 

Eventually Max and Kevin switched out. Kevin knelt in front of me though and was face fucking me as Max fucked me from behind. At some point I began screaming that I wanted both of them to cum for me. A few minutes later Kevin told me he was about to cum and I braced myself and waited for his warm cum to start entering my mouth. A few moments later I felt him twitch and felt his cum start to shoot out and hit the back of my throat and fill my mouth. I swallowed every drop. Not even a minute later Max said he was about to cum. I moved forward and turned around taking his cock in my mouth. A few moments later he began unloading his cum in my mouth too. I fell back into the bed. I was exhausted. Max and Kevin sat there for a while catching their breath. 

They started talking about food and asked if I wanted any. I said sure. They said they were going to go to this pizza place and grab some food and bring it back. They left and I passed out lying there naked on Kevin’s bed. I woke up about 10 minutes later to the other guy, whom I had completely forgotten was there, standing in the doorway. He was really cute. He was about as attractive as Max, but in a different way. He was shorter, about 5’10”, brown hair, in shape, rugged cute look. He looked like he just walked up. When I looked up and looked at him he just looked kind of dazed. He kind of chuckled and said, “what’s up?” I said, “what’s your name?” He said, “Jeff.” I said, “come here.” I knew what he wanted and I felt like I had broken the seal that night. I was in wild mode and I was still ridiculously turned on. 

He walked over and I got down from the bed and onto my knees. I unbuckled his pants and pulled them down. He had a look of amazement on his face. His cock was actually a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It was around seven inches, but super thick. Like even a little thicker than Max’s. I took it in my mouth and started sucking him hard and fast. He kept muttering dirty stuff to me and had his hand on the back of my head. 

After a few minutes I got up on the bed and bent over in front of him. He entered my pussy from behind. I was beginning to be sore, but not sore enough for it to not be pleasurable. He was so thick it felt like he was stretching me out. I wondered if Max and Kevin would be home while this was still going on and what their reaction would be. They couldn’t really say much. They basically started all of this. Jeff was fucking me harder than Max or Kevin did. He seemed like he loved being in control. He had his hands on my hips and was pulling them hard back into his cock. He didn’t last long. It was only about seven minutes before Jeff started losing control and pulled out and came all over my ass and pussy. He got up and put his pants on and walked out of the room. He didn't even grab a towel for me, but he was drunk and I wasn't being very ladylike. Can't expect much in that situation. I just laid on my stomach and let his cum dry on me.

Max and Kevin came home about fifteen minutes later. I don’t know if they ever knew that Jeff fucked me. I’m sure he told them at some point, but I didn’t. I slept in Kevin’s bed that night and fucked him again early the next morning. I left NYC to head home after that next weekend. Also, I know it was really dumb of me not to use protection you don’t have to tell me that. My first shot at telling one of my stories, be nice. :)  Also, thanks to a fellow gonewildstory teller that really turns me on for inspiring me to tell my story, you know who you are ;)

1xdpcc,4,2014-02-08,My bf [25 M] almost broke up with me [26 F] &amp; I'm in shock! Need an outsiders view of the situation!,nmh111112,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xdpcc/my_bf_25_m_almost_broke_up_with_me_26_f_im_in/,"Background: My boyfriend [25 m] and I [26 f] have been together for 1 year &amp; 3 months. 


Our relationship has been tricky, yet fun, rewarding, &amp; remarkable. He immigrated here 5 yrs ago with his family from Cuba, and together, we have learned how to compromise and make adjustments. We have grown as a couple, share similar interests, we have taught each other patience, want the same things in the future, laugh, &amp; our sex life is great, etc. 


Our biggest issues: 1) We are both financially strapped as students and part-time employees. I had a full-time job when we met and left that job for a grad school internship. He was unemployed when we met, struggled to find work, got a job working 4 hours per day at minimum wage, and just got fired for not hearing his phone ring at 4 AM to come to work on Saturday. He was supposed to move in with me this fall, but it didn't happen because he could not find a full-time job. Mind you, it is tough for a lot of immigrants in the job market. 


2) Working through cultural differences. When we first started dating, he spent WAY too much time with his family and put them before me all the time. He lives at home (he helped his family buy their house by working 40+ hours per week in a factory for 3 years). He made adjustments for me and I for him. I am now very close with his family, especially his little sister. Made it work! 


3) He is more of a loner than I am. However, after undergraduate school, many of my friends moved far away and my new friends are typically women with families. I have had difficulties finding the time or energy to expand my social network and the friends I do have left are not dependable. Therefore, we spend a lot of time together. I guess maybe too much. And when we are together, we don't do very much because we cannot afford to go out and its snowy and cold here. 


I did not see this afternoon coming. We had a fight yesterday. He has been incredibly irritable and distant on &amp; off these past couple of weeks, overwhelmed with school, finances, &amp; work. I am getting over a spout of depression, yet, never got mean toward him. I have tried everything I can to help him feel better, but yesterday, he screamed at me on the phone because I asked him 2 questions. I hung up and told him to contact me in the morning when he could control himself.


He came over this morning, very defensive. When I explained that I understood he's struggling, but it isn't right to take it out on me, he said he was sick of it. I asked him if he was breaking up with me, and he said ""Basically"". I was in absolute shock. After trying to get to the root of his issue, he said he just wants to be alone (revealed he lost his job and a pipe broke in his bedroom - last straw). He deals with his issues by closing himself off, while I want to talk it out. He lets things build up and then hides or loses it. He said he needs space, and doesn't know how long he will need space for. I asked him why we couldn't be together while I gave him space, and he said he didn't think I could handle us not seeing or talking to each other as much, and he thought it would hurt me more to have to be together and pull back than to just completely pull back or emotionally tolerate it. Doesn't think I have it in me to not pressure him. He feels smothered by me always obsessing about his happiness and well-being. He gets tired of seeing me too much. He said he doesn't know how long it will last until he figures things out, but said that if we want to work, he needs me to back off a bit. He said he feels too much pressure from me to get work, move in, take things to the next level, etc. It boils down to him needing less pressure. I asked him what he needed, and I agreed to it. 


I guess I am in shock because I didn't realize I was doing this. I realized that once again I have lost myself in someone else. I feel horrible and scared. I am willing to do what it takes to preserve this relationship, and honestly, I could use some space too. I need to find myself, and I need something more besides him in my life.He assured me that he really loves me, wants a future together, we will still see each other, and be a couple like we are, but not always in contact, and that I have to respect that he wants a lot of time to himself. I'm in shock over the situation, but more so scared and confused. I didn't see it coming. I feel crushed. 


He is often true to his word, and I trust that he really does want to be with me. I want to prove that I have the capacity to give him what he needs, that I can back off and not pressure him. I have my own needs, yet I see this as a pattern in every relationship I have had. I have given him much more space and understanding than I did in the past. He said he has seen a big change. Yet, I'm still too co-dependent. I don't want to fuck this one up! Yet, I don't want to be lead on only for him to randomly decide that yes, he really is done. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend of 1 yr 3 months almost broke up with me because he wants to be alone to figure things out and not pressured, and doesn't think I can handle giving him the space he needs without becoming depressed or just not being able to give him space at all. We are going to try it, and I am willing to back off for the sake of us. Do you think he will drag me along and then end it? 

What do I do? Sorry for the long rant! "

Is this inappropriate?,[deleted],eldertrees,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/1xdzsq/getting_evicted_and_fired_up_about_it_is_this/,"**EDIT: Thank you for your input everyone. I feel a lot better about the situation just from writing the letter and getting some validation from you guys. It probably isn't worth risking harassment from the police department. You all fucking rock, have a wonderful night.**

My landlord (who is a cop) caught me and my fiancé smoking in the apartment, and we are now getting evicted. I understand why he has to evict us, he's a cop and all, but he treated us like absolute lowlifes and screamed at and intimidated us for a good hour. We have been great tenants up until now- always pay our rent on time, have made repairs to the place, clean up after our dog. I want to leave him this letter when we move out, do you think it is too much? Sorry in advance for the wall of text:


Dear Landlord, 
I will not attempt to deny that what we did was wrong. We knowingly broke the terms of our lease agreement and you had every right to evict us. One could easily argue that your profession obligated you to do so. We took the risk, knowing that this was a possibility. I completely understand your anger and frustration. The righteousness of your actions is not a question for me in the slightest. 


What bothers me about what transpired on that night is the treatment we received. As soon as the topic of marijuana came up we were treated as lowly criminals, losers, “potheads”, immature. I enjoy using marijuana recreationally and medicinally. That does not make me a criminal. 


Let me give you some background on myself for a better perspective. I was born and raised in a working class Irish Catholic family in upstate New York. Due to psychological manipulation, emotional, verbal and physical abuse throughout my childhood, I have battled both depression and severe anxiety for over 20 years. Perhaps I have a genetic predisposition to these conditions, but I cannot deny that my upbringing was a large contributor. 


Regardless, there were positives from my childhood. I was heavily involved in volunteering through Girl Scouts. This fostered a strong sense of compassion and appreciation of differences in others. The situation at home enabled me to hone skills in reading others emotions and understanding their motives, needs and wants.


I left my parents home at 18 and finished my Bachelors in secondary education at 22. I continued my coursework and in a year completed a Masters in special education. The financial burden for these degrees falls on me and me alone. I graduated from my Masters program at the top of my class and received an award for excellence. I managed to achieve this while working two jobs and completing a full time internship at a middle school. I found my passion and calling in working with students with emotional and/or behavioral difficulties. Maybe it is because I see some of myself in many of them. I used marijuana almost daily throughout this time, always after my obligations were finished. 


I have been a special education teacher for four years. I am usually more humble about it, but I am an excellent and dedicated teacher. Special education is my niche and I truly enjoy going to work everyday. I have coached extracurricular activities with no stipend, sometimes giving up entire weekends to travel. I am only reimbursed for gas milage. I arrive at work early and stay late at least 3 times a week to provide extra help for students. Nobody pays me to do this, nobody asks me to do this. I do it because it is the right thing. I volunteer at an animal shelter on the weekends. I continue to use marijuana on a somewhat regular basis. It helps me relax and manage my anxiety. It helps me let go of some of the stress that is a given in my line of work. I love my job and cannot imagine doing anything else, but that does not mean it isn’t horrendously stressful at times. Some days I come home feeling absolutely heartbroken, knowing full well what some of my students endure at home. As an officer of the law, I am sure you can relate to this sentiment. 


I am a responsible user. I do not drive under the influence. I do not talk about my usage with students; I actively encourage them to hold off on alcohol and other substances until they are older and their brains have finished developing. I have never used before work or a school function. I would liken coming home and smoking a joint to coming home and having a beer after work. I do not enjoy the “stoner” culture and believe it gives responsible users a bad name. It undermines the extensive evidence showing that marijuana is no more dangerous or destructive than alcohol or cigarettes. 


That night you told us that marijuana is the “worst drug on the street”. My fiancé was taunted and asked, “Are you an adult?!” You threatened to call my employer and tell them about this incident in an attempt to have me fired. You said, “as a teacher, you shouldn’t be doing that”. I wanted to ask why, but when you have a 6’4, 250+ lb. army reservist/cop standing over you, you try your best to diffuse the situation. You threatened to get a warrant and send us to jail if we had any more in the apartment. Fortunately, possession under an ounce is merely a civil violation, so you would not have been able to do that. I think you know that you basically lied to our faces in an effort to intimidate us. 


Why shouldn’t I be using marijuana as a teacher? Is it better for me to manage my symptoms by having a few drinks when I come home? By going to a doctor and getting pharmaceuticals with horrible side effects? The answer I hear most often is simply, “because it is illegal”. This seems to be the strongest argument against marijuana right now. The stigma surrounding it is, quite frankly, preposterous. There is an abundance of young professionals without children who responsibly use marijuana, but out of fear for their jobs or reputations, they don’t feel safe discussing it with others. They won’t support groups like NORML for fear of being recognized and judged. 


With the legislation recently passed in Colorado and Washington, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the country gets on board with full legalization. Dave Zuckerman, one of our state Senators, has already introduced legislation that would give the state of Vermont the ability to tax and sell marijuana. They do not expect it to pass until 2015, but it is a start. New Hampshire’s House recently passed a bill to legalize marijuana. I doubt it will make it through the Senate, and the Governor has promised to veto the bill, but it is a step in the right direction.


We deserved to be evicted from the apartment for breaking the terms of the lease agreement, but we did not deserve to be treated as criminals. We are not losers or leeches on society. We do our best to improve the community and care deeply about it. 


It isn’t all bad though. Your reaction has inspired me to go public with my support of sensible marijuana legislation. It horrifies me to think that anyone else is at risk of facing that kind of prejudice over a plant. I am in the process of gathering board members for a Vermont chapter of NORML. I refuse to hide or be intimidated any longer. I will do everything in my power to ensure that the citizens of Vermont are well educated on this issue, and when it does come to a vote, it will pass. 


Thank you for your time and for the opportunity. The apartment was lovely and we will miss living here. I wish you all the best and hope you understand that I hold no ill will towards you or your wife.


Sincerely,
Ballsack Avenger"

I love computers and technology, and I'm great with that sort of stuff, but I can't finish my classes at the moment. I am however set to start an internship once I get back in school.

I want to get back into school, but I'm at a point where I really just want to move out and be on my own. I'm good with my money but I don't make enough to easily pay off my tuition and get back into classes. The most ideal situation for me (aside from having school paid now and getting back into classes) would be to move away to Washington or somewhere on the west coast and work for a year or so making decent money, then finish school on the side. I have 3 years of customer service experience, and about 6 months experience in a medical setting (I currently work in a hospital full time transporting patients). I'm basically looking for a job that I could get into with no more than around 6 months of classes/training/etc and no more than around $1,500 spent on said classes.

$28k in 2013 from campus job, internship, signing bonus

~$55k in 2014 as I start working this summer

~$125k to 2015 from my first full year of working (assuming stock units retain their current value and are sold on schedule)

Right now I have $25k in a money market savings account earning 0.85%. It seems like a good idea to start saving early, but I'm not totally sure how the law works. Since this money is post-tax, I should be putting it in a Roth. Do the annual contribution limits start on January 1st, or some other date? It would be nice if I could put money in for 2013, and 2014 before I start running into the income limits in 2015 and have to deal with a backdoor roth. Also, it would be one more early year of tax-free growth. 

Would it make sense for invest in any other way, other than my employer 401(k) when I start working? A 6% contribution will get me a 3% match, no match beyond that.

Will I be able to do a full year's contribution to my employer 401(k) in 2014?

1xeyxl,1,2014-02-09,Trust Issues (Feel Free to Psychoanalyze or Whatnot),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xeyxl/trust_issues_feel_free_to_psychoanalyze_or_whatnot/,"Hello everyone. Forgive me if this post becomes rather unnecessarily long. For those of you who are not interested in wading through my forthcoming rant, I present to you a summary.

**TL;DR: I think I have trust issues stemming from a heart-wrenching breakup.** 

In my first year of university I fell in love. She was an upperclassman student who I had met through a cultural club that we both happened to be members of. We started dating around April, near the close of Spring semester. 

She had her host of troubles, and I certainly had mine - we were both human after all. Her's was a strong personality that led many of our mutual friends to label her ""controlling."" At the time, I dismissed these charges as her ""controlling"" ways were quite endearing to me. 

Needless to say, when one partner in a relationship is seen as making all the calls, then the other is soon to be pitied as whipped. That role fell onto me, I suppose. Though perhaps it would be more precise to say that I relished the role and wound the noose that was lain across my neck tighter and tighter with every act of submissiveness that I had shown to my girlfriend. 

Before the end of the semester, I would say that our relationship was fairly normal. Although these aforementioned qualities were indeed present in our relationship, they were not definitive in the very least. However, as the semester came to an end I found myself traveling abroad to partake in a work-study internship over the entirety of the summer. Stripped away from this newly-formed relationship, I desperately tried to maintain it via a long distance relationship in which I found myself increasingly giving in to her wanton acts. At one point, she made me write out a list of things that I were prohibited from doing. This must sound queer, but at the time I found I merely saw this as endearing. I suppose this must be that cliché situation in which one lives in a state of denial, repressing the negative comments of close friends in regards to one's relationship with another. 

Anyways, this story seems to be going nowhere soon, so I will cut to chase and say that I was kicked to curb a few weeks into the following academic year. This girl had been my first love and the first woman I had ever known. Is it strange that I would have such deep feelings for her? 

I realize at this point that this sounds like the case of a girl dumping an obsessive guy who does not give her any breathing room. I certainly agree with this judgment: over the summer our relationship had degraded into one where I tried to appease her and make her smile at every waking moment. From answering her multitudes of messages (Facebook Mobile is an amazing app btw) while frantically working and staying up every night to answer her skype calls from the States, I was running myself ragged and miserable trying to keep our relationship afloat so as to restart it the following academic semester.

Though I guess the habits that were ingrained in me over the summer did not die out and I might have been suffocating her. To be honest, I do not know. Perhaps I missed the cues in her body language or something, but she had never clearly indicated this to me so any speculation on the subject is merely that - speculation. 

I was dumped for the reason that she was busy with her studies as she had entered into a prestigious business program at our university. Understandable. Except she started seeing another guy right after she broke up with me. I was of course, bitter, but it's not her fault if she came to like another guy. We were both human after all. 

It's strange for me to say this of myself, but I think I am quite dense. Perhaps there were indeed signs that this break up was coming, but I had not seen them. It felt as if all the wind was taken out of my sails. I remember feeling empty and yet having this peculiar feeling of needing to vomit.

Anyway, the next week or so we chatted and I made a fool of myself asking, or should I say begging for a reason. Why? Or rather... How? How could this happen? I thought things were going well for us? Did everything this past summer mean that little to you? I'm sorry.

It's been about a year since then and I've not wallowed in despair and self-hate. I flirted around with other girls and have dated four others after this personal tragedy. Yet, these relationships were all short-lived, with the shortest lasting less than a night. 

I seemed to panic. Anxiety and stress were all I felt whenever I was with these girls. I felt disgusted when we exchanged kisses and had sex. The smell of their bodily fluids lasting in my dormitory room made me want to vomit at the mere thought. I resorted to spraying febreeze around the room multiple times. 

These girls that I dated were not unattractive girls. Though they certainly were not as dazzling as her. They each had their own quirks that I found endearing and I found myself questioning why I could not find the energy or willingness to date and keep a steady relationship. In the end, I would always break things off suddenly and vaguely, blurting out some incoherent reason such as that damned line: ""It's not your fault. It's...me..."" 

Stupid, really. Most of the time that line holds the exact opposite meaning. I don't like you anymore so I want to break things off. But this idea of ""not liking something anymore"" is an internal feeling, no? So perhaps, it is really me.

That is the conclusion that I have rambled thus far to attain. Utilizing those good-old internet psychology pages, I find myself questioning whether or not I have commitment or rather, trust issues. Has the pain of that first love made me weary of opening myself up to others? Perhaps. I certainly do not want to date, if that is any indication of anything. 

I've lost a lot of friends and I've made a few girls cry. It's a horrible feeling, really. Emptiness, yet again. I don't want things to last this way. I too want to find companionship. I fear however, that with the way things are, I cannot. I will not. 

Thanks again. Have a lovely day. :)"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[In your opinion, is there an irrational fear of nuclear power in society due to the widely known possible disasters? Should we be able to comfortably invest in nuclear power, or is it just another wasteful way of destroying the planet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfahjep?context=5)|I think its something that is a hell of a lot better for the planet that burning coal.
 |Just look up the injuries and deaths related to nuclear power versus the coal industry.
 |Coal kills a LOT of people.  The nuclear industry has a safety standard that is second to none.  But the average person has a visceral reaction to ""nuclear power"" that is currently preventing us from making use of this energy source.
 |I personally think (and this is a non professional opinion), that the solution in the immediate future is nuclear as a baseload, and renewables such as solar and wind as a supplement.
 |Every method of energy is consuming resources of our planet.  As a technological society, we're going to consume it.  I think we should do so responsibly and efficiently, as not to use it without purpose.
[How exactly safe is the stuff you handle? How is it sealed? Do you ever fear the side-effects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfagca1?context=5)|If there was no protection?  The transuranics that we handle are highly radioactive.  But the facility, despite being old, is extremely well shielded.
 |Much of our work takes place through 3 foot thick windows filled with zinc bromide solution, and we have remote manipulators to perform the work.  We do absorb a lot of dose, but its never been anywhere close to dangerous levels.
 |When the fuel is loaded in the cell, its placed in a lead container (we call them lead pots).  Its a 1 gallon cylinder.  That is placed in a 7 gallon can, with a apparatus to ensure its centered in the can (called a spider).  This entire process is required to be filmed, and have two witnesses besides the tech doing the work.  Its sealed, and then two of those cans are passed through a drop chute into a larger 30 gallon can in a clean transfer area (this passes from inside the cell to the outside).  The 30 gallon cans have two layers of plastic, a hard layer and a soft layer.  These are also witnessed by two people to ensure our paperwork is straight.
 |Then, the 30 gallon can is dose rated, and either put in to a steel cask, or a lead cask, depending on the dose rating (the lead ones are really annoying, due to being too heavy to drive around on our electric lifts... we have to use a manual one, and muscle it into place.  Major pain the ass).
 |Once they're sealed in the casks, we transfer them to the waste mechanics.  After that, I'm not involved in the details.
[Can I have some nuclear material? (Just kidding, NSA, clam down\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfajpun?context=5)|Yes. Go buy a bunch of bananas.  There is radioactive potassium in them. :)
[Did you lose your hair from the radiation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfag9va?context=5)|Haha, no.  Combination of stressful school and boat life (I started losing it at age 21, which I thought was rather unfair at the time).
[Edit: and have you tried the build your own stirfry in the cafeteria yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfag9va?context=5)|I shave it, because otherwise I look 15 years older.
[Yep. Totally unfair. Source: I'm an old guy with lots of hair. Sorry. VERY interesting post. Thanks much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfb0eru?context=5)|Haha, don't worry about it.  I got over it years ago... roughly when my gf and two of her friends spent a good 30 minutes rubbing my head and cooing. :)
[ANSWER THE QUESTION OP!! OR ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING ABOUT NUCLEAR BUILD-YOUR-OWN-STIRFRY???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfb3s23?context=5)|I don't eat at the cafeteria, so I dunno. :)
 |Maybe I should give it a try?
[Cooing while head rub. Getting the razor now! TIL.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfb0jhl?context=5)|To be fair, that was roughly six years ago, and I was in *fantastic* shape.  Your mileage may vary. :P.
[Is the fukushima nuclear disaster gonna destroy the west coast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfaj2x9?context=5)|No. Absolutely not.  Its a economic disaster, not a human disaster.  It'll cost a lot of yen to make it right, but its no threat to anybody no in the immediate area (much like any other industrial accident).
[1\]  Where do you think the Fukushima cores are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfaqlka?context=5)|The cores?  They're inside the reactor buildings.  I understand they're deformed, but they're not going anywhere.
[2\]  How do you think we will end up getting them out and stored?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfaqlka?context=5)|I imagine very carefully, very slowly, and with a lot of remote equipment.  I understand the same company that made our robot is making stuff for that area as well.
[Thanks and good luck in the Hot Cell!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfaqlka?context=5)|Disclaimer: I'm not speaking about Fukushima in any official capacity, and certainly not speaking for the Lab in any capacity.
[I wish you were right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfasera?context=5)|Well, I am.  The amount of stupid commentary and misinformation spouting on that incident literally makes my blood pressure go up.
 |May I ask your qualifications to comment on nuclear contamination issues?
[Actually there has been barely any commentary or any information about it in the mainstream media.  I don't need any qualifications other than common sense to know that you are a corporate meat puppet.  The fact that you state that this a concern for finance and not environment says enough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfb2ajt?context=5)|Well, if you refuse to listen to people who actually have experience in the matter, and only listen to people who spout your pre-conceived notions, you're going to have a rough time with reality.
 |But since I've got coming on 7+ years in the nuclear field, and you're.. some random mook on Reddit, I'm sure your opinions are just as valid as mine.
[*Of course I can't provide proof. Honestly, its a stupid question, so I'm going to give you a stupid answer. Do you have any proof its gone anywhere?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfbczdq?context=5)|And to find out a private company is engaging in a PR campaign to downplay their screwups?  Shocking.  I've already said that I'm not impressed with TEPCO, but any industrial setting that is mismanaged is going to be bad news.  Not a problem unique to the nuclear industry.  I'm not an expert in metallurgical science by any means, but considering the core catcher concept is suppose to be for a catastrophe, I imagine its designed to hold out for an extended period of time.  I also, for what its worth, can't find any sources that say Fukushima has one.  I did a 30 second google search, so take it for what its worth.
[Yea, I'm just some mook on Reddit. That sums it up.  Have fun in your left-brained prison.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfb6nh0?context=5)|If you have something to contribute to the conversation, go ahead.  But if all you have are vague doom and gloom moanings, and baseless accusations...
 |I'm very sorry that you seem to have an issue with facts that contradict your assumptions.  That's not my fault, nor is it the fault of the facts.   
[Aside from not quite knowing what this much solid lead, I was wondering if there are any safety precautions I should take. I don't handle the lead for obvious reasons, but I've sometimes wondered if it was once used to handle toxic or radioactive substances. I've assumed that if I keep them out of reach and don't handle them then there isn't any real hazard (after all, the point of them is that they contain hazards\), but I thought I would run it by you since you were here! One of them I painted (to avoid atmospheric lead\) and used as a door-stop for awhile. A problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfahomo?context=5)|You should be fine, I would think.  If that was released from a facility, there is probably at least three or four sheets of paperwork needed to do so.  Or it was never used for work (I think this is more likely... I can't imagine a used container being free-released).  If you're worried, I'm sure somebody at the physics department at the local university has a meter so you could be sure.  I very much doubt its in any way dangerous (except just, you know, being lead).

 |We track our dose in milirem, but its easy to convert.  Our yearly dose limit is 10 mSv. I know radiation tends to scare people, but its really not as bowel-shockingly dangerous as most think.
[Do you track your exposure dose by TLDL or a resettable pocket dosimeter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfaitvl?context=5)|Both.

 |I think in the past, our limit was actually higher due to the work, but right now, its 1000 mrem.

 |It was used for metallurgical experiments on new and used fuel elements for years.  But its old, and its crapped up, and I think they want to demolish the building.  So it has to get cleaned up and everything.  At this point, we're literally waiting for paperwork so we can relax criticality controls. (we basically have next to no fuel left in the cell, but there is plenty of stuff that is just crapped up that has to be safely removed).

[Okay, serious question. What's the most highly radioactive item you have felt with in the lab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfajtw2?context=5)|Well, I never handle it directly.  Even when we wheel the casks out, its got quite a bit of shielding between me and whatever we're moving.
 |I know that the smaller cans, if we get a reading higher than ~60-70 R/hr, we have to call to get permission to load it into the large drum.   And for really spicy items, we have to get the lead casks, vice the steel ones we normally use.  (yes, we do call screamingly hot items ""spicy meatballs"".  I think I watched The Mask right before I started this job).
 |That kind of radiation, unshielded for an hour, would cause radiation sickness.  Remember, our YEARLY dose limits are 1000 mrem/yr (or 1 REM).  We'd smash through our limits in a minute if we stood next to a 60 R/hr item.  So we've got very effective shields.
[Since Fukushima, I've been trying to get my head around the different radiation measurement systems... Am I right that 1 REM = 1 / 100th of 1 Sievert?  Or is this one of those ""well... there's effective biological dose, and then there's the mathematical actual dose, and then there's another kind of thing nobody who didn't go through the Navy nuke school can actually understand"" kind of things?  Sounds like REMs and Sieverts are oranges and oranges, whereas there's a totally different meaning to the gray.  maybe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xdvu2/iama_technician_who_disposes_of_nuclear_materials/cfb3pjn?context=5)|They're equivalent.  100 REM is 1 Sievert.  Sieverts and Rem are measurements of radiations effects on the human body.  Grays is more about the raw energy of the radiation.   But radiation has different effects based on what type it is, and what its hitting.  Sieverts and Rem take that into account. Or so I understand.  I'm by no means a health physicist or a physics doctorate.

 |There are others, but I'm not involved with the shipments after they leave the door of our facility... there are waste mechanics on site that process the casks for shipment elsewhere.  On site, we have an old test reactor, and the casks are stored there behind the reactor shield until they're shipped off site.

 |Radioactivtiy is caused by an atom's nucleus being unstable.  Usually because it doesn't have enough neutrons, or has too many neutrons.  Or is just too big.  There are some complex concepts about the strong and weak nuclear force I'm going to skip over.
 |This means that the nucleus is going to emit something to cause it to be more stable.  That can be anything from just shooting off a neutron, shooting off an electron, or shooting off a couple protons and a neutron.  The particle they emit is the radiation. Various atoms emit these at various energy levels.  Higher is more dangerous, because they're moving faster.
 |Also, some atoms decay very slowly (when you hear about something having a long half-life, this is what they mean). So they slowly bleed off radiation. It tends to be less energetic, and less dangerous in the short term (because its not constantly emitting stuff).
 |Others decay very rapidly.  Which is good, because they rapidly become non-radioactive, but while they are, they're shooting off a LOT of stuff. Can be very intense.  (Iodine-131 is a great example... its very energetic, but it also decays completely away in a matter of weeks/months).

The closest thing would be when we were doing a pouch change (when we move cans from inside to outside, we have to put a new pouch on the drop chute, and then push the old one off... its sealed after the last drop).  When we did that, we were getting the new pouch on, and the old one slipped off despite the o-ring.

1xfu64,0,2014-02-09,Im a (M24) asshole who cheated on the best thing that ever happened to him gf (F22),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xfu64/im_a_m24_asshole_who_cheated_on_the_best_thing/,"I met my girlfriend working for the Disney internship program. We were 

together for 3 months before her program ended and

she had to go back home and i stayed for another 2 and a half months 

without her.We decided to move in together after my

program ended.


A few weeks before she was to move down here , she saw a high 

school friend she was in love with in a park at 3 am (she was

honest about seeing a guy not the love part). She told me they ve 

never been together because he s in the air force and she

didn't think she was good enough for him. The guy told her he had 

feelings for her. It wasn't till she moved here that she told me

she loved the guy.


In Miami she was miserable , hated her job , hated the people , the 

traffic,Everything.

The reason i went to disney was to have fun and have the college 

experience i never had. At work i start to notice their s a girl

who likes me. Didn't really pay attention to her , not my type and i was 

hanging around another girl at that time.

I meet my gf in a club and we start to hang out. We were official a 

week or two after we met. But my roommates throw a small

party later that month and they tell me to invite girls. So i invite my 

coworkers and they also bring the co worker who likes me .

We all start drinking and dancing and suddenly im kissing the coworker. 

We kissed a few times that night ( i felt terrible after ,

my ex cheated on me with a friend and i always thought cheating was 

the most disgusting thing ever) I was tired of being the

safe guy , the nice guy. Then 2 or 3 weeks after that we kissed again 

at work.


Throughout my program nothing else happens with this girl or any other 

girl. The co worker found a bf and i had my gf. Her bf

did cheat on her and she started talking to me more at work and 

through text late in my program (her program ended before

mine). I have zero feelings for this girl.


My gf tells me about the feelings about her guy friend and i freak out . 

When i get mad i don't really scream, want to talk , or get

physical. What i do is just ignore the person until my anger passes.So 

she doesn't get the point of being honest with me if im

gonna treat her like that. I was really great full she was honest with 

me.

I receive a Facebook message from the co worker saying how much 

she loved me , and that she wishes that we would of been

single when we were in the program because she felt that i was her 

ideal guy and that we were similar and stuff.


So the coworker texts me from time to time about school and parents 

and stuff like that , occasionally the drunk texts about

wanting too be with me. I pay little attention , she s 2000 miles away 

and it felt good being appreciated when my gf told me

about the guy friend. My gf tells me about the guy friend and packs 

her bags a few times and i start texting my coworker more and get 

flirty with her. I was so upset my gf was going to leave me for another

guy.But then my gf said she chose me and has no feelings for her 

friend.

.My gf finds out i was texting with her and tells me to stop texting her. 

So i do tell my coworker to stop texting me , even though she does 

send me a handful of texts, it wasn't anything like the texts before and she got bored because i only texted her one letter or one word

answers and she told me i suck and she also sent me group holiday 

messages.


We r still having some problems because she hates miami.

But things get a bit better , a few hours before new years she tells me 

she loves me and that she wants to stay. We go back

home make love and i start to get a few happy new year messages. I 

open it in front of her not thinking much of it . But one

reads ""Happy new year can't wait to see you"". My gf gets furious. I ask 

what she meant and she responds I want to see you but

my gf doesn't see this message.After that night i promised to cut all 

contact with the coworker. I told the coworker i wanted zero

contact from her , so I erased her from FB and my phone.We kind of 

work things out , but then she tells me that she got in

contact with her guy friend after she saw my co workers text.

I forgave her and right when i was taking her to the airport she tells 

me that they had talked about getting together . I got

furious and ignored her the whole way. (she went back home for a 

week to visit family). While she was their we patched things

up. She told me she wasn't gna see him. When i pick her up from the 

airport she tells me they had breakfast together and

talked. I got angry and had a huge fight that night.

Again we make up and demand she erase his fb and number which she 

did.


We decided to move back to her town. She s in Jacksonville and the 

plan was for me to meet her their and then drive together to

her town. I was suppose to go Friday . But she called me wednesday

saying she wants nothing to do with me because the

messaged the coworker and asked if we ever did anything and the 

coworker said we did kiss and i had told her i had feelings for her. My gf had asked me that very same

question like 5 times , And i always said no. She said she would have 

forgiven me for it but i was too ashamed and afraid she

was gonna leave me for it. She s the most important person in my life

, theirs no way i would have cheated on her if i was nt in Disney in my 

college experience mode. I Love Her , she brings out the best in me. 

She told me that if she doesnt ever talk to me or see me again she s 

ok with that. She doesnt even want to be friends because ""why would

i be friends with someone who i dislike as a person"" . She said that i 

wasted a year of her life. It pains me so much knowing i hurt the best 

thing that ever happened to me.


TL;DR : Im an asshole who cheated on his gf with  a coworker. And 

kept on lying to her about it because i didnt want to lose her. I love 

her so much . I dont know what to do ? Everything reminds me of her 

and she wants nothing to do with me."

1xfzmn,1,2014-02-09,Feeling stuck,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1xfzmn/feeling_stuck/,"As the title suggests, I am feeling stuck. I am stuck in an endless loop, a rotary of problems with no exit. 

My life has had its ups and downs over the past few years. I’ve struggled since childhood with weight/self-esteem issues, and throughout college I’ve had to deal with my mom’s declining health issues. Just a short background, my mom had a stroke during the summer of ’09 (I was a sophomore in college). I would go home on the weekends to help my dad around the house since I lived close enough to home. Finally in the summer of 2012 after I had graduated, she had major brain surgery. I almost lost her, but luckily she lived and is back to a slightly independent state.

A few short weeks after her surgery, I received an internship offer across the country and decided to take up the opportunity. I moved out for 6 months to Florida and absolutely loved it. I gained new friends, lost 30lbs, gained financial independence, new awesome surroundings, and basically started my life over. However, I always had guilt for not being with my family and for not being next to my mom during her therapy. She was well-taken care of by my father, but the guilt was still there. That’s why I chose to move back home once my internship ended. I could have easy stayed, working a close-to minimum wage job for a while, but I left.

Which leaves me here, feeling stuck a year later. I am currently living at home with my family, financially independent, grabbed a full-time job in the Fall, but still left empty and unsatisfied. I left behind that ‘new life’ and the opportunity to continue working for a dream company because I felt that I needed to be at home with my mom and dad for support. 

My current job leaves me drained at the end of every day- there’s always something wrong or passing blame onto the “lesser” people in the office (ie. Me). It is mentally draining to say the least. If I don’t have to stay and work overtime, I go home, make dinner, then I go to sleep. My line of work isn’t related at all to my degree and I find no passion in what I currently do.

When I come home, you can smell the stress and anxiety in the air. My mom, who is now finished with therapy, can’t really talk or express anything. My dad and I are her main caretakers. I feel guilty when I cannot understand her and get upset when my frustration skyrockets. I have no control over my emotions and I shut down easily. My dad is depressed the same way I am. We both have a look of defeat, and have guilt riding on our backs for feeling this way. 

To make this a little shorter, I have such an urge to move away. I crave my independence back, especially since I’m in my early 20’s and my life is that of a 50 year old. I miss working for the company in Florida too, although the compensation wasn’t anything to boast about. I miss my friends, the sunshine, my physical health, and the adventures I would constantly be on. One of my friends has an apartment vacancy in March, so the opportunity is there. But I’d be trading my income, full benefits, health insurance, and job security for what seems to be a great opportunity/financial suicide.  I would instantly feel regret and guilt when I leave my dad behind to take care of my mother alone. Just thinking about his mental health in all this upsets me. 

I honestly don’t know what to do.
I guess I just need some general life advice. My support system dwindled away since it’s been almost 2 years since my mom’s surgery- everyone suddenly isn’t as attainable for comfort and my friends seem to have their own issues, that I can’t even talk to them about it.

I need to get away from it all."

The problem is, I don't feel like I have a lot to offer a real company. Yea, I've taken some programming and system architecture classes. (CS 1301,1331, 1332, 2110 and now 2200) but I don't feel like I've learned much in the way of applicable skills. Also, nearly every job lists qualifications for either libraries and technologies that I've never heard of or never used. That, or they only seem to want candidates with previous experience (I've only every worked in retail).

So how did you go about applying for an intern/co-op? Do you just ignore their qualifications and apply anyway? What happens if I somehow land a job and have no idea what I'm doing when I get there?

I'd like to hear from another CS student, but I'd be glad to hear about experiences for other majors as well."

I interned in Biology research labs at Temple University, the NIH, Merc and University of Toronto from the age of 13 until 19. The last internship was after my freshman year of college. After spending enough time with Ph.D's who were in their 30's and doing another post-doc (and getting a D in organic) I decided that I wanted to pick up some skills that would be useful outside of the lab and I switched from Chemistry to Statistics with a minor in Computer Science.

Every job that I've had since then has been some sort of programming/software development/web dev role. After doing that for about two years, I applied to grad school to a software engineering program. I'm like to focus on data mining/machine learning to put my Statistics skills to use.

I already know that I don't want to be in the Engineering type of roles forever and I'd eventually like to move into more Sciencey and R&amp;D type of roles. How difficult/easy would it be to move into bioinformatics with my type of background? I've done plenty of Bio/Stats/Programming but all of my professional experience since graduating has been in software development."
1xgnbx,1011,2014-02-09,The day that TiTP leaked...,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1xgnbx/the_day_that_titp_leaked/,"Hello again FatPeopleStories! Nutritionist here!! 

I promised more stories and today I was reminded of one of my favorite humorous ones so I needed to share it here. But first, some introductions! I've worked at the same hospital for 3 years now (2 employed, 1 as an intern) and so there are the same cast of reoccurring characters. 

~Me: Known to my co-workers as ""Kyo"". Registered Dietitian, relatively new to the job. I'm also relatively young as I graduated from high school and college a year early. I'm no genius, I was just a hard worker and got sick of school^ tee hee. I'm 5'6"" and 135 lbs. I also do personal training on the side.

~Dr. B: A dear dear friend of mine who is a newly hired doctor at the hospital. He is an FtM transgender and is completely transitioned, aka he ""blends"" perfectly and you'd never know he was transgender. He's 6'0"" and around 195 pounds; aka, a buff hottie. (Literally, every woman in that hospital has her panties dropping.)

~Dr. Johnson: An attending. He is diabetic and a total sweetheart. He's dedicated his whole life to curing diabetes and helping people from developing it. 

~Hayley: A heavier nurse, but the sweetest and most intelligent person you'd ever meet. She wants to lose weight to be healthier to have a baby, but it's hard for her with the long hours of nursing. She has absolutely no fatlogic, but weightloss is mentally hard for her. Completely understandable. She's a new client of mine. 

~Benjamin: MALE NURSE. He's also a personal trainer with me and takes care of the patients in the ""Obese hall"" where I'm stuck on a daily basis. He's 6'2"" and around 200 pounds. He does amateur body building on the side. Aka, has no life between nursing and bodybuilding. 

~Ms. Jade: Our receptionist for the front hospital desk. Very sassy black woman who don't need no donuts. She's tall and slender and beautiful, but also doesn't take shit from the people who come into the ER/hospital screaming. 

~Dezzy (aka Sunshine): My boyfriend/fiance. He's on the heavier side and like Hayley has no fatlogic what so ever. He is just way too attached to Pizza, Beer, Pasta and Pretzels. He's a mechanical engineer and coaches kids lacrosse in his free time. He's around 6'4"" and 250-255 pounds. 

And ~Hayden: A skinny male nurse who has literally no tolerance for obese patients. All the doctors understand this so he usually trades off for patients ""that are actually worth helping"". A little harsh, but that means Ben and I get more people to help. 

So ONTO THE STORY:

One day I was called to the front by Ms. Jade and handed a folder for a female patient who was just admitted for strange heart palpitations, abnormal sudden weight gain, frequent urination and numbness in limbs. 

My heart dropped, it had to be Type II diabetes. I glanced quickly over to her sheet; she was only 35. A wave of sadness fell over me. I went to deliver the folder to Hayden so we could go see her before either Dr. B or Dr. Johnson came in to formally diagnose her. 

Hayden took one look at her folder and scoffed at me. 

""Look at this, she's a monster."" He pointed to her weight. 

I sighed, ""Give her the benefit of the doubt, would you? She's probably got diabetes, and gained weight, became depressed, gained more. You know how this works.""

He rolled his eyes, ""You're too nice. If you were a nurse you wouldn't be this understanding. Sometimes they need tough love."" 

There it was; the ""hypocritical"" oath. Honestly it never happened to me except with Hayden and a couple of nurses in my first year. They think that since I only had to obtain a bachelor's degree, take an internship and take a test to become accredited, that I was the scum of the earth and thought I was a nurse myself. I had a good feeling in my gut about this patient, that she could be helped and reasoned with. 

I shook my head and made a beeline for Ben. 

He was standing right outside a closed door, shaking his head.

What did that mean? Ben was always so chipper.

I handed him the folder and whispered, ""What's up Mr. Schwarzenegger?"" 

""Fuck this whore."" He hissed in my ear. 

""Please don't leave, pleaseeeeeee Ben,"" I begged. He was always my partner in crime. I needed him for this. He's a gold medalist in combating fat-logic. And it was obvious this woman had fat-logic. 

""No."" 

He had never been so angry and stern. At this point I couldn't even imagine why everyone got to this patient before I did and hated her. 

Luckily after a little cajoling and begging I got Hayley to help me. She took the folder and walked into the room to talk with the patient. 

I waited a bit, because nurses take all the vitals, etc, etc then inform the patient that a doctor and a nutritionist are going to come see them, especially in forms of sudden weight gain/loss. 

Hayley left the room with a big smile on her face. ""She's a sweetheart, you'll be fine."" She patted me on the shoulder. 

I couldn't help but smile, I KNEW someone had to have an objective opinion on this woman. I took a deep breath and entered the room. 

The lady was bigger, about 5'4"" and around 210 pounds if I remember correctly. She had fake red/purple hair and cute cat-eye make up and red lipstick. I swear it's exactly how I now picture every single fat activist in one stereotypical person. She had a pencil skirt on and a sweater covering a loop neck sweater (I know none of these are probably what they are called. I live in sweats and scrubs so fashion isn't my strong point.) 

She smiled at me and shook my hand. We'll call her Donna. 

""You must be the nutritionist, I'm so happy they called you in here.""

My heart lept for joy. She was going to make it!!! 

""I am, call me Kyo, I'll be your nutritionist while we figure out what's wrong with you and how to fix it."" 

Her smile stayed constant as she calmly informed me, ""Oh, I know what's wrong with me.""

I stopped. Hayley couldn't have diagnosed her... so what? Had she already seen another doctor and was coming for a second opinion?? 

""Um,"" I couldn't help but be dumbfounded, ""So, um, what exactly is wrong with you??"" Super professional, right? 

She literally didn't stop smiling, ""I have hypothyroidism. There's no way that I would be gaining this much weight on my current diet."" 

At this point I could feel all professionalism flying out the window of the room. Why was she at a hospital then? And where did she get these symptoms? Where did she get this conclusion? Was she really diabetic? She didn't look or act or behave like the traditional untreated diabetic patient. This whole time she hadn't gone to the bathroom? Something didn't add up. 

I took a deep breath and continued my questions until Dr. B could come in and save me. 

She got more and more insistent on her being right and loved answering my questions like I was an idiot who knew nothing. My patience was wearing thin^ teehee.

Finally, she flatly told me, with that fucking smile still on her face, ""Perhaps I could see a real health professional.""

I almost snapped and killed her. 

And just when I thought that I couldn't take it any more, the wonderful and handsome Dr. B came in to save the day. See, Dr. B is a handsome man. He's got dark hair and bright blue eyes, and has a perfect amount of stubble on his face. His eyebrows are thick and he's just gorgeous. Normally women patients are quiet around him because he's just ""too beautiful."" (Direct quote from Man Nurse Ben.) 

He smiled and smacked down his copy of the file on the desk. 

""So what seems to be the problem Ms. Donna?"" He commanded such a presence that her smile was wiped off the face of the planet. (no pun intended) 

""I-um, well, you see,"" 

He cut her off with a hand in the air. ""We're going to test you for everything, to see what the problem really is. Now, please cooperate and tell my dietitian here what you eat, how much you eat and what your exercise is like. I'll be taking blood and sending it to the lab. I suspect you may have Type II diabetes.""

She turned bright red. ""Th-there's no way!"" 

He snapped his head to face her, ""You were admitted in saying that you had heart palpitations, abnormal sudden weight gain, frequent urination and numbness in limbs. These are symptoms of diabetes, and with your weight-- well, I wouldn't be surprised.""

Apparently that struck a nerve with Donna, and before I even knew what TiTP was, it leaked. The dam fucking burst. 

Her jowls started flapping and spit went everywhere as she exploded with her ""perfect diet"" filled with ""salads and fruit"" and how she was ""healthier than all her skinny friends"" and that ""her numbers on her tests should be perfect"" and ""she was just naturally fat"" and ""weight loss was impossible unless she literally starved herself"". 

At the end of her spitting rant, I probably looked like an owl. I literally had never heard that many excuses come out of one person. 

Luckily Dr. B was my rock. He sat in disbelief with his hands intertwined under his chin until she stopped spitting. 

""Well, if you insist on all of this--"" he shook his head and sighed, ""The outcome could be much more severe.""

She looked scared.

""What do you mean?"" Her tough girl act was gone, an effect Dr. B usually had on people. He had horrible bedside manner but like fuck if he couldn't get people to be honest. 

""We'll have to keep you here a few days for more extensive testing. Hypothyroidism is no joke, but if your diet is really this healthy, and you are active, it could be something much more serious and we need to get to the bottom of it, so you can continue to be healthy.""

She swallowed hard. ""Um, well, I...""

""Unless you're lying to me...? But I doubt you would do that."" He looked down from his thick glasses directly into her fucking soul. I was scared for her. Dr. B had never been anything but nice to me. I couldn't imagine feeling his rage. 

She looked frantically around the room for some act of someone to save her. 

I looked absently toward the wall. I couldn't handle the obvious one sided war that was going on here. 

Dr. B stood up and took his folder. ""Well, if that's the end of your concerns, I'll go get your tests to the lab. We should have answers for most things in a couple of days."" He flashed her a winning smile. ""Hopefully we'll have you out of here in a couple of days."" 

I had never seen a human being look so defeated. She knew that all those tests were going to come back negative. She knew that all those symptoms if she even had them were a result of her obesity. She knew. And that's what was so sad about it. 

Flash forward 3 to 5 days: Surprise surprise, everything came back negative and Donna was sent home with a huge bill for pointless tests and a defeated ego that she wasn't a special snowflake who knew everything about medicine, but in fact an obese woman who had some thinking and working out to do.

I hope you enjoyed this!! "

I have owned this business for the last two years and the next summer will be my 3rd season of mowing lawns. However I started to attend college and have run into a couple problems already. I go to Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston for computer networking since my real passion is for computers and technology. However I own this small business and for my school I have to do a full time internship in Boston. I will have to start in two years so it is in the future but I was just curious what I should do with my business. I have invested a good amount of money into my business due to needing a lawnmowers, weedwackers, leaf blowers, a truck and a trailer. I have put around $8,000 into my business. I also have 9 consists clients, and I have many more awaiting for the next season. However due to my internship I will not be able to run my business in two years. I was thinking about selling the client list and equipment together or I don't know if I should hire one employee to mow all the lawns and pay him hourly and take the remainder of the money. I believe this will create a lot of stress since I will not be in the geographic location of the business and I do not know the quality of which the lawns are being maintained. 

I really love this business, even though my passion is computers, their is nothing like working for your self and making a salary for yourself. I do not know it is worth keeping until I'm out of college. If I do, I believe I am looking at a lot of money to be made because  everything I have purchased for the business has been paid off and everything I am making now is basic profit except for gas, depreciation, and insurance. Also I have added a lot of client for next season so I should be making around a $10,000 dollar profit for next season. I really do not want to sell it but I think it will be too much of a hassle to deal with if I am working a full time job in system administration in Boston. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it."

I majored in a type of communications which was obviously a huge mistake, seeing as in America you're only ever actually hired if you're part of the STEM master race. I've tried everything. Had my resume and cover letters looked at by professionals, gone to career centers, job fairs, volunteered, everything. I guess I should've just done thirty more fucking unpaid internships so some rich cunt would actually give me a chance to work for a living. Who needs money to buy food when you have all those wonderful unpaid internships, right? I never was even given the opportunity to work. Not even an interview. All the jobs are out of my state and HR fucks just throw out of state resumes right in the trash. I'm tired of it. I've had enough. I have an incurable disease that causes tumors to grow all over my body and makes me look like a deformed creature, which I'm sure makes people really want to be around me. I have no friends, no family, nothing, not a single person that talks to me or cares about me. Every single day I apply for jobs and write cover letters all fucking day, wait for the phone to ring (it never has, not even once), and cry and drink myself to sleep every single night because of the stress, the loneliness, the physical pain of my condition, and the hopelessness. I'll never have a job. Ever.

And if I don't get a job soon I'm killing myself."

I am a Junior, Majoring in computer science, and I have a few questions. 

First is, I work 20 hours a week while going to school, and my GPA isn't as great as it should be. Right now it is at a 3.06. What can I highlight, either in person in an interview, or on my resume to show that I have a good understanding of the concepts I have been taught? 

Two, 
How would you try to ""close"" with an Amazon Representative or someone else from a large company, to get  an interview? 

Next, 
What are some good ways to prepare for interviews? what should of questions should I be preparing, what should I be studying extensively. (I understand that any knowledge up tip now in my academic career is fair game, but what have you noticed is asked a lot?)

Lastly, if you are a software engineer, what do you most look for in hiring an intern? 

I will also say that, for the 5 or so companies I will really be trying to court, I have been studying their glassdoor.com interview questions, and what the people who got offers did, and what not to do (the people who received no offers). Do you have any other tips?

I hope I haven't rambled on too much, and I hope that my Amazon goal doesn't sound too ambitious for someone with a semi-poor GPA. Thank you for any help posted.

I graduated school a couple of years ago with a degree in business and focus on finance and accounting. My gpa and internship experience were great,but Unfortunately, I was not able to land a job in the finance field although i did land interviews and superdays at various places.

Based on this, I took a job at a big 4 in the audit practice. I knew i didn't like accounting, but i took the job because:

-I needed a good salary in order to pay back my student loans.
-The company looks good on your resume
-I never had any accounting experience, so I figured it couldn't hurt to have experience in public.

I've been trying to transition to something less accounting related for about a year now but no luck.

Currently, I am studying for level one in June,I always wanted to take the CFA earlier but because the audit practice doesn't pay for it, I always hesitated. I figured passing the CFA exams would show recruiters and employers that I am serious about getting a job in the field.

What are your thoughts,  Do you think passing the exams can help me transition out of accounting? 

Many thanks for taking the time to read!"

I could use your advice,timeandspace11,NewOrleans,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1xhegu/will_be_interning_in_new_orleans_over_the_summer/,"Hey everybody. I just got an offer to intern in New Orleans over the summer in a practice area I am very interested in. The job is in Mid City. 
I just have a few questions.

Basically, I am looking for living arrangements. Living in Mid City would be ideal. I will not likely have a car by then so I would like to live near transportation.  I would like to keep my rent at $850 Max. Living alone is desirable but I am not at all opposed to having roommates. I would also like to live in a neighborhood that is relatively safe and has access to bars, restaurants, and a good nightlife scene.

I have been looking up places online, but basically everything seems to be focused around Mardi Gras right now, so I am having trouble finding what I want. Do you think Mid City fits the description of what I am looking for? If there are any other nearby neighborhoods with access to public transportation that you would recommend feel free to let me know.

The internship is from the end of May to mid August so I am trying to start my search now. I'm really excited for the opportunity and any insight you have to offer would be great. Thank you!"

I have owned this business for the last two years and the next summer will be my 3rd season of mowing lawns. However I started to attend college and have run into a couple problems already. I go to Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston for computer networking since my real passion is for computers and technology. However I own this small business and for my school I have to do a full time internship in Boston. I will have to start in two years so it is in the future but I was just curious what I should do with my business. I have invested a good amount of money into my business due to needing a lawnmowers, weedwackers, leaf blowers, a truck and a trailer. I have put around $8,000 into my business. I also have 9 consists clients, and I have many more awaiting for the next season. However due to my internship I will not be able to run my business in two years. I was thinking about selling the client list and equipment together or I don't know if I should hire one employee to mow all the lawns and pay him hourly and take the remainder of the money. I believe this will create a lot of stress since I will not be in the geographic location of the business and I do not know the quality of which the lawns are being maintained.
I really love this business, even though my passion is computers, their is nothing like working for your self and making a salary for yourself. I do not know it is worth keeping until I'm out of college. If I do, I believe I am looking at a lot of money to be made because everything I have purchased for the business has been paid off and everything I am making now is basic profit except for gas, depreciation, and insurance. Also I have added a lot of client for next season so I should be making around a $10,000 dollar profit for next season. I really do not want to sell it but I think it will be too much of a hassle to deal with if I am working a full time job in system administration in Boston. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it."
1xhq63,17,2014-02-09,"[M/23/USA] This is my life, and it's ending one minute at a time",[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1xhq63/m23usa_this_is_my_life_and_its_ending_one_minute/,"So, I guess in a way, I was a really sheltered kid. Always kind of a loner. Never played any sports in school, and generally spent most of my days inside in front of my gaming console. I always felt like this hindered my social development as a human being, and I felt uncomfortable in different or new situations which lead me to turning a lot of people down. When I got a bit older and started going through puberty things got worse. Now girls were in the equation.

I remember the first girl that I had a thing for, I guess we'll call her Mandy. My friends had asked me if I was into anybody, and I always lied to them and told them I was into Mandy's friend, Jackie. Over time, that became my reality. Eventually, I asked Jackie out and she said ""yes"". Of course, this particular story has no happy ending. The raging hormones and general social anxiety lead me to chicken out and attempt to try to reconcile, but choked whenever I got near her.

That awkward experience was one of many to come for me. I was raised in a Catholic household so up until a certain point in high school I was raised to believe that there was some mystical being that died for my sins and was generally looking out for me. Eventually high school rolled around, and I met a girl that completely changed all of that for me. See, I learned to play a guitar freshman year and met a kid who asked me to be in his band. Well, my friend promoted the shit out of that band which lead to me being contacted by a girl (we'll call her Lindsay) that lived about an hour away from my house during my senior year. We would message each other on AIM for hours at a time, and I got to know her fairly well that way. She challenged my beliefs and made me think of things from a different perspective. I had eventually come to the conclusion, coincidentally after seeing Donnie Darko that I really felt that I identified as an agnostic. Eventually, the topic of relationships came up as she told me an anecdotal story about some kid spilling his guts to her that he had feelings for her. She had told him that it was too bad because she was into somebody else. At this point my heart sank, but she had then revealed that it was me.

So we planned a day to hang out. This was more difficult than it sounds as I had a part time job at a local grocery store, and my parents were pretty damn near NSA level on me growing up. Also, the news that it was my grandfather's 80th birthday party was on the same day that she and I decided to hang out. I said ""fuck it"" lied to my parents that I was working and hung out with her all day. It should also be said that this girl was moving away before the month was up. I spent all day with her though, doing cutsey 'We're into each other' type of shit. The night ended, and I got a sweet good night kiss with some hardcore tongue action, which, as it turns out, was my first kiss. This story doesn't end very happily either because in the weeks following that she messaged me that she loved me, then the next day proceeded to tell me how she's a terrible person and that I should probably forget everything she said.

The rest of my senior year sucked. I graduated and went to college in Central Florida where I met a bunch of new people. We'd hang out, smoke, play Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart, and life was good. All the while there were girls that I probably could have made a move on, but didn't because I was a scared piece of chicken shit. My one friend, Thomas, on the other hand would get with girls like it was nothing, and then have them call me after they finished having sex. Fucked up, right? Anyway there was one night in particular, the night of my 19th birthday, where we went out, drank and then I called it a night. Well, my friend called me at 3am and wanted me to go to this girl's apartment with him that he met at the club. Fine. Long story short, I ended up in the apartment above the two of them while they were getting it on and watched a guy get punched in the face for stealing some guy's beer. I never ran so fast in my life and all the while my friend was getting laid. Twisted world that we live in.

So after a year and change, I transferred to a school in Philadelphia that was closer to home, not because it was closer to home, but because it was actually better for my major to be there. I wasn't happy about leaving Florida, all my friends were there and now I had to make new ones. Transferring to a new school is hard. You don't have that group of friends that gels together after orientation, and the people in your classes already have that established group. I was also pretty introverted and shy so I had that working against me. I did get to meet one of my best friends, Andy, who I ended up rooming with the semester I transferred. There was another kid that we lived with named Connor that was cool at first, but after a while and a LOT of drama failed out and we lost contact with him. Probably for the best because he punched Andy in the face.

So, life continued. The supermarket that I worked at had since closed down, but I ran into one of my managers at another store in Southern New Jersey. I got a job there and life was lonely, but good. It got me enough to live off of in the upcoming semesters and I had a whole house to myself. I was once again faced with the problem of finding friends since I still was not of age to drink.

The following fall semester, I had an interesting experience with a girl named Jessica. I had made out with her one drunken Sunday night and was really into her. I tried to start something with her, but she said that she wanted to be friends. And yet, she let me kiss her after that. She had been stringing me along a bit and one night it was made apparent that there was a third party involved. It was around Halloween and she showed up with some guy. Now, we were nothing at this point in our experience together, but that didn't stop me from being extremely jealous. One night at a party, I blew up on her because I was insanely drunk, but I felt that I had to prove a point. I left that place and barely talked to her again.

Coincidentally, Andy and I lived in an apartment for a year that was right down the street from her place. It was beyond weird. Life continued though. I got an internship turned part time job. Andy did the same, and we'd hang out on weekends. Meanwhile, a friend of mine from high school, Geoff, would come visit every so often, and the three of us got to be pretty good friends and merged our social circles.

My last semester of college I spent in Los Angeles. It was a part of a study away program aimed at my major and I wanted to do it so bad because this was the moment my entire schooling career had built up to. Working in the mecca of the industry that I studied so diligently. As you could probably imagine, I hadn't made many friends in my major because of my atrocious social skills. So I was limited to square one. All of the kids in the program seemed to really gel together and sometimes I felt like an outcast, but there were legitimate times that I got along with everyone. It was awesome and everything that I thought it would be, at least at first. I had two internships that were particularly taxing, and on top of that I had classes that I had to attend. The traffic didn't help. I had secretly harbored the hope that one of these two internships would turn into something more, and that I would get an offer at the end and get to stay out there and live there. I talked with a producer for one of my projects for that semester and he gave me some advice that was basically ""if you want to make it in this industry, you have to be here.""

However, this story doesn't have a happy ending either. You see, my roommates, whom I had come to be very good friends with, had both secured jobs and were making plans to continue on living out there. They had asked if I wanted to be a part of these plans and I wanted to, but my money had been running out, and my 6 week job hunt had turned up nothing. I was left with no other choice than to turn back and go home, and abandon the very sage advice that the producer had given me.
My dreams shattered, I began the drive home and contacted my old boss to see if I could get some work in the interim. He told me that my old hourly position was filled, but that I could work on budgeted projects as a freelancer. This on top of my already destroyed ego because of my lack of success in securing work in L.A. put me in a very dark place. I spent most of the Christmas holiday drinking myself into a stupor and moping about. Over time, I came to accept this disappointing change and have somewhat adjusted to it. The only thing keeping me going is knowing that all I have to do is make enough to go back and try again.

So after 23 years, I have experienced and continued to struggle with my severely lacking social skills which, as a result, have kept me from reaching any real satisfying relationship. I was late learning the essentials, and looking back I can see just how lost and emotionally frustrated I was. In addition to having the social skills of a 13-year-old, I have never experienced sex, nor do I see it happening anytime soon. My two best friends now have girlfriends, and I sit in a corner with my own shadow of failure. While we're on the subject of failure, let's talk about how disappointing it is for me to work in the mecca of my industry across the country and be passed along at the tip of a hat to essentially be cast back home.

As I look out the window and see the mountain of snow in the driveway of my parents' house, I count the days until I can scrape together enough money to go back and try again. I've accepted that the job that I am pursuing is a lonely one, and that the ratio of men to women in Los Angeles is 6:1, but I cannot accept not giving a proper shot at my dream before succumbing to mediocrity."

This is her situation, and I was reading through it, because the post seemed similar to what I'm in, just there are some stuff different.

So full story on my end...

I had a short summer internship just the past summer of 2013, with a pretty small company. (Talking, 6 people at most. Because the manufacturing was all done in China. It became five about a month, or maybe less, into my internship when one of the guys left because he got a re-offer from a company he just left.) I was paid biweekly, the same schedule as the other employees from what I can tell. I was asked on the first day of my internship if filing me as an independent contractor was fine (he threw in 1099 at some point in the conversation as well); I immediately said yes, because really this was my first internship and I didn't want anything to go wrong.
Near the end of this stint, they sat me down and told me they would like to look for someone else to work for them during the school year, citing one of the main reasons was because I had no technical knowledge under my belt.
No hard feelings, I understand. For such a small company, they need someone that already has some experience and don't exactly have the manpower to sit down with me to teach me from their basics. From my standpoint, the drive isn't exactly a short one and the traffic was bad so I would be late to any classes I would be taking in the fall quarter if I tried to rush back.

So fast forward to now, FAFSA's deadline is fast approaching. (Yes, some people say you could turn it in past that March deadline, but I really want to make it to their 'priority' deadline.) Mom calls me up, and reminds me I need some papers from the company before she can go to our CPA to start the filing process. (For those wondering, our family owns a small business, so a CPA really helps speed up the process and minimizes our mistakes.)
This is really my absolute first time dealing with taxes. (yeah, whoops, last year of college, and I don't know anything; I shall remedy that soon.) So she tells me she can either give my pay stubs to the CPA or, ideally, the 1099 paper from the company.

Unfortunately, my last (third) paycheck was right on the last day of the internship. There was no paystub-paper attached to this third check I was handed. I kept the paystub-like portion for the first two checks I was given, but there was nothing like that for the third. And I for sure know I don't have the third paystub mysteriously laying somewhere because (like I said, never really had to deal with the taxes myself) anything that involved money and was printed on some form of paper, I immediately handed that to my mom the first chance I got.

As I type this up right now, I'm going through my online statements to find when I deposited said checks.

So I e-mailed the boss of the company last week on Thursday with the following, but still awaiting a reply:

&gt;Dear xxx,
&gt;
&gt;Happy Chinese New Year! May the new year bring in an abundance of good health and great fortune!
&gt;
&gt;I hope you are doing well! I was curious, is there a 1099 that I can pick from your office, or an electronic copy that can be sent to me?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for any help and time!
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;xxx

I was going to call him tomorrow, and hopefully get an answer. If no one picks up, drop by for a surprise visit on Tuesday to ask in person.

I guess, to prepare for myself for a worst case scenario, what should I do? Worst case scenario, meaning the boss doesn't pick up the phone on Monday and he's not in the office on Tuesday. (I really hope the place has not closed; their website is still up.)

And if I'm understanding correctly, I should be paying the appropriate taxes out of the paychecks I received right?

Thank you so much for any help and advice, in advance!

So sorry for the long post! (I tried to include details so there aren't any strange gaps to my story.)

EDIT: I guess the reason why I posted this up, and panicking a little, is because I read (in the thread I linked above) that the company can technically file late on February 14th? Should I wait that long, or should I bother them now? I do want whatever-papers-I-need to appropriately file ASAP, seeing as FAFSA's ""initial awards"" deadline is March 2nd. I've never missed this deadline, and I've always gotten the appropriate amount of financial aid I need; I don't want to mess that up in any way."

A few months ago I had a phone interview with a company near me for a Software Developer position and I absolutely blew it.. I thought I had prepared for the interview, researched the company and the tech they use.. but the first question was ""Tell me about yourself"" and.. I blew it! I didn't really say much about my current position (Software Engineer for 1 year) or experience, and my friend who was listening to me said he thought I made it sound like I was still an intern.. The recruiter said that they were looking for someone with more experience and he'd keep my resume and contact me when they had more entry level positions open..

I've kept an eye on the company and they have a position open for a QA Analyst now. I'm wondering if I should send the recruiter an email along the lines of ""I noticed you have an open position for a QA Analyst. Last time we spoke I feel like I didn't do a good job of representing myself and my skills. I'd very much appreciate it if you would be willing to give me a shot at interviewing for this position"".

Any thoughts on this? Let me know if you need more info on anything.

1xjl44,3,2014-02-10,I got engaged two days ago and my parents are stressing me out with planning already - how do you keep boundaries?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1xjl44/i_got_engaged_two_days_ago_and_my_parents_are/,"I don't know how coherent this will be, so I apologize in advance! Basically my parents are getting WAY too far ahead in planning and it is stressing me out (I'm 25, fiance is 29). They are also not listening to me or respecting the boundaries that I put up. I'll sum this up in point form:

* when my now-fiance (!!) and I were asking my parents' blessing, afterward my mom was talking about planning stuff. My dad intervened and said it was probably a good idea that my mom can look into stuff, but not tell me about it unless I ask for help or advice, since I am in grad school and working and have a lot of stuff on my plate - I thought that was a great idea, and we all agreed to it
* my mom did not respect this, and was texting me ideas about centerpieces (we were not even engaged at this point) - I asked her to stop and she apologized saying she didn't respect my boundaries
* when we were engaged they told some people that I wanted to tell myself and I got pretty mad and firmly said that they need to respect this process as mine and my fiances, it is our news and it's our thing
* my parents were hurt by this, thought I came on too strong, and said that they will do nothing unless I ask
* I say that a balance can be struck, doesn't have to be overinvolvement vs. checking out - thought we came to an agreement where they are willing to help but respect my boundaries
* this morning I get a text saying that they were looking into some venues and a lot of them are booked up for this year - while I'm in class. 
* I can't deal with this stuff while I'm in class, while I'm trying to line up an internship, and while we've *only been engaged for two days.*
* I want my marriage to be clear that I am starting a new unit and I feel like if the planning goes on like this (not that it's even started) that will not get through to my parents
* yet I want my parents to be involved, because I see marriage as something as part of a community, and I don't want them to withdraw completely but holy crap how do I get them to listen to me 
* I have tried to nip things in the bud and be clear, but they do not seem to understand how texting me throughout the day is stressful and how we have completely different views of what kind of wedding we would want
* I don't want this to be a source of stress for me and my fiance as we both very much want a low key wedding, and this is why we don't even want to get into all this planning now and take things at our own pace and just enjoy this season, and prepare for marriage
* I also want them to be involved because I know I will need help - how do you strike this balance?

I hope these were not too disjointed - has anyone else had to deal with this? How do you navigate these relationships? I have tried to start things off clearly, but they are just not respecting my boundaries and I in no way want them to think that they have authority or this much sway in my marriage, if they can't deal with me taking wedding planning on my own time."
1xjqly,1,2014-02-10,Marketing Strategist Internship Interview - Need advice!,[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1xjqly/marketing_strategist_internship_interview_need/,"I am a sophomore in college and I've been applying for summer internships. The other day I had a phone interview with a start up company that does business development, marketing, web development, branding, etc. They contacted me saying that they would like to have another interview, this time in person at their office. 

The part I need some advice about is they asked that I create a fictional marketing campaign to present to them as part of the interview. The instructions are as follows:

*""Additionally, we would like you to prepare a fictional campaign to present during your interview.  We are giving you complete creative control over this project; however, you should remain under a 15 minute timeframe.  This campaign will not be considered based on your marketing and business prowess, but rather on your creativity, ability to work under pressure, organization, and communication skills.  Instructions:
1.       Go to our website and research either our company or any of our clients.

2.       Select one company.

3.       Create a pitch centered on a product, service, concept, campaign…etc and be ready to present it in under 15 minutes.

a.       Your interviewers will be your “clients” that you are trying to pitch e.g. at the end of this meeting you should ask us if we are willing to sign your “contract.”*

I have very little experience in marketing, and so I am wondering if anyone has suggestions as to how to go about this. Some ideas I've had so far:

-social media marketing (linkedin, facebook, twitter, etc.)

-create/update company website 

-promotions to incentivize awareness&amp;consumption of their product/service ('like' us on Facebook for your name to be entered in a drawing for a free ___)

-creation of a logo, slogan, etc.

-YouTube and Pandora advertisements

-booths with information and promotions at events (sports games, festivals, etc.) at which a significant number of members of the target audience will be present

-radio advertisements

The thing is, they gave me a couple days notice before the interview, so I'm not sure if building a website/designing a logo/creating a social media marketing campaign is even doable in that time, or if that is even what they are looking for.

Have I totally misunderstood what they are looking for here? I would ask them but I don't want to appear to be ignorant, indecisive, or needy.

If anyone could point me in the right direction I would be very grateful."

She goes to school 5 hours away, I live and work near our home town. Most of the first year we spent together, eventually ended up in a LDR due to her schooling. and though we've had our rough patches, things have never been better. We were both happy, excited for the coming months, and moving forward.

Until a few nights ago. Lately, at my work, I've been pushing myself harder. There's a corporate meeting that my manager had nominated me to go to. Representing my franchise and managing group. A **huge** thing for my career, meeting the right people, shaking the right hands, just a big opportunity to work towards a better future. I never went to college after high school so something like this is even bigger for me. Someone my age in my industry wouldn't be doing much but sitting at a desk taking orders. More than that, I suffer from PTSD and a huge fear of mine is being somewhere i don't know. I've never traveled, and i've never felt strong enough to go. I want to go while I feel confident enough to go. &gt; *I can prove my PTSD wrong*

Also, the added benefit of a paid flight/hotel/rental car to go out there. Spending nearly a week in another city. Something i had never thought I would be doing. 

The only downside, it conflicts with the dates that she would be home and plans for a serious night out. Something we've been planning since christmas. 

I didn't tell her about the possibility of the trip, for the sole fact that if i didn't get it, i wouldn't have to worry about not being here on one of the short infrequent occasions that she gets to be home. It also could conflict with our plans. I wouldn't know if i'd be home the day of, or the day before. But during a conversation about how much i've been working, I let it slip that i was nominated to go. I wanted to go, but i was one of 10 assistant general managers that were nominated for my hospitality group. I said ""the probability is small, I won't end up going."" 

&gt; *Yes seeing as we've been planning this since september. Did you honestly forget about me coming home for spring break*

And follows an argument about her lack of support and the fact that i feel she thinks a broadway show is more important than my future. Taking a turn towards trying to make me feel guilty. 

&gt; *it breaks my heart to think you'd willingly miss The Lion King* 

&gt; *It doesn't matter anymore you've made your decision*

And after countless explaining about not knowing how long the trip back would be, nor how long i'd be stuck over there, I gave up and said, I'd turn it down to stay home for the show. Telling her that I was appalled at the fact that she believed some show was more important than an opportunity to go. Even then, something not set in stone. 

&gt; *Alright, I'll go to the play with someone else.*

Right there I got upset, saying ""I supported your decision to be a state away and not seeing you for months at a time, your decision to look at internships across the country, and being away for even longer and you can't support me on this? I support you and understand you wouldn't be home for certain holidays and dates and you can't be supportive and understanding that I'd be missing an event that can be seen other dates?""


The following day I was notified that another manager from another city was chosen to go instead of me. Sure, it sucked, but that just means i have to work harder next year. I left her a message saying I didn't get the trip, that i'd be home for the show. That all that fighting, all that guilt tripping and stress on our relationship was for nothing.

It has now been a couple days since i've talked to her, she messaged me last night wanting to talk, but i still have no idea how i feel about her reaction, or her attitude. Do i really want to be with someone who won't support me and turn to childish immature guilt tripping to make me stay? Or even then, choose to just make plans with someone else. 

Am i better off just calling it quits and moving on? Do i want to keep someone around who tries to manipulate me with guilt? Is a 2 year relationship worth saving if there's no support. I have to look out for my future, my mental health and my career. I can't support someone if they don't support me. A relationship is a two way street, right?


---   
**tl;dr**: LDR SO reacted horribly to the possibility of me going on a business trip conflicting with a broadway show. She tried to manipulate and guilt me into staying. I ended up not getting the chance, and haven't talked to her in days. The way she reacted hurt, and is forced me to decide whether to stay with her or leave. I have to look out for myself, my career and my mental health. Should i continue on and try to fix things or just be rational and talk to her about her emotions. and hope that she'll be supportive in the future?"

1xk13l,14,2014-02-10,Beginning to hate myself again because I am a 23 year old black disappointment. (suicide trigger warning)(Long as hell),self_throwaway123,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1xk13l/beginning_to_hate_myself_again_because_i_am_a_23/,"My six-month software development internship ended January 1st.  

Before that, I was let go from my job at a tech support call center.  The period of unemployment between those two positions had me feeling more positive than the one I’m in now because the tech support job was stressful.  I wasn’t dealing with it the way I should’ve been, especially still carrying the stress from getting my bachelor’s.  This stress reached a high enough level to where I attempted to take my own life in the January of last year.  After getting to the point where an easy movement would’ve done the deed, the frenzy roiling my mind subsided and left me with lots of fear and confusion.  

For the first time, I was afraid of myself and checked into a psychiatric ward.  The experience there was enlightening for I met people from all sorts of different walks of life who had ended up in the same place; most with different issues.  Given medication and let go, I went back to work determined to find something better.  The job I had was temporary.  I needed to pay bills somehow.  About five months later, I was let go because I had a moment where an irrational client pissed me off.  I was used to this, and it wasn’t the worst, but my reaction was to cry, punch things in my cubicle, and imagine I was strangling the life out of this idiot on the phone who had managed to delete his class’ roster on the day of finals (I will go as far as to admit, to this day, I would like to find the guy and tell him everything despite none of this being his fault.  A deeper part of me would like to stab him in the face, though).  I was let go gracefully, which is why I don’t refer to it as me being fired.  My manager was courteous and had a legitimate case against me and my tolerance for the stress the job came with.

Unemployed, I felt a weight float off my chest as I looked for jobs that caught my interest.  I ended up landing a software dev internship about two months after being let go from the tech support gig.  I was happy, elated, and on top of the world.  I finally landed something relevant to my interests that wasn’t a job an abused monkey could do.  However, this gig grew boring.  The first half of it was fine with me doing menial tasks like tracking bugs and reporting to the actual developers (I was with the QA folks so I suppose it wasn’t so much of a Software Dev position).  After expressing my interest in coding, I was allowed to help with test automation which was done in Python.  Seeing as how I had taught myself some fundamentals of Computer Science with Python using resources like Udacity, and how I had taken some CS courses back in college, I figured I would be fine.  I told myself showing interest and initiative would pay off in my favor.

Turns out I couldn’t write the scripts necessary.  Having to learn the api required to do the work was fine, but using the system setups while adhering to the team’s configurations stopped me.  Then I began to just show up at work, hoping no one would say anything to me, then leave.  Sometimes I would ask for help, and I’d get it for simply setting up little things like the virtual machine I was working inside or simply downloading a particular library.  When it came to talking to the system to do the actual work, I was lost and the most help I would receive would be to go to a basic tutorial page about the specific library I was working with, which didn’t have the depth reflected in the work I was assigned to do.

So the work didn’t get done.  I eventually was moved on to learning how to set up and configure virtual machines on a Windows and OSX environment, which was neat.  I got to spend time alone and away from the team, which had begun to irritate me from how quiet and meek they were, how they would always talk with their heads down, with no fun allowed and had a haughty know-it-all attitude that I willfully succumbed to for the sake of getting paid and having actual experience.

Now I’m here, writing this up, about a month after my internship ended.  I didn’t get any job.  There were no openings, but with how I was treating the opportunity I had and how there were no openings for someone in my skill level, nothing happened.  I’m at the point where it’s easy for me to forget what day it is.  The morning often passes me by and I wake up in the afternoon.  All income is gone except for whatever comes in when my taxes are complete, and if I get my unemployment claim approved.  There was a brief fad where I figured I wanted to be a web developer, but now just visiting Hacker News pisses me off because the level of knowledge and skill needed to be anything in the field is beyond my capabilities.

Everything I feel like I do is half-assed.  I can’t finish anything.  I can’t hold onto a job, and now I’m considering applying to a bank because the job may be easier than what I was doing in my internship.  This makes me feel pathetic because I feel I’m taking a step backwards in the progression of my life, but at the same time, going forward sucked because I felt like I wanted to either kill myself or kill everyone around me.  All the while, I simply can’t do what it is I want to do because I half-ass those attempts to.  Example: I like to write fiction, yet I have no complete story.  I can definitely show off a ton of incomplete works and first paragraphs of an abandoned idea.  I want to make a videogame?  Sure, let’s start something and never finish.  Also, what about that whole idea that making videogames is just a dream that goes nowhere?  It’s just a desire every manchild like myself has.  I even let go of my girlfriend because I couldn’t hold interest in her; I broke us off before I began to resent her.

So, if anyone reads all of this, I really appreciate the effort slogging through.  I don’t think anyone will though, honestly, and I can’t say I blame them since this is all a problem I have within myself.  Perhaps I should visit my therapist and psychiatrist again, just to do it and to get a better perspective on things than my current one.
If there is any positivity from the time I was at my internship, it was the volunteer gig I did in my free time.  I was part of an after school program teaching kids how to build and program the Lego Mindstorm robots.  It was neat, but I do know any interest in helping kids academically is not a way to go if one wants to make a decent living.  Besides, teachers are treated by shit by students, the higher ups, and helicopter parents.

Fundamentally, I’d like to create stuff to entertain folks, but sometimes I wonder if I have the maturity to do it considering how I’ve been floundering around my whole life without making any sort of effort for the most part.  And now I’m getting pissed at seeing some white woman on reddit sleep in her bed with a baby tiger.  If there was ever a candid photo of privilege, that would be it.

And now I feel like I’m just bitter.

EDIT: Broke it up from being the wall of text it was before.

Since my sophomore year, first semester, I have been trying to get internships. I have been very unsuccessful in this, and have not yet gotten an internship.

Here is what I have to ask. 

* What are good ideas for personal projects? And are they necessary?

I don't have any grandiose ideas for things to create, and I also work a lot during the school year, so I don't really have a lot of time for personal projects outside of coursework

* how necessary is an internship for finding a job after graduation?

I know it is important - Which is why I have been trying to get one, but am I basically killing my chances of a career in CS without getting an internship?

I am getting very disheartened, and I feel like I have no future in CS. Going to a internship fairs and getting maybe one interview, then getting rejected can be discouraging. It also doesn't help that time seems to be running out, and this next week or two is my only chance to get an internship before I graduate.

My university is not well known but has a 100% hire rate for the major (expected, I guess).

However, being an international student, I am reasonably worried about being hired. I've had no internships or off-campus work so far (and won't be able to until next Spring because of a silly visa mix-up). So I have a few questions:

- Can anyone in a situation similar to mine give some advice?
- I've heard that getting sponsored is more likely with a Master's degree, how true is this?
- Which companies are known to sponsor visas? Is it only Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc.? Does this make it much harder to get hired by them?
- I've heard people say things like don't tell your employer you'll need sponsoring until the time comes. I don't understand this strategy. Wouldn't it be better to ask them straight up? In the end if they weren't going to do it, wouldn't they just fire you?
- Does Facebook take in international students for summer internships? Do you think I'd be qualified to apply for next year's?

Thank you for any responses!"

With all this political upheaval, this place has become an unsafe work environment. This naturally makes people wanna leave, and being the facility that it is that is impossible. 

Due to the Top Secret nature of this place, No one can actually leave here without being killed. The people in charge of the facility see this as a lost cause because no one can get their work done anymore. So they plan on shutting it down and reverting it back to a time when the facility was more profitable for them. That means Everyone in this facility will be killed, because We can't be left alive knowing the top secret stuff that we do.

If we wanna keep the facility the way it is right now, we gotta make the facility profitable by 2 days or else, well we die...

We currently live together and share a lease and a dog.

Our relationship was always great up until this summer. I graduated from university and got a job in my career field as he entered his senior year of college. He left for the summer for an internship and we saw each other really frequently. We signed a lease and adopted the dog within a month of each other.

Soon after he moved back home though, school started again. He was incredibly busy with his senior project and a club that he is president of. During this time, we both are busy and I'm understanding of his situation. However, we both start fighting a lot around finals/Christmas time about anything and everything. He starts to complain a lot about time that he ""has"" to spend with me. For example, he pitched a fit about having to go to my office christmas party with me when I had asked him to go with me about three weeks prior. We patched things up and things were okay.

I feel like the whole cycle is starting again. This time, he has started hanging out with this other girl. She has a boyfriend who I have met, so I try to tell myself that she's just in a similar situation to him schoolwise and that's why they are hanging out so often. He's started inviting her to hang out with us during the one day a week we have to spend together. However, she has bought him some really nice presents and she's making me uncomfortable.

It all kind of culminated when we had sex yesterday morning and I started to cry after. I told him that I felt like our relationship had no spark anymore, and that he was spending more time with this other girl than he was with me. He left to go to his club meeting and I pretty much dwelled on it all day. Last night, he pretty much told me he was trying his best. He didn't actually make any promises about ceasing to hang out with this other girl.

I have asked him about four times now to try to invest some more time in our relationship, or at least to try to give us some more time where it's just us two. His graduation is three months away. I don't know if I want to wait until then to see if things will change, or if I even want to move with him if a job calls him to a new place. I'm sorry if this seems short... I've got a lot rushing around in my head right now. Help?

##tl;dr: We met, we loved, we tried, we lost, I will miss her dearly and wish her all the best.

---
Almost a month ago, my ex (23f) and I (25m) broke up.

We met in college about 3 years ago and after developing a very intense and involved friendship, we started dating about a year later. She was an international student from Taiwan and I was a guy from the suburbs just north of NYC. We spent a year together dating at the university together before I graduated and moved back home in December of 2012. This was when our long-distance relationship started.

The year was filled with its ups and downs. Being apart after having essentially lived together for almost a year tested our relationship, our trust, and the love we shared. Her graduation this past December became the turning point in our relationship.

Before we started dating, we realized that there were feelings brewing and we discussed what would become of a relationship given the possibility that she may have to return to Taiwan after graduation. We decided that we would make the most of it and deal with whatever hand we were dealt when the time arrived. If she needed to leave, so be it; we would deal with it then if it came to that. Neither of us wanted to get married for papers; we wanted to do this by working towards our own stable lives. We slowly began working towards a future for ourselves.

Truth be told, I did not help our cause by starting my year terribly. I took a break for a few months to sit back and relax, not realizing how hard it would be for me to find a job, much less in my own career field. Months passed and the odd jobs I took didn't last. I was in financial limbo, clawing my way to stay afloat. It was a constant source of stress. The feeling of working consecutive low-paying jobs did nothing for my self-esteem. It wasn't until September that I landed a steady job at a factory in another state for just above minimum wage. I was not the happiest, but it provided stability. It lasted up until about December when I left that job to work as a Chinese delivery guy throughout the month of December, a job I still have on weekends. I work a second during the week now too.

Her year was very different. She balanced internships and jobs, all while studying hard to graduate early. She lived a busy schedule. We met just about once a month for anywhere in between three days to a week at a time. Considering what other long-distance relationships have to work through, we had it pretty good. Nonetheless, the distance slowly affected us and changed the nature of the relationship. I could manage, but it was never something she was really comfortable with; we were a dynamite couple together in person and a different couple apart. We looked forward to those monthly visits and always had a blast together up until the moment we had to part again.

The weeks leading up to graduation were stressful. I provided all the support and love I could as finals and deadlines for papers loomed ever closer. Soon, she would finally be able to reap the fruits of her hard labor. To celebrate her graduation, her mother arranged a trip from Taiwan to be with us. It would be the first time I'd meet either parent. I drove us up to school. The week I spent with them at and after graduation was fantastic. We would see her mom off two weeks later and spend the New Year together in my city.

Upon arrival in my city, it was clear that something had changed.

&gt;""Last month, I was sure that you were the one for me. Now, I'm not sure if we're gonna last the year.""

It hit me as a complete surprise. That night, she asked me if I was sure that she was my forever girl. I didn't hesitate answering.

On our last night together, she told me:

&gt;""I wish I didn't have to leave because when we're together, everything is perfect.""""

By the end of her visit, she wanted to take some time to think about things. My heart sank in fear of the worst. About a week of waiting later, the video call came. It started off well; we shared stories of our days apart. She asked if I had done any thinking over the break.

&gt;""I want you to know that whatever your decision is, I will understand and accept it because I know that you'll have thought it through.""

My chest tightened as the conversation led closer to the moment I had been dreading since the break.

&gt;""I spent some time thinking about it and I realized...that I love you...but only as a best friend.""

Heartbreaking doesn't even come close.

&gt;""I want to us stay friends though because I don't want to throw away the years and memories we have had up to this point.""

I felt the same way. I accepted that this must have been a very difficult decision for her to make. We continued talking and even managed a few smiles towards the end. We made plans to chat again soon.

In a separate letter to my mom, she wrote that she and I didn't have the same goals, priorities or expectations anymore and that for her our romantic relationship was at an end. She saw us taking different paths and thanked her for accepting her into our family and for the hospitality she received over the years.

We sent reddit links to each other almost daily just like we used to and sent a few texts back and forth, but that important feeling that we shared was gone. Her absence in my heart was deafening. It was really over. The relationship was  done and gone. She was no longer my girl. I held onto those messages and links because as much as they hurt, they held a certain comfort, a familiarity that made me feel as warm as much as they brought me to tears. I later realized that this was very unhealthy, so a few days later I sent her this message:

&gt;Hey XXXXXX,

&gt;I hope you've been well.

&gt;The messages and links you've been sending me lately have been great and entertaining, but I'm sorry to say that I made a mistake in wanting such casual contact so soon.

&gt;I'm still in a lot of pain and as exciting as every link you send me is, it really hurts. I need some space and time to heal.

&gt;I know this may come as a disappointment to you considering you were hoping to have all of us play League together again soon, but it's for the best that I have time to myself to help me get my emotions all sorted out. Wouldn't want to get into team fights late into a match and have your carry unable to carry on, you know.

&gt;I want you to know that I'm still interested in being friends in the future if you are too; it's just not the right time for me.

&gt;With your web class probably in full swing by now, your job starting soon, your editing position filling your days with awful writing, and god knows how many other things you're planning on throwing yourself into, I wish you lots and lots of success with all of it. Know that I'm rooting for you.

&gt;I'll be working my butt off too. And browsing Reddit.

&gt;Your friend, ElColombo

I must have read through that letter 400 times, trying to build up the courage to send it. It was hard penning it but I understood that it needed to be done. I didn't expect to receive a letter back, but one came.

&gt;I understand completely. To be honest I've been thinking the same thing, but was too stubborn to admit it because I was the one who insisted on remaining friends. I'm sorry that the contact has been causing you pain; you're right, it's still way too early.

&gt;Take all the time you need. When you feel good and ready, I will be here.

&gt;Thank you, XXXXXX

I broke down reading that last line. I still do.

I don't believe I was a very bad man. I struggled with depression from a long strings of consecutive failures. My successes were far and few. But I can sit here and tell you all that I never wavered in my love for her. In my support of her and her goals. In the belief that we could work through these hard times and come out the outer side stronger, together. I tried my best to give her the comforts of family and friends here in the states. In the face of so many obstacles, I really tried.

Now, a month later, I sit here after what feels like an eternity of thinking, talking, listening, crying, and moping to say that as sad as I still am that she is not in my life nor love me anymore, I believe the breakup was the best thing to happen to us. It served as the great motivator to keep improving myself, but not for someone else. I'm doing it for myself now. I came to understand that as we were, we were never going to succeed. I was stuck in a terrible place and she was at a turning point in her life with so many roads available to her. We had discussed getting an apartment together, but we had no end date or solid plans. We didn't cheat, we didn't fight, we were always supportive but the circumstances beat us.

I promised myself that I would only consider contacting my ex not only after I had the financial and social stability I want to have, but can also accept that she will also move forward and do what's best for her, in love and in life. I want to make sure I can be happy for her own success and happiness. Because she deserves it and our relationship was completely worth it. It will be a long time. I will miss this girl not just as a lover, but also as my best friend.

*I had a letter to her here; instead, I wanted to say this.*

Say you love them. Be upfront and honest; your words carry immense weight. Support them not just in their times of need. Be understanding and patient, even when you're the issue. If your LDR stops working and you go your separate ways, be gentle; they're the last memories you'll have of what once was. I've seen these sentiments in loss posts here. They should never be taken for granted. Remember that feelings change, just as easily as distance and circumstances can.

I'm still a believer in LDRs, even with this great loss. It just takes two special people to work through the hardest parts. The success stories here are proof enough.

Thank you for reading."
1xlxku,3,2014-02-11,Sponsored MBA or Masters degree,needscontrast,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1xlxku/sponsored_mba_or_masters_degree/,"Hey there.

I'm still in my undergraduate studies, but I'm looking forward to my first internship at a major consulting from March on.
At recruiting events many firms (especially BIG4) tell you, that if you enter after your undergraduate studies, you might get your MBA or masters degree sponsored at a good university after working there for a few years with good results.

So here are my questions:
1. How often does this actually happen? I guess it's not ""all the time"", how it is said at recruiting events.
2. What strings are attached to it?
3. What do you think is better in the long run? Doing a Masters degree before starting to work and skipping the first ""(Junior) Associate"" level and enter at as an ""(Junior) Consultant"" or start working after my bachelors degree as an ""Junior Associate""?

I hope I expressed myself in a decent way, so you get what I mean.

""March 25th will change everything!"" said HiRez founder and CEO Erez Goren, ""This is a bigger accomplishment than that time Kelly completed a full match of assault without touching her hair.  You know who else has nice hair?  Lions.  We're gonna bring a lion to the release party!""  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smite, for the unfamiliar, is a M.O.B.A. or Mediocre Online Battle Arena.  In this game you choose from a wide assortment of gods such as the big breasted goddess Aphrodite, the fishnet stocking wearing Athena, the half naked sideboobed Neith, and many more colorful characters to awkwardly touch or compare yourself to.  New Gods are released every two weeks unless it snows in Georgia and the whole state goes into a panic.  Smite Gods come in a few different archetypes such as Hunter, Support, Warrior, and Overpowered Bulls***.  New gods are released into the former group and are later fixed after hundreds of angry Reddit posts.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When asked about the release of Smite, Esports Manager Bart Koenigsberg eagerly asserted, ""I don't really know about that but they really need to buff Ymir tho*[sic]*.""  When asked to clarify he responded by playing a video from Youtube in which Willy Wonka informed me that I get nothing.  Then he gently placed his third pair of plastic sunglasses on top of his head and asked if I was ready for patch notes.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smite has been described by some as a League of Legends clone with a different camera angle, but this is merely due to the fact that Smite is a League of Legends clone with a different camera angle.  Smite also presents a wide array of new challenges to the MOBA genre such as skillshots or getting grouped with people around the same skill level as you.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To mark the long awaited release of Smite, HiRez will be hosting a tournament on March 28-30.  HiRez has announced that along with a $100k starting pool, they have released a purchasable skin for the god Poseidon that will increase the prize pool by $5 for every unit sold.  When asked for comment, HiRezKelly, an intern at HiRez Studios and popular twitch.tv streamer exclaimed, ""Almost $175,000 for a pool?  My friends got one in their back yard for like $25,000.  What a ripoff!  I could buy soooooo many hair products with that kinda moolah.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The professional scene could not be any more pumped for the release.  ""I haven't been this excited since I found a pair of Kyary Pamyu's used underwear on ebay!"" said professional Stepmania and ok Smite player PonPonULaLaChingChangWallaWallaBingBang.  Fellow Smitegame streamer Drew ""I can't spell Laissez-faire"" Boyd produced a longwinded and beautiful recount of the evolution of Smite over the past years but I was unfortunately put into a hypnotic stupor by his beautiful gaze.  After a few minutes of questioning my sexuality I was awoken by a ferocious MANMODE cry followed by Mr. Boyd flailing his arms in the air and spilling his giant jug of drink.  Afterwards he made me swear I wouldn't tell his girlfriend Haliegh or he would be in big trouble.  Steven ""Napman"" Zappas could not be reached for comment at this time as he was too busy flexing into a nearby mirror and exclaiming, ""Damn I look swole!""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each day Smite is gaining more popularity on Twitch.tv, a popular streaming site formerly named after pop sensation Justin Bieber.  Smite will sometimes even reach over 2000 viewers at a time, competing with a wide variety of new and glamourous games such as Age of Empires III and Paper Mario.  For $5 you can subscribe to the official Smitegame channel and recieve free online Icons to spam in chat and genuinely annoy anybody over the age of 13.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With the release of Smite just around the corner the internet is abuzz with Smite hype.  I've had the pleasure of interviewing several big name Twitch.tv casters and they all agreed that Smite is a great item that should be used for jungling and getting last hits.  Upon clarification they hailed Smite as ""Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that once.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All in all, Smite is truly coming into it's own.  One day we will all be able to look back at this moment and just say, ""Wow...remember how much money I wasted on gems?  God help me."""

and my surface pro) and still have another of 2010 Office premium license that I can use on my SP1. It seems to me like the 
University deal is very fair, and I do have money per say (but I don't like to spend it unnecessarily obviously). As of now, I haven' found any real reason why Office 365 would be worth it (it seems I can still Sync to Skydrive and Word and Excel have been fine for my usage). The only thing I don't really now about is OneNote, which I really want to utilize; So if there was a major change, I think it would be worth it. 
Open to all suggestions and thanks for any help.

As a note, last time I checked my University used 2010 (I am currently on an internship) so any added value there would be lost (though I plan on mainly using just my two devices only).

**Edit: I apologize for the confusion that it seemed I had, but I am fully aware of the differences between 365 and 2013 (I appreciate your help since I suppose I was confusing). Now my only true question is that Univeristy deal worth it when I have two licenses of full 2010 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, Outlook, OneNote). My thinking is that my versions of Word and Excel should be fine for me (unless they were astronomically better which they don't appear to be), or if OneNote is a good bit improved from the last iteration then I am interested since I feel it can be a powerful tool for the rest of my studies. My main problem is I never used OneNote 2010 and am unclear how the 365 might be better.** "
1xmj49,8,2014-02-11,My University is having a career fair on Thursday. The attire is Business Professional and I've never worn a suit in my life. What do I do!,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1xmj49/my_university_is_having_a_career_fair_on_thursday/,"Firstly, I have done a search for information. Some information was helpful, and I am learning.

I am a business major and I am looking for an internship for this summer. I have a pretty tight budget seeing as I am a college kid so Men's Warehouse might be a serious stretch.

About me. I'm 6 ft 2in, 170lbs. Thin but I have been working out for 2 years now so I have some muscle. I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and i'm white.

I was planning to wearing something [like this](http://imgur.com/jK5oHap). My waredrobe is very limited seeing as I am still developing my fashion sense and I have such little money, but I know I have a sweater and a button up shirt + tie. My only concern is the dress code is ""Business Professional"", which means I need to look like I am on the set of Mad Men. They are saying ""Suits suits suits"", but I don't have any suits!

So now I am left with two days to prepare an outfit. I am considering going out to H&amp;M, seeing as they have clothing that, although of lesser quality, is cheap and decent looking. I am a Business major, so suits &amp; ties are probably in my future. 

It is a lot to ask from you guys, but I need some guidelines. I have spent some time around here and have a little idea of the basics of putting together an outfit. If anyone has any links, advisement, places to shop, ideas what to wear with considerations to budget, lay it on me! Please try to consider that I am on a serious budget. I would be uncomfortable going over $120 (I know!) but I am honestly open to anything, even just learning!!!!!

Thank you so much MFA. You guys are great.

Edit: The career fair got postponed till next week!!!!!!!!!"

Sucks, but I enjoyed what will have to be [my final bone](http://imgur.com/RgJP9fm) for awhile.

This is probably my fourth or fifth time quitting within my four/five year smoking career.  For clarification, they weren't failed attempts—the first few were because my parents caught me (back in high school) and the third was for a job.  Anyway, there's this really odd trend I noticed..

Every time I quit (each of the previous times lasted about 1-2 months), I start getting sick.  For the past three or so years, I generally smoked an average of twice daily through the bong (or vape).  In high school, I usually vaped at least once a day.  And this doesn't mean I didn't get sick while smoking, but it just seems odd that I get coughs and a stuffed nose for *at* *the* *very* *least* a few weeks following every forced t-break.

Any similar experiences or sci*ent*ists that have any idea what's going on?  Could it just be an adverse reaction to breaking a habit?

My Situation: I have some experience with ArcGIS (Map and some GPS data collection) from an engineering internship I did 4 years ago. All of my work with ArcGIS was self taught. I believe I did a decent job using the program and generally enjoyed playing around with it. After graduating, I went out of the engineering field for 3 years to teach and am now transitioning back into it.   
  
My Questions:  
  
1. What good books/training programs are there out there to refresh-build my knowledge with the ArcGIS suite? I used a book before but it was borrowed and I can't remember its title. The education &amp; tutorials filters don't turn up any results here. Cost is somewhat of an issue so ideally a book would be easier or some self paced program.   
  
2. Not being a student any more and lacking the ArcGIS suite itself I know I can obtain a trial copy from the website to play around with. I know some books will include a copy as well (I think?). The new Online component looks like something I don't want to mess with. Are these trial copies useful/decently functional? I'm not expecting the full blown program with all the bells and whistles but something I can re-acclimate with.  
  
3. I use a Mac. Does anyone have any experience running ArcGIS in BootCamp? Along with this could you recommend a Windows OS to install that is not super buggy? (probably not XP as support is being phased out for it)
  
Any advice/experience you can speak to in the above questions would be greatly appreciated and helpful. Currently I am job hunting and want to clear the cobwebs out of the attic before interview so I can speak and work competently when a position becomes available.   
   
TL;DR version:  
1. Any good books / training for ArcGIS?  
2. Are the trial editions good for playing around on?  
3. Any experience with ArcGIS on a Mac?

Specs: 4th Generation Intel® Core™ i5-4200U processor (3M Cache, up to 2.6 GHz)


6GB Dual Channel DDR3L 1600MHz (4GBx1 + 2GBx1)


500GB Solid State Hybrid Drive


Intel® HD Graphics 4400


Thanks 

EDIT: It seems I was unclear in my op.

I am a student. I am not getting a laptop to play games, if I did, I would have gone for the Lenovo y410p. I need a laptop to do portable work. 

That doesn't mean that I don't want to game though. BUT I probably won't play any games more than these:
Halo CE
Team Fortress 2
Skyrim

During the summer, I'll be busy with an internship and Dark souls 2 for the 360.

My concern now is if this laptop can run skyrim well. According to this video, it can: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaWTLoXAcwc"
1xn21n,7,2014-02-11,I'm a lame duck senior in High School (Gotten in to a college I'm looking for) and have a lot of spare time. What should I do with it?,ProbeIke,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1xn21n/im_a_lame_duck_senior_in_high_school_gotten_in_to/,"Alright, so I currently have a lot of free time and I honestly don't have a lot of stuff to do with it.

I was thinking of starting to learn the Violin, as I've always wanted too, but I don't want to start if I'd have to stop taking lessons in a few months once college rolls around. (Are there instrument lessons in college normally? Is it possible to continue that?)

I took AP Computer Science A in sophomore year, but I never actually found out how to program things and /r/learnprogramming wasn't a huge help in explaining how to get back into practicing computer programming again. (Everyone was just saying ""start writing random code!"" but I don't know what to do from beyond there)

I don't have to study much as I have pretty much all A's in AP classes so I don't really know what to spend my time doing. I might get an internship somewhere over the summer but there's still a ton of free time that I want to turn into something productive.

I like space, but I never could understand any of the celestial mechanics textbooks I downloaded since I never took a physics course (Never fit in my high school schedule) and I tried to self-study for AP Physics B but it's incredibly difficult without a teacher to explain it to you, considering it's physics.

So what should I do? What did you do? I don't really party and get drunk or anything, it's just not my cup of tea. So what should I do?"

1xn677,2029,2014-02-11,"The Lost Town of Deepwood, Pennsylvania",The_Dalek_Emperor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xn677/the_lost_town_of_deepwood_pennsylvania/,"When I was a kid my dad traveled a lot for work. Back then, his company was growing exponentially and my father was sent to oversee the opening of new stores all across the country. In 2002, he had a particularly busy year. My dad was assigned to a store in Pennsylvania and, because it was a longer assignment and because it was summertime as well, he decided to take my mom and I with him. 

 
Since we were going to be there for two months, they gave us a fully furnished house in the suburbs. It was two stories tall and at the end of a very lonely cul-de-sac. The town itself was very small, with a little over 3,000 residents, and the suburb where we stayed was even more rural.  


Our neighborhood was relatively new, and most of the houses were still empty. The housing development, Lone Wood, had only just started cutting into the dense forest that surrounded it and all the empty houses gave it a very eerie, albeit boring, feel. 


Lucky for me, there were a few other kids who lived in Lone Wood and one of them happened to be my age. Jamie and I were both 12 and really that was all we needed to have in common. 


We had a lot of fun that summer. Being a city kid, I was eager to explore all the bike trails local kids had made out in the woods. The city of Middlesbrough was a very old town which was incorporated sometime in the early 1800s. The town had tons of history, but nothing really to do. One particularly boring Sunday, Jamie and I even went to the town’s museum. 


It was pretty boring, as expected, until we heard some kid ask an employee about the “lost town”. The employee replied that that was just a legend, but that was enough to pique my curiosity.


I quizzed Jamie about it but he didn’t seem to know much either. It was a full five weeks into the summer before I finally got my questions answered.


Jamie and I were building a bike ramp over a narrow stream late one afternoon when we saw a group of five teenagers boisterously heading out into the woods. They were carrying flashlights and beer, several of them trying to scare the girls of  the group into turning back.


“I wonder where they’re going.” I mused as I glanced over at Jamie. He stood up and wiped his brow. 


“I know where they’re going.”


“Where?” I stood up and dusted the dirt off my shorts. The novelty of living in a small town had weeks ago given way to boredom and I jumped on anything that sounded remotely interesting.  


“They’re looking for the Lost Town.” He sighed regretfully.


“Okay, seriously, what is that? I knew you know more than you let on. I need to know Jamie, I need to know!” I shook his shoulders in mock hysteria and he stumbled for balance.

“ Alright! I’ll tell you, geez, Katie!” Jamie picked up his bike and started walking down the bike path. I grabbed mine and followed him.

“The Lost Town is just a dumb legend.  The stories say that Middlesbrough had a sister city nearby, somewhere out in these woods. Then one day, like a century and a half ago, the whole town just disappeared. The people left or died, nobody knows, nobody even remembers the name of the town. It’s like a right of passage or something for kids to go looking for it.”


""Jamie we should-“


“No!” He stopped and turned to look at me. “Some kid went looking for it in the 70s and never came back. They found his body like ten years later in the middle of nowhere. He got lost out there. It’s easy to do, everything looks the same.”


“He was a total idiot! Probably on drugs, it was 70s. We are a totally different generation - we have satnav!“

“Satnav?” He looked at me curiously. Jamie had lived in this 
town his whole life and sometimes I forgot how sheltered he was.

“Satellite Navigation? My dad has a GPS that he totally wouldn’t notice missing for a day. Come on Jamie, it’d be so much fun!”

“I’d better get back.” Jamie looked at his watch and then mounted his bike. “My dad is taking me to a movie tonight.” 

We rode in an uncomfortable silence until an idea struck me as we rolled over the abandoned train tracks. They were old and almost buried by plant growth. 

“Hey… I know you don’t want to talk about it, but has anyone ever found anything?

“No. Well, my friend’s older brother said he found some human bones out there once, but nobody believed him.”

“Oh. And where do people look?”

“Well, almost everybody goes to the lake.” He pointed to the left of us, where we’d seen the teenagers heading earlier. “It’s pretty deep back there but they figure that if there was another town, they would have lived by the lake, so…that’s where they go.”	


“Well, you know what I would do? I would follow the train tracks. I mean, they look pretty old. And I don’t know why they would lay them going back into those woods unless there was something back there, so that’s where I’d go.”


Jamie considered this and then nodded. “Yeah, I guess I could buy that. No one follows the tracks that way, though. That’s where that kid that disappeared went.” 


I wasn’t swayed.


I didn’t bring up the Lost Town again until two weeks later. It was the weekend before we were moving home and my parents had a barbeque for the employees of dad’s new store and some of our neighbors. Jamie and I hung out inside the house and played my N64 while we flirted pretty outrageously. There had been an unspoken sort of mutual attraction throughout the summer that no one had had the guts to act on. Since I was moving home in five days, there really was nothing left to lose. 


Although his intentions were probably pure and genuine, I am embarrassed to say that mine were not. I thought that if I could make him want to impress me, he would agree to go looking for the Lost Town. The legend had thoroughly consumed me. I had been to the local library every morning for the past week looking for more information on the town and had found nothing. But legends don’t just come from nowhere! I was sure of it.


I knew if we didn’t leave by 2pm we wouldn’t have enough daylight to carry out my plan. I already had a backpack packed with water, a flashlight, a camera and a can of red spray-paint. I figured if we left the tracks we would need a way to find our way back to them. I thought I was so clever. 


Nothing in that backpack made a damn bit of difference in the end. I was a fool.	
 
	
I set my controller down and turned to look at Jamie. 


“So…do you want to go out to the woods one last time?” I raised my eyebrow at him and smiled. 


“Yeah!” He said excitedly and he jumped up off the couch. Then, embarrassed, he cast his eyes down at the floor. “Yeah, you know..if you want to, that’s cool.”


“Cool, let’s go!” I grabbed his hand and ran out the front door, grabbing my strategically placed backpack on the way. Jamie didn’t even notice it; he was walking faster than I was.


When we had gotten a decent way into the trees, Jamie turned around and looked briefly at my face before casting his eyes to the ground. He rubbed the back of his neck.


“I’ve actually, like, wanted to kiss you all summer.”


I was stunned to silence, absolutely dumbfounded that Jamie had found the guts to say anything like this. I knew I needed to fill the awkward silence left in it’s wake, so I did the only thing I could think of - I leaned in and kissed him. 


It was the awkward first kiss of two twelve year olds, but it made me feel warm and sent a flight of butterflies swirling into my stomach. So I actually really did like Jamie. How about that?


I let him go and his face was the same shade of red that I imagined mine was. He quickly changed the subject to how long he’d wanted to ask me out but that he didn’t think I liked him back. We walked for awhile carrying on this conversation, him oblivious to his surroundings, me subtly leading the way. 


It took him stumbling over the tracks to break off his monologue and finally notice the backpack. He looked at me like I’d punched him in the face.


“You can’t be serious.”


“Jamie, I know but look, this is the last time I’m going to see you in a really long time and I want to remember today! We will only be out for two hours max; we’ll be back before they even realize we’re gone!”
Jamie stared at the tracks for a minute and seemed to be considering it all. I held my breath until he finally let out a deep sigh.


“Okay.”


“Oh my God, Jamie, I-” He held up his finger, cutting me off.


“But we follow the tracks the entire time and we turn around after an hour.”


“Okay!” I was so excited that I hugged him. It would be the first and last time I ever did.


As we walked, we talked about all sorts of mundane things, stopping only to make sure we were still on the tracks. It felt like we had only been walking for 45 minutes but when Jamie checked his watch, it had been 3 hours.


“That’s weird….it hasn’t been 3 hours. It says its 5 o’clock.” He trailed off.


“I swear, we left just after 2. It’s can’t be 5, dude, your watch is busted.” I gave him a playful shove.


Jamie raised his eyebrow at me and smiled. “Even so, we should probably turn around. “


He wasn’t wrong, the sun was setting. The shadows were long and looking around, I wondered if it really was 5 o’clock. 


But I wasn’t ready to give up just yet. As we had been walking, I’d noticed something taking shape off of our right; a large mass, maybe a quarter mile away. It was denser than the area around it and seemed to have clean, manmade lines. 


“Jamie, look.” 


He turned. “Yeah, I was hoping you hadn’t noticed it. It’s a long way off though; we would never find the tracks again.”


“Yes, we would, check it out!” I triumphantly pulled the spray paint out of my backpack. “It’s for the trees.”


He took the can and shook it, then made an experimental ‘x’ on a nearby tree. 


“Ok, but I get to do the spraying.” I didn’t argue.


The closer we got to the mass, the more it took shape. First we could tell it was a building. Then we could tell it was church.  By the time we got the front door, we were looking at a very old and dilapidated chapel. Remembering my camera, I took a picture of the wooden plaque over the door; whatever had been written on it had long ago worn away. We walked around the church in awe. The building was small, maybe 500 square feet. The windows were, surprisingly, all in tact but were so caked with dirt and grime that we couldn’t see anything inside. 


“How do we get in?” I asked quietly.


“I don’t know, but we’re going to figure it out! Wait until my brother hears about this. I mean, holy shit. Look at this place!” His excitement was contagious.


The front door had a pull handle but try as we might, we couldn’t seem to open the door. 


“Do you think it’s locked?” I asked as I watched Jamie struggle with it.


""Yeah, maybe. I mean it must be. There was a door around back, though.”

The door at the back was a lot more sympathetic and let us in with relative ease. We were standing in a small room with an old wooden desk attached to a wall. There was a small fire place and old portraits hung up around the tiny office. The people in the pictures were all standing in front of the same maroon background and were looking down at us disapprovingly. Books were scattered everywhere, most in a language I had never seen before. The floor was covered in dirt and a pair of old shoes were laying haphazardly in one corner.


“Whoa,” I said in awe.


“Yeah, whoa.” I looked over at Jamie who had a huge smile on his face. He was holding up a cross and a piece of paper.


“What is it?” I walked over to see.


“”It’s a list of names. There’s like 60 people on this list. Maybe a town census?”


“Let me see.” I pulled my flashlight out of my backpack and shined it on the parchment. 


“Deepwood. Do you think that’s the name of the town? All these names are crossed out. All except this one.” I pointed to a name at the very bottom. 


“Maybe it was the plague.”


“You think it’s a list of the dead?”


Jamie shrugged. “Makes as much sense as anything else.”


I walked over to the desk and leaned against it. “Why do you think they left? I mean, look, there’s a jacket or something on that chair, and shoes over there. The town pastor or whatever, he just took off and left everything like this?”


“Or died, “said Jamie as he folded the paper and put in into the back pack. 


“Yeah, died… Either way it must have been creepy as hell to be alone in here.” I stared at one of portraits for several long seconds; the young woman painted there seemed to be staring down at me with a very accusatory look. It made me incredibly uncomfortable. 


I was so absorbed in the paintings that I didn’t notice the slow creaking from overhead until the ceiling cracked loudly as it started to cave in. I screamed and covered my head, but the next thing I knew, I was lying on my back over the threshold of a door, Jamie on top of me protecting his head. 


“Ah, thanks,” I mumbled as I gently pushed Jamie off of me. 


“Don’t mention it.” Jamie climbed to his feet and brushed himself off.
I glanced behind him at the office, which was now filled floor to ceiling with decaying debris. 


“Jamie, that was our way out.” 


“That’s ok. We can unlock the front door now that we’re inside. Or break one of the windows.”


If the back office was unsettlingly, the chapel was downright disturbing.


Even though the grimy windows allowed very little sunlight in, I could make out eight rows of pews lining a narrow aisle and a tall podium at the front of the chapel.


Jamie and I stumbled around the small nave breaking windows on either side with pieces of wood we had found. The sun was still setting and I wondered how much of a difference the muted light would make. When I broke the last window on my side I turned back around to survey the chapel, disappointed that the lighting wasn’t much better. The room itself seemed to repel light.


The wooden pews were completely rotted. In fact, the wood we had used to break the windows of the church were leg stands from the front row. The narrow aisle in between the rows of pews was littered with leaves and rotting wood. But that was nothing, nothing compared to what sat upon the alter. 


It wasn’t a podium, as I had thought earlier. It was a statue of the crucifixion – but unlike any I had ever seen before. The paint had been worn away on every part of the statue – except the blood of the crucifixion wounds, which stood bright and realistic, and seemed to be oozing before our very eyes. The only other surface left untouched by the decay of time was the face of Jesus. The details of his face were still so incredibly minute and perfect, and he had the same accusing eyes as the portraits in the pastor’s office. He seemed to be staring directly at me and I could tell Jamie felt the same, though he was across the room from me. 


The statue’s stare awarded me an edge of panic, and I suddenly realized that we needed to leave. We weren’t wanted here. I had the sudden feeling that we were trespassing on some sort of hallowed ground. We had found the church, we had documents proving we had been here – and now it was time to go. 


I turned to Jamie to tell him so and could immediately tell that he did not share my feelings. He had been born and bred on these legends and nothing was going to tear him away from our discovery. I watched him walk over to grab the camera out of my bag. He took pictures of everything he deemed interesting, including the crucifixion statue, much to my unease. 


I gave him several minutes before I said something.


“Jamie, I think we need to leave.” I said in a low voice.


Jamie stopped and looked up, seeming to remember I was there.


“Are you kidding? This is what you came for! We have to bring home evidence, of all of it.”


“It’s going to be dark in half an hour. It’s already hard to see in here…”


“Duh, that’s why I’m using a flash. Hey, can you get a picture of me next to this creepy Jesus thing?”


“Um…I guess,” I mumbled as I took the camera from him. I didn’t even want to look at it, much less photograph it, but if it would help me get him out of here I was going to stomach it. 


Jamie wrapped his arm around it just as I snapped the picture.
“Don’t touch it! Oh crap, why did you touch it? There’s something off about that thing, Jamie. Can we fricking go now?!”


“Yeah, fine.” Jamie walked over and picked up the backpack as I headed toward the front door.


I noticed there was no lock on it. I pushed against the door as hard as I could - it didn’t budge. My heart sank; there wasn’t even a handle or a knob. It was just a solid piece of wood with strange markings on it. Symbols I had never seen before. 


“Jamie, the door is stuck,” I said as I turned around to see him testing a piece of the floor with his foot.


“What are you doing?” I asked, hearing the edge of panic in my voice. He was still at the front of the chapel, a foot from the Jesus statue hopping back and forth from one part of the floor to another. The statue’s eyes seemed to be only on him now.


“There’s something under here. See?” I heard the floorboard creak under his left foot as he put weight on it. 


“Jamie, don’t.”


“No, its like, under the dirt right here, the floor is hallow,” he kneeled down and starting digging through the thin layer of dirt, “it’s like a trapdoor or something!”


And it was indeed a trap door. By the time I had walked the length of the pews, Jamie already had the edges dug halfway out.


“Let’s just leave it and your brother and his friends can come back and see what it is, please, Jamie, I want to go.” There was something wrong with this place. Terribly wrong. And the thought of spending one more minute here had me on the precipice of a panic attack, something I hadn’t experienced in over a year. 


I sat down against the front pew and put my head down. I heard a roaring in my ears and my breathing grew labored. I had to leave here, even without Jamie. I rocked back and forth for a few minutes as I tried to calm myself down. I would climb out a window and run – in any direction, it didn’t matter.


“There’s something here, under the church.” Jamie’s voice sounded a million miles away.


By the time I pulled myself together enough to lift my head, Jamie was knelt next to me.


“I didn’t know you were claustrophobic.” At least, that’s what I think Jamie said. I better remember the horror I felt as I stared at the hole in the floor. Jamie had opened the trap door.


“Two minutes,” Jamie said as he stood up. “We go down, we take a couple pictures of whatever’s down there and we come right back up and leave. Just two minutes, Katie, that’s all I’m asking.”


I wanted to say no. I intended to. But I felt myself slowly nodding as Jamie pulled me to my feet. To this day I don’t understand why I agreed. But I suppose that it’s better that what happened down there didn’t happen to Jamie alone.


“We’re going to come back with the story of a lifetime! What if there is valuable stuff down there or something? Old shit is always worth money. We could be rich! So rich that your family could stay here. You could buy the house you’re living in and come to school with me in September.”


I managed a small smile. Of all the things someone could think to buy with wealth, Jamie’s first thought was to keep me here with him. And he was right, there could be anything down there and almost all old stuff was valuable. I took a deep breath.


“Okay, 2 minutes,” I agreed.


As we leaned over the trapdoor and peered down, the first thing we noticed was an intense heat emanating upwards from the hole. The second was the strangely out of place spiral staircase leading into the depths below. 


Jamie rolled the flashlight over to me with his foot and I picked it up as he pulled his lighter out of his pocket.


“Ladies first,” he smirked at me.


I stared at him slack jawed. 


“No way. You found this door, YOU go first. Between the black staircase and the heat, I feel like we’re descending directly into hell. I am not going first.” I crossed my arms and glared at him to reinforce my point. 


Jamie simply shrugged and stepped onto the staircase. 


I took several deep breaths as I watched his head disappear into the darkness below. I almost didn’t follow him. I was still deciding when he yelled at me to shine the flashlight down the stairs so he could see. 


I started down the stairs after him. They went down much farther than I thought, and it became warmer and warmer the further down we went. 


When we finally reached the bottom, I was holding back what threatened to be a massive anxiety attack. We were farther beneath the church than I thought we’d be and it was hot, muggy and difficult to breathe. 


Hoping to get this over with as fast as possible, I swung the flashlight around the chamber hoping to reveal its hidden treasure. What I saw there, I can never describe, though I have tried many times. 

The room was entirely empty, save two things. One was a desk in the corner, much like the one in pastor’s office. The second was another statue. 


This one was roughly twelve feet tall, and remains to this day the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen. To put it mildly, it was some sort of demon. It towered over us and as such I could only see the bottom of its jaw from where I was. It was looking directly ahead of it, at the staircase we had just descended. Its tail was long and swept around the entire room. There wasn’t a lot of room to move. It had claws, like any modern depiction of a demon and as I moved around the chamber to view its profile, I noticed it had horns as well. 


Neither Jamie nor I spoke as we shuffled around room, our backs to the wall as far away from the demon as physically possible. I stepped carefully over the tail as I made my way to its back and came around to the other side of the statue. 


I couldn’t take my eyes from it, I couldn’t trust it. If the statue upstairs seemed to bleed, what could this one do? As I eyed the talons on the gigantic stone feet, Jamie broke the silence.


“Can you even believe this shit?” His voice was coming from the other side of the room. I searched the darkness for the weak glow of his lighter and was relieved to see it moving towards me. I turned my flashlight upward to shine it on the side of the demon’s head. The horns had to be at least a foot tall. As I brought it down to see where Jamie was, I hit my arm on something hard.


“Ow, my head!” Jamie squeaked as my flashlight fell to the ground and rolled under the desk.


“Goddammit, Jamie,” I whispered in a panic. I dropped to my knees and felt around under the desk, searching for the flashlight. 


“What! It’s not my fault you cracked me on the head.” 


I stood back up and swung the light around to see Jamie trying to relight his lighter – but it wasn’t him that stopped me dead. 


I will forever be frozen in that moment. I don’t know why I couldn’t speak, couldn’t scream, couldn’t move. All I could feel was my own intern decent into madness.


As I had moved the beam of light up to Jamie’s face I had seen another face right next to his. A twisted, angry, soulless face – the demon’s. The statue had bent down and turned to the side; its head mere inches from Jamie’s. And it was staring at me. I can not describe its face, and I am not sure my mind will ever let me remember it in detail. 


It shook me to my core in a literal sense. My body was having a dark, violent, visceral reaction to this impossibility. Jamie finally noticed the flashlight shaking in my hand and turned to see what I was looking at. 

It wasn’t until he started screaming that I was shaken from my paralysis – I dropped the flashlight, Jamie dropped everything else, and we ran.


We took the stairs 2 and 3 at a time, Jamie pushing me up ahead of him. Halfway up I slipped and we both went tumbling down halfway to the bottom. In that horrible moment we heard the grinding of stone against stone and we knew the statue was moving. Jamie screamed but I was mute, too horrified to make a sound. We got up and kept climbing, never taking our eyes off the small, dying light above us; our only salvation now.


We were almost to the top when we first heard it on the stairs. It was so large and heavy that the entire staircase shook with the impact. Terrified that the stairs would come crashing down and we would be left alone with it below, we jumped the last 3 steps.


Jamie pushed me up out of the opening. He climbed out after me and tried to slam the trapdoor shut but it was somehow stuck.


We could hear a deafening thunder on the staircase as the statue slowly climbed the steps. I helped Jamie try to push the trapdoor closed and for the first time noticed the symbols on the bottom of the wood – the same as those on the front door.


Before I could begin to comprehend this, I noticed the demon first penetrate the shaft of light on the staircase below. It was coming. Jamie saw it too and pulled me to a standing position while pointing at the front door.


We both ran at it as hard as we could – but when we hit it, it didn’t budge. We tried again, but it was unsympathetic.


“Katie, the windows!” We ran to the closest one and tried to climb up the wall to get out, but the windows were too high.


The thunder from below was getting louder, closer. It was more than half way up the stairs…


We tried to climb on the rotting pews to reach the windows but they crumbled under our weight.


“I’ll push you out, give me your foot!” Jamie yelled over the sound bellowing from below.


I shook my head. I wanted to, God, I wanted to. But I couldn’t leave him. I couldn’t leave Jamie to face that thing alone. We both looked over at the door again. Our only chance was to keep trying to break it down. We stumbled back into the aisle and ran at the front door with everything we had. I thought I felt it move. We backed up even further and ran at it again. This time the impact knocked me backwards into the aisle and Jamie barely stayed on his feet. He looked at me in horror and I turned around the see stone horns rising up from the darkness of the trapdoor, 3 feet from where I sat. 


We were going to die here. I stood up, refusing to turn around again. I knew that the next step it took would bring its head into the room, and the thought of seeing it’s face again had me running at the door with every last bit of strength I had. Jamie reached it at the same time and I felt it give way as we crashed through the threshold and landed outside the church.


Jamie had picked me up off the ground before I could think to move and we were running toward the train tracks at an Olympic sprint. We could still hear the thundering on the stairs no matter how far we got from the church; every step echoed through the woods like a gunshot – until they stopped. It was here.


I had no idea if we had run in the right direction or if we would be forever lost in those woods. It was now dark outside and the temperature was dropping fast. I was beginning to panic that we would never find the train tracks when I noticed Jamie wasn’t next to me anymore. I turned around in a panic to find him sprawled on the ground a few yards behind me- he had tripped over one of the rails. He was up and running down the tracks before I could even ask if he was okay. We ran until we couldn’t anymore.


Our running eventually slowed to a jog and the jog to a walk. We hadn’t spoken – neither of us had any idea what to say – and it wasn’t until we had both gotten our breath back that one of us finally broke the silence.


“How long have we been on the tracks?” Jamie’s voice had an edge of barely suppressed fear. I looked at his wrist, and noticed his watch was missing.


“It didn’t take us this long to get, to get…to find that place. Or did it? Do you think maybe we went the wrong way?” Jamie asked hesitantly.


I couldn’t afford to think like that. If we had somehow gotten turned around and ran the wrong way down the train tracks, than we were deeper into the woods than ever.


“No. We went the right way,” I said to convince myself.


“That thing,” Jamie started, “I thought it was a statue. But maybe it was some crazy undiscovered giant reptile that was, like, hibernating and we woke it up.”


So we were going to delude ourselves into thinking that there was a scientific explanation for this. I understood why but I just couldn’t accept it.


“Yeah,” I said slowly, “did you, um, did you see the weird writing on the front door? It was on the trapdoor, too. Do you think it was keeping it down there? Because, Jamie, all those doors are open now.”


“Well, if it’s an animal, words mean nothing to it, anyway.”


“Yeah, if…” I trailed off hoping he would challenge my implication. He didn’t.


I could tell this was something Jamie’s mind wouldn’t accept. But he hadn’t seen its face, not like I had. It was no animal. It was made of stone. It was something sinister and anciently evil and it had seen me, had seen right down into my soul. It was aware of me and I was aware of it. And now, it was free. Whatever had been keeping it beneath the church has been awkwardly destroyed by Jamie and me. That thing was free to walk the woods and go God knows where. 


We walked in silence for another half hour until Jamie suddenly stopped short and started yelling.


“Here! We’re here!” He booked it down the tracks toward a swarm of flashlights and I followed close behind him. As soon as Jamie reached his parents he collapsed, while I ran into my mother’s arms and cried like a child. I couldn't hold it together any longer.


The police report says we were found at 4am – by our sense of time about 3 hours after the sun had set. We had spent less than an hour in the chapel and yet we seemed to have lost 10 hours there. We never told anyone where we had actually been, or that we had found the lost city of Deepwood. We simply said we went for a walk to the lake and got lost in the woods. 


My family left Middlesbrough the following Monday – two days ahead of schedule. My father had another store to open and there was really no reason to wait. Jamie didn’t come to say goodbye to me and after we left Middlesbrough I never saw him again. I kept a copy of the police report to remember him.


Over the following year, Middlesbrough slowly disappeared. At first, I could just feel the memory fading unnaturally from my mind. My parents couldn’t remember that we had ever been there, which scared me more than anything else. I taped the police report to the ceiling over my bed so that Jamie would be the first and last thing I thought about everyday.  


Then, the Middlesbrough city website disappeared as did that of the local paper and the town’s two public schools.


The store my dad helped open in 2002 also disappeared from the company’s website. After that I could never find any mention of Middlesbrough anywhere online ever again.


Over the years, I searched public records for Jamie’s full name and found nothing. I hired someone to illegally search private records and he came up empty too. In the end, the only proof that Jamie ever existed at all was the police report with his name on it.


And then nothing was left.  One day the paper I had had taped to my ceiling for so many years was blank. I remember what it was and what it looked like before, but now it’s just an old weathered piece of blank paper.


All that remains of Middlesbrough and the people who lived there are my memories. And this is why I am writing this story down and uploading it to the internet. Once it’s on the internet, it can never die, right? Or perhaps one day it will just disappear and you won’t remember ever seeing it and I won’t remember ever writing it.


And I can only hope that this ended with Middlesbrough. If it has moved on to other towns, who would know? Who would even remember? 


I wish I had answers. But all I have are questions.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Mag XII was my 3rd Magfest.  It gets more incredible every year, and I think attendance has at least doubled since I started attending.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, for the memories and good times.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmvx1?context=5)|I'm glad you're able to keep coming out, and thank you so much for all your support. The event exists for you guys, so we won't stop doing it until you stop coming.
[My question:  who have you been dying to book as a panelist/performer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmvx1?context=5)|I have such a long list of people that I would like to bring out, and so does everyone else on staff. The worst part is that we can easily get in contact with all of these people, but there's just not enough space/time/MONEY to bring them all! It's a pain in the butt to have to make those terrible decisions of who to have and who can't come. Ultimately, I'd say if there were a single guest that is almost completely out of my power to get, because I just have no way to contact him, would be that Arino guy from Game Center CX.
[Oh, and follow-up question: VikingGuitar's beard made me tingly in a special way.  Is that normal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmvx1?context=5)|Also, if a doctor if the tingling continues for more than 4 hours.
[I always thought that Arino guy would be the best guest. Let's hope there's a way. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfdfyaa?context=5)|One day. One day.
[I really loved the layout for MAGfest 11. 12 felt very confusing and a little off. I still had an amazing time but, why the change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcnf0g?context=5)|ASTRONOMEEERS!
 |Due to a very long backstory (but one that I assure you will not happen again), we were not contracted to have anywhere near as much space as we needed. The American Astronomical Society meeting was coming in immediately after us (and somewhat during!) for their event, so they were using up a lot of the space that we would of been to great use for us. If you had seen us planning for M12, you likely would have wanted to given us some kind of Best Tetris Player award for how we finagled and twisted every last inch of space we had, and working with the astronomers to compromise however we could to get more space.
 |I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, and apologize greatly for the loopy layout.
[Haha, you had a space conflict with astronomers. How perfect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcr3rc?context=5)|How did i not realize that before...
[Where do you see Magfest in the near to distant future? I've only recently heard about it but it seems to be growing alongside the popularity of the gaming on the internet eg: YouTube and so called eCelebrities. It seems that music is a huge focus but now with people like egoraptor, jontron, projared etc there seems to be an increase of focus and demand  on internet entities. Do you think it will eventually become focused on panels with these people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpvwy?context=5)|The mission of MAGFest Inc, including the main MAGFest event, and all of our other satellite events, is to further the appreciation of video game music, and gaming of all types, while strengthening the bonds of all the communities involved in said appreciation of those things. Times will change, celebrities will come and go, bands will break up and reform, and the new call of duty will come out every christmas season. Through all of this, our job is to provide the best party atmosphere we can for people to come enjoy things like that, while staying sponsor free, driven by the community instead of the industry, and featuring personalities that are there to enjoy the event rather than collect an appearance fee and sign a few autographs.
[I know personally I would be more likely to attend if I knew a few of my favorite YouTubers would be doing panels or had booths. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpvwy?context=5)|I can't tell you that our goal is to get the biggest youtube stars with the most subscribers, but if there's something that we feel will legitimately contribute to the event without detracting from its core values, then we'll strongly consider it.
[Thanks for your response. I'm glad you have a strong set of ideas that you plan to stick to year to year. I hope I can get out to next year's event maybe I could even help out. I followed the main twitter account so I'll be up to date.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcr4ha?context=5)|We'd love to have you out, and we definitely welcome the help. We're almost entirely volunteer run, so if there's anywhere you're interested in assisting, then hop on board.
[In your personal opinion, what part or parts of MAGFest could use the most work/improvement? What is something that MAGFest does not have that you would most like to see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmka9?context=5)|I've got a small laundry list of internal optimizations that need to be done, but on the external public-facing front, I'd really like to see our media collection process grow into something cohesive and accessible for public consumption. We've got god knows how many panels and concerts going on, so we're striving the best we can to make sure that all of that is streamed and archived for future viewing. Our media department is still in its infancy, but we did a pretty good job of streaming almost all our concerts this year. It's only up from here!
[I have friends who couldn't make it who enjoyed the streams, and being able to capture the events is always great. Capture of the panels would be amazing - I love to attend panels and frequently end up with scheduling conflicts and the need to make very hard decisions. Thanks for the reply!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmx8g?context=5)|I'm glad they enjoyed the streams! Hopefully they'll be able to live it out in person next year. It's a shame that the panels have so many conflicts, that it truly is a first world problem of ""too much awesome stuff to do"".
[So there's space to practice the accordion wiping technique?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmtxs?context=5)|The accordion technique is next-generation precision that requires very little time, effort, and materials.
 |The solitude is required so that my sphincter doesn't slam shut. It's a personal thing.
[Are you involved with booking performers? If so, what do you look for the most when looking at performers/DJ's for MAGFest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfclsh2?context=5)|Our music department is in charge of getting performers, and much like our non-musical guests, there's a few things that are involved in having someone on stage.
 |Skill.
 |Relevance to the event.
 |Uniqueness.
 |Notoriety/Draw.
 |Budget required.
 |Involvement/Dedication to the scene.
 |There's no magical equation to how exactly we book people, but it's a combination of all those factors. There are times when an act isn't very well known, but they have plenty of proof that they're good at what they do, and they're genuinely interested in both the event and the community, which gets a lot of respect from us. We've got limited space in 4 dimensions to work with, so we try to strike the best balance we can in headliners, newcomers, and MAGFest veterans. Invariably someone feels left out because they weren't chosen, but I can assure you that it is never personal, and merely the nature of the beast.
[I've never heard of you but you fit the description of my two favorite things, Music and Gaming. Any plans in Minnesota? I know 5+ (without exaggerating\) people that would be there in a second.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfctq9j?context=5)|We're looking for some west coast stuff, but currently nothing in the works for up your in neighborhood. If you happen to know of a somewhat thriving local nerd music scene (video game cover bands, nerdcore, etc), then let me know and maybe we can put together a Game Over show! Not to turn this AMA into a sales pitch, but if you managed to make your way to our DC event, I'm almost certain you'd come back again. It's ridiculous how many attendees have told me stories of them doing just that.
[How did you get in touch in Egoraptor ? Also, can we please have Anamanaguchi next year? I would actually be able to die then.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmxnv?context=5)|We've known him for a few years through a friend at [sharkrobot](http://sharkrobot.com/), the place who sells egoraptor merch. I'm continually amazed with how dedicated that guy is to both the community and his fans, despite how his popularity has skyrocketed over the past couple years.
 |Anamanaguchi would be a pretty cool band. For whatever reason we've never been able to have them out.
[Didn't they play Bit Gen once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcn559?context=5)|Looong time ago.
[What's your highscore on Flappy Bird? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcocaw?context=5)|Zero. Been too busy playing cave story!
[When is Magstock 2014?  I've wanted to go since you guys announced the first one but have never been able to.  I can confirm that I am a nerd, however my smelliness varies and I can't guarantee that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcp91y?context=5)|MAGStock is coming... soon!...?
[Also this Magfest was #6 for me.  It's something I absolutely cannot fathom missing at this point.  Went to my first BitGen last year and I'll definitely be going again this year.  Thank you guys for all you do.  :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcp91y?context=5)|Thanks so much for all your support, and it's great to have MAGFest vets like yourself returning year after year. Keep telling all of your friends so we can build up our satellite events like Bit Gen and MAGStock.
[Also, have you heard of Starbomb? (Link to www.youtube.com Is there planning to have them perform next year?  They were all there at their panels this year, it'd be sweet to see them perform.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcn6o8?context=5)|They're definitely cool as shit, so we have them in our long long list of performers we'd like to see at some point!
[Such as putting the Protomans (not to be confused with the Protomen\) on main stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpri4?context=5)|First rule about The Protomans.
[How was magfest started? I'd be interested in hearing how the fest became what it is today. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcmwq2?context=5)|Joe Yamine was the original creator, and with all the anime conventions popping up in the mid-atlantic, he wanted to host an event where you could play video games, and also see the minibosses perform (the original event name was actually Mid-Atlantic Gaming Festival). Additionally, I think he was trying to impress a woman. After the first one, he was a little overwhelmed by the effort, and handed it off to Brendan Becker aka [Inverse Phase](http://inversephase.bandcamp.com/), who was a driving force that helped guide the philosphy of the event (no sponsors, community run), while amassing an army behind him. He stepped down after MAGFest 8 or 9, and his army has continued to take it to where it is now.
 |MAGFest would not have survived without the community which has grown around it, so we're just happy to be there to help fill that hole in people's hearts.
[Is sunny still a nice kitty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcm9jz?context=5)|She's a [VERY nice kitty](http://i58.tinypic.com/14ya9go.jpg).
[You used tinypic?  Dude...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcs6pm?context=5)|There's a very long story about me being unable to access imgur currently that I can't get into right now.
[I'm one of Seth's team that ran the Artemis demos.  Did you ever find the rest of the chairs? - Was it considered a success? Bringing it back next year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfctj23?context=5)|You guys were awesome, and I want you guys back so hard. How many chairs are we missing? There are a bunch in the warehouse.
[We only had the one during the actual expo. I hope they were all accounted for. Look forward to seeing you next year!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcwxn9?context=5)|Any idea how many total we're supposed to have?
[Hey Nick! Awesome job with the AMA. :\) I just have one question for you. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen Mateo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcv7f2?context=5)|What do you mean? An 8bit Disaster or a Those Who Fight mateo?
[Why not both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcvdf4?context=5)|Either way, it's fast enough that if you see him coming it's too late. Make peace with your god.
[My wife works at the venue where Magfest takes place. Do you guys intent to enforce rules in a more strict fashion? The things she has to put up with from some of the attendees really turns me off to the whole thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfctlk8?context=5)|It really depends on the rule. We try to be as laid back an event as possible, and let people enjoy themselves, but my right to swing my fist stops at your nose, so it's important to make sure people are respectful as they have fun. Was there anything in particular that bothered her? The gaylord staff are absolutely phenomenal, and do a wonderful job taking care of us every single year, so we want to do our best to keep them happy.
[Accepting any volunteers or interns in the near future? Also, any plans to hit LA or any place near it? I gotta see it live. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcngfk?context=5)|We always always ALWAYS welcome more volunteers. ""Intern"" is such a weird word since we only have one paid employee, and don't have anything resembling an office (though we do have a warehouse stacked yay high with arcades and consoles). We're looking for event opportunities on the west cost, though have been somewhat focused on NorCal. What are you good at, and how do you want to help?
[Favorite memory? Favorite panel or performance from this last year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcnabd?context=5)|Probably my favorite MAGFest memory is this right here. I needed to get to my wife before the concert, so I enlisted the crowd's help! [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etG0Fi6YBis)
 |Machinae Supremacy was my favorite show this year. I've been listening to them for well over a decade (I was still in high school!) so it was great to finally have them out. 
[Starbomb and Ninja Sex Party performing at MAGFest 2014. Confirmed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcp9i3?context=5)|Confirmed! MAGFest 2014 already happened and you missed the secret show! You blew it!
[Fuck. I meant 2015.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpcx2?context=5)|Listen, man, you can't blame me for your mistakes.
[:(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcph1r?context=5)|Also we're months away from announcing any bands.
[I know. I just wanted to be sneaky and get the inside scoop :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpoh8?context=5)|[Link to 31.media.tumblr.com](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md9ikx23QV1qgrp5zo1_500.png)
[Are there plans to have con's elsewhere?  (I hear Denver needs a gaming con.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcm2vj?context=5)|We're not a con, we're a fest! :P.
 |The organization is always looking to expand, but we're almost entirely volunteer, so it's a little hard for us to grow staff wise, despite the explosive growth attendance wise. Some time in the next couple years, we'd like to do a large scale California event, but in the meanwhile, hopefully a Game Over should hit your half of the country. Denver specifically, though, isn't something we've looked at.
[What proportion of MAGFest attendees are stand-wadders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcn9uu?context=5)|0% if I can help it.
[Can we put the Survey at the bottom of the registration form to make sure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcnuqu?context=5)|Auto ban if you check the box.
[What do you think of James Rolfe, or The Angry Video Game Nerd?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcl06w?context=5)|Surprisingly tame and laid back compared to his character. It's really cool to see all of his hard work and effort put into his videos pay off after all those years of doing it, because he has quite a large following now, who help support him in his other endeavors like his game, movie, and the whole rest of cinnemassacre. The imitators spawned off from him are both a blessing and a curse, because some are hilarious, but the vast majority are just...
[How do you guys decide on what ""celebrities"" are worthy of appearing. I know that MAGFest hosts a lot of internet personalities, but there are literally THOUSANDS of those.  Who makes the cut?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcp083?context=5)|Much like our musical guests, it's a combination of notoriety, budget, non-douchebaggery, relevancy, and keeping a rotation of fresh faces as best we can. Again, there's no magic formula, but we try to keep things as interesting and as diverse as we can. We tend to scope out people that we personally think would be cool to have, as well as people that are ""trending"" at the time. 
[What black magic did you work to get Yuzo Koshiro last year? His DJ set was fucking sick. If I wasn't, well, fucking sick in a different way (not too far removed from a hospital stay\), I'd have stayed for all of it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcp9f0?context=5)|Same way we get a lot of our guests; we know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy. We're just a giant network/community of fans running this thing, so it's great to build up a web of amazing people that are interesting coming out. Yuzo was a great guest to have, and his M11 show was the largest show he's ever done by like a factor of 20. What a standup guy.
[Absolutely. I was at his panels.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpj9r?context=5)|Hope you enjoyed as much of the event as you could! I'm sorry you got sick during his set :(
[Serious question time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpjw4?context=5)|So, Love Canon is this legit awesome blue grass band that covers 80's pop hits. When they applied as a performer, we were 98.6% certain that they meant to apply to the [Magnolia Festival](http://www.magnoliafest.com/), a folk music festival down in Florida that is sometimes abbreviated as MagFest. It wouldn't be the first time we've received applications meant for them.
[Love Canon was a pretty amazing find for MAGProm this year.  I've heard the story about how they were booked, but can you share it with the community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpjw4?context=5)|Anyway, as it turns out, this blue grass 80s pop cover band DID in fact mean to apply to play at a video game music festival, and we decided that it was so awesome that we couldn't possibly turn them down.
[I was told (by I think Hachi or Brendan\) that MAGProm was actually conceived as a means to make them fit in somehow for MAGFest since they were that fantastic of an act.  How much truth is there to that part of the story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcpvk7?context=5)|We had another band that was a key part of that equation, but they unfortunately had to drop out, so The OneUps and Love Canon carried the weight to make MAGProm into the glory that it was.
[Nick, in your opinion, what is the greatest prog band in the world?  (By the way, you STILL owe me blowjobs for tackling the Contra 4 Jetski level bass lines and remixing Ys soundtracks just for you\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfcrw52?context=5)|Damn it tony you know I can't answer that question.
[Where would be the best place to submit albums I've done for consideration as a participating musician?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm8st/im_on_the_board_of_directors_for_magfest_the/cfd5khd?context=5)|Music@magfest.org! What kind of stuff do you do? Remember that you don't need to be official booked on one of our stages for people to appreciate your music at MAGFest. You can hop on any of our open mic stages, play music at a respectable volume in the hallway, or hand out CDs to anyone you meet!

Everything my friends say describe it as really sketchy. They have interns at our school with the purpose of getting students emails to send invitations to other students without their consent. It appears that they are trying to get started but what they're doing doesn't seem legal. One of their examples on the website ofa sample screen has two students I know who I know would not sign up to allow themselves on the website. Their privacy policy seems sketchily written, so I'm having troubles seeing exactly what they do with your data. They seem to collect info that is not pertinent t to their intent. I'm really concerned. I could probably write pages on this, but I'm a little stuck on time. I would recommend looking on their website but not signing up. Is evrything they do legal?"

The internship starts the second week of June so I am starting to look for a place to live. I can't move into my college's dorm until August so that means I am hunting for a low cost room in the San Francisco area.

The problem is, the pay will be miminal. I won't make enough for an apartment or room. I can't move into my college's dorms over the summer. The place I am looking at is going to cost $2000 for the two and half months before I move into my college's dorm.

What are my options for financial aid? Is there anywhere I can take out a student loan for internship?

Someone recommended I take community college classes and take out a loan with the 2013-14 FASFA. However, with the internship and a part time job, I don't want to risk of bearing a load I can't handle.

1xo3ni,6,2014-02-11,I need advice and prayer.,mattortman777,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1xo3ni/i_need_advice_and_prayer/,"I graduated from a private college last may, and i recently found out that there was a problem with my transcripts and my graduation stats has been put on hold.

I never received my diploma in the mail, and i thought that it was just an address error and didn't make anything of it. Than about a month ago my friend told me that another friend of our's stole one of my papers, got caught, and didn't graduate. so i called the school last week and found out that my senior seminar class didn't have a grade submitted in to it.

I emailed the professor and he said that there was a problem with another student stealing my paper and gave me his phone number to call him. I called him six times over the weekend and he never picked up. I sent him another email today, and he wrote back that a friend of his had there baby die and he was delivering to funeral so he couldn't talk to me but would get around to it eventually. But this time he also said that the problem wasn't just the paper, but also that my writing was bad and that i had problems with my internship. But i already have a grade for my internship which was completed two years ago, and i never got below a c on any of my papers!

So here i am. I never received any notification that these problems existed, and I've been gone from this school for over half a year. I have no certainty of what the problems acutely are, or when they will be resolved. The professor wont schedule a time that i can talk to him, and i live two states away from the school. I am also having a bit of a anxiety attack right now.

currently i am working two jobs. One minimum wage job, and i have been doing work for a church for free as a college pastor. I also have a job interview on Friday for a very highly competitive position that i was narrowed down to two candidates, and i feel awful going to this interview with my degree on hold.

I know that he is busy dealing with tragedy that happened to his friend. but also i cant help feeling wronged that the school and the professor never told me there was a problem. they let me walk on graduation, without bringing up any problems. when i hinted that i felt like this was wrong in an email, they said that it was the students reprehensibility to check on and take of these issues, but how would i know there was a problem since i never failed a paper or a test?

What am i supposed to do?

Edit 1: This is the email i just sent the Professor.

No, i'm sorry didn't leave a message. I actually thought i might have the wrong phone number, but i checked it with the email three times. I am so sorry that tragedy happened. I am praying for you, and that family; that is heartbreaking news. Please take the time to deal with issue, and than we can talk about what happened with 

I don't remember you ever sharing things like this with the class, but i have heard from others that a lot of really tough things have happened to and around you in these last two years on top of stress that comes with teaching and taking care of a church. I know that you are extremely busy and your time is stretched thin, and my heart goes out to you. I pray that God will give you the words to say at the funeral. I don't know how you are exactly dealing with the situation but the psalms always help me to grieve ""I am benumbed and badly crushed; I groan because of the agitation of my heart. My heart throbs and my strength fails me ... I will hope in You, O Lord; you will answer o my God ... Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, do not be far from me! Make haste to help me, O Lord,my salvation"" sections from Psalm 38.

I know that you have been dealing with issues like this for much longer than i have and it might not mean much, but after being a college pastor for a short while i can sympathize with the pain that comes with ministering to others especially in times like this. One of the things that our staff does every week is pray for situations like this. Our congregation is dealing with several deaths right now as well as the loss of a child and it can be debilitating. I will add a prayer for you into tomorrows meeting just asking that God gives you the right heart and the right words to deal with the situation,

So please call me when you get the chance, because i am having a bit of an anxiety attack with this whole grade thing, and I don't know how big of a deal it is and how long its going to take to resolve it. I'm getting especially freaked out since i have a job interview on Friday my knowledge of whats going on with this whole thing effects that. so please remember to talk to me when you get the chance, but please take care of this other situation of first.

Sincerely,

Need perspective...can't tell if I'm wrong for feeling this way and I'm just immature or my concerns or legitimate!,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1xonty/im_24f_with_bf_31m_in_a_25_yr_relationship_im/,"I've been dating my bf for about 2.5 years. Lately I've been feeling unhappy and just need perspective. Am I being crazy or do I have some valid reasons for feeling this way? And how can I go about fixing it? I want this relationship to work. My main worry is that he doesn't recognize that he doesn't know what's wrong and what's right and that just because nothing physical happened, nothing happened in his mind, although I feel otherwise. 

**Why (I think) I'm feeling upset:** I haven't been feeling like I can completely trust my bf due to an incident that happened a little while ago. I've tried to forget it but sometimes I will think of it and it will flare up these trust issues, and it makes me go into a bad mood swing, which negatively impacts our relationship. I'm not very good at talking to my bf about my concern b/c I'm unsure that I have anything to be upset about. 

**What happened a little while ago to make me lose trust:** While I was abroad for 3 months, a new neighbor moved into the same building. I didn't meet or hear or her until I got back. I wasn't worried about anything, I just personally did not like her that much when I met her. However, things started to annoy me. She calls up my bf crying about something, calls and texts him about missing the party he throws, calls him to help her move her stuff, and maybe other stuff I don't know about. She did move to here from another state but I know she has friends because I've seen them and I know that my bf is not the only guy friend she has who can help her move. I believe she has been going to school here for a few years so...I really find it hard to believe she has no friends and she can only look to my bf to call him crying about this. Basically, I don't like or trust her, my bf is very very nice to everyone, to the point of paying for drinks or cabs for people. Anyway, I didn't react well to my bf telling me this, I'm very upset. The next day he shows me the text, that he hadn't responded to her. So I feel bad for overreacting and wish I had just calmly said that I was upset with this instead and I apologize for my reaction and thought that this was over. However fast forward a few weeks, I see that he has still been talking to her and I ask him to see his phone. He reluctantly gives it to me and I look at the texts they've been exchanging. So I find out that:

**1)** They've met up for drinks, he made the first move to ask her out
**2)** They've been sending texts back and forth over the holiday season, to me with a flirty tone
**3)** HE ASKED HER IF HE COULD SLEEP OVER AT HER APARTMENT. IT IS A TINY ASS SMALL STUDIO WITH ONE BED. WHERE WOULD HE SLEEP? ON THE FLOOR? IN THE SAME BED AS HER? she was back at her parent's but...in response to this he said: I had a few drinks and I had to wake up early to go to work tomorrow. UHM. YOU HAVE A KEY TO MY APARTMENT. He says: oh, we were in a fight I didn't feel comfortable. THE NIGHT YOU ASKED TO SLEEP OVER WE HAD JUST HAD DINNER TOGETHER WITH MY FAMILY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE WERE FIGHTING?! 

Anyway this leads to a big fight. I'm crying. Instead of reassuring me he makes me feel really stupid for even being worried about ""this tiny little girl"". Calls me crazy (which he has been doing a lot lately), says he'll stop talking to her if that's what I want but very begrudgingly. I can't really remember the other details we eventually go to sleep. 

**Anyway, after this, I've been worried.** I'm not worried about him physically cheating. But I worry that he doesn't really see what he did wrong, that what he did to me broke my trust, and maybe it wasn't even emotional cheating but he made me feel bad when I don't think I had done anything wrong except not reacting calmly. He doesn't seem to think that he did anything wrong. He doesn't seem to get that he knew that I would be upset by this, and he did it anyway. And if I hadn't saw it on his phone, it would've been ok. Basically, by not telling me he wasn't exactly lying to me. 

**We were watching a movie and I saw his messages pop up on his screen.** I was able to see that he had been texting two other girls. And ever since then I can't help but wonder what's going on. I'm afraid of bringing this up again because it ended up so bad last time. I had honestly thought that I was being calm about it last time but I ended up crying. 

**We also have some other problems, mainly communication.** I'm very good with sharing things but it drains on me when I always have to ask him about things, he will never tell me things unless I ask. He has been working on it but it it's in spurts. It'll be good right after I ask him and then a little while later it goes back to one sided communication again. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to feel ambivalent. If he doesn't feel like talking, I don't either. I don't want to feel this way. But I just feel very very tired. 

I'm also getting another degree and the school work and internships are taking up a lot of my time. I do realize that I am stressed, and that I'm not the calmest person, I like to get things done and sometimes I forget to relax. I really miss my old lifestyle, where I could go out without a worry and hang out with my friends more. However, he has a much more flexible schedule, he works three out of the seven days and apart from seeing me, he spends a lot of his time with friends going out. I've talked with him that I wish he would share what he does with me but it hasn't happened. I can't go out with him but I wish I could. I was hoping that him sharing with me would make me feel better about being at home, showing that he thinks of me. It hasn't happened. And I keep growing resentful of his lifestyle vs. mine. And since my trust in him has been declining, this combined with this resentment makes me wonder what the hell he is doing all day and I get worried about him cheating. But at the same time I'm tired of asking him questions in order to get him to share, it makes me feel like a mom. It makes me want to not talk to him so that he has to ask me in order to get questions for me. It seems to be turning into a vicious cycle and I don't know how to get out of it. This has been a recurring problem and I don't know how to fix us!

I think that's all I have to say. I know I have my own problems. I'm probably not the most mature. He treats me very well, it's just emotionally, I'm not completely fulfilled.

1xoq8y,1,2014-02-12,Just got denied transfer admissions to my dream university,fuckeveryonee,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xoq8y/just_got_denied_transfer_admissions_to_my_dream/,"I don't have any idea what to even do with myself.  

My whole life I have wanted to study computer science at the University of Illinois in Urbana.  When I graduated high school, I went to community college for financial reasons even though I was accepted into UIUC.  My first semester at community college was very rough, as I was diagnosed with severe depression and moderate ADHD, which really hindered my ability to study.  Even so, my grades were all A's and B's in the majority of my classes that semester, all of which were honors courses, except for Calc I which I got a C in. Around the beginning of my second semester I got treatment for my previously mentioned medical issues, and everything has been going better since then.  I got a B in Calc II and an A in linear algebra, which was awesome.   I've managed to get my GPA up from what was a 2.8 after my first semester to a 3.4, taking all honors and 200 level and honors courses except for my English courses and an intro psych course that I had to take because they canceled one of my classes on the first day of last semester w/o any prior warning.  Apparently, not anywhere near good enough for UIUC though.  Never mind the fact that I got a 31 on the ACT, was named Technology Student of the Year for my graduating class, had a 4.5 GPA, worked three semesters as a computer lab aid, completed an IT internship while also doing over 40 hours of community service. Oh, did I mention I was also working 30 hours a week as well? I guess all this shit was for naught.  

One of the only reasons I was able to fight through my depression was the fact that I wanted to go to UIUC. When I was trying to go homework and my depression was trying in every possible way to distract me, I would use this goal as a way to focus myself. This is the reason I'm currently taking 19 credits this semester so I would have had all my courses in order to transfer.  

I literally have no idea what to even do anymore with regards to school.  UIUC is the only even half decent school for computer science in Illinois that I could afford to go to.  Sure there are private schools like DePaul or University of Chicago, but I can't afford anything near their price range.  The rest of the public schools are a cesspool of mediocrity in regards to their computer science programs. I feel completely crushed and as if there is no point in continuing in school.  The only reason I'm taking Calc III this semester is because I needed it to get into UIUC.  If I hadn't had my calc test today before finding out the news, I probably would have handed in the test blank.  I can already feel my depression creeping back within a couple hours after having finally been fully under control for the past couple months (down from a 43 to 6 on the beck inventory).  I feel like all my motivation has been sapped from me as I don't even feel like continuing my classes this semester.  I haven't missed a day of classes since I started community college, and I honestly just feel like dropping out.  It seems like there are three categories: schools I want to go to, schools that would actually accept me and schools I can afford to go to, and it seems like there is no overlap between the groups.  There is honestly nowhere else I want to go to school. I'm pretty much screwed for next fall, as most universities have already taken their transfer applications.  I by no means think I am a top 5% of the class student, but I feel my qualifications and experience merit at least a deference instead of an outright rejection.  I really just hate life right now.  It seems like with reading that one simple sentence, my life has lost all sense of direction.  

I really have no idea where I was going with this, I just started typing.

I've already applied for a software development internship already at a small (50-200 employees) business, and now I am applying for an internship at NASA's jet propulsion laboratory.

I'm a sophomore at a college not known for CS, and my school projects haven't been too impressive. In Programming II, we spent most of a semester implementing a doubly linked list with an iterator and exception handling, and spent some time on a simple 16 puzzle game using MFC. So, I was hesitant to include those projects. I do have them on my github, however. I'm working on a side project also, but it's only beginning and isn't really functional yet.

What should I change? Is adding a link to my github with fairly unimpressive projects a good idea? Does the Additional Experience section belong on this resume at all? I felt that showing my advancement to management at my current job was worth the resume space, but what do I know...

Any help is extremely appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I'm currently a Singaporean Sec 4 student, going JC next year.

I have done quite a lot of programming and web design (such as HTML and JavaScript) and I plan to pursue a career in these areas in the future. I want to gain some actual work experience probably over the December holidays (far more productive than sitting at home gaming I guess).

How common is it for Sec 4 students to get internships in this area? What kind of pay should I expect?

I work in an IT department of 3 people. We have one person who is more of the 1st level support, and then there is myself and other coworker who are more project based, but assist in tickets at times, especially when the help desk ticket board is getting a lot of requests. 

We've experienced the same problem I know a lot of you experience, and are trying to follow guidelines of guides like the opsreportcard.com (and his book). We have implemented a Help Desk Email connected to a  ConnectWise Service Board to create/manage tickets. This was implemented in late 2010, and have sent out plenty of notices (via Email, through management, etc) as to the guidelines that should be followed for contacting Help Desk and what the Help Desk should be contacted for. We even put this information in any new hire's welcome packet, as well as verbally tell them while they are on-boarding. I know they have a lot of information coming at them in the first week of work between HR, IT, etc, but I don't see how this is a hard concept to grasp with all the ways we try to communicate it. 

The problem is, people will still contact us individually at times. Some of the worst offenders are managers that have even relayed this information for us! When I started, I was that person that did the initial contact on tickets, and have since moved into the role of more system administration and project based work. Even, though that was around 2 years ago since I changed roles in the department, people still think they should just contact me because I used to answer them, anyway. 

We have grown from around 180 people when I started to over 300 company wide (we are in multiple states). Our IT department has grown from 2 people to 3, and we will soon be adding an intern spot to help with the number of new hires we have at certain times of the year.  

We really need people to Email Help Desk, and quit Emailing us directly. There is no reason they shouldn't know these procedures yet. 

So here's my question. If I get these Emails from someone sending direct to my Email, should I feel bad at this point to just disregard the Email and not respond hoping they take the hint (Apart from them thinking Email is down, or something like that)? I had a manager in my office suggest this, and he is well respected in the company.  "

So, after a few days of frantic, erratic actions and discombobulated thinking, I called my doctor, and we were unable to set up an appointment for another few days. Meanwhile,  my grades tanked and I lost all motivation. Caffeine was my only solace. 

Come Tuesday, I'm back on Vyvanse and I am a completely different person! I went from endlessly browsing reddit to looking around the web for Masters programs and internships. I'm no longer filled with angst about my future career path because I had the motivation to do my research! I finally feel like I can tackle my homework efficiently and turn out a quality product. My mind is working at its fullest capacity, and I feel like anything is possible!


Being medicated is definitely worth it, and I will do anything possible to avoid falling into the trap of being without meds.

I graduated from UofM in 2012 with a BS in Brain, Behavior, and Cognitive Science (mixture of neuroscience/psychology) and I recently began classes (again at UofM) to pursue a BS in computer science. The story behind going from one area to another area is long, but a simplified version is that I found a passion in computers that I didn't know existed before. 

As I said, I begin just recently (I am currently in my second semester) and I've taken an intro to programming class, discrete math, linear algebra, and am now in a logic and design course and another programming class. It seems like it's all happening very fast and I want to be able to get everything out of this as I can. I haven't started any outside projects but I want to begin, though I don't know where to start. 

My question to you is where should I begin/look? I recently had a career fair, but so far I haven't heard back from anyone and I feel discouraged that I may not get one. Having a project or something on the side will not only help me gain knowledge in the field, but also may help me get my foot in the door for internships. "

1xqdnn,13,2014-02-12,New here. How do you overcome it?,ShaolinShade,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1xqdnn/new_here_how_do_you_overcome_it/,"Hey people, just discovered this subreddit - I'm guessing most people here haven't overcome their social anxiety, but if you did, how did you do it? What worked? I see lots of posts on here of people relating to each other about it, but virtually no posts involving how to get help or fight your way out of it.

My background: When I was really young I was a very extroverted, social, creative, and motivated kid. As I grew up though, going into late elementary school and middle school, I sort of retreated into myself and became overly eager to please and introverted, and lost all popularity I once had. My days went from being exciting, fun adventures to miserable, endless hell. I've spent countless hours obsessing over this shift and trying to figure out why it happened, and my best guess is some fucked up parenting that I dealt with growing up and just being raised in the mormon church were probably the biggest reasons for the shift. I think I kind of learned that when I put myself out there, people sometimes don't return the love and instead take advantage of me. That's been a hard lesson to un-learn. But I managed to largely do it when I entered college - breaking free from the poisonous home environment my parents created gave me the opportunity to re-form myself, and over the course of a couple years there I largely succeeded and started to feel like I was finally finding my identity and being comfortable with it around others. It started when I found a group of friends that thought like I did and accepted me as I was. They re-introduced me to the social scene, and an event that I think acted as a large bridge-crossing stepping stone was when I took MDMA with some of them at a rave. That was the first time in years that I felt comfortable and happy with other people - I could approach anyone, talk about anything. I was happier than I could ever remember being - It was like I had re-discovered my young self. I sort of ""hung up the phone once I got the message"", i.e. I let that feeling carry me and haven't taken it since that one time. But almost the moment I found this happiness, I also found my first relationship &amp; first love. For a while, of course, this carried me even further - but I think I opened myself up too much to her - it ended in a burning wreck and I wasn't anywhere near ready for it; the damage sort of started a domino effect in my life that undid a lot of the progress I had made and left me struggling with anxiety, depression, ADD, alcoholism, and homelessness (my parents don't help me out since I don't identify as a mormon anymore). Fortunately my sister's boyfriend offered me an internship / job in my field right before I ended up on the streets, and I left my college life completely behind to try to start fresh and rebuild what I had lost. And while I feel like I've been slowly making progress, it's felt completely unreal to me just watching myself live my life - it's almost like i reverted back to my past self. I've also closed myself off to dating since the breakup (it's been about a year and a half since it happened), mainly because I'm just scared of letting someone damage me like that again. And I actually feel like that feeling isn't isolated to my romantic life; it's almost like I keep trying to put myself out there and getting burned every time I do, and I guess I'm just too sensitive to stand the heat. But I'm not happy in the cold. But yeah, TLDR, I started out without social anxiety, gained it (possibly as a result of PTSD?), became an adult and slowly overcame it again, then shit hit the fan and I'm back to square one (almost. square 3? lol). And I'm finding myself wondering, is it even *possible* for me to really escape this? It's just so weird to spend so much blood and tears to climb a mountain, only to have your footing suddenly give out and fall back down the way you came. Granted, I've still made progress - I'm socially capable enough to get by, but I still can't escape it when it hits me (and I can't figure out for the life of me what triggers it). Literally feels like there's some invisible being that just walks along when he feels like it and starts strangling my vocal cords / chest. And then I get to watch whoever I'm interacting with laugh at me as I pathetically attempt to hide it. I could really go on about this for hours, but in the interest of not scaring away 90% of my potential readers I'll just end the rant here :P Thanks for reading this far if you have

Side note: My biggest passion is music, and I'm trying to get into producing &amp; performing it (specifically electronic music), but I can't help but wonder if I won't be able to handle it because of my social anxiety. I can't think of anything that would make me happier than to play a song that I wrote and love in front of a crowd and watch them feel it like I do, but what if I buckle under the pressure? And then live a life wondering what could have been? Sometimes it seems like there's just no way to win"

As interviews for summer internships begin, I'm currently looking to investing in a new suit. Obviously as college student, I have a limited amount of money, so since Express is having a 40% off everything sale, I plan on buying from there.

As I look to what suit to buy, I see two styles: slim fit, and modern fit, as well as suits made of wool and sateen. As an accounting major, I need to make sure that I have a strong look, but also make a great first/business impression.

To be completely honest, I'm not sure what is the most business accepted style is, but I also want it to fit me perfectly. I was hoping MFA could help me out and give me some advice and information.

1xqjv0,1,2014-02-12,The Wife and Girls Night Out...,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/1xqjv0/the_wife_and_girls_night_out/,"alright guys/gals need some input on the steps I should take. Basically my wife is in her last semester of nursing school. She'll be 29 in a few weeks and I'll be 31 a few weeks after that. Been married 5 years together 8. I am a recent red pill convert in the past 3 months or so. We have a 2 year old girl.

Ok so found out last night wife is going on a girls night out with some nursing school classmates next Monday since they have it off. My wife almost never goes out unless it's with me or maybe to go wine tasting with her best friend.

I do not like this at all but haven't said or indicated anything. These girls are all single, mid twenties to mid thirties, some have multiple kids, and a lot of them ride the carousel hard. I've met a couple and one that I know is going is cock crazy. 

I know these girls are jealous of my wife deep down, she has the good looking husband who financially and mentally supports her through her schooling, she is top of her class, and she has a highly sought after internship with the local hospital.

My gut tells me my wife is going to become the target of these girls and knowing how bitchy girls are towards each other I could see them trying to set her up to fuck everything up.

What do you think I should do here?

My thought is to simply tell her that married women hanging out with single /divorced women is bad because of what I stated above. I would also state that I don't know most of these girls or the morals they have, but the ones I do know I don't approve of. I'd also like to know why she wants to hang out with these girls outside of school when she constantly complains about how much she hates everyone in her classes.  Whatever I do though I am going to make it damn clear that these girls nights out aren't going to become regular.

For clarification they are going to an upscale brewery on the marina. I don't know the time but it's likely going to be evening. So it's not exactly a club."

I'm currently a junior in college who is majoring in education and history with a minor in political science. I thought that I wanted to be a teacher, but as I'm getting more and more experience working in schools I'm thinking that teaching may not be what I want to do. Unfortunately, it’s too late to switch my major (not that I could have made the jump to being an engineer or something).

To give you a better idea of what kind of situation I'm in, I feel like I should probably provide some more specifics. I go to Northwestern University and I've managed to keep my grades pretty high (3.6-3.7 range). I spent the last summer working at an education technology start-up, where I basically did whatever they needed me too. I still spend a few hours a week working for them. During the year I work as the supervisor for the staff at the student center. I also volunteer and teach a health workshop in classrooms, and volunteer at the local high school as a tutor (although those are things that I imagine contribute more to a teacher resume than anything else).

I would describe myself as a strong reader, writer, and speaker. I also think I'm a pretty quick study and can pick most tasks up pretty quickly if I have solid instruction. But outside of those general traits, I can't really think of something that would make me employable, or something that people would want to pay me to do.

What skills do you think would be good to pick-up to just make me more marketable in general? I'm fooling around with learning a bit of coding, but other than becoming slightly more computer literate I don't know what else to do. If I don't want to be a teacher, I still want to be able to get a job out of college, but I feel like I don't know where to start. What are some good steps I can take to make sure I have a resume that's attractive in a variety of fields/what fields do you think might be particularly good for me to pursue an internship in? Help me, career gurus, I'm not sure what to do.

1xqqbx,3,2014-02-12,"Starting a new(ish) career, looking for advice on how to proceed finance wise",junh0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1xqqbx/starting_a_newish_career_looking_for_advice_on/,"Hello fellow /r/pf'ers,

I would like to ask this group for some advice.  Been a decent lurker and read the items on the sidebar but now I'm at a point where asking for advice seems like the next logical step.

Here's some context first.  Graduated two years ago from college in the Bay Area, worked at an internship making 18/hr for a year after.  Working currently as a contractor in another company making 25/hr.  

Now here's where things change a bit.  I recently got an offer for a full time gig at a big tech firm at 95k/yr with a 15k sign-on bonus.  Of course I accepted and will start in less than two weeks, right before my 27th birthday.


Regarding debt, I have student loans totaling 10.8k (5k at 3.4% and 5.8k at 6.8%) along with a credit card balance of 1.7k at 16.9% and 100 dollars at 13.9%.

My current expenses are rent (inc. utilities) at 600, helping parents pay mortgage at 400, student loans at 150, gas at 250, food at 200, eating out/drinking at 300, health insurance at 100.  Car insurance and cell phone is packaged with my family and my parents foot the bill, however I'd like to pay for those myself once I start the new job.  Car insurance is at 100/mo right now.  Car is paid off and I'm sure I can drive it for a few years without any problems other than routine maintenance.  Eating out and drinking is that high since I'm single and dating.

With the new job, the company provides a shuttle service to and from so I will be driving the car only to the dropoff location and so I expect gas expenses to drop significantly.

Now with all that said and done, I would like to ask how to proceed with setting things up so I am on the right track to retire well while being able to do things I want in the immediate future, such as traveling.  Goals would be able to purchase a home when it's the best decision for me.  I believe it would be in my early-mid 30's.  However that can change as my knowledge regarding that is not adequate, along with the fact that home prices in the Bay Area are a bit expensive.  Also I do love traveling and would like to travel a few times a year out of the country.

The company provides a 401k with full matching at 3%, increasing 1% each year to a max of 6%.  They also have an ESPP at 10% which I plan to max out.  So that leaves with the rest of the money to do with intelligently.  I do not have an IRA account as of yet but have read up on them and believe a Roth IRA is the way to go.

With the sign on bonus, I'd like to get rid of all the credit card debt and as much of the student loan debt while keeping an emergency fund.  Currently I have 1900 in a savings account for an emergency fund but I'd like to increase that to 5k then to 10k.

So fellow /pf'ers, how should I proceed?

P.S: First time posting to reddit so forgive me if the formatting is a bit rough.  If there's other information you need, please feel free to ask.  And sorry for the wall of text!

1xqsvy,1,2014-02-12,Job hunting Advice for B.A. telecommunications graduate,PAjobseeker16,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1xqsvy/job_hunting_advice_for_ba_telecommunications/,"Hello Reddit, I've read a lot great stories and posts on here (especially the life in a post subreddit) and I guess this would be my first post, please let me know if I did anything wrong in this post and I'll fix it when I get the chance. 
   
  Let me start with a little about my self. I recently graduated last May from Penn State. I'm 24 now. I've studied mass communications, international mass communications, video production, media programming, journalism, internet law and telecommunication management. I also have some experience in the physical layer of telecommunications having been an intern as an assistant to the telecom director of Comcast Spectacor, which was great I liked the work and I've been pursuing a career in the physical layer of communications. They liked me too. My Supervisor said I was the best intern she ever had. The IT dept. was asking me if I got considered for a position yet, but at the end of that internship they weren't hiring and since graduation it has been a grueling job hunt for the past 9 months. 

   I thought the telecommunication industry was a good field to get into that had potential for many recent college grads. Now it just feels like a crawl that's going nowhere and I've tried temp agencies, my school's career services, every job board I could find, I network every chance I get, I go to local job fairs and I've been waiting to go to the Philly job fair, but these recurring snow storms keep postponing it and I follow up week after week after submitting applications. It's exhausting and feel like I doomed for something I hate doing. I've been living with my grandmom for 14 months now and I hate the town and area of Royersford and Pottstown PA. No Internet either. There are some nice people, but my friends are an hour and a half drive away and there is not much to do in the area. 
  I took a part time pizza delivery job to pay some bills and I saved around $2,000, but I can't take it much longer. I hate washing dishes, handling peoples' food, the schedule the restaurant food industry itself and the fact that I spent over $80,000 on a college education and 5 years of my life and this is the only job I could get. That's a prime example of underemployment if you ask me. 
   Recently I've been strongly thinking about job hunting in (you're gonna hate me) Hawaii where some family offered me a place to stay a bit since I've had no luck here and my Uncle is an electrician and knows a bit about the field I want to get into. I applied to a few positions out there already but haven't heard any serious interview offers yet. I've also considered job hunting in broadcasting or something in media, but I despise the sensationalized American media outlets today (CNN, FOXNEWS, MSNBC). They've really lowered the bar on journalism, even though I do enjoy the Dailyshow and Colbert Report, their satire is gold. They are America's John Swift and Voltaire. 

So my bottom line questions are these. 
  One, after 9 months of jobhunting in one area should I take a risk in Hawaii for 2 months (yes it's beautiful, but expensive) somewhere else where I don't know many people? 
  Two, Should I consider changing my direction or industry in my job hunt? 
  Also a list of all the types of jobs my B.A. degree would qualify for would be very helpful since I feel my degree is pretty broad job wise and I asked this question to my school's career services counselor, she didn't help me at all.
 If that Hawaii trip doesn't work I'm coming back home and just apply for a manager position to JCPenny since I know someone that works there and hopefully be a good reference and fuck it I'll find a way to pay more money for education in getting my CCNA certification. I would like to get my foot in the door first with a job I want in telecomm and then get it, but at that point down the road I'll pay for it.

Any Advice would be helpful from people within the industry or anyone in general. I applied to line installer jobs, tower techs and recently Associate Network Analyst/engineer positions. Please let me know what am I doing wrong in this long quest for a job? All I want is to be independent with my own apartment with a job in telecommunications that provides an annual salary of at least 28k. That is my goal right now and it feels impossible. 

TL;DR Job hunting in telecomm field for 9 months, part time job is getting old and annoying, thinking about job hunting elsewhere and looking into broadcasting industry. Any advice would be most appreciated. Sorry if this post sounded like a venting of emotion, but I need help. Hope you have an awesome day."

A month before the breakup I was going through some hard personal times. My bf was not very supportive and when I finally found the silver lining he was almost jealous of my success. (That's a long story for a different day). I realize now that I don't want to marry this unsupportive kind of person but I just feel so awful about myself now. So devalued and defeated. I also feel jealous that he is doing just fine and enjoying his freedom so very much. I'm not a very strong person and I am turning down internships to move back home because I feel so depressed and like I'll never be whole again.

1xr3rv,1,2014-02-12,Wife and Girls Night Out,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/1xr3rv/wife_and_girls_night_out/,"Ok need some advice on what to do here please. I a fairly new convert in the last 3 months. Wasn't a total beta but definitely got soft over the years. Married 5 years together 8, wife is 29 I'm 31. We have a 2 year old.

Ok so wife told me she was going on a girls night out to a local high class brewery/bar with some of her nursing school classmates next week, her wanting to go out normally isn't a big deal if it's with her best friend or some other girls she has known since high school who are the straight laced type. It's pretty freakin rare that she ever wants to go. The problem here is that I really don't know these girls going. The only one I know is a mid thirties single mom who talks non-stop about cock. She's pretty hot too but you can tell she's been rode hard and put away wet. Based on what my wife has told me most of the other girls in her classes are mid twenties to mid thirties single/divorced women with kid(s) who like to ride the carousel and/or have lots of issues.

They are all jealous of my wife, she's nearly top of class, has a highly sought after internship, has a good looking very successful husband(me) who takes care of her, basically the good life.

I think she's gonna be a target. I don't like the idea of her drinking with these girls or even hanging out with them in general. Misery loves company and I can see a situation where they intentionally try to sabotage her. 

I'm trying to figure my move here. I'm thinking I just tell her that I don't know these other girls and the one I do know I don't approve of her hanging out with in that atmosphere. I'm also thinking of telling her that married women shouldn't be going out with single women because they'll be constantly egged on to let loose and just have a good time, the whole what happens here stays here mentality.

Or I could say nothing act as if I could care less and just let her go. 

What do you guys think?

[Given a relatively level playing field, IE Water deep enough for a shark to maneuver proficiently, yet shallow enough for a bear to stand and fight with his characteristic dexterity... Who would win in a fight between a bear and a shark?  Why?  ^...Can ^you ^please ^do ^an ^episode ^on ^this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtgfi?context=5)|A horse sized duck..
[Hi Jamie, big fan here. I've heard on the show that the legal team sometimes gives you and Adam a hard time about what kinds of testing you can't do because it might be too dangerous. Was there any particular time you got the green light to do something and then afterwards you were like ""I can't believe they let us do that""? Conversely was there any time that they would not allow you to do something that you thought was pretty harmless? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsw5j?context=5)|Hi, At this point we know we have to look after ourselves. 11 years of doing this shit and barely escaping intact- we have learned a thing or two. That is why we work with the bomb squad when it comes to explosives and even then we check everything ourselves as well. Insurance adjusters and safety consultants pick up the obvious stuff, but we are pretty much only dealing with the stuff on the periphery, where unexpected things happen. So we back off on things all the time.
[Hi Jamie! how much animosity, if any, is there between you and Adam? Do you ever hang out outside of shooting the show? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtwyu?context=5)|Since this seems to be coming up quite a bit here, for the record, Adam and I have done quite well by each other and have learned to have respect. We don't hang out, we don't like each other, but see that as an asset rather than a problem. There is no dishonesty, no meanness, no game playing, no emotion. Just get the job done. We both feel the other brings a lot to the game.
[What is that brown vest you always wear? Did you make that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdti3r?context=5)|It's goat. I did make it but I did not kill and eat the goat first. 
[Which co-host would you choose to be your companion in the zombie apocalypse and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdurcf?context=5)|I wouldn't choose a co host. My companion would be my double barreled, over under, belt fed full auto 12 guage shotgun with the belts crossing over each other as they go through the gun. One ammo case of deer slugs, one with buck shot, strapped to my back. Fucking zombies.
[We know you’re an inventor and that you love to build “weird shit”, so what has been your favorite thing to build, either on the show or off it? And did you ever get to build something with the giant magnets you talked about last year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsoz5?context=5)|I have not done anything with those giant magnets. You should check out Correlated Magnetics. [Link to www.correlatedmagnetics.com](http://www.correlatedmagnetics.com)
[Well, now you blew something up today. it's their server.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdu0q0?context=5)|Ooops.
[Although everyone else does, do you personally think you look like a walrus? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtn7d?context=5)|God, I hope not.
[If I were you right now, I'd be overwhelmed trying to sort through all of these questions (~850 in 30 minutes.\) I've also read about how you've been involved in a lot of different pursuits over the years. How do you keep from getting overwhelmed by an ever-increasing flow of information coming at you and keep cool enough to run a tv show, among so many other pursuits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdthf3?context=5)|Its hard to keep up with stuff, and I have trouble with it. It's all surreal to me; I am someone who doesn't socialize much, talk much, don't care to be on camera, and I don't do well handling more than one thing at a time. And yet my job for the last 11 years has been to do exactly those things. Go figure.
[Would you be willing to take part in that one-way ticket to Mars? FOR SCIENCE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsq63?context=5)|Yes.
[Did you ever have a moment on the show where you were really giddy about something but had to act all cool, like the straight man you're supposed to be in contrast to Adam's character? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsqtz?context=5)|No, I don't get giddy.
[Bullshit. You were pretty damn giddy when the dump truck plowed through the lines of cars.  Edit: Damn! I called bullshit on one of my heroes, the one and only Jamie Hyneman, and not only did he respond, he agreed. My week has peaked. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdua3n?context=5)|OK, you got me.
[Mythbusters is wildly popular and your budget is clearly impressive, allowing for amazing feats of engineering and comic gold.  That being said, with a literally infinite budget, what one project (expensive, impractical, insane, perhaps lacking morality, etc\) would you, Jamie Hyneman, like to undertake in your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdubic?context=5)|On my list right now is racing spiders - I have the design pretty complete, and a person will be able to ride them. They have 120 hp and will go as fast as motorcycles. I generally don't waste my time with projects that would require an infinite budget.  I do fantasize about taking up extreme sports when I get old; I figure I'll mount a lawn chair on the tip of a large rocket, sit on it with a parachute...you go up, you float back down. Or not. You wanna die in your bed?
[Hey Jamie,  What is your favorite tool/piece of tech that you use every day?  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsiuh?context=5)|The toilet. I mean, they are really underrated, you know? I am grateful every day when I have to use one- can you think of another tool that you  get really upset about when you don't have it when you need it?
[Jamie, big fan of the show!  What is your favourite thing you have built on the show? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdthbu?context=5)|I don't have a favorite, but the dump truck with the cow catcher plowing through a line of cars -aired on Jan. 11 was right up there.  
[Could you ever do an episode focused purely on potatoes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtqxm?context=5)|Hmmm. That's interesting.
[Will you fight me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfduqb6?context=5)|How big are you? Can I use a baseball bat?
[Hi, and greetings from snowy Finland. Just wanted (as car enthusiast\) to ask what cars you own? What is favorite one? What is one you would like to own but not possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfduacy?context=5)|I drive a Prius- would drive any car that does not use much fuel. Cars are tools as far as I am concerned. I like tools that work well and last. I would want one I designed and built myself. It would fly, not use much fuel, never break down.
[Who pressured you into doing this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfduqf7?context=5)|Like I said, Magnets, bitches!
[You and Adam have been RC-ing full sized cars since literally day one of Mythbusters. Why didn't you RC the truck for the recent ""Traffic Ram"" myth?  (Hopefully this still gets answered, I got it in early, but apparently the AMA was in the wrong sub before\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsp8v?context=5)|We deemed the truck safe enough to actually be in there. Also, radio controlling a truck with 12 gears is difficult.
[Hi Jamie, I'm a giant fan of Mythbusters and was very happy to see your recent tour in San Francisco!  What more do you think can be done to introduce building/engineering/science in general to girls?  Do you believe Mythbusters is doing as much as you want in terms of being engaging to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsni7?context=5)|Thanks for your question, wintersage. Here's your video answer: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2NiBiqhzo8)
[Scotch or bourbon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdugwh?context=5)|Bourbon. Definitely. Bourbon is for real men.
[Are you an ass or a tit man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdu1bg?context=5)|Are you kidding me? I want it all.  
[Hi Jaime! I just wanted to say that I am a huge fan. I have heard you are a big reader and like science fiction. I am wanting to get into the genre so I was wondering if you had science fiction books you would recommend reading?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsueo?context=5)|I like Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon, Master and Margherita by  Blugakov, Much of Lem... So much good stuff out there. I haven't read any sci fi really since starting Mythbusters because science and tech that is not fictional is so much to keep up with and just as fascinating.
[I want to try a stunt, I want to know if you fell from 10,000 feet without a parachute into water, is there any way you can land to sustain minimal injury? And how deep does the water need to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdty34?context=5)|Flap my arms really, really fast.
[For the Myth where you tested the ancient Torpedo, your hydro-forming techinique was literally *amazing*, i was speechless, especially after watching your attempts to use a jackhammer to forge it. Brilliant Eureka-moments like that are why i continue to watch you show after a decade.  Was the idea of hydro-forming something that you discovered while researching the problem, or was this something you just pulled from your scientific bag of tricks? how long did it take to create the form, and how many mistakes did they have to edit out (be honest\) before your shell-making started to work that perfectly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdw6mv?context=5)|Thank you so much for that question. That kind of experimentation is what I  enjoy most on the show. I had seen a YouTube video of hydro-forming a much smaller thing simply by inflating it with water and so decided to try it. The process was pretty much exactly as t happened on the show. There was not much editing required.
[What happens to the pig carcasses you guys use after you're finished shooting canon balls at them or blowing them up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsk7w?context=5)|We eat them. 250 degrees overnight, and the meat falls off the bone.
[What ever happened to *Blendo* ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtl99?context=5)|Blendo is still around and went on the Behind the Myths tour with me and Adam.
[Waffles or pancakes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdu3sg?context=5)|Pancakes.
[Did testing the Oculus Rift goggles make you want to get into gaming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtup9?context=5)|No, but it was interesting testing it: [Link to www.tested.com](http://www.tested.com/tech/455063-jamie-hyneman-tests-oculus-rift-virtual-reality-goggles/)
[Do you ever do any programming for the robots you build, or does part of your team handle it? I'm a programmer, and would love to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsy1f?context=5)|They’re mostly puppeted. They’re rarely programmed. It’s more fun that way.
[Is there anything left that you'd like to be certified to do that you can't do right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfduhm2?context=5)|I don't know. I need more magnets, though.
[ of all, I'd like to say thank you for doing this. I love MythBusters, and i think you do a great job on it.  In Adam's AMA, he said you have a very dark sense of humor. Here on Reddit, the darkest of jokes are welcomed and appreciated. What is the darkest joke you know of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdvc4l?context=5)|You don't want to know what that joke is.
[Hey, love the show. Did you blow something up today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdte79?context=5)|No.
[Jamie, I saw you in NYC at the Beacon Theatre a few months ago when you did you live show with Adam. I was the one 20-something amongst the sea of kids and their parents. I had a tremendous amount of fun, you guys did a great job, so thank you! That paintball gun was insane, can you tell me how you built it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsmje?context=5)|It's all plywood except for the guns, and it's mounted on a trailer from Harbor Freight.
[What's one myth you've always wanted to test but couldn't, due to financial/legal/safety/etc reasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdvmmz?context=5)|Thanks, H04X. Here's a video answer to your question: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1LMWCHQiNI)
[What is the most extreme thing, whether you killed an animal or bungee jumped naked, that you have done outside of mythbusters? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdvn9s?context=5)|I don't know if it is the most extreme, but it was up there: we bungee jumped for apples a couple of months ago. Adam barfed after a couple of runs so I had to do it, and I don't like heights. Awful. OH, that was for Mythbusters... Uh, I have been through two hurricanes on a boat in the Caribbean (not at the same time). 
[After somebody uses the transporter in Star Trek, are they the same person, or does reconstituting them out of different molecules mean they're a different person and the original version ceases to exist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdwak5?context=5)|Yes.
[Do you prefer cats or dogs Jamie? BTW thanks for doing another AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdt9dk?context=5)|[Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/JamieNoTweet/status/400778001031254016/photo/1)
[I've heard from your previous AMA as well as on Tested that you're quite the movie prop aficionado.  Of your collection, which prop was the hardest to find (or has the best story\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdvms2?context=5)|I actually am not a movie prop afficionado, that is Adam. The only things I collect are tools. Adam is the prop collector. I do have a number, but because I made them professionally or they were done by my co workers.  
[I'm also an engineering freshman! I asked roughly the same thing somewhere down the line.  Please respond! It would be awesome to work with you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdtmy3?context=5)|No, it is too dangerous to have interns.
[I've named my vagina Jamie Hymen, tho to be honest, I'll never be able to achieve your incredible mustache.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdvth2?context=5)|My mustache is actually prehensile.
[As a person who associates with the freethought/atheism movement's how has this affected you and how do you feel about living so close to the scientology HQ ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xqull/i_am_jamie_hyneman_cohost_of_mythbusters/cfdsvju?context=5)|I am not aware of any scientology HQ nearby. Atheism or Agnosticism or whatever movement doesn't affect me at all. I don't believe in anything.  There are only probabilities, and the probability of a diety or some shit is pretty fucking low IMHO.

1xrd5p,2,2014-02-12,Opportunities outside of Big 4 Tax?,tacksguy,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1xrd5p/opportunities_outside_of_big_4_tax/,"I am still deciding whether or not I want to do tax or audit after I finish my degree. I'm currently doing a tax internship at a big 4 firm in a specialty group. While I was taking my fundamentals of income tax course, I really enjoyed it. It kicked my ass but I ended up doing very well. I'm doing my internship now and I've come to realize, compliance sucks! I'm interested in looking into the code to determine what stance to take on tax issues. 

Anyway, I was looking into opportunities after 3-5 years at Big 4, and it seems that Big 4 Audit has a lot more options as far as career development. I'd like for you guys to chime in as to what kind of career opportunities are available after big 4 tax. 

Thanks in advance."

* Cap Markets Credit Risk Internship
* Back-Office Internship
* .Net Developer Internship x2

I have very little room on my resume and only go into detail on the first three, the remaining two are just single lines with the company name and position title &amp; dates worked.

I feel like having the tech development experience is a huge advantage and makes me stand out strongly, however I have heard mixed reviews and some people have recommended I leave it off.

Not sure what to do. I would even take the back-office internship off if it wasn't for the Big 5 Bank name.

1xrsq3,3,2014-02-12,[For Hire] 2014 CS Grad Looking for Sales Engineering / Sales / Engineering / Anything! Can go anywhere!,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1xrsq3/for_hire_2014_cs_grad_looking_for_sales/,"Hi! I really appreciate you looking at this!

I'm 21, based out of Ohio, and I'm looking to pack up my things and join your company!

I will be graduating in May with a B.A. in Computer Science from Denison University, a small, private Liberal Arts college. I am completely open to working / training for you before that happens.  

*I am passionate about technology*, and I would love to join a company who shares this passion. Another passion of mine is being able to take really complex things, and explain them in layman's terms. This is why I'm primarily looking at Sales Engineering, as I would love to be able to travel with a sales team and be able to talk in depth about the technical aspects of a product. I feel that I could also do very well in sales, but I understand that my lack of any formal experience in sales doesn't help that claim. While I am a CS major, I don't feel that my calling is in development. While the mental puzzles offered by coding do intellectually stimulate me, I don't feel that I could be serve your company by sitting at a terminal all day crunching code. 

**About me:**  

I have technical experience. I spent last summer in San Diego working as a backend server intern for a travel agency data consolidation company. I mostly worked with SQL, and the data analysis was done with Crystal Reporting. In my computer science courses, I have learned C++ and Python, with some minor experience in C, Java, and Ruby. I have set up a few websites, and I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails. 

I have extensive leadership experience. For example, I was the Vice President of the student body, and have served on the student government for all 4 years. I served on the Presidential Selection Committee, which has the honor of screening possible presidential candidates. I am an Eagle Scout. I will walk first at graduation because I am the Senior Co-Governor, and announce the class gift, which I have been working all year to fundraise for. I started my own organization on campus, whose mission it was to foster interpersonal relationships between students, and create a campus culture of respect and appreciation. I am a proud member of Beta Theta Pi, of which I served as the secretary. I was just nominated for the Distinguished Leadership Award, which is given to less than 30 graduating seniors for their accomplishments on campus. 

I am a very creative person. I work on campus in the media lab, where I tutor students on creative applications such as Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Logic. I actively read and write. I am very involved in my community. The summer after my sophomore year I spent in service, counseling juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program centered around a community garden. 

I am ready and excited to work for you. I value work ethic and I value the relationships I form. I can relocate to anywhere you are based. I value professional mannerism, but I feel that I can liven up any office. 

Thank you so very much for looking at my posting. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me via pm and I can send you my resume. 

Thank you!"

I already registered with my university's coop office so they are actively looking for positions for me, which should reveal themselves in the upcoming weeks.

Besides the big local companies in my area, any ideas on how to find good internships for a uni-student?

1xsgj6,4,2014-02-13,I [24 F] have been experiencing loss of libido towards my long-distance boyfriend [26 M] of 13 months.,halpmerhonda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xsgj6/i_24_f_have_been_experiencing_loss_of_libido/,"We began dating in January 2013. He is a current grad student and I recently finished my undergrad in December 2013. 

Our sex life was amazing, incredible, mind-blowing, throughout the spring semester of 2013, despite living 2 hours away. We saw each other about every other weekend. This past summer left us living 7 hours apart, but we would meet at our hometown in between the cities we were living in almost every weekend. Despite our busy weekday schedules and the 10 hours of driving for myself each weekend (and 4 hours for him), our sex life was still really good. It was difficult to have privacy as we were staying at one of our parent's houses when we were together but it was still fantastic when we could sneak away and we were both enthusiastic about being intimate. 

The last week before school started (in August 2013), I drove to his college town (only 2 hours away) to spend that last week of summer with him. It was preceding my last semester in my undergrad, and I took a lot of hours and had an internship, so I knew we wouldn't get to see each other as frequently as we had in the past. He was extremely drunk most of the time I was there - as in passed-out before dinnertime. He hadn't seen his college friends all summer, so I understand that he missed them so I didn't bring it up to be fair to him. 


He didn't ask me to go on a date the entire time, so I planned one. Knowing about the date, he agreed to meet up with his brother without asking me at all if I would prefer to hang out with him and his sibling. I then planned another date so we could at least spend a little quality time together. He was waaaay drunk the whole time we were out on this date but we had a great time, so no harm, no foul. 

I bring all this up as this week is when my sex drive just wasn't the same as it was. I loved sex before but this week he didn't seem interested in foreplay and we really didn't ever cuddle or do other things to emotionally or physically connect. We had sex once or twice at the beginning of the week but it felt mechanical and not full of love or passion.

After the initial lackluster and robotic sexual encounters that week, compounded by his attitude, I couldn't get excited about having sex again during the remainder of that visit. He kept bugging me (putting my hand on his erection in his room, hinting that we should go lay down, etc) for sex several times a day and would get frustrated when I said I didn't feel like it. I feel that lead to him trying to initiate sex more and more, which made me feel all the more anxious and shut down. 

We later talked about the pre-fall semester week and how my feelings were really hurt from his behavior, and he was defensive but then agreed that we should work on our bond if we spend time together by going on dates or just us hanging out alone. He brought up how I wasn't interested in sex that week and asked ""Are we (as in our relationship) getting old?"" and I told him that his behavior was hurtful and didn't make me feel turned on. Since that week, his attention to me and his drinking haven't ever been a problem since. We have quality time almost every day I am in his city and he has one or two drinks a night. I feel like all the issues since that week have been resolved entirely except for the sex thing.


We didn't see each other much during the fall '13 semester as we were both so busy. When we did have time to visit each other, my perception of our sex lives had changed. I still felt stressed and unenthused about sex, even though I had forgiven him for his behavior that week. He drinks only moderately now and every single weekend we are together we do fun stuff together, like go on dates, take our dog to the park and play sports. However, I still felt/feel paralyzed when it comes to sex. Whenever he starts trying to initiate, even now, I automatically feel uptight and not into it. 


I get anxious when I am getting ready to go to bed, because I want to cuddle and be physically intimate, but I always stress and then I have to turn him down, which leads to both of us being frustrated. That makes me feel really terrible as I really do want to have sex and I know it hurts his feelings and makes him feel rejected each time he tries to start turning me on. I don't know what is wrong with me. It's like I can't control it, and I can't relax, even when I consciously try to relax and get into the mood, my body/mind won't listen. I am so over that week, and have been for months and months now, and on top of that, I am really proud that we communicated about it and things have been incredible on an emotional level since then. 


I started to get worried when we were together 24/7 for a month over christmas, and I felt sure that I would be able to relax and things would go back to normal, and we only had sex a few times. During school, I thought maybe I felt too pressured to relax during small windows of time (one weekend per month) that we were together, or that I was having a hard time letting go of external stress from school and graduation stuff, and that was carrying over into our sex life. 

I want to go visit him soon. I miss him so much but I have been avoiding it because I don't want to be hurtful by turning away when I feel him getting turned on or explaining to him again that I love him but I am not in the mood. I feel so ashamed because I love him so much and I want to have sex, but there is an unknown obstacle there and I don't know what is going on. I feel like we are falling into a hurtful cycle where he pursues me, and I turn him down, which makes him pursue me more, which leads to me getting stressed out from being pressured, which leads to me rejecting him. Recently he has expressed that he really misses making out, cuddling and having sex, as do I. We have both recently been stressed, and lashing out at each other instead of going to each other for support, and I can speak for myself when I say I feel….disconnected or something. I think this lack of sex and nearness is impacting both of us, emotionally and sexually. It's not healthy and I don't want to do this to myself or him anymore. I am open to any advice, particularly on trust-building from a sexual perspective. 


**tl;dr**: I [24 F] had an outstanding and loving sexual relationship for the first 8 months of my relationship with boyfriend, [26 M]. Some non-major things happened that made me lose trust in him about 5 months ago and our sex-life has never recovered, despite my hurt feelings being healed months ago. I attributed it to a long-distance relationship and external stressors impacting our sex life, but after spending a month together recently I am worried. We are slipping into a cycle of rejection in the bedroom and I need some strategies to help stop it. I, personally, am interested in learning how to be more sexually/emotionally vulnerable so I can be a better girlfriend and lover, and also would like to hear any advice on how to rebuild trust and intimacy with a partner so that my SO and I can strengthen our relationship. Any insight on what you think might be going on and how to help me is very much appreciated. Thank you so much. "

1xsyk7,1,2014-02-13,[Request] Youtube fame and fans,[deleted],pbsideachannel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pbsideachannel/comments/1xsyk7/request_youtube_fame_and_fans/,"tl;dr: something changes in the way we think of and treat people once they become internet-famous.  It's almost the same as what happens when they become traditionally famous, but it's so close to home, it makes me wonder whether we should re-think this whole ""celebrity"" thing.  Sorry this post is crazy-long.

After looking into [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1xs45h/realtotalbiscuit_total_biscuit_of_youtube_fame/), comments from /u/realtotalbiscuit_ , /u/uberwolf0, and a few others in both the original and the bestof posts, I am interested in seeing how fan access to famous people is changing the already double-edged nature of fame.  

Much has been said already about the consequences of fame.  Actors, writers, musicians, politicians and others all get the benefit - the thrill of the spotlight - followed by all of the negative attention that comes with the territory.  The press digs into your private life, looking for anything interesting enough to sell alongside ads, and it's just business.  Critics and fans constantly judge you for your entire body of work, never miss a mistake, and expect more and more from you as you just do what you love for a living.  We've even seen a few famous explain in great depth why [celebrity culture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKboLTwzFTs) is so twisted.

But the audience is separated from traditional celebrities.  We see them on their chosen medium, say television, only as often as they are published on that medium, say once a week for 13 weeks in a season.  Beyond that we might see them for a few minutes during award shows and in interviews or ""lifestyles of"" specials.  If their PR team is good, you can leave a message for an intern when you send your favorite celebrity an email or letter or gift, you might follow them on Twitter, but you can never really be sure the interaction is genuinely *them*.  Sometimes we get lucky and learn something about traditional celebrities when they show us what they're really like ([for example](https://twitter.com/officialjaden)).

Now look at Youtube ""celebrities"" who are obviously just ""real people"" unlike traditional celebrities, polished and unattainable as they seem to be every time we get a peek into their lives.  Whether the internet-famous get that way by producing particular content (like /u/realtotalbiscuit_), sharing a window to their real lives (like /u/uberwolf0), or if they are accidentally thrust into the spotlight because someone decided to post a crazy video to the internet (like [these people](http://www.today.com/news/viral-accident-7-folks-who-didnt-mean-be-famous-6C10980738) for intstance), they get a special kind of fame because they are so much closer to their fans.  

Internet anonymity soon turns to people knowing your real-life identity.  It might affect your home, your job, your relationships, to a degree you weren't prepared for.  But the traditional celebrities at least have piles of money to distract them from these kinds of strains, while the internet-famous might get lucky enough to make a living off of their celebrity if they choose that path.  Inevitably, the people who love to watch you and talk about you start turning toward you with the same criticism they show traditional celebrities, but instead of a PR team reading it, it's you directly receiving this feedback.  Interaction with the audience is a common aspect of Youtube fame, but it can really get dangerous if you attract the wrong kind of attention.

Is the audience a bigger threat to the internet-famous?  Is the ""celebrity culture"" the same even if the celebrity isn't?  Do people deserve the kind of attention they receive whether they wanted it or not?  Should they just have a thick skin or should we re-think how we treat people who happen to captivate us?  Should our privacy laws be re-tooled for all kinds of celebrities?  What does it say about us when anybody can attain this kind of celebrity and we treat them so differently once they do?"

So I'm a junior in college at a pretty good midwest public school. This is my second year living in my fraternity's house, I'm out to everyone. I love my roommate he's super cool, totally 100% happy with me being gay and everything. I hate living in the house though, it's always nasty, there's SO much negative energy I feel like from everyone. I don't know how much longer I can take it (I know only a few more months…). I have pretty bad OCD and generalized anxiety, I see a therapist once a week but I feel like it's not getting better really. I also take an SSRI daily. I wake up everyday feeling so anxious and so unhappy. I constantly have bad dreams that wake me up. I came out to my parents in October - I thought they would be super supportive because they're very liberal and whatnot but they've been INCREDIBLY passive aggressive about the whole thing, especially my mom. Ive been seeing my boyfriend now for over 6months and I feel like he's the only happy thing I have in my life at all. The past few semesters I've been doing poorly in school (~3.2 average) I'm majoring in math and economics. I've applied to 30 internships and have pretty much been rejected by every single one. I feel so worthless, I feel like I can't do anything, I feel so stupid and dumb for not being able to get an internship. I know it's the wrong thing to do, but part of me just wants to up and leave school, it's been so disappointing recently. I work my ass off in everything but all that ever has been happening is that I'm doing bad in school and getting fat. I hate it. Also there's this girl that is like in love with me, that doesn't stop bothering me, and makes me feel really guilty. I seriously can't stand it. I feel out of control of my emotions sometimes too (like now). I don't know what to do. I'm so sad and disappointed in myself and angry. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just really anxious and upset now and needed someplace to talk about it all."

As I'm sure you're all aware, interview season has been underway for the Summer 2014 internship term, and I have been in the thick of it!

I'm in second year of space systems engineering, but I managed to get an interview for a competitive defence contractor (live in Canada).

I prepared immensely, cleaned up, and learned my tech terminology...

Then I blanked, rambled, and bored the interviewer with irrelevant experience.

The position was filled by another applicant, and I was upset, but I definitely did not deserve it after that interview.

HOWEVER. I just received word that I have an interview for a satellite design contractor (my dream job), and I am motivated by my past failure to not ruin this chance for myself.


Does anyone have experience interviewing for the space industry, or even any high-technology jobs?

The job posting only mentioned interest in attitude determination and control, Matlab/Simulink, as well as engineering extracurriculars (which I have a tonne of).

Any tips would be greatly appreciated, I am generally pretty personable and genuine, but I don't want to drop the ball again.."

Just posting the question is fine, but posting what you're trying to learn about the candidate by asking the question is great. It can be a programming question, an OO question, or anything really.

Thanks."

1xte4h,1,2014-02-13,"Historical Fiction, critique please?",drivinganindievan,AmateurWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurWriting/comments/1xte4h/historical_fiction_critique_please/,"Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.

The click of three pairs of boots stepping in perfect sync with each other cracked like gunshots, echoing in the tall, arching entryway to la camera dei dolori.  A trio of khaki and olive green-clad men-in-uniform were calmly, yet purposefully, striding towards a large oaken door set into the stone. 

The man in front was named Adolf Hitler.  The name, though innocuous enough, would soon be etched into the world’s book of infamy.  A rather brusque man, he was clean cut and his haughtiness demanded attention, even though he was of average size and not someone you would normally give a second glance to while walking on the street.  He had the loud voice of someone who was used to having to make himself heard; having ten siblings often commanded that.  German by blood and Jewish by birth, Hitler took pride in his nation first and always, but his mother’s religion was never as important to him.  As he was now the Chancellor of Germany, he had only the world to gain.  He carried a leather briefcase, emblazoned with the crest of the Third Reich.  The briefcase held the outline for his plan: segregation, isolation, and extradition. 

He stopped short of the door, slowing to a halt, eyeing the entryway with trepidation.  The portal before him seemed to grow larger with every beat of his heart.  Hitler turned to examine his entourage: his right hand man, Franz Von Papen, and alongside him, a small, nervous, young-looking translator that was brought along solely for this meeting and was expendable.

Von Papen was a taller man, with trimmed black hair and a mustache that would rival that of the world’s greatest carnival barker.  He held a sheaf of paper bound by a manilla folder stamped with the bold red word “vertraulich”.  It was this set of paperwork that outlined his plan for the Hunger Plan - a plan not even his superior knew fully.  This plan to eradicate his precious Germany of all problems, religious and political, was one that he knew would have to be presented carefully in the right setting.  Von Papen had severed his ties to these people: his Jewish grandmother died in the crossfire of the First World War, his Gypsy sister was disowned and those people he once called his parents were dead - victims of an “accidental” train crash outside Markdorf five years prior.  The fact that Von Papen had a hand in their murders was twisted, yes, but was he sorry?  Not in the slightest.

The third man in their party, a translator, was a younger man named Joseph Goebbels.  His actual position was intern to der Fuhrer, but nevertheless, he was chosen to be a translator for this occasion because of his knowledge of Italian.  He was confused at the reason why he had been brought along; there were plenty of other, more capable translators enlisted in the Nazi ranks, men with more experience and less fear.  But Hitler had chosen him personally, treating him almost like a son.  Joseph was not one to complain or question authority - he was well indoctrinated.  He grasped onto another briefcase, this one holding - what he so willingly believed - Hitler’s personal effects and miscellaneous papers.  Why he needed a bag such as this for a political meeting, he didn't know.  Nor did he ask; he knew better than to question der Fuhrer.  Sieg heil.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Many people, including apparently the NY Times, feel like SXSW has become a corporate cash grab and strayed very far from its indie roots. Do you think that's fair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefzpv?context=5)|SXSW is a big tent. Everyone, including the press, make choices of what to attend.  We play hollywood films and first-time films from undiscovered talents. We have big name artists and bands you have never heard of. SXSW is a for-profit company and has sponsors of all sizes. -JN.
 |Big Tent is right. There's SO MUCH going on at SXSW.  There's work in all shapes and sizes  for all tastes.  On the film side, we show tons of new talent and films we feel are real discoveries.  If journalists and bloggers gravitate to the more mainstream or commercial events, we can't do anything about that.  We would love more attention on the unknowns...there are lots of them here. (JP)
[So what does SXSW pay filmmakers for screening their work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeggzz?context=5)|Like the other top tier premiere film festivals, sxsw film doesn't pay filmmakers directly to screen their work. We've created a highly desirable environment where there's great opportunity for different kinds of transformative possibilities for the filmmakers.  And it must be working as submissions keep increasing. (JP)
[I've noticed a trend in SXSW's film programming (and elsewhere\) the last few years of programming increasingly commercial film. Why do you showcase movies by already enormously successful filmmakers ? This year, Jon Favreau, David Gordon Green, Nicholas Stoller, Veronica Mars guy,  all have films at SXSW. Isn't the point of a festival like SXSW to introduce audiences to filmmakers they might not get a chance to see otherwise? And by giving precious slots away to bigger films, aren't you hindering the discovery of new talent? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfef80r?context=5)|SXSW Film has always had a strong balance of established and new filmmakers.  This year we're presenting 70 first time filmmakers!  It's a core principle for us.  But we love and celebrate good films from filmmakers at all stages of their careers. -JP.
[What is your best advice for someone looking to move from house management/box office into programming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfehsre?context=5)|Programming is a highly desirable job, and often not a job at all.  Many programmers around the world work freelance or for low pay and in many cases, they've created their own screening events.  At SXSW Film, the programming team is a small group of fulltime SXSW Film staff who all have other serious job responsibiltes.  Like Jim, who answered already, runs out digital content, and  is an international liaision, as well as being a programmer.   There are volunteer opportunities to help with the screening process. It's highly selective and we tend to work with with screeners who've become known to us through other respected film circles in Austin. (JP)
[What are the top qualities you look for in a programmer? (Or to the actual programmers in the group: what skills do you possess that you find most valuable to you in your line of work?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfehsre?context=5)|Skills? Know film. Seems obvious, but it doesn’t just mean everything post-Star Wars.  It means breathing cinema. *All cinema*, from every time period and every country. Be a cinephile. Watch [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Film:_An_Odyssey). You have a responsibility to understand the lifeblood of the film profession - the art of film - because people are trusting you to act as a gatekeeper.  Take it seriously.
[What is one piece of advice that you have learned in life that is unique or surprising? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfef3mi?context=5)|Biz advice: An email sent is not an email read. Saved my ass a lot. -RF.
 |Be flexible with your plans, they don't always turn out the way you expect, but it almost always works out! - GVA.
 |If it's broke, fix it. - jn.
[What would a couple pointers you would give to a SXSW newbie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefi4g?context=5)|Make a plan in advance and be open to changing it all at any minute. Wear comfortable shoes, eat semi-healthy, go to parties and the conference, walk into films you know nothing about and just have fun and let SXSW wash over you like a warm blanket! oh and eat lots of breakfast tacos. :) -JN.
 |Read the [First Timer’s Guide](http://sxsw.com/first-timers-guide) on our website!   -JK.
 |There are so many great things to check out! Make sure you look over all our materials ahead of time to prevent the sense of overwhelming awesomeness you'll have on your first day. Here are some highlights! - CG.
 |SFA and HIDEOUT LOUNGE Visit the Film Hub at the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin. We'll have daily happy hours each day and the SXSW Film Late Night Saloon every night of the conference. This is close to our Paramount, State and Ritz theaters.
 |SXSW Film Hideout Lounge presented by Dailymotion is a great place to grab coffee and get some free Wi-Fi. They also have happy hours every evening from 5pm-7pm for the first 5 nights of the festival.
 |[VENUE STATUS BOARD](http://vsb.sxsw.com) We’ll be continually updating the Venue Status Boards (or VSB) in the SXSW GO App, online at vsb.sxsw.com and at large info boards at downtown venues throughout the event with the line status information for every screening at the festival.
 |[SHUTTLES](http://sxsw.com/shuttles) The Film Festival Shuttle is free to Film, Gold and Platinum registrants and runs a circuit servicing most of the Film Festival Venues from Friday, March 7 through Saturday, March 15. An absolute MUST use.
 |[KEYNOTES](http://sxsw.com/film/sessions/keynotes) We have Film Keynotes for the first time, so be sure to check out Lena Dunham, Jason Blue, Casey Neistat, and Marc Webb.
 |Kickass [TRADE SHOW](http://sxsw.com/trade-shows/about)
 |[MENTORS](http://sxsw.com/film/sessions/about) These Film Conference Sessions are some of our most popular! You have to sign up in advance, you you'll get the chance for one-on-one interactions with experts in film related fields. Basically it's a 10 minute speed date with a film professional.
 |[AWARDS SHOW](http://sxsw.com/film/awards/about) The 2014 SXSW Film Awards will take place on Tuesday, March 11 at 8pm at the Paramount Theater and are emceed by the awesome Jerrod Charmichael.
 |[PARTIES](http://schedule.sxsw.com/?conference=film&amp;event_type=party) &amp; [LOUNGES](http://sxsw.com/lounges) Make the most of your time at our fest by building your network!
 |We've also got a ton of killer [Convergence](http://sxsw.com/convergence-about) programming this year - between [SXsports](http://sxsw.com/sxsports), Future of Entertainment at the Driskill and all the big sessions in Room 18ABCD &amp; Ballroom D, a Film badge will get you access to a fantastically broad range of cool shit. -RF.
[What qualities does a truly great film have, in your opinion? What moves you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfegfuu?context=5)|Most of the time, you just know. It’s a gut reaction, but it can be for any number of reasons.  Pure artistry, originality (especially originality), insight, and reminding us that there are still things that haven’t been done within 90 minutes of screen time.  Oh, and originality. (JK)
 |I agree with Jim.  For me, if I am still thinking about a film the day or two (or week) after I have seen it then a film has had an effect on me.  That in my mind, is what makes a great film. -AN.
[Janet, you were kind enough to chat with me when I recognized you in a coffee shop last year. You didn't even blink when I randomly asked you for a high-five. Proof: Link to vimeo.com  So thanks for that!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefnr9?context=5)|Holy crap this is our new favorite video, thanks for sharing &amp; making Janet a star!!! - RF.
[Hi, just curious is Jason Bateman planning on coming for the premiere Bad Words?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefb6n?context=5)|He'll be here and we're stoked! He's also doing ""A Conversation"" session in our Conference on Saturday, 3/8 @ 2:00pm in room 16AB of the ACC. A Film, Gold or Platinum badge will get you in. details on the Bad Words premiere &amp; his panel are at [Link to schedule.sxsw.com](http://schedule.sxsw.com) -RF.
[Thank you! Is there a list of other directors and actors doing conversations about theirs films?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefote?context=5)|We just announced a bunch [yesterday](http://sxsw.com/film/news/2014/final-keynote-additional-films-schedule-live), and the complete schedule is now [live](http://schedule.sxsw.com/?conference=film). Plus our new [keynotes](http://sxsw.com/film/sessions/keynotes) are super exciting. Peruse away! - RF.
[Why only one screening of Boyhood and at 10:30am on a Sunday? Such a high profile movie and Austin filmmaker should have a more prestigious screening time. I'm volunteering and can't make it due to it being during my hours and it was one of the films I was most looking forward to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeffsx?context=5)|BOYHOOD is in distribution via IFC Films and they are limiting the number of screenings because of the upcoming theatrical release. You will have a chance to see it then if you can't make our screening. We love the film and are over the moon that we can show it. We don't agree that Sunday at 10:30 isn't a prestigious time slot - it is! It's a nearly three hour film. Last year we had a fantastic screening of MUD then with Matthew McConaughey in attendance. Sorry if this doesn't work in your particular schedule. The film is utterly amazing. - JP.
[Is it still eligible to have another screening as an Audience Awarded Festival Favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefxto?context=5)|We expect so, unless something comes up that we're not aware of. We'll know more if it actually wins. -JP.
[Is The Raid 2 going to be the same cut that played at Sundance? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeg4zz?context=5)|It will be a little different as we re playing the theatrical cut. That means it's a little tighter cut and the blood is a little darker, but it still kicks some major ass. - JN.
[In your opinion, where are the best seats in the paramount?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeg6nz?context=5)|4 rows up in the middle on the balcony - JN.
 |I'd say just in front of the balcony, on the lower level. But that's mostly because I'm a middle row/middle seat kinda gal. -RF.
 |If you sit in the front of the balcony you'll have more legroom and no one in front of you! - CG.
 |From the projection booth ;) (GVA)
 |I prefer the orchestra seats on the ground floor almost anywhere.  LOVE seeing movies at the Paramount. -JP.
[Would you say that sxsw is beneficial to local actors looking to network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefcf1?context=5)|100% beneficial. SXSW Film brings together such a great creative community, and interacting in a really casual environment. A badge gets you access to all the films, informative conference sessions and things like one-on-one mentor sessions &amp; awesome parties. Totally worth the investment in our humble opinion... -RF.
[Do you get to see the films in some form or another before choosing which ones to premiere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeehgu?context=5)|Absolutely we watch the films before we choose! That's HOW we know what strikes us and grabs our attention.  It's a big task though - we had 6,500 submissions to sift through this year in a limited time window. - JP.
[For each of the gang: What's the one movie (or filmmaker\) over the years you really hoped would blow up from the festival but, due to whatever reason, sadly did not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfef601?context=5)|The programming team all really loved CHARLIE CASANOVA a few years back and had high hopes for it. - JP.
 |There are so many, honestly. I was a huge fan of American Animal a few years ago - it was visceral and wild and Matt D'Elia's directing/writing/acting voice totally caught my attention, but it was definitely not for everyone. We also really loved Dan Mazer's I Give it A Year - a total flip on the standard rom com and Rose Byrne, Rafe Spall, Simon Baker &amp; Anna Faris were terrific. - RF.
 |Chris Thompson’s Jeff (AKA The Jeffrey Dahmer Files) is masterful filmmaking, much more subtle than the subject matter suggests.  Watch the film on Netflix - you’ll be blown away. - JK.
 |A personal favorite of mine last year was a film called 'Everyone is Going to Die' written and directed by directing collective Jones. It's fantastic and I highly recommend seeking this one out! - GVA.
 |THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION OF LITTLE DIZZLE by David Russo! I love the filmmaker and the film. He has been working on this amazing Blue Man Group doc for a few years now so hopefully we'll see more work from him soon. -JN.
[I just moved to Austin a couple months ago. Since I don't think I can afford going this year, what are you most looking forward to at this event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeda0d?context=5)|VOLUNTEER: You can volunteer for SXSW and in exchange for some of your free time you can earn a badge. volunteer.sxsw.com.  FILM WRISTBAND: You can also purchase a Film Wristband for $80 from any of our venues or from Waterloo Records. They're on sale now and they give you access to screenings after Film Badges. These are NOT sold online and are primarily for locals, but will likely still be sold at venues during SXSW.  SINGLE TICKETS: We also sell single tickets for $10 to every screening at the festival if there are seats available after all Film Badges and Film Wristbands have entered. You can find more information on attending film screenings here: [Link to sxsw.com](http://sxsw.com/film/screenings/acces) (CG)
[What has been your favorite film to be featured at SXSW and where could I find it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfegh89?context=5)|Dear Nipples - [ATTACK THE BLOCK](http://www.amazon.com/Attack-Block-Blu-ray-John-Boyega/dp/B005J4TLQG)!  -JN.
 |One of my favorites from the past few years is “Upstream Color” and you can find it on Netflix.  -AN.
 |I love Otilia Padua’s stunning Mexican film [Diario a Tres Voces / Three Voices](http://diarioatresvoces.com/) from 2013.  But how to get hold of it?  You might have to do some detective work! - JK.
 |Mikey Please's SXSW 2011 animated short, [THE EAGLEMAN STAG](https://vimeo.com/41756240) is just ONE of my favorites. The animation is white on white (SERIOUSLY WTF SO BEAUTIFUL) and has an amazing storyline too! PLUS, you can watch it RIGHT NOW!!! (CG)
 |Cheap Thrills, coming soon to select theatres &amp; VOD from Drafthouse Films! (GVA)
[I was looking through the showtime/venue film schedule and noticed the Violet Crown isn't a venue this year. Why is that or did I miss something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeg5tr?context=5)|It definitely is - it's sponsored by AMC this year, so it's listed in the schedule as [AMC Theater at VCC](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events?lsort=venue_all_days&amp;venue=AMC+Theater+at+VCC). New this year, we'll be running all four theaters there as one screen, interlocked and the intros/Q&amp;As will be simulcast. Here's a list of all our [venues](http://sxsw.com/film/screenings/venues) this year. -RF.
[I know you can ""register"" through sxsw.com to get music passes that cost upwards of 600 dollars... Which is way more than id ever spend.. But how does one get their hands on a music wristband? which are far more affordable ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfefc5j?context=5)|Hey Digsell - if you're local, you can visit [Link to wristbands.sxsw.com](http://wristbands.sxsw.com) and try to purchase a wristband, but I think they're sold out at this point. -RF 
[Would you know if there is a way I could purchase a SXSW wristband as an out of town guest to give to my Austin resident friend as a thank you for staying at his place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfegpys?context=5)|The best route for music wristband questions is via the wristband [website](http://wristbands.sxsw.com) itself. 
[As an Austinite, I used to go to your fest every year, but the higher cost and priority of badge holders over regular pass holders means that for the most anticipated events often those who can only afford the expensive badges have a chance at entry. This seems to make your festival only accessible to the out-of-towners who can invest in attendance as a vacation as Austinites who have jobs cannot take a week off to catch enough screenings to make the cost worthwhile.  Also, the venues are often so spread out that bouncing from film to film to catch a lot of screenings (and thus making the investment of a pass or badge worthwhile\) is difficult at best, and when you factor in that your chances of actually making it into the screening once you fight your way downtown (during one of the busiest times of Austin's year\) if you don't have a badge, it basically is a wasted effort.  TLDR - Are you guys have any plans to address the issues that make the fest inaccessible to locals who have supported and helped build up the festival over the years, or are we just to resign ourselves to the fact that SXSW is now just a fest for out-of-towners and just a pain in the ass for us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt2ju/iama_sxsw_film_organizer_ama/cfeft36?context=5)|Each year we've made steps to make it easier for locals to participate in the film festival. This year we are adding a 3rd Satellite venue at the Marchesa Theatre where many of the out-of-towners will not head to because it is too far out of downtown. We make Film Wristbands available to locals for a more accessible and affordable way to see films without having to buy single admission tickets. We also have tools such as our online venue status board (vsb.sxsw.com) so that you can easily plan out your next move without wasting time going to a venue that is already full.

 |Many of the downtown venues are in easy walking distance from one another.  Badge holders get access to a free shuttle.  As Blake mentioned, we added a third satellite this year at the Marchesa near the Highland Mall which is the new home venue for the Austin Film Society. The other two satellites that we added a few years ago for locals who didn't feel like venturing into downtown are the Alamo Slaughter Lane and Alamo Village.  We're showing quite a lot of films at the these venues, and in many cases, filmmakers and cast are attending.  We love the local audience and are always trying to think how to encourage their attendance.  I also recommend the Vimeo as a Best Bet to gain entrance without long lines. -JP.

1xu084,1,2014-02-13,Art’s Guide to Obtaining an Internship in Public Accounting,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1xu084/arts_guide_to_obtaining_an_internship_in_public/,"Art’s Guide to Obtaining an Internship in Public Accounting
Hello everyone, I am Art and I put this guide out there to genuinely help students looking to land an internship opportunity while they are in college. If you are seriously struggling and really want to have a job lined up before graduating, you will read through ALL of this. I can guarantee you, if you follow this, you have a 95% chance of getting at least one internship. 
This guide is to help those students that are currently attending universities and are looking to land an internship with the big 4. Actually this guide is a great way to really land any type of internship with a company of your choice. However, since I have actually received offers from both the mid-sized public accounting firms and the big 4, I believe that I am better qualified to give advice in these areas. I am sure there are better guides out there and better ways to get into the big 4, but these are the steps that I took and hopefully they can assist you in landing an internship as well. 
If you are one of those people that are going to career fairs and handing your resume to 20 different companies and hoping someone will just call you, believe me, you are doing it all wrong. You will be very lucky if you land an internship that way. In this guide I will show you what channels and strategies I used to get in touch with companies/recruiters and how I built a relationship with them to land my first internship opportunity. 

JOIN STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS! (Networking)
I cannot stress this one enough. I myself joined Beta Alpha Psi (BAP), however, Accounting Society(AS) is a great student organization as well. Both of these organizations are geared towards landing accounting jobs. Being in these organizations will improve your chances of landing a job at the carrier fair by 10 folds. No, I am not exaggerating. Why? Because they(student organizations) give you the opportunity to get to know the professional out at carrier fairs way ahead of time. When you show up at the carrier fair, believe me you want them to say hi to you and recognize you before you go up to them to beg for a job.   
The great thing about BAP and AS is that they are always in contact with leading firms and are always having meet &amp; greet sessions with them. This gives you a chance to have exclusive time with the professionals as there are more professionals per student at any of their events.  
Become Active
Do not just sign up for the organizations and let your membership go to waste. Start attending sessions; these student organizations get exclusive time with the companies. They can help you get your foot in the door in all sorts of firms including, small to mid-sized public accounting firms, the big 4, and the industry as well. 
First thing you need to do is find out which companies you would like to be part of. Do your research on the firms that you would like to work for. You can be the type of person who doesn’t really care about which firm you go to as long as you get a decent job and that is fine too. However, at least make a mental note of the companies you plan to pursue. Next, grab an events calendar from the student organization to find out when your selected firm(s) will be coming to the university. Mark down every day that the company plans on meeting with the organization. You need to make sure that you are at all of those events. You cannot miss a single one, no excuses what so ever. If you have to push exam dates then do it. Just make sure you are at every company event without fail. Missing even one can hurt your chances.  
Focus (Most Important) 
This section I would like to believe is what helped me the most in obtaining an internship and is not something that most people advise you on. Your goal shouldn’t be to apply to the maximum number of companies possible. Start picking out certain companies and stalk them. Some companies show up on campus 5 to 7 times a semester. You need to get that schedule and be at every one of these event. Believe me, the more they see you them, the more they will be convinced that you are interested in them. Get them to remember you on a first name basis. 
You can obtain the company’s schedule on recruiting with your campus the following ways:
•	Grab a calendar from the student organization 
•	Ask the recruiter during one of the events “So when will you be coming on campus next? Or “when is your next recruiting event?” Write the date down in your notebook and burn it into your brain. 
 Start looking for the professionals that come to every recruiting event that the company hosts. For example, let’s say Company XYZ is hosting 5 events at your campus. During the first event a company might come with a staff of 3 recruiters (Bob, Tom, and Jane). In the next event the company might come with Michael, Ron, and Jane and the event hosted after that one you may see Dan, John, and Jane. You want to make sure that you focus on Jane at every event. Keep talking to her and get friendly with her. Chances are she is in charge of recruiting for your campus and has the most say in who gets a shot at the interview. If you see that there are 2 people that always come at every event from Company XYZ, then I recommend that you talk to both of the recruiters. Do not completely ignore the other employees, you never know who has the most say; just make sure you definitely speak with the person/people that attends the most recruiting sessions.
Remember since you plan on seeing them so many times; do not just keep asking the same old questions. If you have obtained all the necessary information that you need about the company, try to create small talk and get to know them on a personal level. Ask them about their weekend and try to remember what they plan on doing. It may not be such a bad idea to write it down so that you can follow up on their weekend the next time you see them. Leave your resume with them before you leave the event. After every single one of your events, email your recruiter and thank them for taking the time out and talking to you and educating you. This will allow the recruiters to hear your name when you meet them, to see it on your resume after the event that day, and allow them to see your name again when you email them. All this will go towards them remembering who you are.
Meeting with the recruiters/employees of a firm
Many people are really nervous about approaching a recruiter. My advice to you is, don’t be. These recruiters are there looking for you and you are there looking for them. It’s like going on a dating site, you don’t need to stress out about if someone is single or is not looking for a relationship. You know 100% that they are looking to date new people. Same concept is applied to recruiting. You know 100% that they are looking to hire someone and they know 100% that you need a job. It’s perfect match. Don’t be nervous, just go up to them and introduce yourself. 
What to talk about?
A lot of people have this problem of not knowing what to talk about with a recruiter. Look, you’re deciding what you want to do after you graduate and how you want to spend your 40 hours a week every week for a couple of months. Believe me; you have a lot to talk about. Here are some questions you can ask on your first meet. 
•	Tell me about your company?
•	What kind of internship programs do you currently have? 
•	When does the internship begin and end?
•	What qualities/qualifications are you looking for in a candidate?
•	When is the application deadline date
These are some great questions to begin your first meet with. Truly listen to them and think about everything that they are saying. Try to have some follow up questions to show that you were listening. 
Before leaving
Make sure you have given the recruiter your resume before you leave, it is another piece that they get to keep with them to remember you by and of course it highlights your accomplishments as well. Also be sure to grab their business card. 
After leaving
This is very important. So now the recruiter has seen your face, seen your credentials and has a resume to remember you by. That same day or the following day send the recruiter a thank you email so they can see your name one more time. Try to mention something unique from your discussion so that he/she can try to put a face to the name. They have met 100’s of students so it’s important that you try to distinguish yourself. Don’t write something really long; keep it short and sweet (about 3 lines). Your whole point is to get that name out there one more time. You need to do this after every meeting. Your goal is to make sure that the moment they see you, they should recognize you. 

Additional Advice
Major firms meet with the students on campus for about minimum 5 times per semester. You don’t have to ask them questions about the firm each time you meet the recruiters. Especially is you have met them multiple times. Sometimes your questions can all be answered and it is perfectly fine to drop and say Hi and see how the recruiters are doing. You can ask about their day and their weekend. Create small talk and try to maybe get to know them on a personal level. This will increase their likeability for you. I mean they get your point by the 5th and 6th meet. They know that you are interested. It’s okay if you still have questions but generally most people run out of them by that time. Take that opportunity to just drop by and say a friendly hello. 
Now I gave this advice assuming that people know what it means to be dressed professional by now and that they know how to write up a proper resume. I know that there are many additional areas that people can use guidance on so I am including a link to an excellent guide which I believe is very thorough and can help address some of the other areas that people can work on including the specifics of professionalism, resumes, thank you emails and other great advice.

I really hope this guide was helpful, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I will try to generally respond in a few hours, if not, then at the most the same day. Good luck on all your recruiting events.

As this chapter of my life closes, I'm looking to commit to someone who i can start the next chapter of it with. I want to see someone i can get to know both on a personal level but also someone who wants to get to know me the same way

I graduate this May, and I'm currently seeking internships all over the country, but that doesn't mean that i cant commit. Im the sort of person that will stay loyal to someone no matter the distance between me and them, and regardless of the quirks and flaws of someones personality. 

Comment or PM with some of your interests, and hopefully we can work something out.

Thanks for reading, I'm hoping something good can come out of this."
1xv5xh,3,2014-02-13,[Hiring] Remote iOS Intern,core-apps,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1xv5xh/hiring_remote_ios_intern/,"We're the leading app developer in the event industry space, and we are looking for an iOS intern who is looking to join a fun team to gain practical experience and knowledge all while working at home in your PJs. You'll be working with fellow geeks on a variety of tasks including maintaining our existing apps, adding in new features and tracking down pesky bugs, and growing and thriving in a high-energy team environment. The nature of our business means that we have hundreds of apps in the Apple App Store at any given time, so you’d be working on all stages of the development cycle—from writing new features, code reviewing other developers work, to submitting new apps and app updates.


We’re looking for someone who:

* Has a great personality. If you wanted to know all of the Doctor Who actors, we could point you to one of our guys. Looking for a meme faster than a witty comeback? We can point you to someone else. Or want to talk about beer, gaming, philosophy, and foreign languages all in the same sentence? Yep, we have that guy too. When replying, be sure to include what interesting knowledge or skill would you bring to the team.
* Is able to work independently from home (or wherever!) without a micromanaging boss. Dress jammies are only required on Mondays.
* Can integrate into and communicate with a team of device developers, server developers, project and operations managers, and sales and accounts folks.
* Can communicate solely via Skype, Campfire, and email to hit the ground running. Everyone works remotely, so you won't be the odd guy or gal out.


We don't expect an intern to have a ton of experience--that's the point of an internship, after all. We're looking for a student (computer science or similar would be great, but in no way is required) who's looking to take that spark of iOS knowledge and ignite the knowledge flame to learn a lot more.


**To apply, please PM me with a note telling us why you're interested in this job, why you're interested in working for us as a company (why are we different?), and tell me a little about yourself. Please also include a link to a resume. ""Template"" cover letters will probably not even be read--save those for your application to Oracle or Deloitte.**"

I was offered a place at Oxford but I'm hesitant in taking it up as I'm not sure about the job market for IT/CS students. 

Most US programs allow you to intern and get some experience while you study, but the Oxford course is an intensive 1 year course so when I graduate, I'll have a Master's degree and just a few months of work ex. So my question is, does UK have a ""startup culture""? Have students received offers from companies overseas? Are the salaries good? Do companies (not talking about Google or Amazon) hire immigrants and sponsor them or is there tendency to hire local talent?

I'm really confused because US is the best place for tech, but Oxford is Oxford. Everyone knows it.

1xvp9x,3,2014-02-14,[Relationships][21M] My GF [21F] and I may possibly have some irreconcilable differences in our plans for careers/the future. What should I do?,arkofcovenant,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xvp9x/relationships21m_my_gf_21f_and_i_may_possibly/,"So, my GF and I have been together for 3 1/2 years, and everything has been going really well. We love each other a lot, we get along really well, we have similar and usually compatible personalities. We've been living together at college for about a year, except that right now she is out of state for an internship since January. Everyone that knows us always says stuff like ""you guys are such a perfect couple"" ""you really lucked out in finding a girl that you get along with so well"" etc etc. We are both kinda thinking its pretty likely we'll get married, but we've both got so much stuff going on I've decided its best to wait until we graduate in about a year before really making the decision to ""pop the question,"" and I know she's ok with that. 

Here's the problem: I am an Aerospace Engineering Student, and I want to go into the space industry, either NASA or a private company. I want to do this not only because it is interesting and important to me, but I *strongly* believe it to be objectively important to the survival of the human race. Right now, a catastrophic event on earth could end humanity in its infancy. It is a ways away, but I believe that the sooner we can gain a foothold out in space, the better, and I want to be a part of the process that will eventually lead us to that. 

It is very important to her to be physically near her family (midwest). She has a very strong connection with her family, and is very hesitant about living anywhere other than the midwest.

Problem: There are approximately zero spaceflight companies in the midwest. 

I was on skype with her earlier tonight when this came up. I admitted that this was definitely going to be a tough problem to solve, but there are so many unknowns right now that it isn't worth worrying about so much, and that we will probably be able to come up with some sort of compromise when the time came. I told her that I'd like to get my pilot's license when I can afford it, and I'd be able to fly her home to see her family whenever she liked. I told her that we'd probably be making enough money (she's engineering too) for her to buy a plane ticket back home every weekend if she wanted. Despite all of this, she seemed very worried about this, and said that she'd be afraid that she would regret deciding to live anywhere else. She said that right now, she feels like she absolutely couldn't live in California (where the highest concentration of space companies are). 

I find this to be really frustrating. 1) Because it seems like she isn't really willing to compromise in a way that would allow me to pursue this career path at all, and 2) Because I feel like this shouldn't even be a debate, as my goals are objectively more important.

I'm having an especially hard time with this because I really, *really* don't have that kind of relationship with my family, and I have a hard time seeing the issue from her perspective at all. I'd be very content being as far from my mother as possible, and while my dad is pretty cool, I'd be alright only seeing him very occasionally, either for her sake or for the sake of my career. 

She is by far the best thing that has ever happened to me, but the future of humanity in regards to space is so important that I feel like I have to pursue it, given that I feel I can make a significant contribution to it. I can't really imagine myself with anyone but her, but if I do have to end it, I feel like I need to end it *now* if I am even going to have a remote chance at finding someone who makes me as happy as she does.

Edit: A lot of people seem to be interpreting this as me being selfish. My perspective is biased, so I don't think that is impossible, but I'm thinking that maybe some people are misinterpreting the word ""objectively"". I'm talking about ""important"" in regard to how it can positively affect the world as a whole. When one option does positively affect the world, and the other does not, isn't it usually best to do the former?

Edit2: /u/victoria_woodhull (thank you) explained it in a way that actually got through my thick skull, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xvp9x/relationships21m_my_gf_21f_and_i_may_possibly/cff2nvk)
While I think I have a better perspective now, I still welcome further input (I'll try not to be so snarky).

**tl;dr**: GF's need for family directly conflicts with the needs of humanity. What do?"

I'll go straight to the point because I'm at work right now.

18 Year male. And ever since I got a internship here, a co-worker who leads the internship party keeps thi nking that I'm doing nothing productive. And everytime I do something wrong she always asks these questions that are implying that I am doing things wrong. It's like she fucking hates me. A friend of mine also works here and his attitude is not helping either. He knows that she annoys me. But he keeps laughing about it and he is the type of person that always wants to convince you he is right. I just expected some understanding from him but he always just pushes my buttons. I want to call him my best friend but he has these character traits that really tick me off sometimes. But it's getting really personal now. It's getting to the point that I don't want to talk anymore, even though I'm quite extrovert. 

I just don't look forward going to work anymore. And I still have to for 4 months. I really don't know how to deal with this. It now feels like everything I say is being judged and is stupid and won't make direct sense. I always have to explain things twice before somebody gets it. I hate that I notice my own flaws. And I know I should embrace those flaws. It also doesn't help that I have to do work in a certain field  that I don't want to learn in.I know that I'm overreacting but every time I notice it, it gets worse. I hate it so much and god I have a feeling that stupid depression is coming back. I'll stop talking now because I'm rambling. "

The thing is, even if I got a nice pile of NZD in my ANZ bank account, I can't seem to find a good solution to change then into Bitcoin. I can't use BitNZ because online deposits are on hold (and apparently it's not going to change soon), Tua doesn't seem to be available now, and I'm simply puzzled by how the market works in LocalBitcoins.com.

All advertisments on LocalBitcoins have pretty much ridiculous prices (the sellers want to sell for an absurd amount of money compared to the market prices, and so do most buyers apparently), and especially, many of them require not only a real name (I'm fine with that, I'm not a scanner) but also a *NZ* ID. I'm honest and I can provide any proof of identity, residence, etc., but I am french, I live in France and I can't deposit cash anywhere.

Any idea what I could do? If you know other exchanges accepting NZ deposits without huge fees, I would be interested as well…"

Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's The Lego Movie is exactly what its title promises, a kid-pleasing movie comprised of CGI renditions of the titular interlocking plastic bricks. The story is a self-aware riff on hero's journey and prophecy tropes: Emmet Brickowski (Parks and Recreation's Chris Pratt, who could make the National Union Catalog funny) is an ordinary guy in a Lego city who discovers that he's destined to Save The World, along the way meeting characters already owned by parent company Time Warner (Will Arnett as Batman) and newly proprietary (Alison Brie as Uni-Kitty). 

When I think about the house I grew up in — my football-themed bedroom, the big family room, the yard — there are always Lego bricks everywhere. And I’m clearly not alone, because everyone in my packed theater watching The Lego Movie this weekend seemed to have the same experience I did: a 100-minute exercise in nostalgia, rendered in RealD 3D.

It's the first big-budget Lego movie in the company's 80-year history, made painstakingly over five years in concert with writer–director duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Its cast list is riddled with A-list actors, its marketing is massive and unavoidable — and it's a shockingly fun, remarkably entertaining movie. Sure, it's an hour and a half of advertising for Lego, but if this is the future of marketing, sign me up.

The picture looks good, it has some yuks, and there are even early hints of an Idiocracy-style satire of a lowbrow culture — the most popular show on TV, Where Are My Pants?, is a PG version of Ow! My Balls! — but the overlong Lego Movie collapses in the third act, finally becoming an overt commercial for the toys while getting existential in a way that unfavorably parallels the Toy Story movies. Nor does it help that the screenwriters work out their daddy issues — what is this, 2013? — and the movie ends on a distastefully sexist joke. (Girls ruin everything!) Still, Chris Pratt gets to say, ""Abraham Lincoln, you bring your space-chair right back here!"" Classic Pratt.

The movie follows Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a normal guy with a normal job and a normal life. As soon as he wakes up, he breaks out the instruction manual. Jumping jacks? Check. $37 coffee? Check. Wave to neighbors? Check. He follows the speed limit, works diligently at his construction job, and every once in a while wonders if there might be more to life than this. One night as he's leaving his worksite he meets a pretty girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), and finds a mysterious object called The Piece of Resistance. The one who finds it, it's been prophesied, is The Special: the smartest, most talented, most interesting person in the world, and the one who will save everyone from President Business (Will Ferrell) and his evil plan. But to do that he needs to ditch the instructions and go freestyle.

Everything in the movie from elaborate cities to puffs of smoke is made of Lego, and it's all fair game: at one point Wyldstyle builds a motorcycle out of an alleyway in order to escape Liam Neeson's nefarious Bad Cop. It's this build-and-rebuild ethos that makes the movie go — the movie twists and turns relentlessly and often without any warning, as if there's a kid above acting like King Kong and knocking down the tower he's built before starting over on something different. It's a funny, quirky, weird adventure that has fun with the limitations of Legos while making clear that there's nothing you can't do or make with those interlocking blocks. Including spaceships.

It's not exactly breaking new ground — normal guy learns he's special, saves the world — and it does come with a fair amount of heavy-handed preaching about how everyone is special and we can all be anything we want. Like any good family-friendly movie, there's a love story, there are jokes both obvious and subtle, and there's a surprisingly tender third act. But everything about the way The Lego Movie unfolds feels fresh, with Lord and Miller doing their brand-building duty while simultaneously rolling their eyes at it. Where a movie like The Internship is one long bow at the altar of Google, The Lego Movie frequently cuts to awkward scenes where minifigures can’t quite figure out how to hold hands, or the revered ""relics"" that are mostly just gross things you might accidentally find in a box full of Lego bricks. It’s loving throughout, but it’s edgy and self-deprecating enough to never feel contrived.

""I think what we’ve really found is that Lego is a medium,"" Michael McNally, Lego's brand relations director, tells me. ""It’s not a toy, it’s a medium for other people to tell their own stories and create their own adventures."" To tell theirs, Lord and Miller (who wrote and directed 21 Jump Street and the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series) turned to Animal Logic, a well-known Australian effects studio. The result is stunning, a mix of stop-motion and photorealism that left me constantly forgetting and remembering the characters are Lego minifigures with claws for hands and as many personalities as they have outfits.

It's a movie made for Lego fans of all ages, which McNally reminds me are everywhere: Lego is the second-largest toy maker in the world, and there are even communities of Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) around the world. ""It’s no different from Volkswagen owners or Apple enthusiasts or Disney fanatics,"" he says. ""We have Lego fans."" He grants that the movie seems designed to encourage and revive interest in Lego (and to sell bricks), but says that wasn't the point. ""A feature film was never really something we set out to make. A lot of people say, ‘Well, toy movies are just designed to sell toys.’ And that’s not something that was compelling to us… it wasn’t like we needed a movie to help us sell more stuff."""

My experience/advice...,champyg,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1xwttu/finally_got_a_job_offer_9_months_after_graduation/,"I was a good student in school. Graduated with a 3.7 GPA from a regionally respected tech university with a BS in EE. It's not top 20 school or anything like that, but they turn out quality engineers. I had 2 internships upon graduation, one in power and one in a household name tech giant. After graduation, I wanted to end up in the Austin, TX area so I began the application process. Had a few call backs, most of which turned into interviews and then on site interviews, but there was always a ""better candidate, even though it was a tough choice."" This happened 3 different times after somewhere between 75 and 100 applications. Leaving the third interview, I was told I was exactly what they were looking for, cream of the crop, first resume pulled, etc. After getting a ""no"" back, I had a healthy hunch it was in-state graduates or people with a foot in the door snatching all the openings. So with that knowledge, I had to shift focus a bit...

I started reaching out to every possible connection I had. This pretty much restricted my possible destination to a 4-hour driving radius of my university, which was a little bit disheartening. BUT in 2 months of this type of searching, I got just as many interviews as I had in the previous 7 of blind online applications. Not to mention a boatload of leads I never got the chance to follow. I ended up with 2 offers on the same day after 2 months of network-focused searching. I even used one to leverage the other offer out of the company. The location for the one I'm accepting isn't as alluring as Austin, but that's a sacrifice I realized had to be made.

So here's my TL;DR if you're discouraged about job outlook. Use networking: friends with jobs, previous coworkers, university resources, etc. I know it might feel kind of cheap and limits your choices, but that seems to be the state of things when you're fresh out of a non top 20 school."

In Ken Scott’s Delivery Man, Vince Vaughn plays irresponsible delivery truck driver David Wozniak – the naive, risk-taking, black sheep of his family. After a pyramid scheme leaves him with over $100,000 in debt, David discovers that, not only is his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) pregnant, he’s at the center of a high-profile privacy lawsuit. Twenty years back, David had regularly donated (in exchange for cash) to a fertility clinic under the pseudonym “Starbuck” - which in turn disproportionately distributed his “super” sperm to hundreds of women. As a result, David learns that his trips to the sperm bank resulted in the birth of 533 children that share his DNA – of which 142 have joined a class action lawsuit to unearth Starbuck’s true identity.

Curious, David goes undercover to meet his biological children and finds a bond with the diverse batch of young people, reveling in their talents as well as attempting to aid in their challenges. However, as the lawsuit becomes a trending topic on cable news channels, David must decide whether or not to reveal himself and take an active role in the lives of the “Starbuck Kids” – or focus entirely on his “real” family.

Vince Vaughn as David Wozniak in ‘Delivery Man’

Director Ken Scott helms Delivery Man, a Hollywood remake of the 2011 Canadian comedy Starbuck, which was also directed by Scott. As with any remake, there are small differences between the two films, but even with the same director, Delivery Man is a surprisingly close recreation of the same story – this time with an American star and a New York City setting. For that reason, anyone who enjoyed Starbuck (which was runner-up in the 2011 TIFF People’s Choice Award), Delivery Man will likely come across as a shameless Hollywood adaptation of a superior indie film. Still, the core premise is ripe with comedy and emotion, Bollywood and French Starbuck remakes have also been released, and Scott maintains a solid balance between humor and drama in his own (second) effort. Therefore, moviegoers who have not already experienced the Starbuck story will find plenty to enjoy in Delivery Man, even if there’s reason to be cynical about a director refashioning his original indie picture for a mainstream audience.

On the surface, potential viewers might pigeonhole Delivery Man as another formulaic Vince Vaughn comedy, where the actor goes through his usual underachieving man boy turned grown man arc (see: The Internship, The Dilemma, and Wedding Crashers, among others). Yet, as David stalks his biological children, the film actually includes some pretty weighty story elements that force the main character (and subsequently Vaughn) to take the entire situation seriously.

Britt Robertson, Amos VanderPoel, Vince Vaughn, and Jack Reynor

There are still a number of laugh-worthy jokes but American audiences will likely be surprised by the amount of sincere moments that Delivery Man offers. Few are quite as profound as Scott may have intended, largely because Vaughn simply doesn’t have the necessary range to sell the diverse set of deeper ideas presented in this story, but dramatic scenes are not simply one-note throwaways either. Delivery Man makes genuine attempts at earning its rumination on family and fatherhood – meaning that even when it falls short, the material has already aimed higher than standard comedy fare.

As mentioned, Vaughn isn’t doing anything new in Delivery Man. In general, David is an amalgamation of the comedian’s other man-child leads – an aimless, self-centered, and underachieving guy that is forced to grow up as a result of the situation at hand. To his credit, Vaughn delivers in a number of encounters that ground the film in meaningful emotional drama but other moments are less successful as the actor comes across stilted and over-eager in selling a few especially delicate scenes.

Chris Pratt as Brett in ‘Delivery Man’

Nevertheless, Vaughn is surrounded by a gripping group of young people that make up the four most prominent faces out of Starkbuck’s many offspring, namely David Patten as Central Park musician Adam (and organizer of the Starbuck lawsuit), Adam Chanler-Berat as philosophical lost boy Viggo, Britt Robertson as recovering addict Kristen, and Jack Reynor as aspiring actor Josh. Whenever Vaughn falls short, the enthusiastic cast of supporting actors is there to prop him up – with likable and relatable depictions of young adults in search of acceptance and family.

Several solid performers help round-out the Delivery Man storyline – including fan-favorite Chris Pratt (soon to lead Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy) playing David’s best friend and lawyer Brett. Pratt’s timing and understated approach to the character result in some of the film’s biggest laughs – ensuring there’s enough fun for viewers that might otherwise be overwhelmed by weighty drama in Scott’s film. Colbie Smulders (How I Met Your Mother) is equally effective as Emma, David’s pregnant girlfriend, but isn’t given very much to do. Despite her role in the larger story, Emma mostly serves as a motivator for David, and a reason to grow up, stepping into the plot whenever Scott needed to show a different side of his leading man – without tangible development for his love interest.

Colbie Smulders as Emma in ‘Delivery Man’

That said, it’s hard to fault Scott for keeping the Delivery Man plot focused on David and his extended family of biological children. In that effort, the remake succeeds at repackaging the smart Starbuck setup for a broader audience. Several plot threads get short shrift and it’s hard to escape the sense that this is a slightly watered down version of a unique original, but it’s still entertaining to watch the assembled pieces interact. Moviegoers looking for a laugh-out-loud Vince Vaughn dramedy in the vein of Wedding Crashers or Old School might be slightly underwhelmed by the amount of comedy set pieces in Delivery Man; yet for others, the competent mix of humor and drama should have no problem delivering a mostly fun (and even heartfelt) movie experience.

I think some folks in the taxi industry would actually argue that late-night T service actually might have a positive impact on taxis ... right now, it seems like most of Boston shuts down after 1 am, and late-night T service encourages late-night business, which encourages people to go out late at night, and some of those people will decide it's too cold/they're too lazy to take the T, and will grab a cab to go home.
 |But I'm sure not everyone thinks that.
[Correction: Most of Boston shuts down after 7:30PM.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffe058?context=5)|Hahaha word.

I never understood that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cff9nrf?context=5)|Transit advocates have been battling for this for years -- even filed, and won, a lawsuit against the T.

[Where do you think we need improvement and what needs to be expanded?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffa5n5?context=5)|Yes! I love my little Toyota. It was kind of a trial-by-fire experience of learning to drive manual transmission ... definitely a character-building experience.
[Anything new you would bring to the city that you've seen elsewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffa5n5?context=5)|Not sure I have a magic plan of ""what I would do with a billion dollars"" -- you should ask urban planners and transportation engineers who are way smarter than me and much more adept at thinking about smart investment -- but I think it's exciting to hear about DMUs (diesel-multiple units) that are basically like small trains that can run on commuter rail lines. ([Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_multiple_unit) So many possibilities to have subway-like service on existing rail lines! I live in Dorchester, so I usually take the Red Line, but I live close to the Fairmount commuter rail line but never take it because service is so infrequent. If they had a smaller train running every 5-10 minutes ... voila, it will be my new most-used line to get into downtown! My colleague Shirley Leung has also written about DMU service between Seaport and Back Bay ... [Link to www.bostonglobe.com](http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/05/state-begin-innovative-rail-service-between-seaport-district-and-back-bay/oHUinYj30lzOV6KNCQUMEJ/story.htm) It's probably more complicated than it sounds, but that seems like a pretty cool investment to me.
 |And, as everyone knows, we desperately need new trains and buses. Riders are frustrated that the Red Line screws up (seemingly every day in the winter) and I think if you talk to folks at the T, they're incredibly frustrated, too, because they feel like they're working with equipment that has just run out of mojo. So it seems to me a good idea that money has been set aside for that.
[Why is it taking so long to get EZ Pass accepted in all lanes on the Pike? I commonly get off at Natick during rush hour, and the toll lanes are empty (and we are paying for people to twiddle their thumbs\) while the electronic tolls are backed up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbttr?context=5)|EZPass will become all-electronic on the Pike by 2016 ... they have to do the whole Pike at once, so it takes time for all the technology/construction.
[When are we going to see realistic speed limits set anywhere on the highways?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbttr?context=5)|Is your thought that speed limits (65) is too slow? We're generally in line with the region, though slower than NH and Maine. ([Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_speed_limits13.svg) But State Rep.

[If you could pick one street that sums up the cultural diversity, history, past, present and future of Boston, what street would that be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cff9jst?context=5)|Y'know, I'm sure there are a lot of streets in Boston that fit that bill, but one street that I take often and find super-interesting is Dorchester Ave., down in Southie + Dot. It's totally historic/traditional Southie (think: the Sugar Bowl) but also has this really great burgeoning scene of boutique stores at the intersection with Columbia Rd., becomes a largely Vietnamese community further south (with a ton of cyclists and pretty clearly-marked bike lanes, I might add) and runs all the way down to the Neponset River. If South Station expansion forces the Post Office to move, then they might open back up the part of Dot Ave. that runs along Fort Point Channel ... which would provide a direct route from Dorchester right into the heart of the city.
[Do you see any potential solution to make East Boston accessible by bike without having to route through Charlestown/Everett/Chelsea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbprs?context=5)|Eastie's great. A few friends of mine have recently moved out there, and they totally love it. I agree that it's pretty much gotten short shrift when it comes to bike facilities ... since it's hard to bike between there and downtown Boston, I think it's assumed that people don't really bike around the neighborhood, which isn't true. (Hence no Hubway in Eastie.)
[My wife and I use the Commuter Rail frequently. It's always packed and runs a sparse schedule. Is there anything in the future about increasing the frequency of the train schedule? 45min-1hr each train is pretty long during the commuting hours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffcuu3?context=5)|The best hope of increasing frequency on the commuter rail is DMUs: smaller trains that can provide subway-like service on commuter rail tracks, since they are more efficient to run. The T is planning on buying some of these guys to try out, but it could be 10 years before they're implemented.
[Why are the subway cars and stations in such poor condition compared to comparable (if not larger cities\) with public transportation? DC comes to mind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffcuu3?context=5)|Our cars are wicked old, because no one wanted to fork over money to pay for new ones. but we're getting some new ones on the Red and Orange line in 2019, possibly Green Line in 2021.

[Any updates on the Boston Harbor ferry grant? It was federal money to study, buy, and launch a Charlestown-&gt;Eastie-&gt;Seaport-&gt;Downtown ferry, but I haven't heard anything on it for a while.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbs8c?context=5)|I haven't heard anything for a while, either. Good question, will put it on my list of things to ask.
[What's the deal Government Center? Is it really closing for two years? What are they going to do during those two years? The construction on the street has been going on for months and it doesn't seem like they accomplished a single thing except putting up Jersey Barriers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffdkbl?context=5)|It is indeed closing for two years. I don't know a ton about the project's progress right now ... as the March 22 date closes in, I'll def. be turning my attention to that so you can expect to hear more details (at least from the Globe) closer to then.
[ question: How did the experimental Cape service go? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffdkbl?context=5)|Cape Service was wildly successful. (Though there are some folks who live along the tracks that have been annoyed with the increased train traffic.) Folks are thinking of making the service year-round.
[Anyway, I just see a very obvious technological solution to a problem that has plagued the transportation since cars were invented: how to eliminate human error (the only cause of accidents\). If there's anything safety-wise that the government should subsidize, don't you think it should be the rapid development and implementation of this technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffaxhv?context=5)|In the more near-term, car-to-car communication seems like it's really gaining momentum. And, on a smaller note, bike-to-car communication. Can you imagine? Your car tells you ""hey, there's a cyclist ahead, be careful""! That could save lives.
 |What I think is really interesting is that, at this point, they're almost as safe as humans -- but we're so resistant to the idea of being driven around by robots, that the technology has to prove itself to be significantly better than humans before we can even think about them becoming mainstream.
[Here on Long Island, a county legislator basically said that no one should ride bikes ... at all (see this thread\). Do you find that reactions like this are still common, in particular in suburban areas? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffguht?context=5)|I heard about that. Honestly ... yeah, you get these reactions in a lot of places. Here in South Boston, at a meeting about bike lanes last summer, people straight-up declared that they felt people riding bikes were asking to be killed. It's actually surprised me as the one issue that gets people most incensed. As a reporter, I am pretty open-minded and see things from all kinds of different angles, and generally believe that most people have justifiable reasons for their beliefs. But people flat-out declaring that biking should be illegal ... that just seems really unreasonable.
[Favorite day-trip via commuter rail spot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffa8hu?context=5)|I love the Peabody Essex Museum, so the fact that you can just jump on the commuter rail and step off and you're basically across the street ... talk about a simple way to get away!

I know the MBTA makes thousands a day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbnt8?context=5)|People are naturally very, very skeptical of the government and of corruption -- especially here in Mass., where we have the legacy of financial mismanagement during the Big Dig.
 |I have had very positive and very negative experiences on the T as a passenger. There's nothing more infuriating than getting stuck on the train not moving for 20 minutes for no apparent reason. But that also happens to me when I'm driving -- stuck in infuriating traffic that I don't understand, cut off my evil drivers. And sometimes I find the T a lot more pleasant than driving. But only sometimes. Pluses and minuses.
[Local business owners around Roslindale have really felt a decease in foot traffic due to an aggressive rash of ticketing this past month. Store owners observe that the officers of the Boston Department of Transportation (BDT\) stopping by seem to justify their ticketing citing increasingly minor offenses (e.g. 2-3"" too far into the street - largely due to snow buildup\).  My questions are: Have you heard anything about this? Do you know why the BDT is ramping up its ticket collection in particular areas? What do you recommend local business owners / residents do about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffd1h5?context=5)|This is the first I've heard about this, but it's really interesting.

[Have you gotten to speak at all with the new(ish\) GM Beverly Scott?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffb1ac?context=5)|I have gotten the chance to speak with GM Scott quite a few times. (An aside on commuting -- she usually takes the #55 bus, and she's started to take the Ride, apparently ...

[If so, what is your personal opinion of her and how does she compare to Davey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffb1ac?context=5)|I think Dr. Scott has gained a lot of popularity simply because she's a very outgoing, effusive person -- that's less of an opinion and more of a fact, simply because anytime you meet her she's giving hugs and talking to people in a tell-it-like-it-is kind of way, which I think is pretty unusual in the world of gov. transportation administration, generally known to be kind of staid and buttoned-up. I remember a woman at a recent MassDOT meeting who was complaining about something T-related (the details are hazy now, thought in my notes) turned to Dr. Scott, and was like ""I really don't like your policy, but I like you."" So I think her candor can be pretty disarming and effective. She's certainly been very involved in a lot of recent big decisions (rollback of the Ride fares and Keolis as the new commuter rail operator) so I wouldn't call her just a figurehead. But she's only been here for a little more than a year, so time will tell how she fares ... she's said in the past she only plans on being at the T for a few years, and it seems like much of her legacy will likely rest on how late-night T service turns out, as well as how Keolis turns out as our new commuter rail operator. If they end up sucking, it will look bad for her.
[Is she a figure head or is she actually working to get shit done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffb1ac?context=5)|As for Sec. Davey -- he really took on the role of a politician in the last year of pushing for funding for transportation improvements. (I wrote a story about that: [Link to www.boston.com](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/03/23/for-transportation-secretary-patrick-bill-means-going-into-campaign-mode/NHqjjqcXSIl1VhlFvHbAQP/story.html) So I think the fact that you've seen him constantly in the press and as the face of the agency, perhaps more so than Dr. Scott at times, is an intentional choice.
[What are your thoughts on the sharing economy and companies like uber/lyft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cff9pqa?context=5)|I find sharing transportation services super-interesting, and in a lot of ways, indicative of the future. (Side note: My mother just discovered airbnb last night and it blew her MIND.) Obviously there are a lot of concerns about employment fairness + passenger security. I see both sides ... I think that the liability issues with Uber/Lyft/Sidecar/RelayRides are very real ([Link to techcrunch.com](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/02/should-car-services-provide-insurance-whenever-their-driver-app-is-open/) but at the same time, I do think there are some real advantages, both in terms of cost + convenience, as well as the ability to track cars on your smartphone so that others can know where you are. So ... it's complicated, and there are pros and cons. Like most things I cover :-)
[Is there ever going to be a direct connection between North and South Station? That would be incredibly convenient.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffdne2?context=5)|People are always talking about it, but a N-S connection has gained basically zero traction when it comes to political machine that drives transportation investment.

[Can you offer any insight into the delay in the new schedule for the Framingham/Worcester Commuter Rail to expand usage of the new Yawkey Station? My understanding is that the State Reps from Natick (Linsky\) and Wellesley (Pleisch\) are not satisfied with the evening service to their respective communities, but it seems like nit-picking to me. I'd like to know more about how candidate schedules are vetted; who gets to be involved in the process; how long does it take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbvdh?context=5)|Wish I had a better answer on this ... but haven't reported much on the issues with the Worcester line. Last I heard was that the T had to wait a little longer due to construction issues at Yawkey Staion platforms, as well as the fact that the T is ""taking under consideration some schedule changes suggested by customers and local officials."" That's all I know ...
[What are your favorite subway/bus apps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffbqdu?context=5)|There are a bunch of great apps out there, and I certainly haven't tested them all. I generally use Catch the T for my basic ""when's the next train supposed to get here"" queries. I've also written about ProximiT -- it always pops up on my phone every time I pass South Station or JFK/UMass, which is cool, but I don't often use it for the ""how long do I have before I need to walk to the T station, because I usually know that by heart.
[I live in Brighton right on the Allston border (if there really is such a thing\), and frequently take the 57 bus.

[How has the all-winter Hubway experiment in Cambridge been going from your perspective? At this point, does it look promising for a full-system year-round attempt in 2014-15?  Would you encourage the prioritization of all-season access to Hubway, or increased density of Hubway stations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xwn4l/iama_a_reporter_for_the_boston_globe_covering_the/cffereh?context=5)|Not sure how interested the surrounding towns are in putting in the extra effort to maintain year-round service, but the fact that Cambridge is working (and especially that there have been no signif. accidents, knock on wood) helps the case.  I have not yet Hubwayed in winter ... I don't live in Cambridge, and usually just take the T to get there, but I think I would probably use Hubway in Boston in the winter just to spend less time out in the cold as I walk from the T station to my home or between shops on Boylston St.  But that's just speaking as a person who rides bikes -- obviously, Hubway has financial issues to deal with, and I'm not sure how the added costs of year-round service throughout the system would affect their bottom line. Maybe it's just too unsustainable if the number of riders decreases during the winter.
 |As for density -- that's also a good question. With a finite amount of money, do you increase the density of stations to make them more convenient for people who already have access, or do you put those stations in places that are currently without any Hubway access at all, like Dorchester/Roxbury/Mattapan? Hard question to answer -- thankfully, it's not my job to answer the question but to ask it!

You can't buy train cars the way you can buy automobiles off the lot ... they have to be custom-made. So you have to come up with a design for them, then put a design out to bid, then choose a manufacturer, then the manufacturer makes a sample car so you can OK it, then they go back and have to manufacture, deliver, assemble, deliver, test-out all your cars.

Glad to hear you're interested in journalism ... I love it, and love that I get to learn about new stuff every day. I studied African American Studies, which is not directly related to journalism, but I think was actually enormously helpful for my job in terms of helping me understand issues in layers -- that most often, short-term controversies or arguments are caused/affected by long-term issues and historical context. There are other majors that help frame smart thinking: history, international studies, American Studies, political science.
 |But broadcast is a more technical field than newspaper journalism (though it should be less so -- if I could go back to college and take more programming courses!!!) so I would consider majoring in journalism.

Looking for some advice/avenues/stories on how to go about obtaining a programming internship and how to maintain financial stability when doing so (as most internships are unpaid nowadays).

How do you (or how did you) understand the intricacies of how different languages work together in a business environment, without ever working in said environment?"

My questions are:
Does anyone here use GIS (we are using ArcGIS ESRI software) for a hospital or any large government facility? If so, what is the best way to use and manipulate data to show the effectiveness of GIS for this client?
Is there any tips or tutorials on converting CAD files for use in ArcGIS? How are utilities (water, electrical ect.) data best used in ArcGIS?

I know these questions are rather broad, but I'm just trying to get a handle on the situation and what to expect before I dive headfirst. I'd also like to just hear general stories on what a GIS professional does when working with data from a hospital or large facility. "
1xy1n8,1,2014-02-14,Offered position but they haven't conducted a background check....,Kezzander,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1xy1n8/offered_position_but_they_havent_conducted_a/,"Okay, so here is my back story. During my jsenior year in high school and for 2-3 years after that I was addicted to painkillers. From 2008-2011 I was arrested 7 times. 2 illegal consumption's, 2 bar fight batteries, 1 possession (all the previous misdemeanors) and then finally 2 felony delivery of marijuana and narcotic pills (charged at the same time). In 2011 I went into rehab and cleaned myself up and enrolled in college.

So, my major is Computer Science and I am a junior now.. This fortune 500 company had an internship offer. I interviewed with a panel of 5 people and a week later I was offered the internship which starts this summer. It is contingent on passing a background, hair test, and physical. They congratulated me and looked forward to seeing me the summer. Not once have the asked me about my past background. No where did I have a chance to tell them about it, except if I volunteered to bring it up during the interview which I wasn't sure if I should or shouldn't. I certainly would never have lied as I was ready to tell the the situation and wish they had asked about it. But they passed me to HR now.

I accepted the offer and emailed it back to the HR generalists. She Said she would initiate the process about 4 weeks before my start date. 

So.... Now here I am. I can pass a hair test. I can pass any drug test that goes back to 2011. I can pass a physical and I have volumes of references that can speak on my character. But I don't think I can pass the background. I mean its 7 arrests with 2 of them being felonies in a 3 year period. That looks horrible.

So, what would be an opinion from anyone in HR? Should I write to the hiring manager and tell him about my past? Tell HR about my past? Should I not mention anything and see if the generalist see's my drug conviction as negligent hiring or just something they will pass up? I have looked up EEOC's suggestions on what to do about hiring someone with a criminal background and how it needs to pertain to the job.. but with my repeated behavior from 2008-2011 it is pretty ugly. This isn't financial or anything to do with financial industry. Its a programming position on applications for the company.

I got help and I still go to my meetings. I understand what I did wasn't good for society and I have made my best efforts to amends. But I don't know how to express this or what to do without someone from HR looking at that background report and slamming a  no-hire on it quicker than lightning.

Any opinions much appreciated."
1xy65e,5,2014-02-14,I want to learn how to be happy while sober.,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1xy65e/i_want_to_learn_how_to_be_happy_while_sober/,"It's been something like a month and a half since I've had any alcohol apart from the small amount of rum that my roommate used when he was cooking baked beans the other night, but that all cooked out so I feel like it's negligible. Anyway, I'm proud of myself because since I stopped, my life has vastly improved. I've started seeing a therapist, I'm getting more responsibility at the newspaper where I work, I've become a founding father at a new Fraternity on campus, and I landed a great, well paying internship today. Despite all that, I just feel like a giant pile of shit, physically and emotionally, and I don't know what it's gonna take for me to become truly happy while sober. I guess maybe when I'm not under the influence of anything, I have to get used to dealing with my own mind as it actually is.

Edit: I truly appreciate all of the responses so far. I feel really weak tonight. My roommate and a friend were upstairs drinking and I stayed downstairs on reddit just feeling really low. The good thing is I know my roommate would put a stop to me trying to join them, but I still felt the temptation when the friend came down to talk to me with a bottle of tequila in his hand.

You guys are really a big help."
1xyey8,335,2014-02-14,Just a happy story about an old guy who turned his life around by learning programming.,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1xyey8/just_a_happy_story_about_an_old_guy_who_turned/,"Back around 2006 I was an Air Force officer, and I felt sort of misplaced in life. I took up photography as a hobby and bought my old trusted Canon DSLR camera. I started using Apple's Aperture for file management / post processing and I noticed that I spent a lot of time doing the same things manually, over and over again. That's when I started learning AppleScript, in order to automate some of the most tedious workflows.

I thought a few other geeks might want to use them, so I went and posted on a forum somewhere, offering them for free if anyone was interested. Then a guy called 
[Joseph Linaschke](http://photojoseph.com/) sent me a message saying that we could sell the scripts for a very low price on his website for Aperture aficionados, [ApertureExpert.com](http://www.apertureexpert.com/store?tid=26&amp;key=&amp;sort_bef_combine=created+DESC#.Uv6iarQnu-0), and split the profits. That was obviously an encouraging experience. And turning computers into minions felt so rewarding that I just wanted to keep learning.

In 2011 I decided to quit at go back to school for 2½ years and get an AP in computer science. I was 36 years old at the time. I was intensely motivated, but also more than a little frightened of the prospect of competing with my class mates, most of whom were born around the time I joined the military. It turned out that I had nothing to worry about. My joy of becoming a better programmer, coupled with the rush and self respect you get when you throw away your well paying and secure government job and start following your dreams for real, made me Ace most of my exams. I won't argue that my now 40 year old brain has lost a lot of cells and plasticity over the years, but somehow I feel more sharp and awake than ever.

As a project for the final exam in January, me and a class mate decided to dive into web development during an internship at one of the largest online book shops here in Denmark. The project was to be an app which made it easy for employees in my project partner's dad's accounting firm to log the time they spend doing different services for different clients. It had to be easy to use, work in all browsers, on all devices, and feature meaningful statistics and charts.

We built it in PHP, which we both had played with a little before, and because [Go Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf)! Well, he was technically once Danish, because Greenland is sort of still our territory. Anyway, I digress.

I was worried that the project would be too simple, given that we wouldn't need any fancy algorithms, data structures or database models. And my experience in frontend design was limited. The last time I had made a public web site was when frame tags were the shit. Okay, except for this [fantastic front page](http://www.mortenscheel.com) on a shared web hotel thing I have for testing out backend stuff.

So to compensate I worked like crazy to make the project show how quickly I could learn new languages, platforms, frameworks and design patterns, and use them in concert in an almost ridiculously beautiful and scaleable OOP MVC backend framework, which I ended up making from scratch. I mean everything. From custom Apache configuration and request routing via a custom built authentication model, which included a pretty secure routine for salting and hashing passwords and cookie tokens. Then some pretty clever controller classes parsed the meticulously organised http requests and sent back web pages assembled from a home made template system with simple placeholders. Or intricately structured json arrays in case of ajax requests. Admins had a lot of extra options. Besides being able to CRUD everything in the whole system, their charts, tables and statistics were much more advanced. Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/eOTQqYb). Man, those admins could even drill down into each employee's records and stats.

The verdict? A small B. 

We did a great and well rehearsed presentation, touching upon known weaknesses, future plans, etc. Then followed a half hour individual examination. The ***only*** thing they wanted to talk about was our complete lack of adherence to any particular design process. Our report mentioned in passing that we had used elements from Unified Process, SCRUM and eXtreme Programming, and managed sort-of-a-backlog and burndown chart via elaborate Trello boards, but that didn't fly. They admitted that the end result was pretty awesome, but our documentation of the process and our decision-making processes were, admittedly, almost non-existent. I didn't even get to show off my custom query builder class with all its flexibility and manual injection sanitation with home made regex patterns.

Anyway, I was pretty pissed and depressed over that final exam for a few days, but then a class mate pm'd me on Facebook, telling me that his boss was looking for a backend web developer who had some PHP skills. The next day, I was at the first job interview, which lasted twice as long as scheduled. Then I was subjected to [an online test](http://tests4geeks.com/test/php-mysql-javascript) which was so cruel that it made me feel totally inadequate. Regardless, I was hired the day after.

So. I went from a super safe career with all its paid overtime, no chance of getting fired, like ever,  ([remember, Denmark is a nanny state](http://denmark.dk/en/society/welfare/)) to now being in charge of the backend of a pretty complex website. I have honestly never felt as alive or fulfilled before. 

This is where I thank you guys profusely for all the help, and for generally just being an awesome and generous community. Imagine learning programming before the internet.

By the way. Remember those AppleScripts? Earlier today, I requested my first royalty check in a long time, and I decided to use some of it on some pretty awesome tools that I use during most of my waking hours: [a keyboard](http://www.roccat.org/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/ROCCAT-Ryos-MK-Pro/), [a mouse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReK_-QRHnlQ) and [a headset](http://www.accutone.co.uk/en/product/in_ear_gemini.php). Nerdgasm.

TL;DR: I'm a lucky guy.

I am currently a junior studying International Affairs and German studies at a University. I am a good student (3.6 GPA) So far, I have gotten through everything pretty easily. I almost never have to study hard for exams or get extra help and sometimes there are classes that I don't even go to and still end up getting an A. I started out pretty indecisive about my major and minor, really dedicated, I got an internship and was feeling really confident about my future. I wanted to work with non-profits or NGO's and was even thinking about going on to study international or immigration law. 

This semester, something has just changed. I have no motivation whatsoever. I have no desire to continue learning German, and I feel so behind. I used to speak up in class, and now I feel like everyone knows more than me and I have nothing to contribute. I have lost the confidence I once had, and I can't tell if that is caused by my lack of motivation or vice versa. 

I can't work right now because of a couple of chronic illnesses that I am dealing with, plus the fact that I can't find anything that will fit my schedule. I know that is kinda bringing me down too, because I worry about the future and being able to work full time because of my health. I am completely financially dependent upon my parents, and, quite frankly I feel like a complete loser. 

Furthermore, I have no desire to pursue a career in international affairs. To be quite honest, I am getting kind of sick of it - there are so many fucking problems in the world and so many ways to look at them. I can't stand listening to people debate anymore or trying to develop policies or trying to understand the economics behind things. I know a career probably won't involve such broad subjects, but even then I can't think of anything I would really want to do career-wise. Right now being a stay at home mom sounds really nice, but I know I need to get back on my feet and motivated or else I will get stuck in this state-of-mind. If I had any choice, I would love to go on straight into a masters just to stay in the university setting (although I would have no clue what to study). I'm also gonna be 20k in debt when I graduate, so that's a bit daunting.

Has anyone else gone through some kind of burn-out when they are almost done with their degree? I feel like everyone else is so motivated and excited to finish school, while I feel like I am losing my passion, and I don't want to ruin everything I have worked for just because of a bad semester. 

Any advice?"
1xyxd6,1,2014-02-15,Interview rounds again. Scared. No more confidence.,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1xyxd6/interview_rounds_again_scared_no_more_confidence/,"So last semester I applied to one of the world's top financial firm (Goldman Sachs) and I made multiple final interviews.  I was confident I was going to get a job due to my good people skills, amazing academic background, and extracurricular (on campus leadership positions + volunteering) background.  I never got an internship.

Now I'm trying again with different smaller firms, and I'm honestly scared as shit that I'll never land an internship anywhere.  All of my professors in accounting tell me that I have a great future in my field of study because I'm always the best student in the class.

I'm afraid I'll never get anything.  I was so very confident in myself landing an internship with Goldman Sachs, that I pretty much assumed it was mine for the taking (I guess that was my first mistake).

My entire life is consumed by working and studying as hard as I can.  I always work my hardest.  If I don't land an internship this time I'll probably mentally break down.  I feel like I've been preparing my life for this one moment and nothing seems to be working in my favor.  

My GPA is high enough, but when interviewing, there seems to be someone else out where with a ""better personality"".

I have little-to-no hope right now.  Is there any reason for me not to be seriously depressed right now?  I come from a very low-income family and have invested too much money and time on investing in my future.

I honestly don't even know how to handle with my stress of just finding a job after college.  I've done everything I thought was the best for my future.  

I majored in Accounting, I minored in Computer Science, have an almost perfect 4.0 GPA in my minor &amp; major, go to a good college, have taken on leadership positions on campus, volunteering, won employee of the month many times at my work, etc.

I feel like I'm working my hardest as possible, but no one out there is willing to even give me the smallest of a chance to prove myself.

I just don't know how to handle all of this stress...  I'm practically heartbroken.  I feel like the world's biggest loser and recently have been drowning in my own depression."

When I think about the house I grew up in — my football-themed bedroom, the big family room, the yard — there are always Lego bricks everywhere. And I’m clearly not alone, because everyone in my packed theater watching The Lego Movie this weekend seemed to have the same experience I did: a 100-minute exercise in nostalgia, rendered in RealD 3D.

It's the first big-budget Lego movie in the company's 80-year history, made painstakingly over five years in concert with writer–director duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Its cast list is riddled with A-list actors, its marketing is massive and unavoidable — and it's a shockingly fun, remarkably entertaining movie. Sure, it's an hour and a half of advertising for Lego, but if this is the future of marketing, sign me up.

The movie follows Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a normal guy with a normal job and a normal life. As soon as he wakes up, he breaks out the instruction manual. Jumping jacks? Check. $37 coffee? Check. Wave to neighbors? Check. He follows the speed limit, works diligently at his construction job, and every once in a while wonders if there might be more to life than this. One night as he's leaving his worksite he meets a pretty girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), and finds a mysterious object called The Piece of Resistance. The one who finds it, it's been prophesied, is The Special: the smartest, most talented, most interesting person in the world, and the one who will save everyone from President Business (Will Ferrell) and his evil plan. But to do that he needs to ditch the instructions and go freestyle.

It's not exactly breaking new ground — normal guy learns he's special, saves the world — and it does come with a fair amount of heavy-handed preaching about how everyone is special and we can all be anything we want. Like any good family-friendly movie, there's a love story, there are jokes both obvious and subtle, and there's a surprisingly tender third act. But everything about the way The Lego Movie unfolds feels fresh, with Lord and Miller doing their brand-building duty while simultaneously rolling their eyes at it. Where a movie like The Internship is one long bow at the altar of Google, The Lego Movie frequently cuts to awkward scenes where minifigures can’t quite figure out how to hold hands, or the revered ""relics"" that are mostly just gross things you might accidentally find in a box full of Lego bricks. It’s loving throughout, but it’s edgy and self-deprecating enough to never feel contrived.

Everything in the movie from elaborate cities to puffs of smoke is made of Lego, and it's all fair game: at one point Wyldstyle builds a motorcycle out of an alleyway in order to escape Liam Neeson's nefarious Bad Cop. It's this build-and-rebuild ethos that makes the movie go — the movie twists and turns relentlessly and often without any warning, as if there's a kid above acting like King Kong and knocking down the tower he's built before starting over on something different. It's a funny, quirky, weird adventure that has fun with the limitations of Legos while making clear that there's nothing you can't do or make with those interlocking blocks. Including spaceships.

""I think what we’ve really found is that Lego is a medium,"" Michael McNally, Lego's brand relations director, tells me. ""It’s not a toy, it’s a medium for other people to tell their own stories and create their own adventures."" To tell theirs, Lord and Miller (who wrote and directed 21 Jump Street and the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series) turned to Animal Logic, a well-known Australian effects studio. The result is stunning, a mix of stop-motion and photorealism that left me constantly forgetting and remembering the characters are Lego minifigures with claws for hands and as many personalities as they have outfits.

The world of The Lego Movie is enormous and meticulously detailed, and McNally notes that you could pause the movie at any point and build everything you see. (Lego’s own designers helped Animal Logic with the set and character design.) The film still feels very much like Lord and Miller, though, a constant string of winking references and off-topic pop culture jokes to go with crazy sight gags and physical humor. The cast may be needlessly star-studded — Channing Tatum’s Superman has all of about three lines — but it’s hard to imagine a lesser group pulling off this mix of irreverent and sincere. Will Arnett might be my favorite Batman ever."
1xz01u,2,2014-02-15,Interview sessions start once again.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xz01u/interview_sessions_start_once_again/,"So last semester I applied to one of the world's top financial firm (Goldman Sachs) and I made multiple final interviews. I was confident I was going to get a job due to my good people skills, amazing academic background, and extracurricular (on campus leadership positions + volunteering) background. I never got an internship.

Now I'm trying again with different smaller firms, and I'm honestly scared as shit that I'll never land an internship anywhere. All of my professors in accounting tell me that I have a great future in my field of study because I'm always the best student in the class.

I'm afraid I'll never get anything. I was so very confident in myself landing an internship with Goldman Sachs, that I pretty much assumed it was mine for the taking (I guess that was my first mistake).

My entire life is consumed by working and studying as hard as I can. I always work my hardest. If I don't land an internship this time I'll probably mentally break down. I feel like I've been preparing my life for this one moment and nothing seems to be working in my favor.

My GPA is high enough, but when interviewing, there seems to be someone else out where with a ""better personality"".

I have little-to-no hope right now. Is there any reason for me not to be seriously depressed right now? I come from a very low-income family and have invested too much money and time on investing in my future.

I honestly don't even know how to handle with my stress of just finding a job after college. I've done everything I thought was the best for my future.

I majored in Accounting, I minored in Computer Science, have an almost perfect 4.0 GPA in my minor &amp; major, go to a good college, have taken on leadership positions on campus, volunteering, won employee of the month many times at my work, etc.

I feel like I'm working my hardest as possible, but no one out there is willing to even give me the smallest of a chance to prove myself.  I just don't know how to handle all of this stress... I'm practically heartbroken. I feel like the world's biggest loser and recently have been drowning in my own depression.

If you've read through it all this far... thank you.

So as part of an internship me and my team-mates have to build a quite customized website with a lot of interactive things in it (i.e. interactive calendar, personalized content, big profiles with a lot of stuff on them etc.). 

*The important bits:*
Among the team we cover python, java, php, sql and some noSql databases and of course HTML and css. We're mostly from programming  and development background (there are other people that make the design)

There has been some initial work done on Drupal, but getting around the structure of everything is proving to be very unintuitive - at least for me - I simply cannot find what I need (in terms of file, code etc., getting around the admin panel is straightforward)
now, and we know that we'll have to rework everything from scratch anyway. It also seems to have modules for everything (although it feels like trying to build a house from bricks that are different size, material and shape)

The fun part - we all got  little (or none) experience with Drupal except one person, that seems to know their way around. Our php level is ... uhm mixed.

In the meantime I found django, and at first glance it seems more intuitive and a bit easier to get around, customize and get it to do what you want. My idea is to suggest building the thing on django, maybe with MongoDB as backing database. 

So question is what do you guys suggest: Should we keep to Drupal, should we do the website with django? What are the up and downsides of each? Maybe something else would be better? 

Thanks in advance for the help. "

Watch Endless Love Online Like many films about wholly misguided love affairs, consuming obsession, and criminal activity involving elephants, ‘Endless Love’ opens with a vaguely creepy voiceover. Apparently meant to be styled as the opening lines to some kind of modern fairy tale, David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) uses the first few moments of Shana Feste’s adaptation to introduce us his very own tower-bound princess, young Jade Butterfield (Gabrielle Wilde), a sensitive enough soul entombed in our own grief (or something like that, it’s hard to tell over Pettyfer’s creepy staring). Set at the pair’s high school graduation, David and the camera both spy on Jade as he vows to do, well, something to get to know her. Charming.

Despite its title, film bears little resemblance to its source material, and only scattered details have been plucked from both the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film and the 1979 Scott Spencer book – including character names, the destructive power of hormones, a lingering weirdness with Jade’s mother, and explosive fire (no, no, not of the hormonal variety). Surprisingly sanitized despite a hefty number of perfume commercial-styled love scenes, ‘Endless Love’ keeps most of the darkness of the novel and first film at bay, resulting in a throwaway romance that’s only memorable because of how tremendously and laughably bad it is.


""""‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad, cringe cinema.""""



Watch Endless Love Online Whereas the original film imagined the Butterfields as free spirits and David as a preppy kid from a wealthy family, Feste’s film flips the script – these bookish Butterfields are profoundly straight-laced (and profoundly wealthy, apparently) and David is from a broken blue-collar home, and his only interests seem to include partying and cars (you know, like any teen boy). Both devastated by and sequestered after her beloved older brother’s death when she was just a sophomore in high school, Jade has spent the remainder of high school studying and hanging out with her parents. It’s certainly a sad story, and, man, does Dead Brother Chris hang over the Butterfield house, but it’s also hard to swallow – did Jade not have friends before? Did no one think to go out of his or her way to be kind to the heartbroken teen? Did no other guy notice that Jade is, to put it mildly, wildly gorgeous? – and instead, we’re forced to believe that Jade has been left alone for two years and is simply bursting for some human contact.



Enthralled by David’s wild manner and bad haircut, Jade falls fast for her new beau, despite lingering concerns from her family, especially her overbearing dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood). Hugh’s wariness is well-founded, because all it takes for Jade to abandon her innocence is precisely one joyride in a filched Maserati, one party crashed by surly teens putting on dance routines (yes), and one truly terrible family dinner. Jade, for all her inhibition and inexperience, beds David in her family home – in an open-doored library with a roaring fire and her family sleeping nearby, making it clear early on that almost nothing about their love story will scan as believable, even as it is wildly and bizarrely amusing to watch. While neither Pettyfer nor Wilde look convincingly like teens (both actors are in their mid-twenties), Wilde does manage to intermittently nail the coltish innocence of Jade.



Watch Endless Love Online As over the top as ‘Endless Love’ is (and, goodness, is this thing over the top), Feste occasionally hits on real emotion and believable reactions – it’s just all obscured by a choking hormonal haze and a dizzying series of increasingly terrible decisions. Hugh’s desire to protect his daughter is entirely understandable given their background, but Feste and Joshua Safran’s script insists on turning his concern into a version of villainy, while also folding in a subplot that makes him look like a real bastard (and, yes, he is a real bastard, but it ultimately has zero to do with his feelings about Jade and David). Similarly, Jade, consumed by her love for David (and, again, the hormones, good God, the hormones) decides to skip out on an internship that is essential to her future career as a doctor just to spend the summer with her new boyfriend.



Make no mistake, ‘Endless Love’ is not a good film, but that doesn’t keep it from being compulsively watchable and deeply (if not accidentally) entertaining. The film is peppered with hammy, head-thumping visual cues (Jade lives in a literally gated house! She is gated up! Free her, David!) and a series of instantly quotable one-liners (few people will be able to resist the charm of David’s father Harry, played by Robert Patrick, screaming at Hugh about the legality of breaking into a zoo). Distilled down to its most basic elements, ‘Endless Love’ is about the battle between mature love and first love, which isn’t a bad thing to form a film around – in its execution, however, ‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad cringe cinema that seems destined to become a new wave cult classic (read: audiences will enjoy laughing at it for many, many years to come)."
1xzae3,6,2014-02-15,Do I turn down this offer?,9Virtues,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1xzae3/do_i_turn_down_this_offer/,"So I'm doing an internship (still have a semester left of school), and its been hinted I'll get an offer to come back in the fall full time (finish school in summer).

The issue is, is that its a 1 hour and 45 min drive there and back. As it stands now during busy season I have an hour before I have to leave for work, and then when I get home an hour before bed. I honestly can't see myself doing this long term. Ya I know when busy season ends, it will get better, but for the past 6 weeks the only time I can even turn on the TV or watch a movie is Sunday (work saturday too).

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And so the saga of Thor continues. We first met the mighty Asgardian in 2011, when he was arrogant, impulsive and full of hubris, only learning humility when marooned on earth and surrounded by puny humans.

He ended that film a more measured and mature warrior, which readied him to team up with The Avengers for 2012’s biggest blockbuster, in which he once again helped save our planet from alien invasion. And little over 12 months later he’s back for a third outing, this time in the entertaining if somewhat silly and derivative Thor: The Dark World.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film kicks off with a prologue that finds Thor’s grandfather doing battle with an army of ‘Dark Elves’, led by the menacing Malekith, a seriously angry elf who is hellbent on plunging the world into darkness.

His plan revolves around harnessing the power of ‘The Aether’, which is one of those mysterious destructive forces that films like this need in order to further their plot but
Chris Tilly Says

He fails in his efforts however, but not before sacrificing the majority of his people and sticking himself and a few survivors into hibernation.

Thor’s Gramps meanwhile, on realising that he can’t actually destroy the Aether, instead buries it where no one will be able to find it. Of course, it's found in the first 30 minutes.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Yet while it’s nice to learn about Asgard’s back-story and heritage, time waits for no God, and so we immediately jump forward to the present-day, where Thor’s brother Loki is imprisoned on Asgard following the events of The Avengers, his girlfriend Jane Foster is stuck on earth and wondering where he’s gone and why he didn’t call while said events were taking place, and Thor himself is travelling through the Nine Realms kicking ass and taking names with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

It’s in these scenes that we first get an inkling as to why Marvel charged Alan Taylor with the task of helming the picture, his ability to stage and shoot a battle – honed while working on Game of Thrones – meaning that Thor: The Dark World has some of the best action sequences yet seen in a superhero movie.

Taylor has a more naturalistic approach than Kenneth Branagh employed on the previous flick, thrusting his camera into the heart of battle so that the fight scenes have a grittiness and muscularity that serve the story well.

But the Warriors soon complete their task, bringing peace to the Realms so that early on in proceedings, The Dark World is suffering from a severe lack of drama and conflict beyond Thor arguing with his Dad about the differences between a king and a man. And standing around with his top off for no apparent reason.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Praise Odin’s beard then that the Convergence is approaching, a beautiful but dangerous cosmic event in which all of the Realms align. And don’t worry if you don’t understand this aspect of the plot, as it’s explained over-and-over again throughout the film.

The event coincides with Malekith waking from his slumber and going after the Aether, putting him on a collision course with Thor on Asgard and Jane on earth. And then Jane on Asgard and Thor on earth. And as worlds align and portals open, the action traverses between these realms and several others on an all-too-regular basis, making for a somewhat schizophrenic viewing experience that at times confuses.

It doesn’t help that Malekith is a pretty weak antagonist, with much of the misery that drives the film’s villain seemingly brought on himself. There’s no doubting that Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but here he’s buried under mountains of prosthetics, and the audience spends so little time with the character that we never get a true sense of who he is or what his motives are.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And in spite of the fact that the film clocks in just under two hours, it also feels like we don’t spend enough time with Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. In The Avengers he was part of a hugely charismatic ensemble, but when it comes to Thor – where the title character is often the straight man – he’s pretty much the star of the show, and so scenes where he’s not onscreen feel like a wasted opportunity.

Indeed the film kicks up a gear when he and Thor are compelled to join forces, and rather than squabbling with each other – as they have done in previous efforts – their dynamic becomes infinitely more interesting; the film all-the-more fun because of it.

Which is more than can be said for the relationship between Thor and Jane, which may well be the least interesting aspect of the narrative, a potential love triangle between the pair and Lady Sif briefly thrown into the mix before quickly and mercifully being dropped.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Jane’s friendship with intern Darcy does allow Kat Dennings to once again flex her comedic muscles, and more of her one-liners hit the mark here than in the original Thor. Indeed this may rival Iron Man 3 for the title of ‘funniest Marvel movie yet,’ with Chris O’Dowd raising laughs in a couple of brief appearances, Stellan Skarsgard stripping off for a hilariously clothes-free cameo as Dr. Erik Selvig, and Thor’s ‘fish-out-of-water’ shtick still working three films in.

But perhaps the funniest character this time around – albeit unintentionally – is Idris Elba’s Heimdall, the returning Sentinel who possesses the ability to see and hear events in faraway galaxies. Heimdall has one job, which is to guard the gate at Asgard’s Observatory. And yet he fails on that front quite spectacularly in The Dark World, the character’s incompetence making him quite possibly the worst bouncer in the cosmos.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film’s biggest problem is that it fails to take the Thor franchise to the next level however. Post-Avengers, Marvel’s standalone superhero movies have to work doubly hard to make their mark, which the aforementioned Iron Man 3 did by raising the stakes and stripping Tony Stark bare so that you genuinely thought that it might be the end for him.

But Thor: The Dark World feels less like a dramatic escalation and more like bland continuation, the action improved but the story – which was written by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely – unimaginative and uninvolving, at times feeling like it’s been cobbled together from bits of other comic book movies. There’s a huge contrivance involving Jane Foster that’s somewhat unforgivable. And come on guys – Charing Cross to Greenwich on the Tube in three stops? Seriously?

Watch Thor The Dark World Online That said, the film does manage to avoid climaxing with the kind of cliché-ridden city-wide destruction that has become the hallmark of the genre in recent years. East London does take a bit of a battering during the finale, but the film nevertheless finds an alternate route to close out its narrative; one that cleverly combines comedy and action for something approaching a satisfying conclusion."

Watch The Lego Movie Online ""I think what we’ve really found is that Lego is a medium,"" Michael McNally, Lego's brand relations director, tells me. ""It’s not a toy, it’s a medium for other people to tell their own stories and create their own adventures."" To tell theirs, Lord and Miller (who wrote and directed 21 Jump Street and the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series) turned to Animal Logic, a well-known Australian effects studio.

It's a movie made for Lego fans of all ages, which McNally reminds me are everywhere: Lego is the second-largest toy maker in the world, and there are even communities of Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) around the world. ""It’s no different from Volkswagen owners or Apple enthusiasts or Disney fanatics,"" he says. ""We have Lego fans."" He grants that the movie seems designed to encourage and revive interest in Lego (and to sell bricks), but says that wasn't the point. ""A feature film was never really something we set out to make. A lot of people say, ‘Well, toy movies are just designed to sell toys.’ And that’s not something that was compelling to us… it wasn’t like we needed a movie to help us sell more stuff.""

Long story short, I'm a UWM student whose computer decided to apparently stop working overnight. I take 15 credits, and am a Journalism student so not having a laptop is already greatly screwing me over. On top of that, I just took an internship with Peace Action Wisconsin and I am (supposed) to manage their social media. This was literally yesterday that I had my first day there. A lot of the social media work is supposed to be on my own time.

I'm beyond broke, as in I owe hundreds of dollars to WE Energies, etc. because I am behind in bills. I cannot purchase a new laptop. Even the ones on Craigslist that have word (and the ability to insert an SD card) are $150-$200.

I'd be willing to provide my transcripts to show I am a serious student. 

Thank you.

I worked 4 years in the field right out of uni. I love it, I always did, but then I made a career change and became a project manager/consultant.

Now I have 10 years' experience as a PM, not all of it related to IT or system development: I spent my last 3 years in advertising (yeah, I know) managing the dev teams and PMs which did all the ""digital"" work in the agency. So I didn't code myself, but I oversaw everybody that did. I believe I did OK as a PM, but not nearly as good as when I was working with code.

Now I decided to pursue a lifelong dream of moving to Canada. Due to the immigration process, my best choice is to enroll in a Canadian school and get at least one year of Canadian post-secondary education - because then I can get a work permit for the same amount of time I spent in school and then apply for permanent residence, then - many years later - citizenship.

So obviously I have a ton of questions:

1) Should I get a masters (longer, expensive) or some other CS related degree or diploma (shorter, cheaper)? I saw some good courses with co-op semesters (basically paid internships) which would be really good into giving me a first push into the Canadian market. About the masters, I read [the related topics listed in this sub FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_masters), but couldn't reach a conclusion, especially considering my background. Also, recently someone posted [this](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobs/a/best-worst-masters-degree-jobs.htm) on /r/jobs and it made me even more confused.

2) Would my managerial experience add up or hinder my professional profile for a recruiter looking for a software engineer or system analyst? How can I make it work in my favor?

3) Should I give up on going back to the dev world and pursue a managerial career in Canada, even though I have only a tiny canadian experience (a six months consulting project) and no experience in managerial roles inside the Canadian job market/culture? Wouldn't my chances be really, REALLY slim?

Any help is really appreciated. Thanks in advance."

Watch Endless Love Online Like many films about wholly misguided love affairs, consuming obsession, and 
criminal activity involving elephants, ‘Endless Love’ opens with a vaguely creepy voiceover. Apparently meant to be styled as the opening lines to some kind of modern fairy tale, David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) uses the first few moments of Shana Feste’s adaptation to introduce us his very own tower-bound princess, young Jade Butterfield (Gabrielle Wilde), a sensitive enough soul entombed in our own grief (or something like that, it’s hard to tell over Pettyfer’s creepy staring). Set at the pair’s high school graduation, David and the camera both spy on Jade as he vows to do, well, something to get to know her. Charming.

Despite its title, film bears little resemblance to its source material, and only scattered details have been plucked from both the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film and the 1979 Scott Spencer book – including character names, the destructive power of hormones, a lingering weirdness with Jade’s mother, and explosive fire (no, no, not of the hormonal variety). Surprisingly sanitized despite a hefty number of perfume commercial-styled love scenes, ‘Endless Love’ keeps most of the darkness of the novel and first film at bay, resulting in a throwaway romance that’s only memorable because of how tremendously and laughably bad it is.


""""‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad, cringe cinema.""""



Watch Endless Love Online Whereas the original film imagined the Butterfields as free spirits and David as a preppy kid from a wealthy family, Feste’s film flips the script – these bookish Butterfields are profoundly straight-laced (and profoundly wealthy, apparently) and David is from a broken blue-collar home, and his only interests seem to include partying and cars (you know, like any teen boy). Both devastated by and sequestered after her beloved older brother’s death when she was just a sophomore in high school, Jade has spent the remainder of high school studying and hanging out with her parents. It’s certainly a sad story, and, man, does Dead Brother Chris hang over the Butterfield house, but it’s also hard to swallow – did Jade not have friends before? Did no one think to go out of his or her way to be kind to the heartbroken teen? Did no other guy notice that Jade is, to put it mildly, wildly gorgeous? – and instead, we’re forced to believe that Jade has been left alone for two years and is simply bursting for some human contact.



Enthralled by David’s wild manner and bad haircut, Jade falls fast for her new beau, despite lingering concerns from her family, especially her overbearing dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood). Hugh’s wariness is well-founded, because all it takes for Jade to abandon her innocence is precisely one joyride in a filched Maserati, one party crashed by surly teens putting on dance routines (yes), and one truly terrible family dinner. Jade, for all her inhibition and inexperience, beds David in her family home – in an open-doored library with a roaring fire and her family sleeping nearby, making it clear early on that almost nothing about their love story will scan as believable, even as it is wildly and bizarrely amusing to watch. While neither Pettyfer nor Wilde look convincingly like teens (both actors are in their mid-twenties), Wilde does manage to intermittently nail the coltish innocence of Jade.



Watch Endless Love Online As over the top as ‘Endless Love’ is (and, goodness, is this thing over the top), Feste occasionally hits on real emotion and believable reactions – it’s just all obscured by a choking hormonal haze and a dizzying series of increasingly terrible decisions. Hugh’s desire to protect his daughter is entirely understandable given their background, but Feste and Joshua Safran’s script insists on turning his concern into a version of villainy, while also folding in a subplot that makes him look like a real bastard (and, yes, he is a real bastard, but it ultimately has zero to do with his feelings about Jade and David). Similarly, Jade, consumed by her love for David (and, again, the hormones, good God, the hormones) decides to skip out on an internship that is essential to her future career as a doctor just to spend the summer with her new boyfriend.



Make no mistake, ‘Endless Love’ is not a good film, but that doesn’t keep it from being compulsively watchable and deeply (if not accidentally) entertaining. The film is peppered with hammy, head-thumping visual cues (Jade lives in a literally gated house! She is gated up! Free her, David!) and a series of instantly quotable one-liners (few people will be able to resist the charm of David’s father Harry, played by Robert Patrick, screaming at Hugh about the legality of breaking into a zoo). Distilled down to its most basic elements, ‘Endless Love’ is about the battle between mature love and first love, which isn’t a bad thing to form a film around – in its execution, however, ‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad cringe cinema that seems destined to become a new wave cult classic (read: audiences will enjoy laughing at it for many, many years to come)."
1y09el,15,2014-02-15,Take internships both summers and delay graduation?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1y09el/take_internships_both_summers_and_delay_graduation/,"I am a third year student this year, but I just switched into Com Sci at the end of fall semester. I entered college in fall 2011 and did a year of AeroE, then I stayed over the summer and did the summer and 3 semesters as a Physics major. Now I feel I've found my niche and am on the Com Sci track. Thanks to AP credits I will be able to graduate in spring 2016 if I take a few classes this summer, even taking summer '15 off to do an internship.

I have found an opportunity to work in IT over the summer making $15/hr and working pretty independently. If I do this, it will likely increase my chances of getting a good internship next summer, as well as getting a good job at graduation. However, it takes away the summer and means that I will have to stay in school and graduate at the end of '16 calendar year. Is it worth delaying graduation to increase my marketability?

Here's a bit of background on the internship I'd be doing this summer:

&gt;[redacted] is a progressive company working on such technologies as Mobile Computing,
Virtualization, Supply Chain Optimization and Computer Assisted Ordering. The Information
Technology department will be hiring 9 interns for the summer of 2014. This group will be
visiting the stores to install and update Windows computer systems throughout [redacted]’s eight
state areas. Tasks will include upgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2, preparing for an
Exchange 2013 migration, working with Active Directory and Hyper-V, as well as staging and
deploying workstations. We will be performing various other maintenance tasks and software
updates. We are looking for individuals currently studying for a degree in MIS, Computer
Science, or some other technical field. The necessary training required for this project will be
provided.
The position will be Monday through Friday, with travel and overnight stays. The internship
will begin in mid-May and conclude in mid-August. All interns must have a valid driver’s
license. Travel expenses will be reimbursed.

It doesn't pay as well as other internships, but it also doesn't require prior knowledge, only an interest in technical fields. I spoke with one of the managers who will be involved in the hiring at my university's career fair and the conversation went well. He has my resume and says he will keep an eye out for my application.

So, is it advisable to postpone graduation for ~7 months (and possibly do a third internship that final summer since I won't need any summer classes) or, should I try to get out quicker and do my summer classes now and just take the one internship next summer (which will hopefully be better than the one described above since I'll have more info under my belt)?

*edit* - additional about the position from my conversation with the recruiter - a week of training at the corporate headquarters, a week of travel and deployment with trainers and other interns, a week traveling with just other inters, the rest of the summer alone."

I feel like I have to learn stories or learn exactly what to say, otherwise my brain just shuts down. My mind is excellent at times, I got 160 in an IQ test, I'm good at problem solving and seem to have a love of numbers and the like.

I don't know if there is something wrong with my memory, but a recruiter was preparing me for an interview and she was saying

""tell me about a time where you went above and beyond in customer service""

Now, I know that I have done this in previous jobs, I'm very attentive and eager to please, but remembering exact details when someone is staring at you... I couldn't come up with an elaborate story about it, I couldn't even form sentences. My brain just stopped, it just decided not to work.

Is there any way to get around situations like this?

About me: I finished an Economics &amp; Finance degree last summer, had a graduate internship writing a business plan for a company, ending just before christmas, and am trying to figure out which jobs I would enjoy (I like the numbers, the use of excel, the problem solving - though I wouldn't want to be someone who messes people over to get huge profits) where there would be some people for me to talk to, in terms of help or clarification, but so that I can go and have time to be by myself and get on with things.

Do I try and get better at thinking and coming up with things quick and under pressure or apply for certain jobs where they won't ask too much about situations I found difficult, or just scenarios that I just can't remember for the life of me?

1y0rdx,7,2014-02-15,There is a world of potential passing me by,[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1y0rdx/there_is_a_world_of_potential_passing_me_by/,"Here is my situation in life. In 2010 I graduated with a science degree and moved home with my mother in the suburb of a large city to begin an internship at a large research institution / museum. The commute is a bit rough at 1.5 hours, but it's a great place to work. There is a lot of energy and there are great people there. After two years of interning, I was able to get started on a project part-time in a different department, thanks to the great networking opportunities there. Trouble is, most of the work I'm doing is off-site in the suburbs where I live. I'm pretty much isolated at this location.  
  
Now, it was hard enough to keep up with friends and co-workers in the city when I had to commute on a daily basis, but this current situation makes it downright impossible. My friends are busy with their own lives—job(s), grad school, families—and I just can't stay on their radars. When there are company mixers or birthday parties or whatnot that I get the invite to, it's always a great time and I'm generally very sociable. I try my best to keep the momentum going and hang out one-on-one or in small groups, but inevitably I fall out of contact with everyone. They have their own usual circles, and I am not a part of them due to my location. I hear things like ""wow, you came all the way out here for coffee with us?""—innocent small-talk, I'm sure, but in my mind it further cements my status as fringe social member. The same thing happens when I show up at my main work building in the city: ""oh hey, what are you doing here?""  
  
It's so frustrating, because I think my social skills are pretty alright, but it's circumstance that is preventing me from having any good friends.  
  
The solution is clear, I think. I need to get a job that would support my moving into the city. However, the past 4 years haven't offered any promising leads, even within my company. The one time that I did make it to the final round of interviews with my company for a full-time position was in the summer of 2010, when I was a fresh, deer-in-the-headlights intern. Go figure. The person who got the position was pretty much identical to me, right down to the degree that we both had just finished (I learned later that, yes, the job could have gone to either of us). I try not to think about the fact that they made tons of friends and has since moved on to grad school and a better job and is engaged. No, I was not even considered for a first-round interview for the vacancy that they left, despite being the runner-up last time around. I'm only a little bit bitter.  
  
I've tried Meetup groups and networking groups that happen in my city, but a similar invisibility effect comes into play. My suburb itself is a social void-zone.  
  
I'm not precisely sure what I'm asking for here. Maybe I just needed to vent. Perhaps I'm finally cracking under the pressure of knowing that I'm the only one of my peers who isn't financially independent. And this is 4 years on at this point.  
  
Thank you for listening."
1y0rhp,1,2014-02-15,Interning Without a Career Plan,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1y0rhp/interning_without_a_career_plan/,"Hi Reddit,

I am a 21 year-old Asian male living in NYC. I am currently a third-year student at a public university majoring in psychology. I have taken several introductory science courses, psychology courses, and random electives. I have been preparing to apply to medical schools, but complicated and personal issues will set me back a few years. 

Because of this setback as well as my doubts about pursuing a career in medicine, I have decided to search for job or career opportunities in other fields. However, I have absolutely no idea what to ""try out"". My academic interests have always been in the sciences and medicine. (I do not want to go into research/science unless it's medicine). Ironically, this setback can be great since I am being given the opportunity to search for alternative careers that may suit me. 

For your information, I have a clean record, and my GPA is very strong. I also have a few people that may be willing to write me strong letters of recommendations for programs, internships, scholarships, etc.


As most students, I wish to find a job after graduation, so I am looking for internships for this summer. This will be my last summer in college. Do you recommend I apply everywhere and for everything? I have no set career plan in mind, so I am having difficulty pinpointing what programs or internships I want to apply for.

I have found internships in famous museums, marketing teams, etc., and they all seem pretty interesting. However, to aimlessly apply to them and just go to the one I get accepted to seems dumb IMO (or maybe this is how most people do it).

Also, I am having trouble selling myself. Most of my out-of-class experiences have been in clinical settings and in a research lab. Therefore,   I feel like I have nothing to offer outside of the research/science field. (I do not want to go into research/science unless it's medicine). 

So, again, the ultimate question is: How do I go about looking for internships? Should I just apply for everything and anything I see? Are there any red flags I should look for when reading descriptions about positions? How will I know if I will be able to get job opportunities from the internships I will apply for? How will I know if my position will lead to decent/well paying jobs later on?

Advice from those who are experienced or successfully landed a good internship would be greatly appreciated. Help out a desperate college student! "

I'm currently trying to work on deferred rendering and lighting and more complex scenes but I'm a little lost and wondering if I'm actually learning anything. 

Lately it feels like I'm doing less learning and more reinventing the wheel just for the sake of it. Which leads me to my question; How should I continue to learn OpenGL and graphics programming in general? Should I just go ""Oh that looks like a cool effect, how do I implement that?"" or is there a better and more structured way to improve? 

Right now I'm somewhat annoyed as I'm having trouble importing random online models and for things like volume rendering (light,shadow,etc) I'm needing to write something that provides immediate mode which just feels like more stuff in between me and actually doing things. I've also been having issues choosing GUI libraries as I'm having trouble finding something light and easy to integrate that doesn't conflict with any of my other libraries. 

I've found some promising ones, but they either don't work with glfw3, require glu or glload rather than glew or are very large libraries that would require a few weeks to learn and integrate. 

Ideally I'd like to get my skills to the point where I can apply for an internship in computer graphics but I'm not sure what exactly that would require.

At the start of the interview, the recruiter point blank told me I probably wouldn't get the internship because I was a junior (she would give priority to graduating seniors since it's their ""last chance to intern"" and the firm was probably looking for more ~~minions~~ staff to hire). I was a bit taken aback, but I figured nothing of it as she asked me some questions.

That evening after coming home from my interview, I found out that another junior from my university had gotten in - the recruiter offered him a position right on the spot. My guess is his experience was a bit more applicable (although I'm not sure by how much; his internship experience was similar to mine). The next day I got an email saying I was not getting the internship. It was a bummer, but I ended up finding another internship that I'm currently at that makes me happy.

I wasn't mad for the junior getting the spot (jealous is probably more like it), but at the recruiter for pretty much disqualifying me simply because of my class standing. 

I'm reapplying for summer (it's a small industry and a renowned company), so if in the event I get another interview with the same recruiter, is there any way I could politely call her out (even though she might not remember me)? I know the point is to convince her to hire me (and be polite and take the high road), but I'm half expecting her to make the same statement again should I interview with her."

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And so the saga of Thor continues. We first met the mighty Asgardian in 2011, when he was arrogant, impulsive and full of hubris, only learning humility when marooned on earth and surrounded by puny humans.

He ended that film a more measured and mature warrior, which readied him to team up with The Avengers for 2012’s biggest blockbuster, in which he once again helped save our planet from alien invasion. And little over 12 months later he’s back for a third outing, this time in the entertaining if somewhat silly and derivative Thor: The Dark World.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film kicks off with a prologue that finds Thor’s grandfather doing battle with an army of ‘Dark Elves’, led by the menacing Malekith, a seriously angry elf who is hellbent on plunging the world into darkness.

His plan revolves around harnessing the power of ‘The Aether’, which is one of those mysterious destructive forces that films like this need in order to further their plot but
Chris Tilly Says

He fails in his efforts however, but not before sacrificing the majority of his people and sticking himself and a few survivors into hibernation.

Thor’s Gramps meanwhile, on realising that he can’t actually destroy the Aether, instead buries it where no one will be able to find it. Of course, it's found in the first 30 minutes.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Yet while it’s nice to learn about Asgard’s back-story and heritage, time waits for no God, and so we immediately jump forward to the present-day, where Thor’s brother Loki is imprisoned on Asgard following the events of The Avengers, his girlfriend Jane Foster is stuck on earth and wondering where he’s gone and why he didn’t call while said events were taking place, and Thor himself is travelling through the Nine Realms kicking ass and taking names with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

It’s in these scenes that we first get an inkling as to why Marvel charged Alan Taylor with the task of helming the picture, his ability to stage and shoot a battle – honed while working on Game of Thrones – meaning that Thor: The Dark World has some of the best action sequences yet seen in a superhero movie.

Taylor has a more naturalistic approach than Kenneth Branagh employed on the previous flick, thrusting his camera into the heart of battle so that the fight scenes have a grittiness and muscularity that serve the story well.

But the Warriors soon complete their task, bringing peace to the Realms so that early on in proceedings, The Dark World is suffering from a severe lack of drama and conflict beyond Thor arguing with his Dad about the differences between a king and a man. And standing around with his top off for no apparent reason.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Praise Odin’s beard then that the Convergence is approaching, a beautiful but dangerous cosmic event in which all of the Realms align. And don’t worry if you don’t understand this aspect of the plot, as it’s explained over-and-over again throughout the film.

The event coincides with Malekith waking from his slumber and going after the Aether, putting him on a collision course with Thor on Asgard and Jane on earth. And then Jane on Asgard and Thor on earth. And as worlds align and portals open, the action traverses between these realms and several others on an all-too-regular basis, making for a somewhat schizophrenic viewing experience that at times confuses.

It doesn’t help that Malekith is a pretty weak antagonist, with much of the misery that drives the film’s villain seemingly brought on himself. There’s no doubting that Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but here he’s buried under mountains of prosthetics, and the audience spends so little time with the character that we never get a true sense of who he is or what his motives are.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And in spite of the fact that the film clocks in just under two hours, it also feels like we don’t spend enough time with Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. In The Avengers he was part of a hugely charismatic ensemble, but when it comes to Thor – where the title character is often the straight man – he’s pretty much the star of the show, and so scenes where he’s not onscreen feel like a wasted opportunity.

Indeed the film kicks up a gear when he and Thor are compelled to join forces, and rather than squabbling with each other – as they have done in previous efforts – their dynamic becomes infinitely more interesting; the film all-the-more fun because of it.

Which is more than can be said for the relationship between Thor and Jane, which may well be the least interesting aspect of the narrative, a potential love triangle between the pair and Lady Sif briefly thrown into the mix before quickly and mercifully being dropped.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Jane’s friendship with intern Darcy does allow Kat Dennings to once again flex her comedic muscles, and more of her one-liners hit the mark here than in the original Thor. Indeed this may rival Iron Man 3 for the title of ‘funniest Marvel movie yet,’ with Chris O’Dowd raising laughs in a couple of brief appearances, Stellan Skarsgard stripping off for a hilariously clothes-free cameo as Dr. Erik Selvig, and Thor’s ‘fish-out-of-water’ shtick still working three films in.

But perhaps the funniest character this time around – albeit unintentionally – is Idris Elba’s Heimdall, the returning Sentinel who possesses the ability to see and hear events in faraway galaxies. Heimdall has one job, which is to guard the gate at Asgard’s Observatory. And yet he fails on that front quite spectacularly in The Dark World, the character’s incompetence making him quite possibly the worst bouncer in the cosmos.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film’s biggest problem is that it fails to take the Thor franchise to the next level however. Post-Avengers, Marvel’s standalone superhero movies have to work doubly hard to make their mark, which the aforementioned Iron Man 3 did by raising the stakes and stripping Tony Stark bare so that you genuinely thought that it might be the end for him.

But Thor: The Dark World feels less like a dramatic escalation and more like bland continuation, the action improved but the story – which was written by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely – unimaginative and uninvolving, at times feeling like it’s been cobbled together from bits of other comic book movies. There’s a huge contrivance involving Jane Foster that’s somewhat unforgivable. And come on guys – Charing Cross to Greenwich on the Tube in three stops? Seriously?

Watch Thor The Dark World Online That said, the film does manage to avoid climaxing with the kind of cliché-ridden city-wide destruction that has become the hallmark of the genre in recent years. East London does take a bit of a battering during the finale, but the film nevertheless finds an alternate route to close out its narrative; one that cleverly combines comedy and action for something approaching a satisfying conclusion."

Watch Endless Love Online Like many films about wholly misguided love affairs, consuming obsession, and criminal activity involving elephants, ‘Endless Love’ opens with a vaguely creepy voiceover. Apparently meant to be styled as the opening lines to some kind of modern fairy tale, David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) uses the first few moments of Shana Feste’s adaptation to introduce us his very own tower-bound princess, young Jade Butterfield (Gabrielle Wilde), a sensitive enough soul entombed in our own grief (or something like that, it’s hard to tell over Pettyfer’s creepy staring). Set at the pair’s high school graduation, David and the camera both spy on Jade as he vows to do, well, something to get to know her. Charming.

Despite its title, film bears little resemblance to its source material, and only scattered details have been plucked from both the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film and the 1979 Scott Spencer book – including character names, the destructive power of hormones, a lingering weirdness with Jade’s mother, and explosive fire (no, no, not of the hormonal variety). Surprisingly sanitized despite a hefty number of perfume commercial-styled love scenes, ‘Endless Love’ keeps most of the darkness of the novel and first film at bay, resulting in a throwaway romance that’s only memorable because of how tremendously and laughably bad it is.


""""‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad, cringe cinema.""""



Watch Endless Love Online Whereas the original film imagined the Butterfields as free spirits and David as a preppy kid from a wealthy family, Feste’s film flips the script – these bookish Butterfields are profoundly straight-laced (and profoundly wealthy, apparently) and David is from a broken blue-collar home, and his only interests seem to include partying and cars (you know, like any teen boy). Both devastated by and sequestered after her beloved older brother’s death when she was just a sophomore in high school, Jade has spent the remainder of high school studying and hanging out with her parents. It’s certainly a sad story, and, man, does Dead Brother Chris hang over the Butterfield house, but it’s also hard to swallow – did Jade not have friends before? Did no one think to go out of his or her way to be kind to the heartbroken teen? Did no other guy notice that Jade is, to put it mildly, wildly gorgeous? – and instead, we’re forced to believe that Jade has been left alone for two years and is simply bursting for some human contact.



Enthralled by David’s wild manner and bad haircut, Jade falls fast for her new beau, despite lingering concerns from her family, especially her overbearing dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood). Hugh’s wariness is well-founded, because all it takes for Jade to abandon her innocence is precisely one joyride in a filched Maserati, one party crashed by surly teens putting on dance routines (yes), and one truly terrible family dinner. Jade, for all her inhibition and inexperience, beds David in her family home – in an open-doored library with a roaring fire and her family sleeping nearby, making it clear early on that almost nothing about their love story will scan as believable, even as it is wildly and bizarrely amusing to watch. While neither Pettyfer nor Wilde look convincingly like teens (both actors are in their mid-twenties), Wilde does manage to intermittently nail the coltish innocence of Jade.



Watch Endless Love Online As over the top as ‘Endless Love’ is (and, goodness, is this thing over the top), Feste occasionally hits on real emotion and believable reactions – it’s just all obscured by a choking hormonal haze and a dizzying series of increasingly terrible decisions. Hugh’s desire to protect his daughter is entirely understandable given their background, but Feste and Joshua Safran’s script insists on turning his concern into a version of villainy, while also folding in a subplot that makes him look like a real bastard (and, yes, he is a real bastard, but it ultimately has zero to do with his feelings about Jade and David). Similarly, Jade, consumed by her love for David (and, again, the hormones, good God, the hormones) decides to skip out on an internship that is essential to her future career as a doctor just to spend the summer with her new boyfriend.



Make no mistake, ‘Endless Love’ is not a good film, but that doesn’t keep it from being compulsively watchable and deeply (if not accidentally) entertaining. The film is peppered with hammy, head-thumping visual cues (Jade lives in a literally gated house! She is gated up! Free her, David!) and a series of instantly quotable one-liners (few people will be able to resist the charm of David’s father Harry, played by Robert Patrick, screaming at Hugh about the legality of breaking into a zoo). Distilled down to its most basic elements, ‘Endless Love’ is about the battle between mature love and first love, which isn’t a bad thing to form a film around – in its execution, however, ‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad cringe cinema that seems destined to become a new wave cult classic (read: audiences will enjoy laughing at it for many, many years to come)."

I have been lurking on this subreddit ever since I got my PADI Open Water in December 2012.  Well, I think it is safe to say I have been bitten by the scuba bug!  After doing my Open Water, I did my AOW a few weeks later and actually quit my job and moved to Australia for a year to make some scratch in order to buy equipment and do a Dive Master Internship.  

Fast forward to the present, I am a Rescue Diver who has just arrived, like 3 hours ago, in Cebu city, Philippines. 
I’m reaching out to our awesome community here to pick your brains regarding where I should pursue this internship.  I’ve done a fair amount of research and have narrowed it down to three locations in the Cebu area (I’ll worry about dive centers when I get there, although suggestions are welcome).  

The three options are as follows:

1)	 Malapascua – Home to Monad Shoal and frequent Thresher Shark sightings 

2)	Moalboal – Famous for their schools of sardines, turtles, and whale sharks, not to mention a laid back diving community

3)	Alona beach, Panglao Island in Bohol – Amazing coral reefs and similar vibrant diver community

So I’m curious if anyone of you have been to these destinations or if you guys run in circles with others who have.  

As an FYI, I have all my own equipment, perhaps I can get a break on the price of the internship, and I will be in the Philippines until the 23rd of May, roughly 3 months to complete the course. Any and all feedback/suggestions are welcome.  Thanks in advance!

1y2cgo,11,2014-02-16,"30 days, and it feels so good!",sergeant_awesome,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1y2cgo/30_days_and_it_feels_so_good/,"So I'm finally at the 30 day milestone, I guess I've earned myself some bragging rights now. This is the first time in a long time I've gone for 30 days without PMO, and given that I never really counted the days in my previous long streak it could very well be the longest streak I've ever had (I'll make it official at 60 days just to be safe).

A summary of the changes (positive or otherwise) I've noticed:

* I've been getting alot more sleep lately and my sleep schedule isn't out of wack anymore. Likely due to not staying up that extra hour or so to fap.

* I've been turning that pent up frustration into energy that makes me go harder at the gym (pun not intended). As a result I've for the first time in two years started regularly weighing in under 180lbs.

* I'm concentrating more on getting what's important. I'm able to focus a bit better on schoolwork now and I'm on top of the game when it comes to applying for internships.

* I didn't really have social problems before joining NoFap, nor did I feel inconfident around girls. Recently however I've been feeling *even more* confident around them. Now I'm seeming to get a bit more adventurous, and at a Valentine's Day party I danced with a random girl whose name I don't even know and got a kiss out of it (scratch that off the bucket list :P). In other words I was fine talking to women before, but only recently have I actually been able to act on making a move.

* Without watching porn I'm now able to see that there's much more to relationships than just having regular sex with women. I've recently been rejected by a girl but unlike previous instances I've been able to take the rejection positively. This time I'm actively choosing not to ""hate"" her to get over my feelings for her and she's still somewhat friendly towards me. I'm hopeful that at some point we'll be able to put it all behind us and resume a platonic relationship (which I really don't mind having).

* I'm feeling alot more in control of myself and my sexual urges.

Overall I don't think I've gained any ""superpowers"" from NoFap, but I attribute any positive changes to the fact that I'm now taking control over my sexual urges, and its this (so far) success with self control that's making me feel more confident. I've got some ways to go yet still but its been a hell of a ride just reaching this one milestone. Thanks guys and girls for all the support, I wouldn't have been able to get this far without this community!"

I am conflicted.  Those who know me in person know me as someone who is sociable, personable, humble, out going and a team-player, things that are entirely opposite to the unfortunate stereotype that gets attached to us MENSAns.

About halfway through Endless Love I made the unnerving revelation that this is, in fact, not a movie about young love, first love, or any kind of love. This is a vile and manipulative film about an abnormally malicious father and his unhealthy relationship with his daughter. That it is being sold as the next The Notebook is unsurprising, as director/co-writer Shana Feste’s trite and sappy sophomore effort contains the necessary components to dupe unassuming customers.

There’s a promising edge to the opening of “Endless Love,” which begins with a young man, David (Alex Pettyfer), speaking in voice-over about a young woman, Jade (Gabriella Wilde). It’s a high school graduation somewhere in Atlanta, and as the camera picks Jade out of the celebrating crowd, David reminisces about how he’s been watching her for years. From the way he talks, he seems to have been watching her closely. Closely enough to suggest that he’s been long nurturing a passion, perhaps an obsession — something deep, troubling and real.

The two attractive and compatible teenagers who fall for each other at first sight, Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer); the disapproving father (Bruce Greenwood) and the pragmatic mother (Joely Richardson); the rebellious brother (Rhys Wakefield) who constantly disappoints the patriarch of the family; and the limbo-like summer between high school graduation and college where one’s future appears to be infinite.

Shallow, timorous and unbelievable, alas, end up being more like it. Based on the 1979 Scott Spencer novel of the same tantalizing title (is “endless” a happy vow or a threat?), the movie relates what is meant to be the kind of feverish love that sends people into shudders of ecstasy. This is the love, or should be, of Antony and Cleopatra, Scarlett and Rhett and the couple in the 1950 film noir “Gun Crazy” who look at each other like “wild animals.” This is the love, or should be, that burns, consumes and spurs Friar Laurence to warn Romeo: “These violent delights have violent ends./And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,/Which as they kiss consume.”

All the necessary pieces for a predictable, but sweet love story are in place. Jade is an exquisite beauty – shy and ambitious – with plans to attend Brown and study pre-med (like her father) in the fall. Conversely David (although smart enough to receive a 2020 on his SAT) has no collegiate aspirations, instead deciding to work at his father’s car shop. The two young lovers soon begin a courtship of sorts. They run and scream and dance in the summer wind, laughing and making love as they please. Happiness and excitement is in air as the two embark on the type of whimsical summer most teenagers’ can only dreams of.

This story takes a sour turn after the sunny opening 25-minutes. One problem with this love is that it’s been difficult for filmmakers to translate it to the American screen, which has long been locked in the grip of a stultifying, Eros-killing Puritanism. In a superb film like “Gun Crazy,” which was made under strict industry self-cen6sorship, desire is expressed through innuendo, smoldering looks and the sublimating violence of erotically, ecstatically discharged guns. By contrast, American movies today often roil with orgiastic violence that’s a conspicuous substitute for sexual desire. That partly explains why this “Endless Love” falls so flat, registering as more neutered than even the kitschy 1981 version with Brooke Shields directed by Franco Zeffirelli, now best remembered for those newcomers Tom Cruise and James Spader.


Feste and co-writer Joshua Safran soon decide that Endless Love need not be a romantic film, but a conniving and contrived one. From the get go, Jade’s father Hugh — scarred by the death of his oldest son for years ago — has his qualms with her entangling herself in David. His complaints are reasonable: she’ll be leaving in two weeks for an internship, why bother investing herself in someone so soon before she has to pack up and leave? Moreover Jade has never been romantically involved with anyone prior to David – and so Hugh’s reservations about the whole relationship are natural. Plus, what good father is not at least a little concerned about the entrance of another man in his daughter’s life?

Directed by Shana Feste (“Country Strong”), this new “Endless Love” doesn’t have enough going on to make it memorably terrible: Banality is its gravest sin. Ms. Wilde and Mr. Pettyfer are very pretty (both have worked as models), and they’re certainly pleasant to look at, even if they’re also, often distractingly, too old for their roles. Jade is supposed to be 17 and sheltered, having spent most of her high school years giving comfort to her parents, Hugh and Anne (Bruce Greenwood and Joely Richardson), after the death of a son. Unlike Ms. Shields, whose status as a preternaturally sexualized child star imbued her with an otherworldly, almost celestial air (the celebrity who fell to Earth), the coltish Ms. Wilde mostly just suggests the supermodel next door. Ms. Feste responds accordingly and shoots Jade twirling and running as if she were in a commercial for an exciting new product.

But then the film decides to eschew naturalism and honesty, diluting the situation until it no longer bares any resemblance to reality. Hugh descends from a concerned parent to a nefarious one, hiring a private detective to look into David’s past while constantly being condescending for no legitimate reason. In an attempt to paint this character as some sort of villain, Hugh not only pathologically lies and yells at his family, but succumbs to infidelity. If Feste and Safran’s goal was to make Hugh a robotically diabolic husband and father with no signs of humanity, than they succeeded.

Also baffling is Jade’s turn from virginal high schooler to sexual hedonist. It’s natural for any teenager to be curious in something many of her fellow classmates have already dabbled in, but the malleability of this character lacks any sort of verisimilitude. One-minute an introverted, taciturn daddy’s daughter, the next a borderline nymphomaniac who disrespects her parents, investing her entire self into a boy she just met.

Of course the two run into some complications, as all relationships do. Their love, however, is not hindered by the standard problems of monogamy (geography, intimacy, compatibility, etc), but class. The Butterfields exist in the bourgeois, Elliot’s the proletariat. This non-issue is, like all elements of the film, manufactured to create tension where there is none. Think “Romeo &amp; Juliet” but written by someone who read Shakespeare’s opus briskly and carelessly.

Falling in and out of love is a cyclical cycle most of us continue (and will continue) to endure throughout our lifetime. I mention this because finding and maintaining a romance is an arduous undertaking — one that doesn’t need to be exacerbated by watching a shallow, regressive, and repulsive movie like Endless Love. This is not a film about love, and all the joy, pain and heartbreak that comes along with it; but it sure does feel endless."

I have an assignment in my professional writing class to find someone from my field of study and do a short interview via email. Here is a list of the questions I would love for anyone who works for a game studio, game programming field, or even computer programming; to answer for me:

Interview Questions:

1. What types or workplace communication do you typically use within your company? For example do you write a lot of memos, emails, or have oral presentations?

2. Within the company what tone, purpose, and/or audience do you target your communications to? For example is this company more laid back in their communications, talking to one another as friends. Or is the communication kept more professional?

3. How important are strong writing skills in this field or within this company in your opinion?

4. What types of articles, newspapers, and/or magazines do people within this company read on a regular basis? What types or readings do you recommend to stay up to date on the gaming industry or computer programming industry? I'm especially interested in knowing what professional articles or sites you look at to get an internal perspective on the industry.

5. What is the best way to get oneself into the gaming industry? I'm working on my BA of Computer Science, would this be enough to get entry level positions or would I need to do internships first? What level of experience are you looking for in your entry level positions?

These are all the questions I need to write my paper. I'm wanting to become a game programmer and it would be so helpful to get an internal perspective on the industry.

Thank you for your time.

* Recruiters typically look at the left side of your resume, more towards the top. There's actually studies showing this. This means that important buzzwords should be placed towards the beginning of each sentence. It also means that recruiters pay less attention the further down the resume and at the ends of your sentences.
* Flip side means less impressive points should be more towards the right and bottom. Bad GPA? Stick it on the same line as your degree, all the way to the right. It'll be less noticeable.
* List out all your languages and frameworks. If you know Rails, you know Ruby. List both.
* Somethings aren't quantifiable. There seems a huge emphasis on making sure each bullet point has something quantifiable in it. Do this only if it makes sense.
* If you have a bad GPA, see what you can ""replace"" it with. I'm not suggesting that you lie - just withhold information. Put your major GPA instead if its better. Maybe just put ""Dean's List"" if you are/have been on the Dean's List. Or maybe list that you're a member of an honor society as opposed to your GPA. 
* Something are more worth emphasizing. If your side projects are more applicable to the internships you want, put more emphasis on them. Even if this means putting less on past internships or your education.
* Objectives are useless. They just take up space.
* Don't have any side projects? Contribute to open source. Go on Github and sort projects in your favorite language by the number of forks or stars. Find one that looks beginner friendly. Tech companies love open source.
* If you have contributed to an open source project, list the project's name and ""(Open Source)"" where you would put a company name. Recruiters don't know that something is open source. They'll be impressed once they do.

***
## Getting Interviews
* Referrals are amazing. If you know somebody, or somebody who knows somebody, ask! There's absolutely no harm. Most jobs are gotten through networking, period.
* Contacting recruiters on LinkedIn can be great for less well known companies. Find a recruiter, connect with them, and then email them showing interest.
* Do not ask too many people! Once you get a single response, you're done. Regardless of whether it's what you want or not.
* Even intern referrals are good. If you know any friends who have interned at a company in the past, ask! 

***
## Career Fairs
* Take a couple practice companies. Figure out what you're going to say.
* The idea is to focus on one or two things and make them sound impressive.
* Waiting in line for a company? Do some research on your phone! Find out what technologies they use. Look into the culture. Being able to say ""I know you guys are a Python shop. Why?"" says a lot about your passion for the job.

***
## Phone Interviews
* Practice makes perfect.
* Cracking the Coding Interview. Don't just go through the answers. Work through the problems. It really does make a difference.
* Google each company before you interview. There is probably a sampling of past interview questions on Glassdoor.
* Make sure you have answers for behavioral questions ahead of time. These include ""Explain a time where you worked well on a team"" or similar questions. Have a sheet of paper alongside you with notes to help remind you.
* Don't lie. If you don't know something, say so. If you are unsure, say ""I don't really know, but I'd guess that..."". 
* Send a thank you email afterwards. Be sure to ask each interviewer for their email address. If you're not comfortable with that, send the thank yous to your recruiter and ask for them to be forwarded over.
* If you write code, comment it! It helps the interviewer work through your process. It also helps you break down the problem.

I'll try to post more as I can. Thanks for everything, guys and girls!

Don't get me wrong, all people suck, just some find excuses with their weight. Anyway this is a story that dates back to the summer of 2008. I was back home from my first year in college to start my first summer internship at a large tech company. I was always on the heavier side (5'6"" and 170ish) about mid summer I stepped on a scale and noticed 190lbs, so I went for a walk over one of the bridges. As I was getting back to my car a rather large man stopped me and wanted to chat. He said that it was good that I was starting an exercise routine then before my weight got too out of control like it did for him. He too worked at one of the rival tech firms for over 25 years. And in that time of having a static lifestyle he doubled his weight to over 300 and some sort of disease associated. 
6 years later and now full time writing software I use this encounter as motivation to never let my job get in the way of a healthy life. I wish him the best,whatever may have happened to him and a thankyou for showing me a possible outcome of my future.
For those curious, I'm at 145 and have never felt better."

The degree has been a little less technical than I would have hoped (lots of policy discussion) but I have managed to get my Sec+, Net+, CEH, CCNA, and learn a fair bit of Python. I have been teaching myself Linux through virtual machines and reading [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) book. 

I have been applying for some entry-level security positions as I have absolutely no experience in IT. Most of them are internships, but I have noticed some system administrator jobs that could perhaps be a foot in the door if I can't find a security internship/entry-level position. 

I know most experienced people in this subreddit and others tend to dislike certification exams, and for good reasons, but in my mind a certification exam offers a structured starting place to learn something new and show an employer objective proof that I do have knowledge of these concepts. 

I'm thinking about doing Linux+ since CompTIA exams are straightforward and my university has a discount on vouchers. How useful has the Linux+ exam been for anyone who here who has taken it? Would it be a waste of time? Am I better off putting my energy towards applying for jobs rather than taking more tests? Thanks in advance everyone.   "

1y3l24,4,2014-02-16,I lied about my college major and wasted a good portion of my life.,temp_account_confess,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1y3l24/i_lied_about_my_college_major_and_wasted_a_good/,"I graduated from college almost a decade ago and lied about what I majored in.  There was a major I had wanted to pursue for most of my life, but I did terrible in a required class for this major.  I even took the class three times and withdraw every single time.  I was doing better the final time, but I dropped it because I was already a senior and the other classes were taking too much of my time.  At this point in time, I could only hope for this to be a minor, instead of a major.

I decided to settle for a different major and two minors.  I was not thrilled about the major and really preferred the two minors.  I decided that after spending so much time in  a somewhat prestigious college, that I might as well get a degree in something.  I told my parents, and others, that I was double majoring, instead of telling them that I had changed my major.

I got very depressed in college and after graduating I went to work for my father.  I have always hated working there, but I basically had no other choice.  I have always kept to myself and I have never been much of a people person.  I never got an internship in college.  I always spent the summers working for my father.  I have only had two short four day breaks since the last major one almost twenty years ago.  I had these because I was physically ill and could not work.

I have been so depressed after college that I would spend a lot of my free time just buying things and not saving a dime.  I ended up spending more than I had, so I racked up massive credit card debt.

So now I was a freaking liar, broke, and an all-around loser.

In the past couple of years, I guess I kind of woke up a little, and started to pay down my credit card debt.  Right now my debt is the lowest it has been in years and I just transferred the highest interest debt into lower interest credit cards.  I also started to take my student loans more seriously and finished paying two of them last month.

I have also decided to try and learn what I really wanted to in college, but on my own.  I want to do this through online readings and exercises, and by reading books.

I have been cutting down on my TV watching to around three hours per week and only on the weekends.  I have also been spending time in /r/GetMotivated/, /r/GetDisciplined/, /r/NoFap/, and other subreddits, but the first three are my favorite.  I have also been reading and watching Jim Rohn, James Altucher, Tony Robbins, and others.

I am not being very detailed and created this account just for this confession.  I am very grateful for anyone that read this and wish you well."

THIS BILL NEEDS OUR HELP!!)",btq,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1y3pt0/update_on_tennessee_bill_to_protect_ecigs_vapor/,"###HISTORY &amp; GENERAL INFORMATION

Here's my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1winbf/any_tennesseans_here_theres_a_bill_going_through/) on the bill.

Here's a [summary of HB 1461](http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/billinfo/BillSummaryArchive.aspx?BillNumber=HB1461&amp;ga=108).

The bill's [main page](http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB1461&amp;ga=108) with more information, such as where it is in the TN General Assembly and a link to the bill's full text.

[CASAA's ""Call to Action"" page](http://blog.casaa.org/2014/02/call-to-action-support-tennessee-bill.html) to SUPPORT this legislation.

###WHAT'S NEW

The TN Department of Health (Read: Governor's Office) apparently [has some concerns](http://knoxblogs.com/humphreyhill/2014/02/13/state-department-health-frets-electronic-cigarettes/) about ecigs and, more importantly, HB 1461 to PROTECT and define ""vapor products"" so they can NOT be regulated and taxed like tobacco products.

 - [TN DOH's Official ""Health Advisory""](http://health.state.tn.us/downloads/PHA_ElectronicTobacco.pdf) - *A bunch of hyperbolic, ""slipper slope"" fear mongering; Citing outdated, inconclusive studies.* 

Earlier this month, the sponsor of the bill rescheduled it to be heard next week, in order to hopefully ""work out the kinks"", if you will, with the TN DOH et al in the meantime. HB 1461 is back on the schedule for the House Finance, Ways and Means Subcommittee next Wednesday (12/19/2014) at 10:30am.

The TN DOH (Governor) coming out ""against"" this bill is certainly another, fairly large, hurdle for it becoming law. But it does **NOT** make it impossible for this bill to pass. Do not give up! He hasn't said it's something he would consider a veto for, so there's no reason to think he wouldn't sign it, if indeed the General Assembly did pass it. 

**This can *absolutely* still pass.** But it has a long way to go, and the more we  do to show our support, the better the chances.

###HOW YOU CAN HELP

*(I'd love support from anyone and everyone on this. But* ***I am only encouraging those living in TN to make contact.*** *These are State Legislators we're dealing with, &amp; they only care about the interests of their constituents. It may frustrate them to receive a bunch of out-of-state calls &amp; emails.)*
-

1. **Contact members of the Subcommittee and voice your support!!**

    **First thing's first** - These members, listed below, will be the first in the General Assembly to vote on HB 1461. If it doesn't make it out of this meeting, it dies. This is where the battle begins.

    Representative's Name | Phone Number | Email Address
:---- | :---- | :-----:
Mike Harrison - Chairman | (615) 741-7480 | rep.mike.harrison@capitol.tn.gov
David Alexander | (615) 741-8695 | rep.david.alexander@capitol.tn.gov
Joe Armstrong | (615) 741-0768 | rep.joe.armstrong@capitol.tn.gov
Kevin Brooks | (615) 741-1350 | rep.kevin.brooks@capitol.tn.gov
Karen Camper | (615) 741-1898 | rep.karen.camper@capitol.tn.gov
Craig Fitzhugh | (615) 741-2134 | rep.craig.fitzhugh@capitol.tn.gov
David Hawk | (615) 741-7482 | rep.david.hawk@capitol.tn.gov
Gerald McCormick | (615) 741-2548 | rep.gerald.mccormick@capitol.tn.gov
Steve McDaniel (Bill's Sponsor) | (615) 741-0750 | rep.steve.mcdaniel@capitol.tn.gov
Gary Odom | (615) 741-4410 | rep.gary.odom@capitol.tn.gov
Dennis Roach | (615) 741-2534 | rep.dennis.roach@capitol.tn.gov
Charles Sargent | (615) 741-6808 | rep.charles.sargent@capitol.tn.gov

    (NOTE: The General Assembly is CLOSED on Monday, 12/17/2014, for President's Day. So don't expect an answer that day, but you can always leave a message. If you want to talk to someone, call Tuesday at the earliest.)
-

2. **Contact YOUR representative!**
 - Find your legislator [here](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/legislators/).
 - Right now, the most important members to contact are the committee members listed above, and you do NOT need to be their constituent to voice your support and help this bill pass. (Though it would help if you were) But it ***NEVER*** hurts to be in touch with your representatives and voice your opinion on legislation moving through the General Assembly.

3. **Come to the meeting in person!!**
 - With this being such short notice, it being so early in the fight for this bill, and understanding that people have a lot going on and can't drop everything to come to Nashville, I'm not pushing this. Not for this first meeting at least. 
 - If you can make it happen, awesome! It's certainly encouraged. If not, please show your support by the other methods listed. 
 - However, **please consider coming to Nashville in the future** if you can make it. This bill will have many more appearances in committee meetings if it passes on Wednesday. It will give you a chance to talk to members of each committee it has to go through, as well as YOUR representative. Plus, Nashville is an ***AWESOME*** city anyway! 

##Pointers for Phone Calls and Emails:

- **BE POLITE** - *If calling, you'll probably be talking to an assistant or intern. They aren't elected &amp; don't have a vote on the bill. Being an asshole only ensures your message isn't delivered &amp; makes them bitter toward other calls on the subject. So be kind.*

-  **BE CONCISE** - *These guys have a lot to do in a single day. Don't ramble. Nothing annoys them more than people who call or email &amp; blabber on incoherently with no end in sight.*

- **TELL YOUR STORY** ***(The 2 previous points still apply. Keep them in mind.)*** - *This is more for emails* ***OR*** *if you actually get a Rep on the phone, which isn't likely, but possible. (Doesn't hurt to ask if they're available to talk.) If E-Cigs have positively affected your life, tell them how. If you're knowledgable on the subject, answer any questions they may have. If they engage you, try to politely educate them about the positive benefits, and about the misinformation they may have been subjected to.*

- **LEAVE CONTACT INFO** - *Whether calling or emailing, leave your name, home address, phone number, email address, etc. This lets them know you're a constituent of their state, gives them a way to contact you if they have questions, and makes you seem more trustworthy; which is what we need: their trust.*

- **SUPPORT HB1461 By McDaniel** - *Most importantly, tell them to vote* **YES** *on HB 1461.*

##Pointers for coming in person:

 - **ALL ABOVE POINTERS APPLY** - *Be polite. Don't act crazy, rude, etc. Make a good impression and be a model citizen. We want these people to like us.*

 - **DRESS NICELY** - *This isn't a requirement, of course. If you don't own a suit, coat &amp; tie, or nice dress or something, don't let that stop you from coming. But if you* ***do*** *own something of the sort, I would highly recommend it. The Representatives, Senators, and employees have to dress nicely while there, and it makes a good impression on all of them if you are respecting the Capitol and don't look like a slob.* 

 - **DO NOT VAPE INDOORS OR IN THE COMMITTEE ROOMS** - *So help me god, I will slap someone if I see this. Many, if not most, of these members know absolutely nothing about ecigs or vapor. If they see a bunch of people vaping in the halls or committee rooms they will probably think you're smoking, find you disrespectful, and loath all of us as a result. This is a bad thing. Don't be that guy. Take it outside.*

###CLOSING

We, as a state, have a unique opportunity here, to create precedent for other states for the protection of the vaping community and industry. This bill is truly exciting and makes me extremely proud of Tennessee and of our Representatives.

**BUT IT NEEDS OUR HELP!!** I talked to some members of the committee after I made my last post, and asked if they'd gotten any phone calls or emails in support of HB 1461. They all said they hadn't. I know some of you said you intended to reach out, and I'm sure many of you did, but we **MUST REMAIN ACTIVE** to help this bill get momentum. Let your voices be heard. Make phone calls, write emails, and if you can, arrange meetings!! And do it all more than once! The more calls we make, the more emails we write, the more meetings we attend, the more they pay attention to our cause and learn about this wonderful product that has kept me off cigarettes for nearly a year. 

As I've said many times, this bill has a long way to go. But if we blow it off now, saying to ourselves ""I'll wait and see if it gets through this first hurdle, then I'll get active"" or if we make the effort now, then think ""Well I've done my part, it's up to someone else to make calls as the bill moves forward"" we'll be taking the wrong approach and using a losing strategy and thought process. 

**We have to get active now, and stay active!**

###P.S. - Just a few more things:

 - If you missed the link above, check out [CASAA](http://blog.casaa.org/2014/02/call-to-action-support-tennessee-bill.html)'s Call to Action for more info and pointers on how to show support! 

 - If you want to thank the members who are sponsoring HB 1461, and ask them to make it a priority:
    - [Steve McDaniel](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/members/h72.html) is the prime sponsor, 
    - [Charles Sargent](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/members/h61.html) and 
    - [Judd Matheny](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/members/h47.html) are cosponsors.

 - Oh, and don't mention reddit, or this post, if you do call or email. Just be an informed citizen participating in their democracy.

1y3rd5,13,2014-02-16,Feeling lonely in the city.,TokyoUD,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1y3rd5/feeling_lonely_in_the_city/,"Posted here a few months back to vent out some of my frustrations. Surprise! I'm back again.

Where do I begin? Well after the frustrating time that was last semester, I found some happiness for a bit. I went back home and spent the entirety winter break catching up with close friends. I was even in a relationship for a little while. Everything seemed right for those three weeks. It kind of nice actually. Nice enough that when January rolled around, I was prepared to start the year off on the right foot.

Shame that these sort of things don't usually work out the way you intend them to. 

The first week of January, I broke up with my girlfriend realizing that it just wasn't going to work. I know it was the ""right"" thing to do, but it still hurt like hell. I started my COOP (Essentially a paid internship), with the city and realized that it wasn't everything I'd hoped it would be. I'm grateful for the work experience, but that doesn't make slogging through spreadsheets and making basic maps all day any more exciting. But at least I'm working with a good friend throughout the entire COOP, so I'm sharing some laughs throughout the week. The real problem isn't with what I'm doing during the work week, but rather in those periods in the evening and weekends that I have to myself.

For all intents and purposes, I'm a nerd. I play way too many video games for my own good. I read a lot. Blah, blah, blah. Long story short, I've got plenty of hobbies and interests that I'm involved in. Recently I've started exploring Cincinnati and learning more about the city I'm going to be spending the next 3-4 years in. My afternoons have been full of trips to museums and local attractions. Between those trips and running when the weather permits, it's been doing me a lot of good. But beneath the immediate pleasure that getting out gives me is something gnawing at me incessantly; this acute sense of loneliness. 

A few weeks ago, I went to see the movie ""Her"". Despite the teasing of some of my guy friends, I was really intrigued by the premise of the movie. Long story short, that was the first movie in a long time that made me bawl like a baby. I got dropped off after the movie at my dorm, went into my room, and started sobbing. Asides from the fact that it was a wonderful movie (Dat soundtrack), it made me realize just how alone I've been feeling nowadays.

Being an out of state college student isn't always fun. I never really understood homesickness until my freshman year here at UC. But with classes and friends to hang out with, it was okay because I was learning to be semi-independent. But this semester I have no classes. Most of the friends I made here are away in others places for their COOPs. While there are a few still in Cincy, they're not really the people I hang out with. In fact, most of my close friends are still back home in Virginia. At the end of the day, this loneliness is really breaking me down.

What makes it even more frustrating is that asides from that, everything else is great for me. I live comfortably. My physical needs are satisfied. But I can't get past *how fucking lonely I feel*. No matter how many museums, parks, and concerts I go to, I am still sitting there on my own. Any amusing or insightful comment just sits there in my head. At the end of the day, I will still go home to my room and reflect on the day alone. It makes me wonder if I should have even bothered going in the first place. It's hard to explain really. 

I'm not a stranger to being alone by any means. I grew up a single child in a neighborhood full of older people. Most of my friends were an hour or so drive away. I learned to make my own games and entertain myself. But this feels different. I catch myself thinking about what would happen to me if I got seriously injured. Nobody to visit me or help me out. Just me pulling myself up with my own bootstraps. That's a scary thing to think about, it really is. 

My point is that I feel incredibly lonely and I have been contemplating just ending it all.

I have goals and dreams. I know what I would like to do professionally and I have plenty of ideas of places/things I'd like to do. But the idea of having to go through the rest of my life essentially alone terrifies me. 

I know it sounds stupid to contemplate suicide because of something like being afraid of being alone. I used to be fine with doing things on my own. But now I'm finding that I need people in my life. It's just so nice sharing moments with others.

I have tried loving myself. I have tried doing my own thing. I have been eating healthier and exercising. But it's not enough.

I feel alone, truly alone. And you know what? I need help.

I need help meeting people. I need help feeling like I'm not all alone in this ice covered city. I need someone to tell me it's going to work out in the end.

Thanks for reading/listening.

My GPA was awesome and I had made Dean's List a few times, but before my final year started I received an awesome internship which turned into a job almost 1,000 miles away. I was making above market value for my job and have since transitioned closer to home at a better position, still living the dream.

If someone asks me about it in person (ie. ""What college did you go to?""), I tell them the truth and they are usually more impressed than bothered by it. However, I don't know how to convey this sort of thing in an online dating profile. I usually leave education and income blank, but I can see this might turn some people off. I also don't want to outright list the story in my profile because I don't want it to come off as insecurity or bragging, because I really don't feel that way. Also, some dating profiles require you to list an education--if I choose ""some college"" or something along those lines, it looks really bad, doesn't it?

I was a physics major and have found out that there is some demand for science majors going into software, and I'm really hoping to do this (though I am finding it hard to break in).  I have been going back and really trying to learn the fundamentals of software development.  I have found some great books and have been using several of the online resources recommended here.  One of my books has begun introducing some best practices.  It suggested using top-down, while I believe I had been using bottom-up.  The book also has hinted at agile development coming up in a later chapter.  I have also seen a lot of job postings that want programmers with agile knowledge.  
  
This bring me to the questions.  What is your preferred development process?  Why do you like it over other methods?  And where can I learn more about it?"

I've heard mixed opinions about the necessity of getting an internship the summer after freshman year. 

One of my friends, a sophomore, said not having one or other relevant experience is really screwing him over for finding an internship next summer. Another friend however said not to worry about it and that it'd be my last summer to have fun and time to myself. 

I never coded before college, and now only know matlab and am currently learning java. I don't know if I'd even be able to perform at a level expected by an internship, but I don't want to regret not trying for one next year.

What does everyone suggest doing? If I don't get an internship I certainly intend to try to work on some independent projects over the summer, but I don't know if I'd really be able to do anything meaningful enough on my own."
1y4d3q,1,2014-02-16,Any advice for and Enviro Engineer graduating in May? Good areas to work? Types of jobs? Share any thoughts!,coolasliquidnitrogen,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1y4d3q/any_advice_for_and_enviro_engineer_graduating_in/,So I am about to graduate with an environmental engineering degree and really am feeling pretty lost. Most of my family farms (we're Mennonite actually haha) and no one has ever gone to college so they can't help me out . I have had internships (an EE/computer programming one and another with a local watershed) but they don't have full time work. I am willing to move anywhere. Any tips are greatly appreciated!  
1y4dx9,1,2014-02-17,I have an interview coming up with my previous employer. What questions should I ask?,Browngrocerybag,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1y4dx9/i_have_an_interview_coming_up_with_my_previous/,"Background:

Two years ago I was a part of a massive layoff in a start up company where 50% of the employees were let go. I was one, if not the top performer in my group, but was the only one let go because I had the least amount of work experience. I was just out of school with only an internship for job experience, while all the others had at least 2 years of work experience plus a bachelors or a masters.

I was employed by a much  bigger company two months later. Now, my old team members would like me back and we have a long phone interview coming up. I am considering it because I really enjoyed working with nearly all of my coworkers there and had many friends at work. My old team members are very good friends of mine and I would not mind working with them again.

What important questions should I ask? 

Thanks.

1y4jts,2,2014-02-17,Applying for a job at Amazon through their Careers website,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1y4jts/applying_for_a_job_at_amazon_through_their/,"For a software engineering internship, I interviewed with Amazon in January 2013 and failed their phone screen. Since it's been well over a year, I figure I could at least try applying again.

However, from my Careers profile, it seems like I must have spammed out 5 applications to various *Software Development Engineer ** roles last semester, all of which list *Reviewed, Not Selected* under Application Status. I'm not sure if a *Reviewed, Not Selected* message applies to a particular position, or to Amazon as a whole.

Should I apply for more Amazon job openings? Perhaps bug the recruiter I talked to a year ago? Or do those not-selected messages indicate that I should stop applying to *any* Amazon jobs?"
1y4kps,3,2014-02-17,Seeking career path and resume building advice,Sasfer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1y4kps/seeking_career_path_and_resume_building_advice/,"I was one of those kids/young University Students wanting to get into game design/ game development. Of course I've long since been dissuaded however it has thrown a wrench in what I thought I would be doing for a career. I do truly enjoy coming up with solutions to problems. Designing the solution and creating the related system and then seeing and fixing the errors in your design until finally you hit a working implementation. That moment excites me.

So I'm basically looking for career advice and what I should be doing to end up on a good career path.

**Information about myself, I realize I'm on the low end of hireability right now:**

* Canadian University BS in Computer Science. 1 year from graduation with a 66-70 average on graduation.
* No related job experience. Trying to get an internship through my University however I've been told I have 1/10 odds based on previous years. I will also try to find a way to get a summer internship on my own and my friends have pointed me in a few directions, including applying for positions in the USA although I'm lacking knowledge in that area.
* I have 1 small solo project ongoing, a game made with Unity3D (Filtered down from my career goal to my hobby).
* Going to create a small web scraper to pull updates from websites similar to RSS to add to my resume's projects section.
* I know the most about and enjoy programming with C# (Unity3D) closely followed by Java (Almost every course at university uses it). C++ and Python are also interesting but not my first choices.

So I suppose a few of the major questions are:

* What are some careers that use C# and/or Java?
* What language do I program my second project in? I've read in the FAQ that I should make my projects diverse so should I avoid C# which I'm using in my other project?
* Should I upload a few of my complete and clean project scripts for my applications? Where to upload? How to format it? Should I put it on my resume or my cover letter or both?
* What else should I be doing to beef up my puny resume?
* Apply to summer internships outside my University's program?
* Apply to summer internships internationally?
* What internships to focus on to lead me down a better career path? Suggestions for companies to apply for?

I'm 21, based out of Ohio, and I'm looking to pack up my things and join your company!

I will be graduating in May with a B.A. in Computer Science from Denison University, a small, private Liberal Arts college. I am completely open to working / training for you before that happens.  

*I am passionate about technology*, and I would love to join a company who shares this passion. Another passion of mine is being able to take really complex things, and explain them in layman's terms. This is why I'm primarily looking at Sales Engineering, as I would love to be able to travel with a sales team and be able to talk in depth about the technical aspects of a product. I feel that I could also do very well in sales, but I understand that my lack of any formal experience in sales doesn't help that claim. While I am a CS major, I don't feel that my calling is in development. While the mental puzzles offered by coding do intellectually stimulate me, I don't feel that I could be serve your company by sitting at a terminal all day crunching code. 

**About me:**  

I have technical experience. I spent last summer in San Diego working as a backend server intern for a travel agency data consolidation company. I mostly worked with SQL, and the data analysis was done with Crystal Reporting. In my computer science courses, I have learned C++ and Python, with some minor experience in C, Java, and Ruby. I have set up a few websites, and I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails. 

I have extensive leadership experience. For example, I was the Vice President of the student body, and have served on the student government for all 4 years. I served on the Presidential Selection Committee, which has the honor of screening possible presidential candidates. I am an Eagle Scout. I will walk first at graduation because I am the Senior Co-Governor, and announce the class gift, which I have been working all year to fundraise for. I started my own organization on campus, whose mission it was to foster interpersonal relationships between students, and create a campus culture of respect and appreciation. I am a proud member of Beta Theta Pi, of which I served as the secretary. I was just nominated for the Distinguished Leadership Award, which is given to less than 30 graduating seniors for their accomplishments on campus. 

I am a very creative person. I work on campus in the media lab, where I tutor students on creative applications such as Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Logic. I actively read and write. I am very involved in my community. The summer after my sophomore year I spent in service, counseling juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program centered around a community garden. 

I am ready and excited to work for you. I value work ethic and I value the relationships I form. I can relocate to anywhere you are based. I value professional mannerism, but I feel that I can liven up any office. 

Thank you so very much for looking at my posting. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me via pm and I can send you my resume.

1y4pr5,2,2014-02-17,What can I do at a job fair to stand out?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1y4pr5/what_can_i_do_at_a_job_fair_to_stand_out/,"My GPA is going to be a tough one for me (well below a 3.0...). I plan to say something along the lines of, ""I know that my GPA isn't the best, but it was a tough program alongside personal struggles. I have two friends who didn't make the cut in the program."" I suffered from depression/anxiety, and while I'm okay with posting about it on reddit, I am not comfortable discussing it in person with someone I don't know (nor do I think it's appropriate to go into details about personal struggles... can be off-putting to some). How do I tell them that this had a role in my poor GPA? Can I chalk this up to personal issues? For what it's worth, this semester I am busting my ass with 3 senior level classes, and doing my best to get A's in all of them. Can this ""turnaround"" be worth anything? 

The two employers worth mentioning -- IT intern at the university &amp; intern at a large-ish tech company -- have invited me back due to performance (well... one invite, one extension request). The IT department sought me out to ask me to come back, and my summer internship with the tech company was extended through the year at my request (they approved without hesitation).

My technical skills are top-notch, and my professionalism &amp; people skills are usually noticed the moment I start talking. I can handle myself well in interviews, I believe. I have a few companies doing the recruitment dance with me, one so far even asked if I would like to fly out and stay in a hotel on their dollar so they could interview me on site. 

So getting back on track... with my ""decent"" interview/people skills, technical prowess (for a soon-to-be college grad, anyway), and professionalism, how can I stand out? And what can I do to lessen the impact of my poor GPA? "
1y4r7r,1,2014-02-17,Young adult in need of life advice. Long read.,HighJarlSoulblighter,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1y4r7r/young_adult_in_need_of_life_advice_long_read/,"So, I've got problems and I'm pretty sure we all do. Anyways, I'll try not to sound like a whiny bitch. 

I never enjoyed learning. I don't know how it initially started, but the school environment and the process of learning is a real drag for me. Is this a common thing? I'm in college and I don't even like what I'm learning. I haven't gotten into the higher level classes specifically for my major yet since I'm still taking care of some requirements.

 I originally wanted to a science/engineering major, but I don't have the problem solving intelligence and motivation to get through the science and math classes. Also, there is a severe lack of interest in these gen ed courses. I enjoy solving puzzles and eventually solving math problems once I get the hang of it, but the problem is getTING the hang of it. I hate sitting down and nailing down these processes into my head. It's not just the STEM courses, it's literally every class.  The act of doing it just takes so much out of me. I try to understand these concepts, but I just don't get it and I end up wasting my time. 

I'm wasting my college experience and I just don't know what I want to do. I never wanted to come to college in the first place. I used to be a good student in grade school, but depression put quite a dent into my life. It's probably the main reason why I have an aversion to math and science courses now. My depression made it difficult for me to put the time and effort required to succeed in these classes in middle and high school; now I can never enjoy them like I used to. I'm still feeling the after effects but it's much better than before.

I feel outclassed by the people around me even though I know that I'm smart and can compete with them, but I'm not putting in the effort. I'm not absorbing all of the information so I end up playing on game day with half the equipment I need. I don't enjoy the challenge of these difficult courses since they require so much work to stay afloat.

 I don't enjoy playing video games anymore; I haven't for years now yet I still do. That's what it feels like a lot these days. I don't enjoy doing it, but I do it anyways. Is this how life is? That's what it seems like when I observe my parents. 

I don't like my family. There were a lot of arguments that I overheard while growing up. There would be multiple ones a day when I was young and continue on until I began high school. Then, they started to die down in frequency. Also the same time when the arguments began focusing on me. The first year of high school wasn't so bad compared to all the other years of my life. The previous years of my life sucked. The gist of it is that I was picked on a lot (kids are dicks, I'm pretty sure everyone experienced this) and school basically sucked. Especially middle school. I would say that my depression began around the middle of 6th grade due to a lot of reasons. Mainly because school sucked and family life at home wasn't so hot either. I was basically stuck in a rock and a hard place, feeling like I had no where to hide. 

The basic gist of my schooling experience is that I felt forced into many things by peer pressure such as sports teams. There was a colossal fuck up in sophomore year that would screw me over to this day. I had chem after lunch and half the week it would be a double period for double the fun, especially since I could barely stay awake on a full stomach. I joined the swimming team, sucked at it (literally worst ""swimmer"" on the team"" and continued to lift weights. Went to China over winter break (for the first time in my life, to my grandmother's funeral, who I barely knew) and had bad jetlag that wouldn't be fixed until I started college. So I ended up over-trained, sleep deprived, and full of suicidal thoughts. Junior was worse than that. Senior year was better, but still bad.


I would begin to argue back at my parents in high school. Since I didn't tell my parents any of my problems, there was a huge gap in understanding and treatment (there was none). I felt that I couldn't tell my parents anything since I was ashamed of my problems and they weren't people you would open up to. I felt alienated. I always had social anxiety and was shy. It was difficult for me to make friends , especially after moving a couple times. All I felt that I could do was endure. I made empty promises that I would try harder and everything would be okay. That's all I could hope for. I would learn to hate hope since it prolonged my existence in this hell. I'm not saying that I lived in North Korean-esque conditions, but it felt pretty bad to me.

My parents would call me worthless and lazy when I didn't study. I played video games to help me get away from the problems at school and home, but my parents made that nearly impossible. I felt like the Gestapo were after me so I cold never enjoy video games. They still do this to me today, but are much more lenient. If they ever caught a glimpse of me playing, they would go into a raging fit. All I wanted to do was escape from my reality.

My mom would always act like she wasn't the problem. Everyone in my family has a problem with her. I feel sorry that she had to go through some difficult times with my dad in their early years, but she keeps bringing them up. She would always talk about how bad my dad is, how much of a piece of shit he is. Ever since I could hear, she began talking about him in that manner. She still does to this day. Maybe she's a narcissist. She always believes that she could do no wrong. 

My dad is very well educated and hard working. Both my parents are. My dad should never have been a father, my mother either. My dad isn't close to my sister and I, he has always been that person who went to work early and came back late. He has always been that person who spanked me and I feared him because of it. I feared him for all my life until high school. I wished my parents never had me or at least they should have been divorced a long time ago. It's funny how I feel like my problems in high school have brought them closer together. I don't know if there are other problems between them that they aren't sharing, but I guess that isn't my business. 

After high school, I didn't want to go to college. In fact, I don't even have my driving license. Mostly because, what's the point of learning if I'm going to die soon anyways? That was my mentality for a long time and I've paid for it. Anyways, I still feel like going to college was a wrong move for me. The only reason I'm still in is because I don't know what else to do. I tried convincing my parents to let me join the military but they think that I'm not mentally equipped to do it. That reason pissed me off since most of my anger and tantrums were focused on them. It nearly drove me insane as to how skewed their perspective of me was. Well, I didn't join the military and I hoped that college would be better. I would later find out that my dad's job pays for all of my tuition if I stay in for four continuous years and higher degrees, up to a point.

College is okay. It's better than the rest of my life, but still feels wrong. I don't like what I'm learning, I don't like the process of learning. I tried for so long to want to learn, but there is a mental block. I failed Calc I twice in college. I took calc in high school and did very well. I've got the intelligence to succeed, just not the heart.

 I would quickly develop a crush for this cute brunette in college, mainly because she was the one who started getting interested in me first. We would look at each other across the room, but I would never do anything. We don't know each other. It's been over a year now. I feel like shit since I didn't do anything about it. I think she gave up on me last semester. I didn't make a move because I was afraid that my mental problems would hurt her. I knew that I hated myself and I tried fixing it. I hate myself even more now, but at this point I just don't know anymore. My life is a mess. I don't even go after what I want most. 

Should I just suck it up and get through college? I really want to take a break and I know that it's hard to come back. I've always hated school and I need a disconnect with all the negativity of school that I have. I don't even have any valuable life experience. I never had a job, never really traveled anywhere. I want to get away from all of this. I feel trapped in my situation. I would be throwing away a paid education, but what's the point if I don't even pass? 

I want to get away from my family forever. I'm not close to them at all. My parents have tried to reconnect with me ever since I began college. In fact, they started talking to me more when I began college than when I lived at home with them. My dad hugged me for the first time ever at the end of freshman year last year. I remember when I was around five and he didn't let me get hugged anymore since it was time to become a man. My mom is still crazy-ish, but trying to reconnect. She hasn't changed though. She's just delusioned enough to think that I have ""improved"". I barely talk to my sister. In fact, she texted me last night telling me that I should start looking for internships. Her birthday was over a week ago and my family celebrated it at home this past weekend. I didn't go due to a weather. My parents think that my life is turning around and seem proud. It makes me sad that they are actually proud of me for the first time in my life. I'm not talking about proud as in getting an A on a test in grade school. I'm talking about actual pride in them seeing me becoming a man. 

I don't see myself staying connected with my family. I barely stay connected with my close friends. The only reason we're friends is because we do a lot of gaming together. That has been barely enjoyable for years now. They are close friends, but I don't feel like I could open up to them. I'm someone different to them than who I feel like I really am. I want a restart."

Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption”

Episode Synopsis: Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption” – When some of Gabe’s (Sendhil Ramamurthy) acquaintances go missing, Cat (Kristin Kreuk) and Vincent (Jay Ryan) must come together to save them. Vincent ends up returning to the hospital where he was an intern, allowing him to see what his life could have been.

Detective Catherine Chandler is a smart, no-nonsense homicide detective. Several years earlier, Catherine witnessed the murder of her mother at the hands of two gunmen. Catherine would have been killed too, but someone – or something – saved her. No one has ever believed her, but she knows it wasn’t an animal that attacked the assassins…it was human. Years have passed, and Catherine is a strong, confident, capable police officer, working alongside her equally talented partner, Tess. While investigating a murder, Catherine discovers a clue that leads her to a handsome doctor named Vincent Keller, who was reportedly killed by enemy fire while serving in Afghanistan in 2002. 

Catherine learns that Vincent is actually still alive and that it was he who saved her many years before. For mysterious reasons that have forced him to live outside of traditional society, Vincent has been in hiding for the past 10 years to guard his secret – when he is enraged, he becomes a terrifying beast, unable to control his super-strength and heightened senses. Catherine agrees to protect his identity in return for any insight he may have into her mother’s murder. Thus begins a complex relationship between Catherine and Vincent, who are powerfully drawn to each other yet understand that their connection is extremely dangerous for both of them.

The series stars Kristin Kreuk (“Smallville,” “Chuck”) as Catherine, Jay Ryan (“Terra Nova”) as Vincent, Max Brown (“The Tudors,” “MI-5″) as Evan, Nina Lisandrello (“Nurse Jackie”) as Tess, Nicole Gale Anderson (“Make It or Break It”) as Heather, Austin Basis (“Life Unexpected”) as J.T., and Brian White (“The Shield,” “The Cabin in the Woods”) as Joe. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is from CBS Television Studios with executive producers Jennifer Levin (“Without A Trace,” “Felicity”), Sherri Cooper (“Brothers and Sisters”), Bill Haber (“Rizzoli &amp; Isles,” “Thurgood”), Paul J. Witt (“A Better Life”) &amp; Tony Thomas (“A Better Life”), Ron Koslow (“Moonlight”) and Gary Fleder (“Life Unexpected”).

1y4t3i,1,2014-02-17,Young Adult. Need advice. Reposting from /r/Advice.,HighJarlSoulblighter,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y4t3i/young_adult_need_advice_reposting_from_radvice/,"So, I've got problems and I'm pretty sure we all do. Anyways, I'll try not to sound like a whiny bitch.


I never enjoyed learning. I don't know how it initially started, but the school environment and the process of learning is a real drag for me. Is this a common thing? I'm in college and I don't even like what I'm learning. I haven't gotten into the higher level classes specifically for my major yet since I'm still taking care of some requirements.


I originally wanted to a science/engineering major, but I don't have the problem solving intelligence and motivation to get through the science and math classes. Also, there is a severe lack of interest in these gen ed courses. I enjoy solving puzzles and eventually solving math problems once I get the hang of it, but the problem is getTING the hang of it. I hate sitting down and nailing down these processes into my head. It's not just the STEM courses, it's literally every class. The act of doing it just takes so much out of me. I try to understand these concepts, but I just don't get it and I end up wasting my time.


I'm wasting my college experience and I just don't know what I want to do. I never wanted to come to college in the first place. I used to be a good student in grade school, but depression put quite a dent into my life. It's probably the main reason why I have an aversion to math and science courses now. My depression made it difficult for me to put the time and effort required to succeed in these classes in middle and high school; now I can never enjoy them like I used to. I'm still feeling the after effects but it's much better than before.


I feel outclassed by the people around me even though I know that I'm smart and can compete with them, but I'm not putting in the effort. I'm not absorbing all of the information so I end up playing on game day with half the equipment I need. I don't enjoy the challenge of these difficult courses since they require so much work to stay afloat.


I don't enjoy playing video games anymore; I haven't for years now yet I still do. That's what it feels like a lot these days. I don't enjoy doing it, but I do it anyways. Is this how life is? That's what it seems like when I observe my parents.


I don't like my family. There were a lot of arguments that I overheard while growing up. There would be multiple ones a day when I was young and continue on until I began high school. Then, they started to die down in frequency. Also the same time when the arguments began focusing on me. The first year of high school wasn't so bad compared to all the other years of my life. The previous years of my life sucked. The gist of it is that I was picked on a lot (kids are dicks, I'm pretty sure everyone experienced this) and school basically sucked. Especially middle school. I would say that my depression began around the middle of 6th grade due to a lot of reasons. Mainly because school sucked and family life at home wasn't so hot either. I was basically stuck in a rock and a hard place, feeling like I had no where to hide.


The basic gist of my schooling experience is that I felt forced into many things by peer pressure such as sports teams. There was a colossal fuck up in sophomore year that would screw me over to this day. I had chem after lunch and half the week it would be a double period for double the fun, especially since I could barely stay awake on a full stomach. I joined the swimming team, sucked at it (literally worst ""swimmer"" on the team"" and continued to lift weights. Went to China over winter break (for the first time in my life, to my grandmother's funeral, who I barely knew) and had bad jetlag that wouldn't be fixed until I started college. So I ended up over-trained, sleep deprived, and full of suicidal thoughts. Junior was worse than that. Senior year was better, but still bad.


I would begin to argue back at my parents in high school. Since I didn't tell my parents any of my problems, there was a huge gap in understanding and treatment (there was none). I felt that I couldn't tell my parents anything since I was ashamed of my problems and they weren't people you would open up to. I felt alienated. I always had social anxiety and was shy. It was difficult for me to make friends , especially after moving a couple times. All I felt that I could do was endure. I made empty promises that I would try harder and everything would be okay. That's all I could hope for. I would learn to hate hope since it prolonged my existence in this hell. I'm not saying that I lived in North Korean-esque conditions, but it felt pretty bad to me.
My parents would call me worthless and lazy when I didn't study. I played video games to help me get away from the problems at school and home, but my parents made that nearly impossible. I felt like the Gestapo were after me so I cold never enjoy video games. They still do this to me today, but are much more lenient. If they ever caught a glimpse of me playing, they would go into a raging fit. All I wanted to do was escape from my reality.


My mom would always act like she wasn't the problem. Everyone in my family has a problem with her. I feel sorry that she had to go through some difficult times with my dad in their early years, but she keeps bringing them up. She would always talk about how bad my dad is, how much of a piece of shit he is. Ever since I could hear, she began talking about him in that manner. She still does to this day. Maybe she's a narcissist. She always believes that she could do no wrong.
My dad is very well educated and hard working. Both my parents are. My dad should never have been a father, my mother either. My dad isn't close to my sister and I, he has always been that person who went to work early and came back late. He has always been that person who spanked me and I feared him because of it. I feared him for all my life until high school. I wished my parents never had me or at least they should have been divorced a long time ago. It's funny how I feel like my problems in high school have brought them closer together. I don't know if there are other problems between them that they aren't sharing, but I guess that isn't my business.


After high school, I didn't want to go to college. In fact, I don't even have my driving license. Mostly because, what's the point of learning if I'm going to die soon anyways? That was my mentality for a long time and I've paid for it. Anyways, I still feel like going to college was a wrong move for me. The only reason I'm still in is because I don't know what else to do. I tried convincing my parents to let me join the military but they think that I'm not mentally equipped to do it. That reason pissed me off since most of my anger and tantrums were focused on them. It nearly drove me insane as to how skewed their perspective of me was. Well, I didn't join the military and I hoped that college would be better. I would later find out that my dad's job pays for all of my tuition if I stay in for four continuous years and higher degrees, up to a point.


College is okay. It's better than the rest of my life, but still feels wrong. I don't like what I'm learning, I don't like the process of learning. I tried for so long to want to learn, but there is a mental block. I failed Calc I twice in college. I took calc in high school and did very well. I've got the intelligence to succeed, just not the heart.
I would quickly develop a crush for this cute brunette in college, mainly because she was the one who started getting interested in me first. We would look at each other across the room, but I would never do anything. We don't know each other. It's been over a year now. I feel like shit since I didn't do anything about it. I think she gave up on me last semester. I didn't make a move because I was afraid that my mental problems would hurt her. I knew that I hated myself and I tried fixing it. I hate myself even more now, but at this point I just don't know anymore. My life is a mess. I don't even go after what I want most.


Should I just suck it up and get through college? I really want to take a break and I know that it's hard to come back. I've always hated school and I need a disconnect with all the negativity of school that I have. I don't even have any valuable life experience. I never had a job, never really traveled anywhere. I want to get away from all of this. I feel trapped in my situation. I would be throwing away a paid education, but what's the point if I don't even pass?


I want to get away from my family forever. I'm not close to them at all. My parents have tried to reconnect with me ever since I began college. In fact, they started talking to me more when I began college than when I lived at home with them. My dad hugged me for the first time ever at the end of freshman year last year. I remember when I was around five and he didn't let me get hugged anymore since it was time to become a man. My mom is still crazy-ish, but trying to reconnect. She hasn't changed though. She's just delusioned enough to think that I have ""improved"". I barely talk to my sister. In fact, she texted me last night telling me that I should start looking for internships. Her birthday was over a week ago and my family celebrated it at home this past weekend. I didn't go due to a weather. My parents think that my life is turning around and seem proud. It makes me sad that they are actually proud of me for the first time in my life. I'm not talking about proud as in getting an A on a test in grade school. I'm talking about actual pride in them seeing me becoming a man.


I don't see myself staying connected with my family. I barely stay connected with my close friends. The only reason we're friends is because we do a lot of gaming together. That has been barely enjoyable for years now. They are close friends, but I don't feel like I could open up to them. I'm someone different to them than who I feel like I really am. I want a restart."
1y50pu,2,2014-02-17,[Troubleshooting]Is it better to use my extern HDD instead of my intern?,Alban04,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1y50pu/troubleshootingis_it_better_to_use_my_extern_hdd/,"Hello, first of all thanks reading and assisting me.

Would it make sense to use my extern HDD instead of my intern HDD. On a sidenote the intern HDD is quit loud so thats the main reason i wanna use the extern as my boot system.

Extern: Toshiba HDTB110EK3BA STOR.E Basics 1TB 

HDD SpeedTest Tool: 20 data a 10MB

Write: 6,7Mb/s

Read: 28,9Mb/s

Intern: WD Caviar Blue 1TB Sata3 6/GBs

HDD SpeedTest Tool: 20 data a 10MB

Write: 4,2MB/s

Read: 9.0MB/s

I think using the extern would be better overall, quiter and faster.. but i dont really know if i can use it without problems. If yes, can i copy the complete stuff off my intern onto my extern HDD via a programm?

Is there anything i have to take care of i might have forgotten?

Thanks in advance, i have to go to work now and sorry for my bad english, not my native language."

Episode Name: Redemption

Air date: 2/17/2014

Summary:
When some of Gabe's acquaintances go missing, Cat and Vincent must come together to save them. Vincent ends up returning to the hospital where he was an intern, allowing him to see what his life could have been.

Main cast :
    Kristin Kreuk as Catherine Chandler: As a teenager, she witnessed her mother's murder and was saved by a mysterious creature (Vincent). After her mother's death, Catherine set aside her ambition to become a lawyer and sought a career as a homicide detective with the NYPD.

    Jay Ryan as Vincent Keller: A former doctor who enlisted after his two brothers died in the September 11 attacks; while in Afghanistan, he was part of an experimental unit of soldiers who were subjects in a supersoldier program that was terminated. He is the only known survivor following the termination of members of his unit with extreme prejudice. Vincent's DNA was mutated and he developed the ability to transform into a creature very human-like in appearance but with a beastly mind; he turns into the creature whenever he is distressed. He checked in on Catherine once a year after her mother's murder, and went on to protect her in his beastly form many times, often inadvertently leaving behind DNA evidence.

    Max Brown as Dr. Evan Marks (episodes 1–18): Police morgue medical examiner who worked with Catherine and had a flirtatious relationship with her. Evan worked with Muirfield to capture Vincent.

    Austin Basis as J.T. Forbes: Vincent's childhood friend and a professor at a university in New York. He hid Vincent from the men who have been hunting him for a decade.

    Nina Lisandrello as Tess Vargas: Catherine's partner and closest friend who eventually discovers and reluctantly agrees to keep Vincent's secret. She had an affair with her boss, Joe Bishop.

    Brian White as Joe Bishop (season 1): Catherine and Tess's former commanding officer. He cheated on his wife with Tess. He is eventually fired for his vendetta against his brother's killer, which distracted him from his job. Originally credited in a guest role, the character was promoted to series regular by the second episode. In the series' second season premiere it was announced that the character of Joe Bishop lost his job as commanding officer, and actor Brian White's name was removed from the show's credits."
1y58wk,4,2014-02-17,"My [23M] girlfriend [21] of 5 months, wants to go travelling for a year and I am struggling to deal with it!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1y58wk/my_23m_girlfriend_21_of_5_months_wants_to_go/,"A bit of background: When I met my girlfriend, she always talked about how she was going to go travelling after we finish our internships. Since then we have fallen hard for each other and have been living together since we started seeing each other. Because of this, she told me she was reconsidering going travelling in order to wait for me to finish my studies (a further 8-9 months).

Recently, however, she has changed her mind again and wants to go as soon as we finish in the summer- when I go back to university. The reasons for this are: she does not want to hang around doing nothing while she waits for me, and she wants to experience travelling solo (which I recommended!!) Neither of us want to break up and she says she will come back for a brief spell at some point but I am really struggling to deal with this. 

We have spoken a lot and she knows how I feel but it's not fair to talk her out of it. How do I know we will last through this? How can I accept it and deal with paranoid thoughts of jealousy? What do I do??

TL;DR; I really don't know how to deal with my emotions regarding my girlfriend leaving me to travel around the world

1y5ctz,1,2014-02-17,Say the words and Ill starve and stay,OkayWhiteShark,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y5ctz/say_the_words_and_ill_starve_and_stay/,"My entire life all I ever wanted to do was make movies. It was my dream and my passion for my entire life. And then I decided to move away from home and go to film school. 

I thought that it would be full of imaginative, passionate, and inspired people. Instead it was full of some of the most hateful and bitter people I've ever met. Especially the teachers. I didn't understand at all.

But last Nov. I graduated and now I understand. What was my dream has now turned into something I regret. The film industry is full of hateful and bitter people. And everyone on the lower end of the totem pole is willing to lie, cheat, steal, and sleep their way just to get a little bit further.

And now because I followed my dream I'm starving and would be homeless if it wasn't for some amazing friends.

But thats not the point of this post. The point of this post is my ex. Last August we broke up because my former room mate and his now wife put a wedge between us. It wasn't a messy break up at all. We both knew it was time, but we also knew if that wedge hadn't been put there then we would still be together. We both just needed time to heal.

And after months of waiting, heartbreak, just wishing she would look my direction, we've now reconciled and she told me she always loved me.

But we've decided to not get back together yet because she's at work and school everyday but Sundays. And me, well obviously I don't have a job.

And now I have a choice. 

My old boss back where I came from is trying to get me a job with his company. I was an intern there before I moved and everyone loved me. The higher ups all have given the thumbs, they're just waiting for the paper work to go through.

It would solve all my financial needs, I would have a roof over my head (The family I'm staying with and I decided I need to be out by March 1), and I would have something stable thats somewhat in my field.

But that doesn't matter to me. Even though I'm starving and I'm on the brink of being homeless, if she would just say ""Stay"" I would stay. I would risk it all and throw everything away. Because she's worth it and because there is no one on this earth that I have ever loved as much.

Say the words and Ill starve and stay."
1y5fvl,1,2014-02-17,[For Hire] 2014 CS Grad Looking for Sales Engineering / Product Management / Account Management / Anything! Can go anywhere!,[deleted],SFBayJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayJobs/comments/1y5fvl/for_hire_2014_cs_grad_looking_for_sales/,"Hi! I really appreciate you looking at this!

I'm 21, based out of Ohio, and I'm looking to pack up my things and join your company!

I will be graduating in May with a B.A. in Computer Science from Denison University, a small, private Liberal Arts college. I am completely open to working / training for you before that happens.  

*I am passionate about technology*, and I would love to join a company who shares this passion. Another passion of mine is being able to take really complex things, and explain them in layman's terms. This is why I'm primarily looking at Sales Engineering, as I would love to be able to travel with a sales team and be able to talk in depth about the technical aspects of a product. I feel that I could also do very well in sales, but I understand that my lack of any formal experience in sales doesn't help that claim. While I am a CS major, I don't feel that my calling is in development. While the mental puzzles offered by coding do intellectually stimulate me, I don't feel that I could be serve your company by sitting at a terminal all day crunching code. 

**About me:**  

I have technical experience. I spent last summer in San Diego working as a backend server intern for a travel agency data consolidation company. I mostly worked with SQL, and the data analysis was done with Crystal Reporting. In my computer science courses, I have learned C++ and Python, with some minor experience in C, Java, and Ruby. I have set up a few websites, and I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails. 

I have extensive leadership experience. For example, I was the Vice President of the student body, and have served on the student government for all 4 years. I served on the Presidential Selection Committee, which has the honor of screening possible presidential candidates. I am an Eagle Scout. I will walk first at graduation because I am the Senior Co-Governor, and announce the class gift, which I have been working all year to fundraise for. I started my own organization on campus, whose mission it was to foster interpersonal relationships between students, and create a campus culture of respect and appreciation. I am a proud member of Beta Theta Pi, of which I served as the secretary. I was just nominated for the Distinguished Leadership Award, which is given to less than 30 graduating seniors for their accomplishments on campus. 

I am a very creative person. I work on campus in the media lab, where I tutor students on creative applications such as Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Logic. I actively read and write. I am very involved in my community. The summer after my sophomore year I spent in service, counseling juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program centered around a community garden. 

I am ready and excited to work for you. I value work ethic and I value the relationships I form. I can relocate to anywhere you are based. I value professional mannerism, but I feel that I can liven up any office. 

Thank you so very much for looking at my posting. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me via pm and I can send you my resume. 

Thank you!"

I have been a 3D graphic designer for the past 5 years, and since I started my career it has been a struggle to get jobs. Things that graphic designers has been more and more confronted recently, from long internship to tests or unpayed jobs. Like most of us I got skills and knowledge, surely not the best in the world but I think I'm highly capable to deliver a good job. My career has been a bit chaotic, worked for video game, architects, interior design, communication agencies and recently contemporary artist ( I know, amazing they do 3D ). So here I'm with my 5 years of experience in 3DSMAX, VRAY, Photoshop etc... and that big question which is:

Is 3D graphic design worth all the sacrifices I done? Or should I reorientate my career? If yes what are the options?

Bonus questions: Maybe I done something wrong like choice of software ? Best country to work? Well any tips that made your life easier as a 3D graphic designer are welcome.

Thank you for reading me."

1y5ntr,25,2014-02-17,Looking to limit or disable Torrent traffic at certain times in a shared student dorm.,Kwakman,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1y5ntr/looking_to_limit_or_disable_torrent_traffic_at/,"A few months ago my fellow dorm dwellers and I decided to up our internet speed. Sadly someone has been using to much of the internet for themselves for torrents. Normaly this wouldn't be to much of a problem but this person is dispatched all over the province cause of his internship. 

He has the habit of leaving up all his series and several movies downloading via torrents while he is gone. He uses his computer as a server to access files remotely so I can't shut his connections down permanently once the downloadspeed starts dropping to horrendous levels.

Is there a way I can manage the Torrent speed without having to force myself myself into his room and possibly password protected computer? I have full access over the router btw. Some specs to follow.

1y5pvj,2,2014-02-17,Requesting some quick registration advice.,Khavanon,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1y5pvj/requesting_some_quick_registration_advice/,"I'm trying to decide between Technical Report Writing and Linear Algebra. I'm already going to take Applied Differential Equations, third term Physics, and Circuits II. I got A's in Calc I and II, never had any problems with Algebra or Trig, and I am currently taking Argumentative Writing. This Linear Algebra course has Calc I as its prereq.

This semester I'm burning out half way through, mostly because I'm devoting a lot of time to Writing and Physics (both young, ambitious instructors) while trying to do a respectable load of work in Circuits I and a manageable amount in Digital E II. I also have a family (wife and two kids).

I want to save T.R. Writing for later if I can, mainly because right now I'm committing 10-12 hours to writing during weeks where I also have lab reports (and homework) for the other three.

But I wonder if it isn't a mistake to take two math classes at the same time, even if they have some things in common. I do know the Linear Algebra instructor, and I actually had him for both of my Calc classes. I don't know the DiffEq instructor, but I have to take it this term if I want to take Circuits III this summer.

I suppose the easiest thing to do would be to take neither right now, as I would still be a full time student. However, I don't want to make a habit of piling up classes in the future. I have my course path planned out, and if I stick to it I could be getting an internship or two my senior year without a heavy course-load. My school graduates students only once a year.

What are your thoughts?

tl/dr: How challenging would it be to take Differential Equations and Linear Algebra at the same time?"
1y5z2r,0,2014-02-17,"Got denied by a Chase credit card, is this common?",GreyMatter22,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1y5z2r/got_denied_by_a_chase_credit_card_is_this_common/,"I was in FutureShop all set to buy a MacBook Pro, went to issue my FutureShop's Card by Chase so that I could purchase the laptop in installments, but I got denied by Chase.

Called my bank to see what's up first, the person on the line looked at my credit history and assured that it is in good standing, however the representative on Chase told me that ''*my credit history isn't high enough*''.

I'll now head over to get my credit scores from the bureaus, however the folks at FutureShop and BestBuy told me that Chase denying people is actually very common, so I shouldn't be worried about, and is most probably to do with the fact that I am a student than anything else.

Is the notion true? Is it common that students and even others get denied by Chase, or is something with my history?

Also, is there any way I could get the laptop in installments?  As paying all of it upfront from student me isn't ideal.

Sorry if this question might not fit here.

EDIT: Just to be clear, I can buy the laptop, but installments would be easier to maintain my cash flow, and the fact that I can work an internship for the summers, so that would give me a financial boost and a smoother cash flow, that was my thinking. Yes, if I did not have the money, I would be relying on my current 6 year old $250 desktop, which is almost done, lol."
1y60qt,1,2014-02-17,[Help] Dealing with Sleep Deprivation,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1y60qt/help_dealing_with_sleep_deprivation/,"Recently I haven't been getting enough sleep and it is really putting a lot of strain on me.  Sometimes I get really sleepy during the day inbetween classes and try to take a nap in the computer labs but fail to actually fall asleep.  Sometimes my roommates wake me up during the night around 2-4am, both of them are international students (from India and China).  I'm a CS student and I'm currently taking a 16 credit hour semester (of the university max of 18), meaning sometimes I have to crank out programs right before deadlines and plus I'm finishing my lab science credits and I stupidly chose chemistry (most failed class at my uni).  I'm working a contracting job as a full stack programmer (the front end, developing an API, and managing the database) for a professor.  Generally he gets a request from his research firm 2 weeks before it is due and I have to implement the request, which can lead to maybe 3 hours of sleep a night for a week.  Plus I'm working on applications for summer internships and trying to finish side projects that friends need help on (my one buddy recently started a general programming solution company and he asks me for favors as needed).

What do you do personally to deal with sleep deprivation?  

Currently I try to bring a small blanket with me for some shut eye when I can, I also try drink tea when I start to get tired and splash my face with water.  Sometimes I sit outside and do work in the snow so the cold will keep me awake as well."
1y63bb,1,2014-02-17,Question about an IT internship I'm doing.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1y63bb/question_about_an_it_internship_im_doing/,"I've been doing an IT internship for about a month.  A place that runs a giant auto plant, that builds small car parts/components for different auto companies' vehicles.   

I do IT for a small office, basically a person has a computer problem, I fix it.  I was told Id be working in AD, and a IT support system, also some windows server stuff.

Been about three weeks, a month by Friday.  So far I've pretty much installed workstations in the office, well as in the plant floor.  I've also imaged/installed a bunch of desktops and laptops, and organized wiring.  Once in a while I'll plug in patch cables in the server room to hook up a network printer or phone. 


Basically I'm worried because I haven't gone into any AD or IT support ticket stuff so far.  I know I was told it takes time to get access to all the remote servers I need. 


Should I be worried that I'm not getting into that part of my internship after almost a month?  I'll probably ask my boss (sole IT by the way) about this by the end of the week."
1y67cz,1,2014-02-17,Resume doesn't illustrate my experience well - any suggestions?,ineffectiveprocedure,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1y67cz/resume_doesnt_illustrate_my_experience_well_any/,"I'm trying to get a job as a programmer, preferably one that's a little above entry level.  My problem is that I have much more experience than I know how to express on my resume. If you look at my resume you'd see this:

* A B.S in cognitive science (2009)
* An internship as a programmer (2009)
* A year as an R&amp;D analyst/programmer (2010)
* A master's in philosophy (2010-13)
* A big space of time off (2013-14)

The reality is this:  I've been consistently programming, mostly on my own, for about 15 years.  I taught myself C/C++ and python in high school and have kept learning since then.  I didn't get a degree in computer science because I didn't want to take classes in subjects I had already learned on my own time, so I focused on a subject that was relevant to the stuff I'm interested in working on (i.e. artificial intelligence).  I ended up taking mostly classes about mathematical modeling and machine learning.

I got sidetracked for a bit by academic interests and ended up with a master's in philosophy.  This looks terrible on my resume, because of how useless and flimsy one might imagine the coursework for a master's in philosophy would usually be, but since I was interested in some rather technical problems and I was in a very rigorous program, for me it actually amounted to three years of training in high level mathematics.

I took some time off after grad school during which I was considering starting my own software business to work on some of my own ideas - I ultimately decided against this and now I'm looking to rejoin the workforce as a programmer.  During my time off, I've resumed learning about relevant CS stuff on my own.

So I have a really big math and programming background and a couple degrees that don't necessarily provide any evidence of that background.

I'd like to get a job that is roughly commensurate with my actual experience - something demanding, where I could work on projects that I'm interested in.  But my resume makes me look like I have nearly no relevant experience - I can list lots of knowledge areas and skills, but it's not immediately obvious where I would have realistically gained these.

What can I do to beef up my resume to provide a better demonstration of the knowledge and skills that I have?

I've considered getting another master's in CS, but I would like to avoid going back to school (yet again) for now.

I also considered trying to go for a very low level anything-I-can-get programmer job, just to get some more work experience.  But it seems like this might work against me, as doing work that's below my level of competence doesn't flatter me - it seems more like an admission that I actually am as underqualified as my resume might suggest. I'm fine stooping down a little bit, as long as there's room to prove myself and move up into bigger and more interesting projects, but if I'm stuck doing entry level work, there's not going to be much opportunity for that.

The next thing I've been looking into is taking online courses, so I have some area-specific certifications.  Do employers look at this and take them seriously?

Anyone have any other ideas?

Edit: Didn't notice relevant subreddits (e.g. CS career questions, resumes) on the sidebar - I'm looking into cross posting this elsewhere, but I'll delete it here if anyone suggests that'd be appropriate.  Sorry if I'm spamming."

Apple is Apple. The work is less interesting, but the name is bigger and they have a very good internship program.

The mid size SF company is well-known, public company, albeit smaller than Apple. The work would be more interesting, but I'm worried that it won't get me a Big 4 job next year.

[How's my mom doing? Bang her recently?? Kudos for reaching top 40 without cheating though. I play Zombies a LOT and all the top ranks are dirty little cheats it would seem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhn77t?context=5)|Haha i was never one to give abuse, its usually the people getting slapped who do that, thanks, yeah it got annoying when people cheated to get ahead of me, what i found funniest is when i was #1 all time for a while there were people below me who were boosting.
[If you were the best at something like Starcraft 2 or League of Legends you could be making 6 figures though :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhue05?context=5)|I wasn't the wasnt the best. Public games are completely different to the professional way to play it. 
[Still no confirmation of a love life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhq8bj?context=5)|This is the internet, no matter what i say people won't believe me. If i saw someone trying to argue how great their love life is online i'd just assume they're lying.
[When you were young? As in last year? Also, getting high on the leaderboards doesn't make you the ""Number 1 COD Player in the World""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhx3gz?context=5)|This was a few years bak I was 15/16. I'm not saying I'm the best but at a point I was the #1 in the world. That's how leaderboards work. Photo doesn't lie.
[You were not the best in a game. You were playing public matches, lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhur7y?context=5)|I never said I was the best. I said I was #1 which I clearly was with proof of photos.
[*i have realised there's better things than being the **best** at a game.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhvfzu?context=5)|Yeah. I was trying to be the best. I was in the process of becoming the best when I quit. Wasn't there by a long way 
[Is it true that the reason I am killed so often is 1% because the other guy is better than me and 99% because ""this is bullshit""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhnor9?context=5)|Back then i could never relate to people getting angry but if i ever play nowadays on the newer games I am the same, haha everyone is terrible at the game but you seems to be the cod motto.
[I know! running around for 5 minutes getting shot in the face whilst barely even seeing anyone means I have smashed up many controllers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhntf5?context=5)|I never got to that stage but im sure in my day i have been the one making people smash things up.
[Did you like game play better in black ops original or black ops 2? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhmwnu?context=5)|I preferred Black Ops 1 simply because I was better at it and at that stage the game was still fun for me.
[What do you want to see in upcoming games? How can the developers implement new ways to keep the game fresh, but also prevent burnout? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhnbnf?context=5)|I preferred when it was simple, in my eyes World At War was the best, they're over complicating it, revert to 3-5-7 killstreaks only and smaller maps.
[How much COD would you say you play on average in a day? And do you make money by being number 1 in the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhn2yz?context=5)|I have barely touched it since Black ops 2, its become boring to me now, I personally made none because I only played public matches, although i did get a few requests to buy my account as i was consistently top 10 on a number of game types.
[How much do people offer for that? Did anyone make any actual offers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpfgr?context=5)|I got offered $100 for my account, of course i said yeah because i could easily make a new one and get back to #1, but the guy never replied, probably wasn't a serious offer.
[Have you played/plan on playing Titanfall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfi2sdh?context=5)|Don't have an xbox one and don't really have any desire to get one.

[Im sure you can use the dual shock on it, most modern pc games have controller features that auto detect if u have a dual shock or xbox 360 controller.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfi8m11?context=5)|I didn't know that, good idea. Dont have any interest in games anymore though. Got stale for me.
[Cant even use a keyboard/Mouse to play a FPS PROPERLY.  Holy fuck your such a fucking casual.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfizkz5?context=5)|You're saying that as if thats going to insult me, if you bothered to read any of my answers i played for fun, just so happened to be good. No interest to me to play ""FPS PROPERLY""
[So what are you #1 at now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpog8?context=5)|#1 at reddit AMAs about being #1 in call of duty years ago.
[How long did you have to play each day to get to #1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqokg?context=5)|For weekly leaderboards which i was usually at least top10 the max it would take you would be 50 mins, this game was based on skill rather than who could lay in their own filth the longest, i didnt have to play that much as i just played the 50 mins got a really high score and sat at number 1 for the rest of that week, i was also 1 in monthly and all time which took 5 and 10 times as long respectively.
[When you made it were you determined to keep it for as long as you could?  Would you have to play more in a day to maintain your ranking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqokg?context=5)|Its actually the opposite, the more you played the harder it would be to keep up your high average, i would usually play a load of different game types and see how well i did, i mainly topped search and destory, domination and most commonly Free for all. As for determined not really, it was funny going into a lobby and hearing ""that lads number 1 in the world"" and you see a load of people leaving if they arent on my team.
[What was your favorite loadout and killstreaks? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqokg?context=5)|Famas/Galil silenced, ghost, sleight of hand, marathon. Killstreaks = Blackbird (8kills) Chopper gunner (9kills) Dogs(11 Kills)
[Wow, that's not a lot of time at all.  I read an article about the #1 HALO player in the world and he said he needed to play HALO 2 (I think\) for 8-10 hours a day to maintain his ranking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhrax8?context=5)|Yeah some of the cods you have to grind it out to stay number 1 all day everyday, i couldnt do that i had more important things even back then, no worries, thanks for the question.
[What was your ideal load out on Black Ops?  I miss how great online for that game was.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhnz7h?context=5)|Silenced famas/galil ghost sleight of hand marathon. Yeah the new ones don't have a patch on it.
[Exact same as me, nice.  I did love dual mag on the galil with SoH.  Is it full of hackers now? I can't bear myself to play it online for this reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfho5gx?context=5)|Yeah but i was always snaking around their spawn and once i got blackbird it was game over, not sure to be honest havent been on in a long time.
[How does being #1 make you feel?  2\) thoughts on people who have died from playing too much comupter games?  3\) have you used any hacks?  :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhto0v?context=5)|It's irrelevant to me now. This wa years ago. Even then it didn't mean much. Not like it was a notable achievement to the general population.  I think anyone who plays the game all day everyday needs a reality check and to realise there's much more to life. And no never willingly. 
[Dont you sometimes wish all that time you spent on the game couldve gone to something else? any regrets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhtxbk?context=5)|I get the no regrets question a lot. I have none. I had a good social life at the time aswel. Only regret is I should've spent more time studying. But I stopped playing in time and got into college so it all worked out. 
[I used to be the #1 cheater in the Call of Duty series.  Did you ever think modding was fun? Not just kids killing for stats, but you never once enjoyed a modded lobby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhrl60?context=5)|I never really saw the appeal, when mw2 was hacked to pieces i got all challenges and all done but i kinda felt like ""whats the point in playing now"" i found the challenges enjoyable.
[Why did you never play professionally? (If you did I apologize, im fairly new to the pro CoD scene\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhvz0o?context=5)|I didn't like that side f things. Back then it wasn't anywhere near as big as it is now. It's full of little kids with their heads up their asses who think they're the greatest.
[How many hours did you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhnio5?context=5)|Back in black ops 1 the ranking system was done by score per minute played spread out over a certain amount of games e.g. 50 games for all time. I'd play maybe an hour max a day, i had just become good by playing the old ones a lot.
[Did you ever use any kind of custom controllers or mods like control freaks/ modsticks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhrgpv?context=5)|Nope, some of my friends swore by kontrol freaks but i wasn't bothered, back then there wasn't all these fancy expensive controllers.
[Have you played titanfall beta yet and what do you think of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhn8iw?context=5)|I haven't, in the last few years i havent touched any games really, also i dont have an xbox 1.
[Did you ever decide to step up from public matches and play competitive? Like gamebattles or anything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhtiei?context=5)|Once in mw2 before I was good. Didn't like it. I played the game casually for fun. Was more fun to me to demolish people than be challenged to be honest. 
[Yeah I had my fun grinding pubs and spawn trapping in bo1, and then I moved on to GB. I won a 4v4 Amateur tournament and then just quit playing. Its always fun to go back and play the older CODs and just shit on everyone in pubs, though. Thanks for the reply.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhu135?context=5)|My friends and I were never anything more than casual players that's why we never progressed. There's an ego within GB that everyone is the best which I never liked. Just play to enjoy it  no worries thanks for the question 
[Have you been offered money to coach or train other players?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhnjil?context=5)|Nope, there's two sides to the cod world really, the public and professional, I stayed on public side, the pros play the game completely differently and i wouldn't have a clue how to coach them, i did often accept friend requests and have people ask for advice.
[Coming from the CoD PC community, console (FPS\) gaming was looked down upon.  Do you think you could beat an above average CoD PC gamer, if console and PC could be linked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqzjj?context=5)|So i heard, i was completely casual and was more in competition with myself to see how high i could get in the world, although it was a good tool to use when people tried to abuse me saying i was bad i never started the arguments,  and to be honest nowadays i doubt it, id say i struggle to hold a 2kd nowadays. Good question.
[I have to assume you play competitively to be that well ranked, so, what was the top prize you've ever won?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhnbgb?context=5)|I played a bit of GB back in the day, i was more into it than my friends so we never won anything, i always preferred destroying people in public matches.
[How do you spend your free time now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqqhk?context=5)|I'm in college and on an internship right now, back then i did have free time, as explained it was more about how good you were rather than how much you played.
[That's not really true though. No one is inherently good at playing COD. It's skill built from playing (either COD or other games - even non-computer game activities could help\).You obviously played a few hours a day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfihelt?context=5)|You obviously know how much i played a day? Why would i lie about this? I pick things up quicker than most OBVIOUSLY.
[How can you know if you are #1 in the world? pc, xbox and ps does not have cross platform play with each other.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhopq2?context=5)|I'm not saying im the best ever, just saying that i was ranked #1 on ""black ops 1"" out of 14 million people on ps3 for an extended period of time.
[Do you think MW2 was the best COD of them all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhrz7m?context=5)|Between that and WaW for me.
[I always find myself going back to MW2 everytime. We still play it and its crazy that we can still get games easily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhs3s0?context=5)|Last time i tried to play it it was non stop hackers.
[Favourite black ops map?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhorkj?context=5)|WMD/Jungle.
[We play hc search and dont have any problems with hackers. There was a point when wall hacking was big though and it was horrible to play.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhs6v5?context=5)|Yeah they ruined a good game for a long time.
[Did you become the best through practice? or do you think you were born with a god-given ability to play video games that i'll never be able to reach in my wildest dreams even with a shitload of practice?  (have zero desire to be a gamer, just curious\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhv0x3?context=5)|I don't know. I was average in the beginning and just so happened t be really good at that game. I did play a fair amount prior to tha game tho. I still class myself as a casual player who stumbled upon a game he was good at 
[How do I quick scope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpery?context=5)|I'm not the man to be asking unfortunately 
[How did you do it? as in, what's the secret? as in, what was I doing wrong? Do you have extremely good eyesight? A sixth sense or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfidw66?context=5)|I just could tell what people could do I think, I would go certain places on certain maps that i knew people would be in and caught them off guard. No real secret some people are just good at things, mine happened to be this.
[Ever play against Kimdotcom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhux95?context=5)|Nope. He goes the route of playing non stop. I was 1 in the old system of score per minute. He's a cool guy tho. That vice documentary on him was really good. 
[Your favourite weapon? :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfho1j8?context=5)|Famas/Galil.
[What was your preferred load out in BO1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhspee?context=5)|Famas/Galil Silenced, ghost, sleight of hand, marathon.
[Why are you proud of it ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqaub?context=5)|I don't see it as something to be ashamed of, i was bored on the bus home and today is my first day ever on reddit and thought these AMAs were an interesting idea. 
[I'm a girl, didn't have my own Xbox for a while, and just started playing bo2 around Dec. 15th, multiplayer &amp; zombies.  WHY DO I ALWAYS DIE IN MULTIPLAYER? I'm pretty good at zombies, but I just can't seem to get kills in multiplayer. What am I doing wrong? Will the campaign help me or am I screwed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfia82s?context=5)|I was terrible in the beginning, never played zombies. Campaigns pointless in my opinion, the more you play the better you become.
[How many hours did you put into gaming to get the #1 spot? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhrewe?context=5)|Common question, it was about how good you were rather than how much you played, i did play a lot when i had a gap year type thing in school but when i was number1 i wouldn't play more than an hour a day.
[What's you longest kill streak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqdxi?context=5)|I think it was 67 including killstreaks when i went 67-0. Gun streak was like 38, not 100% on that as i havent played the game in over a year.
[Do you plan on playing Titanfall when it comes out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpxjt?context=5)|I dont play games anymore, also dont have xbox one, watched a few youtube videos of it and it looks confusing to me.
[Any particular reason on why you don't play games anymore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfi1g3x?context=5)|I only ever played call of duty so once I got bored of that I has no other options so just quit. 
[Actually in some cases it can be.  Now for my question.  How many times have people gotten pissed at you/called you a hacker and/or threatened to kill you IRL?  Also, how exactly did you get to the #1 spot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfjhhbq?context=5)|Most games i played i got either those abusing me or else praising me and taking the beating well haha, I was #1 mainly in free for all, so i wasn't relying on stupid team mates, it went on score per minute, so my goal was to end every game of free for all as fast as i possibly can, to get weekly leaderboards you had to play 5 games, monthly 25 and all time 50, so i played all my games and got #1 all time, but i continued to play to keep getting weekly and monthly top spot.
[Do you know PWNSTARZ from real life, or have you ever met him ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpbwd?context=5)|Nope no idea who that is, i dont keep up to date with cod anymore.
[Any tips or tricks you have for people when it comes to cod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhvekp?context=5)|I haven't played in years so I'm not the one to be asking but stay away from team mates and always look at the map.
[Don't know if you're still replying, but I was in the second best clan for sniping EU and was up there a lot of the time on MW2 at one point, did you do much yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfilwi1?context=5)|Still here yeah, I sniped a lot in mw2, basically all i did, sleight of hand pro made it ridiculously fun.
[What was your average KDR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpev0?context=5)|In my prime it was 6, but by end of game about 4.5.
[So you only killed 4.5 people for death you incurred on average?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpyna?context=5)|That was my overall average from start of the game to finish, it really varied some games i could get 60+ kills with 5 deaths but i'd rarely get below 4.5 kills/death per game.
[I think I'm in the minority, but MW3 is my 3rd favorite cod out of the ones I've played (Just behind MW2 and black ops 1\) my question is, why was it that you didn't like it, is there something I didn't see that made that game bad? Why did you not enjoy it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfi1e5u?context=5)|I hated the death streaks. Maps kill streaks and support. Guns weren't great either. I managed to get to 8th prestige in like 3 days playing and just hated it. 
[Did you ever run with a klan? That was my best cod experience. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhqal2?context=5)|Not anything official no, only just a group of real life friends, i enjoyed playing against them a lot and hearing all the abuse after the game.
[How does auto-aiming on a xbox compare to real skill?  Have you ever played the original Call of Duty/ Call of Duty 2 (I'm not talking about ""the Big Red One"" on xbox!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfib786?context=5)|I played ps3 so i have no idea, nope i started with WaW and played every game since also played a bit of cod4.
[What other video games do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfi8ihn?context=5)|I don't, never really enjoyed any others, stuck to what i was good at and quit when it got boring.
[That's cool! At least you got out when you could rather than go down with the ship...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfic3ce?context=5)|Yeah i always said as much as i love it if i ever play for the sake of playing I need to stop.

I have always found theres always one or the other with hard core cod players but I liked both and I was a hard core player for a bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhn13n?context=5)|MW2 was the most fun of all the CODs for me, mainly because all my mates played it, Modern Warfare 3 for me was the worst i've ever played. 
[Couldn agree more mate. mw3 was a collosal disappoint and fucking awful. mw2 was the most fun ive had with a multiplayer 1st person shooter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1y609k/iama_ex_1_in_the_world_in_call_of_duty_ama/cfhpmnp?context=5)|Yeah i played mw3 for about a month before realising it was useless.

He is going on an internship abroad (Nepal) and the main use will be for office/web but he is looking for the best possible bang for his buck because he would also like to use it for gaming after office hours. 
Doesn't need to run everything on high but at least reasonable performance with recent games.

He asked me for advice since I'm an avid PC builder but I don't really know a lot about what a good price/performance ratio is for the mobile versions of the components.

Only requirements are:

- At least 15,6"" screen 

- Reasonable battery life.

- SSD would be a pro but is less important than a better GPU...


Going to buy the laptop in the Netherlands but if you guys could give me some suggestions I'll look up my local prices.

This has the potential to get long, so turn back now if you don't want to read it. I understand. 

K has been...an acquaintance. I hesitate to call him a friend or an enemy, because he is neither. I don't like him, I in fact quite dislike him, but he's not my enemy. We have a mutual friend, and met at a party my sophomore year of college. Before we met, our mutual friend, M, warned that he might try and hit on me. I'm certainly not used to being hit on by dudes, but I figured I could handle it well enough (I hadn't been hit on by many chicks either, but I had a little experience). Well, that happened pretty early in the night. I wasn't much of a drinker then (still not), so I really was just hanging in a corner with my solo cup filled with water. He came up to me, slightly drunk, and asked if I batted for both teams. It knocked me back for just a second, because there was no chatting, no foreplay if you will. Kid maybe knew my name, and maybe not even that. I kind of stuttered out a response in the negative, and that I was happily dating someone and had been for awhile. He immediately took offense and called me homophobic. I kind of laughed it off, and that seemed to be the end of that. We saw each other at a few other parties, but never really talked again. 

Because of our mutual friend, K frequently came to my apartment to meet M before they went anywhere. My girlfriend was also over frequently, because I have had several classes that she was currently taking (she's two years younger than me) and I was helping her study. K always seemed to make it a point to hit on me in front of her, making her incredibly uncomfortable. Every time, I told him I wasn't interested, you're making my GF uncomfortable, and I wanted him to stop. One time he did this, there were a bunch of people over at my place with M pregaming for some concert. He started again, and I repeated that I wasn't interested and to please stop making my GF uncomfortable. He then yelled, drawing the attention of the entire room, ""You're just a damn homophone and intolerant of my lifestyle."" Before I even had much time to think, I heard myself saying, ""I don't dislike gay people, I just hate assholes like you. And if you continue to annoy me and make my girlfriend uncomfortable, I'll slap you into the middle of next week."" He sort of laughed and the party left soon thereafter, because I had clearly made tensions too high to bear. Throughout the year, I continued to receive nasty glares from him, but he never made any more advances.  

Fast forward to just before the summer before my senior year. M has informed me that K has been cut off by his parents and has been struggling to find a place to live that's in his price range (literally broke, from my understanding at that point). M asked me if it was okay if he slept at our place that summer. I warily agreed, because I am not heartless. K assured us it would be a month or two max before he found his own place. He had a roommate lined up, they were just looking. In the mean time, he got a job and was working on the edge of town. Good for him, right? I had an internship in my hometown that summer, but would be back in town frequently to party and play some sports with friends. I made it known to K and M both that my bed was strictly off limits and my room was to be used sparingly, if at all. The summer kept marching on, and it appeared that K was no closer to getting out of our apartment. He had cleaned a bit, but most of the time that I saw him (probably about 15% of the summer) he was sitting on my couch, watching netflix on my xbox, using my gold account. So he essentially lived the entire summer rent free, while accumulating money from his job. He also had the funds to open a new line with a popular telecom, as well as a shiny new iphone and some fancy accessories. It wouldn't have been much of a problem to pay at least part of the rent that is stupid expensive in a college town. But no, nothing. K finally moved out on the day before the semester started. Literally the day before. Whatever, I was just glad he was gone. 

But my troubles hadn't ended yet. K was back at our place frequently, because of M. They drank at our place frequently, and K passed out on our couch. One time, my practice ran late and didn't get back until after midnight. I opened my door and threw my bag on my bed in my dark room and heard a grunt. I stopped and snapped on the overhead light. There K was, snuggled up in my bed. My fortress. My blankets, my pillows, my safe haven. Being...used. I flipped out, and started yelling obscenities like get the fuck out of my bed you lowlife piece of shit, how dare you, and all kinds of other shit (way out of character for me, I'm a pretty chill guy). He started yelling back, and I shoved him out of my room and shut and locked the door. I was so wired I couldn't sleep for hours. Thankfully, I never found him in my bed again. The rest of the semester passed pretty uneventfully, except for the orange juice incident. I buy good OJ whenever I go to the store, and my roommates never buy any, and they don't usually drink it. Whenever I go home, my mom buys me a shitton of it, like 5 gallons. I love OJ. I came back from my early class one day and saw him sitting on my couch, drinking a big glass of my OJ. I told him I'd appreciate it if he didn't drink any more of my juice, because it was expensive and I really liked it. He said I wouldn't notice a single glass gone (I had just gone home, had a fridge full of the stuff), and I replied that it didn't matter. I was gracious enough to let him sleep on my couch and eat my food, but the juice was off limits. He was pissed, but I didn't care. He told M what I said, and M basically said that he didn't drink the juice because he knew how much I liked it and knew how expensive it was. 

It didn't get any better this semester. K has since moved to a suburb outside of town, but comes back on Thursday and stays most of the week, because of M. I used to like hanging out with M, but I don't like that K is always there. He's supposed to leave on Sunday, but doesn't. He sleeps on my couch, uses my blankets and my pillows, and watches netflix on my xbox. Just sits. All day. And when he does leave and come back, he doesn't knock. Come on man, common courtesy! I know you think you live here, but you don't. I do, and you're ruining it.  

All of this would be so much better if he was gracious. Me and M don't exist to cater to him. My couch is not a rent free hotel. No thank yous or nothing. If I was in his situation, I would be doing whatever I could to help the people who provided me a couch. I would deep clean, offer homework help, cook, something, anything! Instead, if I come home and want to play some vidya, I can't because there's a kid on my couch that I can't say any of this to because of his relationship with M. Instead of relaxing on my couch watching House of Cards or studying late into the night, I am in my room, venting because there's no way I can remedy this situation without losing a friend. 

Also, M just told me to get my stuff out of the dryer, that someone is coming over to do laundry (included in our rent) without asking. I mean, could you at least ask if I was in the middle of laundry before whoring out the machines? Jesus, common courtesy would be such a welcome relief. 

Sorry for the wall o' text, and thanks for listening. "
1y6sw3,2,2014-02-17,"Long, but I'd appreciate the advice: how to offer support long distance",advicewouldbewelcome,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1y6sw3/long_but_id_appreciate_the_advice_how_to_offer/,"I'm looking for some advice on how to provide the right kind/amount of support for someone suffering from severe depression.

I guess a bit of background: known each other for about 2 years, dating for a year and a half. It is a serious relationship and it is understood that we are in this for the long haul. We are both very focused on our education and career, which relevant to the story and is part of the reason we get along so well. When I first met him, he was not depressed; he went away for three months for an internship, and when he came back, we started dating. This coincided with the start of a major depressive episode that has been going on ever since.

I knew he had suffered from it in the past but never really got a feel for the extent of it. Also, I had never really known him when he wasn't depressed. To me, this is just ""normal him,"" although he assures me that this is not normal for him. I don't really have anything to compare it to, although even his friends have mentioned to me that he hasn't always been like this.

In part because of these things, I'll admit at first that I wasn't as supportive as I could have been. He is not the best at communicating his feelings and I tend to be rather high strung, so I jumped to a lot of conclusions and took a lot of things personally. I thought I was the ""cause"" of it - I still have a hard time convincing I'm not, even though he repeatedly says I'm not (although I'm sure stressful relationship situations didn't help). I went away myself this past summer for three months and that's when his depression really hit hard. That, coupled with long distance, made for a really unfavorable situation for both of us. But, we made it through. When I came back we started communicating more openly. I myself have pretty severe anxiety and he was very understanding and encouraged me to try medication, which helped for awhile. I also adopted some better coping strategies (notably avoiding alcohol and trying not to take things so personally). I am doing much better now and no longer need the medication.

However, he seems to be doing worse. I have finished my graduate program and accepted a really great 6-month opportunity on the other side of the country. He encouraged me to take the opportunity because the timing would be right: it would give him a chance to focus on the rest of his school, and we would be done at about the same time. I was a bit worried about leaving him alone for so long, but I know he would have felt even worse if I had skipped out on the opportunity ""just for him,"" so I took it.

So far I've been gone for three weeks. At first it seemed OK, but the past few days I have been really worried. He is too down to talk on the phone, but he will text, and he tells me he keeps doing worse. I'm glad that he is at least communicating that to me, because before he wouldn't even do that, but I'm still worried - this is causing my anxiety to resurface, although in this case I think that's understandable. I tried giving him some advice that I thought was pretty sound (focusing on smaller, achievable goals rather than broad and hard to define ones). He has friends who care about him where he is but I know he isn't reaching out to them.

How can I be supportive from so far away? I don't want to be overbearing or put any pressure on him, so right now I am giving him space, but I'm really worried - not just about right now, but about how long this has lasted and what this means for his future. I honestly wouldn't care if he dropped out of his program for now to figure things out, and honestly, at this point he might just get kicked out anyway. I'm really worried about what will happen then. His mental health is most important to me, but I know for him a lot of his self-worth is vested in the completion of his degree. He just can't bring himself to do anything.

Any thoughts about what I can do to be supportive without overstepping my bounds? I know this can be a very delicate issue and I don't want to do the wrong thing. Right now I'm just sending him cheerful text messages and asking how he's doing, but beyond that, I'm not sure what to do.

1y6x4j,5,2014-02-17,"Been promised a job promotion since last summer, but still nothing?",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1y6x4j/been_promised_a_job_promotion_since_last_summer/,"I am interested in your thoughts, suggestions, and I'm very curious what *you* would do in the same situation.  If it matters, this is my first office job, I'm late 20s, and this is a career change for me (my college degree is a bit different, so I'm self taught in this).

I have been a ""Temporary Web Design Intern"" for 1 year 4 months (hourly, no benefits).  My boss has changed 3 times: first one got laid off, second one moved to different company, and my boss now (I'm part of a team of 4 people).  Right now, I have some very important responsibilities for an intern and I'm the only person who knows how to do certain tasks.

I have asked each of these bosses about changing me to full time status (which would mean more pay, with benefits and vacation).  They have all liked me and my work and were very open to that promotion.  By late last summer I've been told (by 2nd boss) that I am basically hired, but it'd just be a matter of paperwork and that the headcount wouldn't be approved until 4th quarter, in October. 

October comes and this boss leaves, but the higher up boss has said to me that they are hiring me to full time status.  I ask my 3rd boss about this and this boss has asked for my promotion to the higher up boss.  I don't hear anything, so I email the higher up boss and HR directly asking if I can do anything to help/accelerate the process. He just says he's still working on it.  At this point I learn there's a freeze on headcount until mid-January.  

Starting since about November, I have seen a few other people being hired on different teams.  A few temps, but also full timers.  My status has still not changed. 

**Questions:**

* Everyone praises my work in front of me and the higher up boss.  I am eager to learn and do my best to help my colleagues even when that means staying late.  But why hasn't my status changed?  (Is it possible that my work isn't as good as they say?)

* Am I suppose to bug the hire up boss and my boss more persistently (I ask about this every 2 weeks or so)?  I am a very agreeable, quiet, and hard working person, but perhaps this comes off as I'm willing to be tossed around and underpaid?  

* To be honest, I feel quite disrespected because I've been given empty promises since last summer.  My gut feeling is that this company doesn't deserve me.  Should I just quit and give my 2 weeks now?  Or should I wait until I get a new offer?  I have been applying elsewhere, but no new offers as of today.

**TL;DR**
I've been promised a promotion (from intern to full time) since last summer, but still nothing.  Do you have any thoughts/suggestions?  What would you do in this situation?"

It was the best decision I've ever made. This kind, hardworking, intelligent, and in my opinion beautiful girl had managed to go through highschool and three years of college without being snagged by anyone. It took me over a month just to get her comfortable around me but once I did she became more confident, positive, and ambitious with everything. 

During this time we fell in love with one another and after less than six months it ended. It ended approximately one week after I accepted an incredible job offer from the company I interned with. She told me that we were in two different parts of our life and that she had realized she wasn't ready for commitment. Breaking up was incredibly hard for her, she cried extensively and at one point had a panic attack and couldn't speak a word.

I respected her decision, starting seeing new people, and think I have moved on. She is single, hasn't pursued any relationships, and simply appears to be focusing on her grades.

I almost never miss class, never failed a test in college, never made less than a B on a paper, and I work my ass off. I have not taken the GRE yet.

I literally either have an internship, work, or school every day of the week. 


No one in my family has gone past an undergrad, and very few have even gotten one.

It was easy to make a decision for my undergrad. Pick a school in state and close by.


But graduate. I don't even know where to begin.


I want to be a Primatologist. I want to get an anthropology degree.

One professor is telling me to get my masters, the other is saying straight to a PhD.

I have a list of schools that just merely have masters programs for ANTH.


There's so many.

I don't know what to look for, other than that they have Primatology stuff.

I don't know how to look for funding.

I don't know what I'm looking at.

I don't know exactly what I want to do. Not zoo stuff. Research stuff.



I feel so stressed and lost.

I start to make a list, but there's just so much information and I'm not sure what's important.


My professors can help me some, but they can't dedicate hours to me for one day to look at all the schools. I don't want my hand held anyway.

I just wish I had someone next to me, knowing what I'm looking at, and helping me understand it all. I don't want them to make any decisions for me. I just want some support that isn't ""you can do this!"" 

""You can do this"" is nice, but that's as far as they can really help me.


On top of that, I'm scared. 

This has been my dream and I've worked hard for it, but I don't think it's enough. 


My family, professors, and friends keep telling me not to worry. I'll get in.

But what if I don't?

I feel like I'm the only one being realistic. 

I can always reapply, but that would be another year for some programs. In a way I'm in a hurry. I want to start actually working in my field and not watching others do it from a few feet back. I might have to, and that's okay, but I'd rather get started.

The doctor I met was very young and nervous. I suspect he is an intern or a student.

He didn't wear gloves while touching me, and didn't wash his hands or use hand sanitzier before or afterwards.

The medicine I received did not work. When I returned to the clinic to tell him it did not work, he told me he had given me the incorrect medicine. I was charged again for meeting the doctor and getting medicine.

The second round of medicine I received also did not work. Some googling tells me I was given incorrect medicine on both visits.

I complained to the hospital but they denied everything.

Be warned!"

I'm a CS PhD student entering the workforce to allow the other half to go to grad school and the resume probably needs some work.  I am mostly looking at corporate and/or non-faculty university jobs, since there are no professor positions.

Some questions I have off the bat:

* I was offered NSF fellowships, both which I declined. Any possible worth in the resume/cover letter?
* I supervised/mentored/enslaved interns during the last two summers, any use?
* Should I figure out a way to include experience in the languages?  C++ is over 10, C# is a year.
* When jobs ask for full time experience, what do I consider the assistanceships?  Yeah, I was in classes for some of the time, but I've also been working 60-100 hr/weeks for the last three years.

1y7tqx,40,2014-02-18,It's officially official: I'm out at work,Amy_of_Dallas,transpositive,https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/1y7tqx/its_officially_official_im_out_at_work/,"So, lately I've been making a series of posts about slowly coming out at work: [Prologue](http://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/1tkc4h/found_out_something_really_cool_about_a_coworker/), [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/1xe74h/came_out_to_a_couple_of_people_at_work_last_week/), [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/1xkjbl/my_boymode_is_failing_harder_than_i_thought/)

Well, the climax has arrived.

At the time of my last post, only a few people knew.

On Friday, I cornered a bunch of people one by one and told them I was transitioning. The general reaction was that while they weren't *expecting* it, they weren't *surprised* either. Except for the co-founder and *de facto* COO, who told me that he'd already guessed and said ""if anyone gives you shit, let me know"".

I'd mentioned in a couple of places that I'd been looking for a new job. Yeah, job hunt is off. As much as I'd love a job with good pay and benefits, I like my co-workers enough that I want to stay. Never in a million years did I ever think I'd be staying at a job because of the people, but hey, we're one really awesome ragtag bunch of misfits...

This morning, I came out one-on-one to a couple of people I'd missed on Friday. One of them was an intern who just turned 18 last month. That was probably the most awkward. One, it didn't happen at the office: he has a second job at the coffee shop in our building, and I told him there (we was the only people in the store at the time, and he just told me he wasn't scheduled to come up to the office today). Second, he looks up to me like an older brother, and I just *know* that dynamic is going to change now. Third, his reaction was... unexpected. I expected him to make a really tasteless and hilariously offensive joke or something (oh, I can tell stories about him putting his foot in his mouth...). Instead, he just gave me this deer-in-the-headlights look and says ""okay"" after a very, very long pause.

This afternoon, I gave an announcement at the weekly team meeting. Everyone in the room knew, but that made it official. Also, for most of them, that was the first time I gave my name as ""Amy"" (most of the people who knew, I just told them I was transitioning). I also made a little joke about how the guy at my company with the same legal first name as me gets to have the name all to himself now (thank goodness people don't have to call us by our last names anymore). Since I'm the one who writes the meeting notes, I got to be the one to record my own coming out for posterity. I gave March 3 as the tentative date I'll go full-time. I hope I don't chicken out: I'm worried that I'll look like a fool because I haven't been on HRT long enough and because my voice sucks and because my body language sucks. We'll see, I guess...

Since not everyone was in that day, and we have a few remote people, after the meeting I wrote a mass email to send the entire company. Fortunately, I had support: one of our remote programmers is also a famous trans activist (I've mentioned this in my earlier string of posts, BTW), and I'd been talking to her on Skype as I wrote the email. She volunteered to field any questions people weren't comfortable asking me personally, which was really awesome of her.

I seriously can't believe I've come this far. Just a month ago, I was swearing up and down that I'd just medically transition and not socially transition. What changed? A few things. One, I've become much closer to my co-workers in recent weeks, and I've started hanging out with them more as much of the depression I suffered from before HRT is fading fast, and I really want to be myself around them now. Two, my mom's cat who I've known for literally more than half my life passed away about three weeks ago. He was 15 years old, I absolutely consider him family, and I love him more than anything else. More than anything else, I regret not visiting more. I could have seen him more often, but I didn't. I regret letting year after year pass by just sitting at home and doing nothing. It dawned on me that I'd wind up with the same regrets if I treated my transition that way. I realized that I need to start living life the way I've always wanted to. I guess that was his final gift to me. Dammit, I'm crying again... I miss him so much."
1y7v27,20,2014-02-18,How did you/do you know you're depressed?,[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1y7v27/how_did_youdo_you_know_youre_depressed/,"It's been a series of unfortunate events for me in life right now and I have been having some, well, bad thoughts. 

Normally, I'm a cheerful/happy/optimistic person, but for the past 5 months, after moving back home from an incredible internship, I have fallen deeper and deeper into hopelessness. 

I don't want to admit I'm depressed. I don't want to make a big deal out of my self-pity, but I thought it would go away by now. And now all the shit that has been happening to me, it's only getting worse.

Edit: Thank you all for you wonderful responses :) I appreciate you taking the time out to tell me about your story"
1y7y8a,3,2014-02-18,"I look like I have a great life, but its a very convincing cover for my consistent failure. I've recently started lying to people about my job.",TinyPaintedBiscuit,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y7y8a/i_look_like_i_have_a_great_life_but_its_a_very/,"I was supposed to graduate in May 2013 from college but crippling anxiety attacks and generally being a failure who deludes himself into thinking he's some tragic genius. My graduation was supposed to be a week before my wedding and I even put money down for a gown rental and invite stationary. My wife is an amazing over achiever who works out of state and I've been living with her ever since but haven't gotten a job. We live on a military base and I stick out like a sore thumb with long hair and a beard. I feel like everyone knows something is up, like I'm the failure trailing partner in my marriage. My wife's boss has started to catch on and gave my wife unsolicited advice about how she should crack the whip and that I can't act like a college student anymore. I tell myself I'm overqualified for regular work but really I just don't want to go back to shitty retail or food service jobs. If I wanted to I could actually make money in sales, I've gotten really good at faking it and switch into likeable and convincing guy mode. But I choose not to because I hate it, faking it and being convincing to others drains me emotionally and leaves me with nothing and makes anxiety worse. Every sales or fundraising job I've had I did really well for a while but then got worse and worse as I would get more discouraged and once had to be let go.
 
I hang out all day and am supposedly supposed to be working on finishing my degree remotely and working through therapy to fix all the stuff thats broken inside me. I applied to an internship as a contributor to an online periodical. I sent in a resume and a writing sample. They liked me and asked for more and then I never responded. I tell people I write now. My grandma things I write, my sister who is a Mormon missionary overseas thinks I'm a writer, (She's the most squeeky clean, smart, likeable, successful person ever. I'm a bad person for this but I'm really resentful of her but she's super nice to me) so does my landlady and several acquaintances. My Facebook profile lists and old job. But on my most productive days I get out the textbooks from my failed classes and read for a little while.
I started writing notes and started to get good ideas again, and after months of therapy and new drugs (I lied to him too, no fucking clue why) I managed to write an email to some professors who I had a decent relationship with and explained what happened and that I wanted to send them papers in a few months. A year ago writing that email would have taken weeks and would have caused me hours of anguish and a bruised head because I hit myself in the forehead over and over again like a psycho toddler.

Then a week later my apartment caught fire and I lost all my work. I lost my home and I lost nearly everything. I don't dare write those same professors now, almost a month later and give them yet another sob story explaining why I bailed. The fire wasn't my fault but no reasonable person could possibly believe me and these men I respect and want to think highly of me certainly will think I'm not just a disappointment but also a deluded liar. In a few months I could stop the lie but now my life is fucked up by my own failure, lost notes and books, and a whole new wave of anxiety and depression that makes me really doubt that my life is worth living. 

But that's really fucked up. I have it so good. My wife is unbelievably patient and understanding. She loves me way more than I do. I've ruined my life and all I have left is a comfy lifeboat that keeps me from completely losing it. I've failed out of school once before four years ago just as I was moving out of my parents house. I was a miserable mess, tried very hard to see the bright side but slowly started to feel like I wanted to snap. I really wanted to take a baseball bat an smash cars, not in anger but because it sounded fun. Like I would put some fun music on my iPod and dive around lean out the window and smash someone's mirror off. I got myself out of that situation and back into school but I went into the same cycle; short burst of success and optimism, then a downward slope into doubt, anxiety and general craziness. Less just before seeking any medical help I took out a hammer and came very close to smashing my left hand. Not sure why but I really wanted to punish myself for not having started a paper yet. 

Jesus I'm so fucked up and I'm so lucky I have a supportive spouse and family. So many people have it worse but I still keep fucking up. The weird thing is if I had it worse, something big and noticeable like severe agoraphobia I could justify my awful failures and even get some sympathy and understanding from the people around me. People with real problems at least have a socially acceptable out for not living up to their potential. That desire is fucking disgusting, its a slap in the face to anyone in a worse situation than me. I'm in an awful ""sweet spot"" of being just functioning enough to fool everyone but my spouse and parents, but messed up enough to still be an underachiever and have it be reflected as a failure of my character. 

When I seriously contemplate a life where I never graduate and have the career I want I seriously don't want to live it. I'd rather be dead, killed in a car accident or have died in a fire. Fuck my building was burning down and I missed my chance. I don't seem to have real suicidal thoughts, again comparing my wish to die rather than get the life I want is disrespectful to real suicidal people. I can't even be sick right. 

I'm so sorry this was long. I never read shit like this when its this long. Edited to add more depressing details.


EDIT again. Writing this doensn't make me feels better. My hands are shaking and I feel like throwing up. Now I'm having a god dam''n anxiety attack, fuck i can't confess right."
1y7zt9,1,2014-02-18,Don't succumb to superficiality and materialism,HappyJerk,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1y7zt9/dont_succumb_to_superficiality_and_materialism/,"Quick story about me: I always hated superficial and materialistic people.  I grew up really spiritual and religious, and my parents were awesome and loving. I also had some of the coolest, realest, un-materialistic, un-superficial friends ever.  So I considered myself a pretty down to earth and genuine person.  

During law school I got an internship in Los Angeles and the cheapest and closest apartment I could find to my work was in West Hollywood, right in the middle of douche central, the plastic-surgery, famewhore, celebrity gawking, shitty, superficial capital of America.  I literally lived in the thirty-mile zone,  the 30-mile radius centered at the intersection of West Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard, where all the movie studios and douche nightclubs are located, after which TMZ.com is named.  I lived literally across the street from Area, the hottest douche nightclub at that time, where all the celebrities and famesluts would congregate to do coke and be shitty human beings.  I thought I would hate it. 

The first day I was in LA, I went to the bank to open an account. My banker was a hot blonde that looked like a typical LA girl - huge fake tits, obvious plastic surgery on her face, and a hot outfit that had her tits hanging out in a way that was definitely inappropriate for a bank.  We started talking and I told her I just moved to LA and I hoped I would like it.  She said to me, ""LA is a great city, but the only problem is that it is full of superficial and materialistic people.""   I thought it was strange that she would say that, considering that she was the epitome of an LA superficial and materialistic person. 

In the first few weeks, I had the same conversation with 4 other people.  I would tell them I just moved to LA, and they would say ""it's a great city except for the superficial and materialistic people,"" and then those same people would do something extremely superficial and materialistic.  One time a guy was telling me how he hated materialistic people and as he was talking a Lamborghini drove by and he yelled ""oh my god that is such an awesome Lambo! I want that car!"" It then hit me like a ton of bricks - materialism and superficiality is a DISEASE! And the people who have that disease hate that they have it, but they just can't resist it.  I used to think that superficial and materialistic people were happy that way, but then I realized that no, those people are regular people too, they are just in the grip of this crazy illness they can't control. 

Why am I posting this in seddit? Well, I think a big problem a lot of guys have is that they buy into the superficiality and materialism of bars and clubs.  They think that the only way girls will like them is if they are tall, have big muscles, are rich, famous, etc...  The reality is that those things help, but what girls REALLY want is a genuine, loving, caring guy. All human beings have the same genes, and even the dumbest, craziest, sluttiest clubwhore deep down wants what all girls want: a man to love them, a man to hold them, a man to genuinely listen to them, and a guy to be there when she needs him.  All that other stuff is a symptom of a disease partly influenced by genetics and partly by our society. 

We live in the most superficial, materialistic society in the history of the world and its just getting worse.  People try to enjoy it, but they are really deeply unhappy. And the deeper people get into superficiality and materialism, the more they yearn for something real and deep.  You know that super hot girl in a slutty dress at the VIP table in the club surrounded by douches in Ed Hardy t-shirts and sunglasses at night? The way to her heart is not by having the fanciest watch or the biggest muscles but by having a genuine conversation with her about something deep.  In my short time in this game I have noticed that I have the deepest, most spiritual conversations with strippers and hookers, because those girls are the most spiritually starved.  One night I brought a hooker home (I didn't know she was a hooker) and we stayed up until 2 in the morning talking about the Bible. I later learned that pretty much all strippers and hookers are trying to figure themselves out spiritually.  

Before I sound too hippy dippy I realize that in reality the disease is very strong and oftentimes for these women to even look at you you have to look rich, confident, ""alpha,"" tall, etc...  The disease is hard to break, but once you get your foot in the door you can cut through all the bullshit and get to her heart by having a serious conversation about the meaning of life, etc... You can absolutely ""destroy"" with these girls by having a conversation about how much you hate ""fake"" people, about how much you love your parents, about how the most important thing is to be a ""good person.""  It seems totally counterintuitive when you see these whores at the club but it turns out that the appearance they give off is the exact opposite of what they really want.  

I go to clubs where a lot of professional athletes and celebrities hang out, and I see a similar pattern often: the young dumb whores try to talk to them and go home with them (cuz that's what you're supposed to do, right?), but the guys are just so douchey and superficial that the girls can't handle it, and come back to me (sometimes).  The other night I started talking to some really hot girl at the club, and I was trying to have a really intelligent, deep conversation with her, but she was just too stupid, so I left her after like 20 minutes.  Later in the night I saw her in the same club talking to the movie star Jason Statham.  I obviously thought my ship had sailed, but as I walked by her eyes locked with mine and she literally left Jason Statham mid-conversation and walked up to me.  I was fucking shocked.  I brought her home that banged her (I wasn't going to leave her again) and in the morning I asked her why she left Jason Statham for me and she said ""cuz he was a douche."" 

Now, one of the problems with seddit is that it teaches guys to be unemotional ""alpha"" dawgs and not ""nice guys.""  The reality is that girls want guys who are genuinely, unconditionally, selflessly nice.  The problem is that most ""nice"" guys are actually predatory - they are only ""nice"" because they want sex, attention, validation, etc...  They are an emotional drag on girls, needy, annoying, depressing, etc... Part of the reason girls are attracted to guys who don't give a fuck about them is that paradoxically ""alpha"" guys are nicer because they can be genuinely honest and friendly to the girl with no ulterior motive or neediness.  A ""nice"" guy is like a used car salesman blowing smoke up your ass so you will buy his car whereas an ""alpha"" is like a professor who is too busy to spend much time with you but goes out of his way whenever he can to help you.  You also have to remember that a lot of girls have been ""in love"" before and have been hurt, so when they get in relationships where guys start tossing a bunch of heavy emotions at them they freak out and don't want to get hurt again. 

Think about yourself - what do you really want in a relationship?  You want a loyal, loving, caring girl that you can deep conversations with and be vulnerable. That's nice and good - but you also want a hot bitch with huge fake tits, a round ass, tattoos, and will twerk like nobody's business.  You have evil desires as well as good ones, and it is hard to balance them.  That is why a lot of guys hate clubs - it's not because its too loud or the music is shitty or whatever - what they are really worried about is that they afraid of their own materialistic and superficial desires and they don't want to go to an environment where that part of them might come out.  It's a scary and ugly part of human nature. 

The TLDR?  Be genuine and be real.  Don't be afraid to go for the deep conversation at the club.  in fact, if you can pull it off without looking disingenuous or weird you have conquered a plateau 99% of the other guys aren't even trying to.  99% of the people in the club are in the grip of this disease, but if you can show them you are above that (without looking like you are just bitter cuz you're not rich/famous/etc...), you come off 100X better. I talk about shit in clubs that would crazy to you - world peace, the war in Syria, the Bible, etc... Why? Because 1) that is what I am interested in and 2) all human beings have an innate need to be intellectually stimulated and feel a deep connection with another person.  It doesn't matter how big your tits are or how expensive your dress is.

Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption”

Episode Synopsis: Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption” – When some of Gabe’s (Sendhil Ramamurthy) acquaintances go missing, Cat (Kristin Kreuk) and Vincent (Jay Ryan) must come together to save them. Vincent ends up returning to the hospital where he was an intern, allowing him to see what his life could have been.

Detective Catherine Chandler is a smart, no-nonsense homicide detective. Several years earlier, Catherine witnessed the murder of her mother at the hands of two gunmen. Catherine would have been killed too, but someone – or something – saved her. No one has ever believed her, but she knows it wasn’t an animal that attacked the assassins…it was human. Years have passed, and Catherine is a strong, confident, capable police officer, working alongside her equally talented partner, Tess. While investigating a murder, Catherine discovers a clue that leads her to a handsome doctor named Vincent Keller, who was reportedly killed by enemy fire while serving in Afghanistan in 2002.

Catherine learns that Vincent is actually still alive and that it was he who saved her many years before. For mysterious reasons that have forced him to live outside of traditional society, Vincent has been in hiding for the past 10 years to guard his secret – when he is enraged, he becomes a terrifying beast, unable to control his super-strength and heightened senses. Catherine agrees to protect his identity in return for any insight he may have into her mother’s murder. Thus begins a complex relationship between Catherine and Vincent, who are powerfully drawn to each other yet understand that their connection is extremely dangerous for both of them.

The series stars Kristin Kreuk (“Smallville,” “Chuck”) as Catherine, Jay Ryan (“Terra Nova”) as Vincent, Max Brown (“The Tudors,” “MI-5″) as Evan, Nina Lisandrello (“Nurse Jackie”) as Tess, Nicole Gale Anderson (“Make It or Break It”) as Heather, Austin Basis (“Life Unexpected”) as J.T., and Brian White (“The Shield,” “The Cabin in the Woods”) as Joe. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is from CBS Television Studios with executive producers Jennifer Levin (“Without A Trace,” “Felicity”), Sherri Cooper (“Brothers and Sisters”), Bill Haber (“Rizzoli &amp; Isles,” “Thurgood”), Paul J. Witt (“A Better Life”) &amp; Tony Thomas (“A Better Life”), Ron Koslow (“Moonlight”) and Gary Fleder (“Life Unexpected”).

Billy and Nick ar 2 forty-something ticker salesmen WHO lost their jobs once their company plicate (nobody uses watches anymore). each men ar currently adrift during a world that has passed them by. once a protracted night of sadly Googling the ""jobs for individuals with no skills"", Vaughn's Billy stumbles upon Google's competitive situation program associated signs up himself and his brother Nick for an interview. Batting away the kids WHO need to urge on the general public laptop, Billy and Nick shout at top-volume into the screen, despite the very fact that they're told by the recruiters, ""Guys, we will hear you"". Billy associated Nick jam their heads approximate like an recent variety team soliciting for a frenzied promotional photograph and jabber right into the camera, exuding not solely obvious technical inco

petence however blatantly embarrassing would like

Directed by dancer Levy and written by Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern, ""The Internship"" stuffs some creaky gear-shifts and boring exposition in its 1st fifteen minutes; even can Ferrell's one scene falls alittle flat. however the Google interview is that the moment the film explodes. The energy is uproarious.

Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) are salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital world. Trying to prove they are not obsolete, they defy the odds by talking their way into a coveted internship at Google, along with a battalion of brilliant college students. But, gaining entrance to this utopia is only half the battle. Now they must compete with a group of the nation's most elite, tech-savvy geniuses to prove that necessity really is the mother of re-invention.

1y83th,93,2014-02-18,Co-worker gets called out for taking advantage of an intern,applestoapple,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y83th/coworker_gets_called_out_for_taking_advantage_of/,"**BACKGROUND:** So, a couple years ago I was a marketing intern at this international company. Because I was a good enough worker, my boss put me on corporate marketing request duty. Basically what happens is that whenever some random person in the company needs something to be done on the website, they would submit a request to my co-worker and I. We fix whatever is wrong and eventually shove it onto the website. I got the more-or-less simple tasks that only required playing in HTML and occasionally CSS. People tended to like me since I took care of things in a pretty quick fashion. Overall, my team had about 10 people in total, which includes me, my boss, his boss, my mom, and a few other people who don't need mention.

**ACTUAL STORY:** Some time a couple months into that position, I got a request from the legal department that seemed pretty trivial. Just fix this one page, whatever. I fixed it, sent it to the woman sending the request (let's call her Hagar just for ease) for review, and everything was starting to look good. And then she got the bright idea to start doing the ""Oh, and while you're there, could you do this little thing for me?"" I let my boss know about this, he said I should just go along with it even though she's supposed to send each and every one of her additional requests through the corporate marketing server. An interesting thing to note here is that I always made sure to CC my boss in my replies. In Outlook Express, if you hit Reply All, the people who were CC'd are going to be included in your reply. And all of her responses don't have my boss included, and her more impatient emails had her boss included. So, it means she is intentionally trying to take my boss off the email list. This continues for another week and then I suddenly fell incredibly sick. As a result, I had to stay home for a few days and was not allowed to work (my mom, one of my coworkers, had none of it.)

I finally get back to the office after ~5 days, including the weekend, to find about 20 emails from Hagar demanding to know what is going on with her now-pretty-large request. At this point, she decided to include my boss's boss in the emails. Mind you, not my boss, but his boss. I promptly respond with, ""I was out sick the past few days,"" and that shut her up out of sheer embarrassment for a while. I took care of everything she requested, sent it back to her for review, and then went to focus on this problem that required about half of my team.

A couple weeks pass, and then I get this email from Hagar with her boss, my boss's boss (because clearly my boss is just too insignificant for this shit), and one of the people on the corporate managing team CC'd with this huge explanation for why she is so upset and how dare I not do anything she's asking when her problem is so important (the problem she was citing was reorganizing the overview page, which is as trivial as you can get) and it's been over a month (more like 3 weeks) and I'm just ignoring her and I'm just the worst person ever.

Finally, I give up and, after checking with my mom and boss to make sure it's okay, send a Reply-All email with,
""Hi, Hagar. I'm sorry I haven't been taking care of your request in the past week. I had to focus on building the new site (which we were also building at that time). I have your problem fixed, you can see it here. And while I still have you, could you please check to see if all of your other requests that I sent back to you weeks ago look okay? *includes links to all of the pages she wanted me to clean up* Thanks, applestoapple, Corporate Marketing Intern""

A couple hours later, I get a response from Hagar's boss (with Hagar and my boss CC'd) saying that all of the things I've taken care of look good and are ready to go live. I don't hear from Hagar for the rest of my internship. I've been taking contractor positions at the company since then, and it was only until a couple months ago that Hagar has been allowed to send corporate marketing requests again.

**TL;DR:** During my internship at some company, some person in a different team sends a request that rapidly snowballs into a nightmare, gets angry that I don't take care of things as quickly as she wanted, tries to include multiple higher-ups in the company, and I smack her down in front of all of them."
1y89nt,1,2014-02-18,Just Be Careful,[deleted],Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1y89nt/just_be_careful/,"I feel the need to share this, only because I believe what I believe, and I feel it's worth it to mention what's going on with me to a subreddit full of people interested in exploring otherworldly stuff.

I'll throw this out there to start with: I have clinical depression. So, me being bummed out is the norm. I don't take meds and I've never had therapy, because I've never felt that my state of mind was severe enough for professional treatment.

It's also important to mention that I am a Christian. No denomination, really, just your standard Protestant. 

Not sure where I'm going with this, really. I just... feel the need to warn people. See, this past summer, I began an art/research project focusing on The Revelation of St. John, the last book in The Bible. Call it an internship, if you will, because I was offered money and it was a subject I wanted to work with. So, I'm making these big drawings of Satan's fall from Heaven, Tribulation, angels, demons, all that fun, disastrous, cryptic stuff. 

Basically, ever since I started these drawings in the summer, I've been... a mess. My girlfriend split with me, which didn't help anything, but I was falling apart before then. I LOVE this work, I love the research, I love The Bible, I love to make art. The way I see it, I shouldn't feel the way I do. But I'll just say what I told my girlfriend before she dumped me: something very real, and very evil, does not want me making this work. 

My depression has peaked into fits of anger, I'm forgetting how to interact with people, I can't sleep and when I do, I have nightmares. I forget to eat, and can't hold down what I do eat. I've been sick to my stomach once or twice a week for the past half year. I'm compelled to finish my task, but there are constant distractions. I've tried desperately to keep up with my Bible devotions and prayer, but I'm often pulled even from that. This work is about the final battle, evil being destroyed for good, and God recreating the world and perfecting everything He made that fell to sin before. Something terrible, be it the devil or whatever form of evil you believe in, has been attacking me ever since I started these drawings. 

I'm reading posts on here about Ouija Boards and talking to spirits and all that, and it kills me that people are so passionate about contacting ""the other side."" Meanwhile, I'm sitting here trying to share my faith through artwork, and something from said other side has all but driven me mad. I guess my point in typing all this is, if you're going to provoke the supernatural, you'd better pray for some kind of insurance that doesn't want to eat your soul. Mine is my faith in Jesus, and even that is pretty rusty at this point. Even if you're just trying to contact a ghost, a lost human spirit floating around, you're opening doors that other things can and will pass through. The devil disguises himself as an angel of light; never forget that. 

Go ahead and tell me it's all in my head, that this will blow over once I finish the work and take some stupid pills. Believe what you will, I'm just telling you, be careful. "
1y8din,7,2014-02-18,Should I get a job in Australia or continue working in Norway?,chrixzz,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1y8din/should_i_get_a_job_in_australia_or_continue/,"Hi,
My IT internship ends in June and I have to find a new job. I can just stay in Norway and get a new IT job or i can travel to Australia and get a job there. 
I like to travel and I've always wanted to go to Australia, the thing is that i don't know whether i should wait one more year or just go now when my internship ends."
1y8en2,2,2014-02-18,Rescheduled for the 39048th time for my psychiatrist appointment,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y8en2/rescheduled_for_the_39048th_time_for_my/,"So I probably adhd. And I just failed my semester. And I'm trying to fucking hard, and it's like I'm always gonna be a failure. I can't take this anymore. 
So I had an appointment for the 7th of March. Fine. Then they called me saying I had to be rescheduled for the 28th. Shit. I called the international department (I live abroad) and they were able to give me an appointment for today, and I cancelled the one I had for the 28th. I was fucking happy and relieved. This morning I get a call from them saying the psychiatrist is sick today, and they only have space in the beginning of April. Seriously, fuck them. Not to mention all the times they didn't call me when they had do, to the point I had to call them from my phone crying and feeling like a neglected piece of shit.
Just fuck everything. My semester will be close to ending in the beginning of April. I have to do my internship then and I'll probably do it in another country so it's not even worth it.
I just thought that this one time, things would work out. That I wouldn't fail again. 
Right now I just feel fucking depressed, I hope this sadness translates into anger soon because when they call me again to confirm my next appointment I just want to yell at them like they just killed my whole family.
Have a good day everybody."

Touches of humor are riddled throughout the film almost as if the director took notes from the master of humorous storytelling and director of The Avengers Joss Whedon.

All the main players are back from the first film, simply titled Thor. Directed this time by Alan Taylor who is best known for directing some of the most popular television series on the small screen. Taylor has recently been sharpening his director’s swords on the hugely popular HBO fantasy Game of Thrones. With this type of pedigree the chap who is better known for television projects must have been seen as being perfect for the second Thor feature.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Chris Hemsworth is back as the blonde-locked demigod who has a romantic interest in Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster. Considering that this is the 30 year-old actor’s third outing as the son of Odin and brother of Loki, it isn’t too surprising that the role fits Hemsworth like a well worn, but tight, glove. As equally at home in his role as Loki, the untrustworthy and grandiose trickster who longs for his own throne, is Tom Hiddleston. The 33 year-old actor is perhaps the most qualified actor to play opposite Hemsworth as the two close and quarreling siblings. Although, Loki is, as Thor points out in The Avengers, adopted.

Equally impressive is Stellan Skarsgård who reprises his role as Erik Selvig friend and mentor to Jane and unwilling host to Loki, in his head, throughout most of The Avengers. This brilliant actor is equally at home in his character’s skin, again, because he also has played Selvig three times now in three different films. In Thor, Skarsgård was protector of Jane and reluctant friend to the Hammer swinging Asgard. With the news that there will be, at least, one if not two more Thor films in the offing, no doubt Stellan will be back and continue to impress with his skills as an actor.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online In Thor: The Dark World, which is dark, but not too much so; after Odin recites the tale of the dark elves, the audience is brought to “present day” and Thor is sorting out the nine realms and Loki is cooling his villainous heels in Asgardian dungeons. Thor is missing his human love interest and decides to pay her a very overdue visit. Meanwhile, back at Earth, Foster is attempting to move on having pretty much given up on the Demigod ever returning. After being interrupted on a date by her intern Darcy Lewis, played with kooky capability by Kat Dennings who tells her that something odd is happening and that Jane really should check it out; things move to a deserted warehouse in London.

While discovering an anomaly inside the warehouse, Foster stumbles over an artifact thought hidden since the defeat of the Dark Elf Malekith and it invades her body. Thor then turns up and after a short, and amusing, reunion the artifact which is known as Aether has taken over Jane’s system and apart from making her dangerous to others, she herself is in danger. After British police try, somewhat ham-handedly, to arrest Jane for trespassing, Thor takes Foster to Asgard to have her cured if possible.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film does an adequate job of recreating the Asgardian verse and the only disappointing thing about the film is the loss of Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano who plays Hogun, one of Thor’s band of Asgard colleagues who join him anytime battle is due to commence. At the start of the film, when Thor is sorting out Vanaheim and after defeating the rebellious natives, Hogan is allowed to stay behind to help clean things up. This more than capable actor, who is best known for his role in the Takashi Miike cult classic Ichi the Killer, has not had too much to do in either Thor movie, but, it is hoped that this creative genius will eventually play a larger role in future films.

The obligatory Stan Lee cameo is present, as in all Marvel films, this time as an asylum inmate with Erik Selvig who is teaching the assorted “crazies” in a common room. After the lesson, Lee asks for his shoe back, which Erik is using as a teaching aid. The film does have many small touches of humor, some more slapstick in nature; as when Malekith and Thor hit the roof and side of a glass topped building but even this touch is deft and not done in a “Three Stooges” sort of way.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The graphics in the film amaze and do not lose a thing by being watched on a smaller screen. The FX are just as brilliant and the battles are impressive. The acting is without a doubt top notch. In a film where “smaller” roles are filled by acting royalty, i.e. Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo – who may not class as royalty exactly, but does have an impressive pedigree – as Frigga, there can be no question as to delivery. Christopher Eccleston as Malekith is evilly brilliant and the award winning Idris Elba as the Asgard Sentry Guardian Heimdall is just as impressive in the second outing in the world of Thor as the first.

It would take too long and be ultimately boring to mention all the cast who adroitly make their characters come to life. Suffice to say the script combined with skilfull helmsmanship from Taylor as well as actors who all bring something to the party, Thor: The Dark World is a brilliant sequel to the first Asgard tale of a Demigod who fell in love with an earth woman and stayed on to become the planet’s defender. In this second tale, the film may be dark, but, not too dark. If the other sequels can maintain this quality the continuing story of Thor and his fellow Asgardians will be a special treat each and every time they appear. Available for streaming now and for sale from February 25, this is a real 5 star out of 5 film that in collector’s speak, “is a keeper.” Don’t forget to keep an eye out for another cameo of a miliary sort.

1y8gm3,391,2014-02-18,"""Diets don't real"". Love, Medihams the medical student.",anyeonghajimemashite,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1y8gm3/diets_dont_real_love_medihams_the_medical_student/,"
**Edit**: LOLerblades. This post sure got more attention than I expected. Banana and I just wanted to thank everyone who commented. We learned a lot from the comments! Thank you!

****

This is a short but sweet story about Medihams. Medihams is the ex-girlfriend of my boyfriend's brother. I have been exposed to her fatlogic and fit-shaming for a very long time but I didn't try to post here because my SO's brother browses reddit from time to time. But now that they've broken up, it's free for all. 

Yes, I am aware me posting about it after their break-up is a douche move. However, I just want to get it off my chest as her fit-shaming rustles my jimmies to high heaven. 

Medihams, as you can guess by her name, is a med student. She is not a very good one. Her ex-boyfriend is one of the best in his class. She *pretends* that she's just as good and even told me at one time that it was *her* tutoring that got him his good grades (this is bullshit. He is already an intern (on his way to being resident) and she is still stuck with lectures because **she keeps failing fucking everything**). 

She often tries to be nice to me, but ends up being condescending. We don't get to talk often because I would rather swallow a fistful of nails than talk to her. Well, that and we don't really have anything in common. Every time I talk to her, it ends up about how she's a med student and I'm not (I'm an English teacher, folks. Never dreamt of becoming a doctor even when I was bullshitting all those ""what do you want to be when you grow up"" essays in elementary school). 

Anyway, I wasn't present when this story happened. It was my SO, who we'll call Banana (its what his second favorite fruit), who witnessed her fatlogic first-hand. It's a little long, but this will be a bit important later -- and it will also kind of explain why Banana and I are so pissed at her fatlogic. 

See, for a few months now, Banana and I have been trying to get some changes done. See, we *were* both overweight. Not hamstatus or mini-moon status, but mostly just a lot of fat in the wrong places. I have to give him credit, though. Banana was the one who really pushed himself first and then encouraged me after. I was one of them TiTp-er sympathizers. I don't mean I was a fat activist who fit-shamed and didn't think ""diets don't real"". I sympathized in a way that I really did believe that fat people were being oppressed and unfairly humiliated. I got a lot of flak from my mom (especially her) and the rest of my family about my weight a year ago. I weighed 94kgs (206lbs) and Banana weighed a little bit less than that (maybe around 180-185lbs?). 

It was a year of feeling like shit and moping around about how lucky thin/fit people were and how my life was so hard because I couldn't say no to a second helping of white rice every meal time. Banana, on the other hand, started taking up Tai Chi lessons a two years ago. He's now learning Bagua (?) and other offensive forms of Tai Chi. He also started watching what he ate. He dropped the ""soda everyday"" routine, stuck to green tea and water and of course, controlled his cravings. It worked. He looks great now. 

For a while, I was hesitant to do it because I was too busy feeling sorry for myself. You know, like most TiTpers. But then I decided to give it a shot this year. Since January, I've been on the Keto diet and I've been circuit training every night no matter how tired I am from work. I now weigh 89kgs and dropping! Banana and I kind of encourage each other and help each other with our diets. It's been going great. I'm happier, healthier -- and I need new clothes because everything is so loose on me now. Ha. 

**Enter Medihams**.

See, Medihams has the illusion that she, too, is healthy. Her parents got her a membership to an expensive gym near her campus. She is also trying on this new trend diet. When I heard that she was trying to lose weight, I felt happy for her. She was finally fighting back the fatlogic --

&gt;Everyday posts pictures of cakes and ricemeals on FB

&gt;Everyday goes to Starbucks to buy fraps

&gt;""After gym treat, tee hee!""

**See why I say illusion?**

She has other people calculate her calorie intake and cook her food. This isn't bad at all. Especially since med school pretty much **does** take over your life. I just wish she'd stop shitting all over this chance to change something by **fucking eating cake every single damned day**. 

Okay, I'm calm. 

Anyway, Medihams is also the daughter of Banana's boss. That's why sometimes, she's there at the office while Banana is working. One day, before going out to lunch, she walks to Banana's desk and starts a friendly conversation. It's just the usual. School, work, life-stuff. Until Banana makes the mistake of saying the following words:

&gt;Banana: Yeah, AH and I have been trying to lose weight. We're doing great so far. 

Medihams puts on that face that she gives you when she wants you to know she's concerned. It's a mix between smug and constipated. There is no meme for it. Sorry, FPS.

&gt;Medihams: Why are you doing that?

&gt;Banana: Oh, well. We're not getting any younger. We have to start looking out for ourselves. AH and I want to be healthier for when we get married and start a life together. 

Banana is 31. I am 27. He also makes the mistake of telling her that he is taking up Tai Chi and I have taken up circuit training. We are both on the keto diet. 

&gt;Medihams: Yeah, you did lose weight. I don't get it though. Everyone is so *obssessed* with losing weight! 

&gt;Banana: My goal this year is to lose more belly fat. I'm going to do more crunches and situps --

&gt;Medihams: It doesn't *WORK* that way!

Banana had to do a fucking double take because, shit. Did the *med student* just tell him that **exercise doesn't work**? Like, fucking really? That's like a computer engineer telling you he doesn't know how to use microsoft office. 

She continued to lecture him about how diets and exercise are only society's way of pressuring you to be something you're not. And that if he really loved me, he would stop trying to fat shame me and love me for who I am. Medihams constantly repeated that exercise won't make you thin. Nope. It won't even *help* you get thin. And if you stop yourself from eating whatever the fuck you want? Well, that's you starving yourself! You should be good to your body and **let it have the three tubs of ice cream it so desperately craves** (okay, she didn't say that last part. That was artistic license). 

Again, FPS. I remind you. This is from a med student.

Let that sink in. A *med student*.

Someone who is going to be a doctor.

Someone who is going to treat people. 

Who will specialize in treating *children*. 

She just told us that exercise and diets *don't* work. 

I'll let you have a shouting match with your jimmies for a while. I'll be right here.

...

...

...

Okay. You're back. 

Banana's jimmies were rustled, but since she is the daughter of the person who holds his paycheck. He didn't really start any shit. Instead, he just asked a question.

&gt;Banana: So, you're saying that -- no matter how much I exercise. I won't get thinner?

&gt;Medihams: That's right!

&gt;Banana: If I eat a lot of food, will I get fatter?

&gt;Medihams: Uhm... well, yes. But that just means that you were meant to weigh that much!

&gt;Banana: But I read about this woman who weighs 800 pounds. Is that still considered okay? That's morbidly obese, right?

&gt;Medihams: Well, that's not a bad thing. It just means it was genetic!

&gt;Banana: But these people eat junk. All the time. They can choose *not* to eat junk. Also, isn't heart problems and physical impairment due to weight pretty much a bad thing? 

&gt;Medihams: I'm not petite (she means not fat). I don't have any health problems. I'm absolutely fine. And I exercise!

&gt;Banana: But I thought you said exercise doesn't work? Why do you do it? 

&gt;Medihams: To be healthy, duh.

&gt;Banana: But -- I just told you that *we* were doing it to be healthy, too. Isn't that pretty much the same thing as you're doing? Why is it wrong when we do it? 

&gt;Medihams: Because you're doing it to lose weight! And that's not healthy! You shouldn't be obssessed with it! 

&gt;Banana: My blood pressure stopped peaking as often as it did when I lost weight. I think that's kind of healthy. And AH and I aren't obssessed about it. We just do it together to motivate each other. 

&gt;Medihams: Well... Chocolate (Banana's brother) and I do that, too! We play tennis together! And that's exercise. 

&gt;Banana: Oh. Well, that's great! How often do you two exercise together?

&gt;Medihams: We play tennis *once a month*. Tee hee! 

&gt;Banana: Oh. Well, I guess if that works for you. I guess that means you've lost weight, too.

&gt;Medihams: Uhm... it's a little hard (this means no, she didn't. She still pretty much looks the same). With exams and lectures and all. I gotta keep energized! In fact, I'm gonna get a snack now. I feel a little light headed. Wanna come with?

&gt;Banana: Where?

&gt;Medihams: There's a steak house near here, right? Their ribs are *excellent*

**It's 3pm in the afternoon. At most, it's fucking snack time.**

&gt;Banana: Uh... no thanks. I ate a pretty okay lunch and I've still got work to do. 

&gt;Medihams: What did you eat?

&gt;Banana: AH and I had Kani salad (basically a garden salad with 3-5 strips of crab) and some coffee. I'm good.

&gt;Medihams: *sigh* Starving yourselves. It's so sad. 

And so off went Medihams to hunt for ribs. Banana told me about it the evening after it happened. My jimmies were rustled to maximum 5000 and there was much sexy times to soothe the savage beast within me. 

*****

Recently, Medihams and Chocolate broke up. This happened because Chocolate was going through some kind of life choice crisis and Medihams could take no more. At that point, I sympathized with her. Chocolate was kind of giving her a hard time. In Choco's defense, however, when he saw that Medihams was unhappy, he let her go. Then, Banana hears from Mediham's brother, Carrotcakes. He had this to share:

&gt;Banana: Hey, sorry about my brother being a douchecanoe. Hope there aren't any hard feelings.

&gt;Carrotcakes: Nah. It's alright. We'll see what happens from here. Have you heard though? 

&gt;Banana: About?

&gt;Carrotcake: Medihams said she's going to lose weight and become sexy so that Chocolate will be sorry he ever let go of her. 

&gt;Banana: ....Uhhhh...

&gt;Carrotcake: *shrug* It's kind of like -- to get him back, I guess?

&gt;Banana: O..kay.

***

As of late, Medihams is on that swanky diet I told you about. Although, her profile page is filled with pictures of the stuff she eats everyday. Basically cake, ice cream and all that other kinds of junk people aren't supposed to eat every fucking day. She used to post whenever she was at the gym, but I don't see her posts at the gym anymore. 

This will probably be a series. "

Unfortunatly my application was not good enought. I then decide to share what I made with reddit instead of simply deleting it. I would like you ti give me some feedback on what I should improve. 
Keep in mind, I'm not a native english speaker nor an expert in making balanced champions. I apologize for my english and hope you will enjoy reading it.

Kurai, the cosmic herald

INTRODUCTION : 

I imagined this character 2 years ago. At the time, I was wondering why there was no abilities able to interact with other abilities. Two years later, yasuo comes out. I was really happy to see, that finally someone had the same idea. I really like this type of gameplay, and I really hope Riot Games will go further in this way. I find it really interesting, because it gives some champions really high skill cap. Pro players are becoming stronger everyday, if we dont want players to be limited by the skill cap of champions, skill caps have to follow the trend.

LORE :

Kurain is a yordle, that lived in a remote place, near Bandle City, with her family. She was the only child her parents had, and they died while she was still young. She lived as an orphan, thanks to the fields her parents built, she managed to grow up. Until one day, while she was going on a trip into the mountain, looking for some edelweiss, a black spot caught her attention. As she was walking towards it, she felt an attractive strength. The closer she was getting to the the black spot, the more intense the strength was. She slipped on the humid moss that covered the ground, and was sucked into the black hole. She was no more able to feel her own body, she was now out of the space-time continuum. She attended birth of universes she didnt even know, she saw them growing and dying. She saw the entire galaxy taking shape and disappearing into star dust. She was travelling through space and time, she had no more shape or age. She felt the presence of entities close to her, but she could not know which feeling gave her this sensation. A whisper broke the deadly silence, this voice came from nowhere and said : 
""You saw things that none of your kind were supposed to see. You touched things that none of your kind were supposed to touch. That is because It chose you. It opened your mind to new domains, you are now ready. Go back to your world, be Its herald, and serve It. This is not about good and evil, this is about a timeless clash between things and nothing. You do not have to understand what you do, just trust It. Enrol in the League of legends, make yourself a name, be famous and feared. One day, It will explain Its reasons to you. Later.""
A sudden light burnt her eyes as she woke up at the exact same place. No one can tell how long this  phenomenom took her away, and no one can tell where she was. Maybe because time and space were not even defined, it happened nowhere and never, yet it happened. Her body had merged with the cosmic energy she had been through. She quickly recovered, and quickly got used to her new abilities. She was now able to distort the space-time continuum. As the herald of an entity she suspected was responsible of the birth of universe, her size worried her. She made herself a staff and two wings, from materials she picked up in space itself, to be able to be the embodiment of It on earth.

""Shapes, colours and time are only ellipsis made by weak minds in order to grasp what they could from a reality they cannot conceive. - Kurai""

APPEARANCE :

I've designed Kurai as a silhouette, which is filled with a view on the universe. That gives her a really unique appearance as her ""skin"" contrasts with the rest of the map. Please keep in mind this is not what the champions is supposed to be. My drawing skills are not good enought to draw her as I imagined her. This is the only way I found to try to have you understand what it could look like designed by someone relevant.

""Shapes, colours and time are only ellipsis made by weak minds in order to grasp what they could from a reality they cannot conceive. - Kurai""

APPEARANCE :

I made a drawing of her, but I do not know how to include it in my post so I will just describe how she is. I've designed Kurai as a silhouette, which is filled with a view on the universe. That gives her a really unique appearance as her ""skin"" contrasts with the rest of the map. She wears a very large magician hat that is too big for her. She has two little wings made from cosmic materials she gathered thanks to her powers (it's mostly a tribute to Flandre from Touhou). She also hold a staff made of broken shard, with at the the top a galaxy as the head of the staff.

ABILITIES :

Starts with one rank in ultimate

	Passive : Restructuration : Kurai can stack up to 50% CDR.

	Q : Cosmic Ray
Kurai fires a little orb of dark matter that detonates, inflicting magic damage (70/110/150/190/230  +0,6*AP)  upon hitting an enemy or reaching the end of its path (radius of little blast : 90). If the cosmic ray hits a black hole (R), the black hole deals magic damage (100/160/220/280/340 +0,9*AP) in a radius of 150, and the cosmic ray is automatically absorbed if the black hole is able to do so, but a single cosmic ray can only be absorbed once.
Cost : 55 / 65 / 75 / 85 / 95
CD : 8 /7,5 / 7 / 6,5 / 6 
Range : 750

	W : Wormhole
Available only when two black holes are present.
Kurai swaps everything that are within 60 radius of the center of the black holes to the other one, in both ways (enemy heroes and minions, allied heroes and minions and spells absorbed ). The swap deals some magic damage ( 75 / 125 / 175 / 225 / 275 +0,5*AP) to enemies. Cosmic Rays absorbed into black holes, thrown from it, deal 30 % more damage.
Cost : 65 / 75 / 85 / 95 / 105
CD : 25 / 23 / 21 / 19 / 17

	E : Spell devourer / Nebulous aura
Available when at least one black hole is present. 
Kurai decides to briefly unleash the full power of her black holes, causing them to absorb one  enemy spell, that must be a projectile, within 80 radius from the center of the black hole. If a spell is absorbed, spell devourer becomes nebulous aura for the next 6 seconds. 
If a cosmic Ray hits a black hole, it is automatically absorbed and nebulous aura is available. The cooldown of spell devourer is halved.
Cost : 90
CD : 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12  (starts when spell devourer is used, does not wait for the use of nebulous aura)

Nebulous aura : Throw the spell absorbed, from the black hole that did so. With wormhole, Kurai can change the black hole from which she wants to throw the spell.

R 
	Active : Black hole
Only available when Kurai has a dark energy charge ready.
Kurai creates a distortion in the space-time continuum, building a black hole (radius = 70). When appearing the black hole deals magic damage ( 80 / 130 / 180 / 230  + 0,5*AP) to enemies within 100. The black hole is immediatly able to absorb a spell thanks to spell devourer, but it has a 0,3 sec delay before Kurai is able to use Wormhole. Black Hole disappear if kurai is more than 1300 away. Building a black hole at more than 1100 from another black hole will cancel the first one. Only two black holes can be present at the same time.
Cost : 60
CD : 1 sec 

	Passive  : Space-time distortion
Every (10 / 8,5 / 7 / 5,5)  Kurai generates a dark energy charge. She can stack up to 2 dark energy charge at the same time. CDR does influence the rate at which Kurai generates her dark energy charge.

GAMEPLAY :

Kurai is ranged, her basic attacks come from her staff, she throws little shiny stars.
Kurai has been designed as a midlaner, toplaner or support  : she has some crowd control and good harass with a decent mobility.
Laning phase : Kurai has to choose where does she place her black hole. If she chooses to farm, she will place them close to enemy's minions, so her cosmic rays would hits her black hole dealing bonus damage to minions. If she chooses to harass her opponent, she has to place her black holes in an offensive way, closer to her opponent. In teamfight, she can provide nice engages, and good crowd control.

MISCELLANOUS : 
Kurai's enemies would be character coming from the void, such as cho'gath, and especially Malzahar. On the contrary her friend would be Lulu, as lulu is very open minded and able to see things differently. 

Alternative skin for Kurai : Arcade Kurai
Her black hole would be mario green pipes, she would maybe wear a salopettes and throw fireball like mario does.


Thanks for your attention."

I usually have short flings with interns sometimes when I go to the college bars I meet women there. 

I have dated some of the women my own age but in all honesty not only do they look worse on average, but they don't have the fun and vibrance of a younger woman. Plus they view are a lot less interested in casual sex. 

I heard usually when guys get older their tastes change as well, but for me it hasn't.

What have your experiences been?"

Yep.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1y9435/me_28f_with_my_25m_3_month_relationship_just_a/,"

Like the day of our second date before we were exclusive. I found out like two weeks ago. She told him, ""Yeah, you probably shouldn't mention this to her"". She supposedly stayed over because the roads were too bad for her to drive back to Virginia, and we live in PA and his house is about halfway to hers. She stayed in a separate room. So he was hanging out with her (alone), came to take me out to eat, then took me back to my dad's and went back and she was there waiting for him, and spent the night. 

Anyway I kind of just forgot about this, although it sort of bothered me a little, but because I don't want to be THAT GIRL and in general I don't really feel threatened a lot (not to be stuck up but I'm pretty attractive and funny, and can hold my own in situations like that.) So I decided to forget about it.

It only kind of turned into this big thing when we were hanging out the one night after I'd been staying at his place for going on 4 days,  and there's a call at about 7 pm looks at it and goes, ""Oh, I don't recognize that number..."" sort of weirdly, and doesn't answer. 

It was from her parents house in Virginia and he said he didn't know it was from her, but I still think he was lying. I thought it was someone I myself had called earlier in the day (a grad school in Virginia, actually) and when I called and it was HER we were both really confused and I just shoved the phone in his hands and was pretty embarrassed about it. I guess the fact I assumed he had known it was her all along and  he didn't want to talk to her in front of me was an indication he liked her. 

So he told me later he DIDN'T know it was her calling (his iPhone said the call was from Virginia, I mean c'mon?...) and that I am misconstruing the information. I admit this is possible.

He swears up and down he doesn't like this girl and is friends with her boyfriend, but I just have this weird feeling. They talk on the phone (she calls him maybe once or twice a week, and it seems like she talks to him, but her boyfriend doesn't seem to contact him much, if ever) and she visits him. 

When I asked why he is friends with her when he basically makes her sound like an idiot, he had some interesting answers.  Not one to suffer fools lightly (he is actually kind of an asshole about it), I addressed this and he said, ""Oh, she is a good person to be friends with. Her family has good political connections"". Supposedly her family helped decorate Biden's Christmas tree. So, like really connected. 

My boyfriend works in a field where this could be useful.  She is rich (and I am really really poor, and I'll admit this makes me insecure in a whole other way, but I realize she can't help being rich either) and he makes her sound like a little infantilized idiot, but part of me think he kind of gets off on that too, because he likes to take care of me (paying for everything, talking about how he'd be a good provider, offering to buy me a car, etc). Also, she is what he'd want for social climbing, and not me. 

On the other hand, he has left me his phone all day (my phone doesn't work where he lives and my grandma was sick and I wanted to keep in touch with my mom). I'll admit when I used his phone, that while I didn't go through it, I saw all the calls from Katie on his phone. Like, a lot. I've been in his house all day long without him here. He has nothing laying around to incriminate him, although I'll admit I didn't really dig. 

On the other hand, he says he sees ""nothing wrong"" with her staying the night, and I agree that I myself should have no problem being as were weren't exclusive then, but I think it's a little ridiculous to think that at this point it would be fine. He acts as if the same thing to happen tomorrow that it would objectively be totally cool, but he won't do it ""because I don't want him to"". Remember Katie herself mentioned he shouldn't mention it to me. Isn't that just kind of common decency/sense? I wouldn't stay over at a guy's house at this point in our relationship, and I wouldn't make a point to tell him it was a special concession just for him. I would do it because it's generally just not okay. 

Also, he has made a point to disparage her boyfriend Kaleb. He has said he's goofy looking, but ""girls seem into him"". When I asked if they were serious, he said, ""Oh, they've been together years. They're going to get married"". He sounded almost resigned when he said it. 

He also told me that Katie would look up to me, (which pissed me off because it made me sound matronly or something, despite the fact I'm only 3 years older) and that Katie wishes Kaleb were ""more like him"", and that he thinks Katie thinks he would be a ""good influence on Kaleb"". He talked about trying to get Kaleb a job where he worked eventually. 

She added me on Facebook and asked when we would hang out. She told me Mike talks about me all the time to her. There were lots of exclamation points involved. 

I'm supposed to leave to go do an internship abroad (like very far away) for 6 months and so he has accelerated the relationship- he has talked about wanting to get engaged, and how he wants to keep me here instead of going to do the internship by buying me a car and getting me a job where he works. We went to visit a local school because he wants to keep me around (he drove me there and took a day off work, and knew I couldn't help with gas or anything). 

So he is very serious but what is up with this situation? I mean the 3 month thing leading into marriage is weird already but what is up with this girl? I am not the jealous type but I seriously am stumped. Am I being irrational or is there something to that niggling voice in my mind that says he has feelings for her and won't even admit it to himself? Should I proceed with this or is this going to end badly for everyone?

1y9arn,6,2014-02-18,"Long story, short: Can't stand the new manager",manage_this,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y9arn/long_story_short_cant_stand_the_new_manager/,"First, a little background for context...

I am a 26-year-old full-time student at a large university majoring a business field similar to MIS. I went to work for a few years and saved up some money after high school, which explains the age gap between me and the students who spend every night piss-drunk.

I also have a 20-hour/week internship as a Network Operator at a large local company. It's so easy and boring for me, but most of the full-time operators are the kind of people who aren't motivated or intelligent enough to move out into other positions. So, there's a lot of in-fighting and people bad-mouthing each other. The internship pays very well (over $20/hour), so people tell me I'm an idiot when I complain. The problem is that the work is so mind-numbingly boring that it quite literally makes me crazy some days. Plus, the three interns were hired to fill in the weekend so the full-time operators wouldn't have to do it anymore. I was the sharpest of the three interns hired, so I got stuck on the night shift where more discretion is expected. Then, I got stuck on the night shift for an entire year, meaning I have no life because I go to school during the week and work on the weekend. My manager was great, though, and I enjoyed working for him--he was an intelligent, funny guy who knew his job extremely well.

So suddenly, right before Christmas, they called together an emergency meeting to let us know that IT was being reorganized and he was being demoted (never found out exactly why).

Then, after a stressful fall semester where I barely pulled through with my 4.0 (overall 3.84 GPA), I went out of town for three weeks for Christmas to visit my girlfriend who lives 800 miles away (she moved away last spring after she graduated, and now I only see her about once every 2-3 months for a week or two). Right after I left, my &amp;%$#@ landlady/roommate/whatever told me that she thought I was abusing her animals and that I needed to get out by the end of the next rent period (mid-January). Of course, how would she know if I were abusing them anyway? She went out of town every weekend for 3-4 days starting the day I moved in, expecting me to take care of them. She has two giant dogs that live in a 6'x12' kitchen while she's at work for 12 hours/day or while she's gone. Whatever, hated living there anyway--I just did it because it was cheap.

I miraculously, with the help of my sister and friends, found a place to move while I was 800 miles from home. Then, right around Christmas, I got sick with a horrible cough/respiratory infection (which I still have, by the way). I drove home while coughing my lungs up three days early to start the moving process, and I moved by myself right after New Year's (while roommate was out of town, to avoid her and to finish before school started).

The current situation is that I've been to the doctor several times. First, the student health center at my school, then my own doctor when I finally got an appointment. The SHC was useless and the doctor refused to prescribe appropriate medicines because she said the research on the medicine indicated the exact opposite of what it actually said. She told me to wait it out. I finally went to my doctor, who treated me a little better, and eventually sent me to an ENT when the problem didn't go away. The ENT narrowed it down to mycoplasma pneumoniae and has begun treating me for that, and it seems to be helping so far, but I still feel miserable.

Meanwhile, I have approximately 0 free time and 0 time to rest because I'm participating in an intense program at school involving Internal Auditing that helps prepare you for the Certified Internal Auditor exam and offers lots of opportunities for internships and jobs. I'm on track to finish school in December (which is a semester early). I had lots of money saved, but when I didn't work for the first year and a half of school, I spent a significant chunk of it. I still have enough left to survive on savings for about 8 months at the current rate, but I'm anticipating some more previously unforseen costs in the summer.

I've had to take a lot of extra time off in the past month for the Internal Audit program, but I've always made every attempt to schedule and practically build my life around my current job/internship. The old manager was always extremely easy to deal with and very understanding, especially when I had school obligations.
The new manager is interested only in micromanaging and doesn't care about me. She expects me to find someone to fill my shift and acts like it's a huge inconvenience. The problem is that they took away our remote access to company email so I can't communicate with anyone except when I'm in on the weekend. She texts me all the time asking me to fill in and even texts me to complain about things I've done. I just got a 3% raise a couple weeks ago on my yearly evaluation and they rated me very highly, especially on attendance and performance.

At this point, I'm so tired, I've been sick for two months, I have money saved but not enough for the final year of school, and I have lots of opportunities. I want to tell the new manager that I'm tired of her s%$# and that she can find a new b%$#&amp; to fill in on the weekends and see how much fun that is. I get lots of financial aid but it may be cut because of the money from my job. The Internal Audit instructor has asked for a couple of students who really want to work hard all the time to come forward for some certification fast-track opportunities.
I'm seriously considering giving my manager the middle finger and taking up the professor on that opportunity, and just sucking it up and taking out a loan if my money doesn't quite make it to the end.

Sorry, I usually write better than this (I won best essay in an undergrad English class last year), but I just feel frantic, like I need to get it out.

Thanks guys."

Franco Zeffirelli’s sappy 1981 teen romance about obsessive love across the class divide – which was based on Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel and starred a young Brooke Shields – gets a glossy remake with Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the leads. He’s a brooding blue-collar guy from the wrong side of the tracks; she’s a sheltered rich girl who belongs with the country club set. And when they fall passionately in love, her overbearing dad (Bruce Greenwood), still mourning the death of her golden-boy elder brother from cancer, is equally passionate about putting a stop to the relationship. The ensuing love-conquers-all narrative bears as much resemblance to real life as The Lego Movie, but for all its blandness, Endless Love will be pure catnip for its target audience of teen girls.

Although Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) are members of the same Atlanta graduating class, it seems that she’s spent the past four years so buried in her studies that she never looked up and saw the handsomest hunk in her high school. But he’s had his eye on her – and when he’s parking cars at a posh country club, he finally attracts her attention. Under the watchful eye of her cardiologist father, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood), she’s headed for Brown University to study medicine and is scheduled to spend the summer working on an internship with a high-profile Georgia surgeon.  Although her mom, Anne (Joely Richardson), and brother, Keith (Rhys Wakefield), have gone through their mourning period, her dad is still grieving over his older son’s death from cancer – and he’s furious when lonely Jade ditches the internship and invites David to join them at the family’s magnificent lakeside summer home. The friction between the ardent working-class suitor and upper middle-class protective dad is palpable, presumably because David’s widower dad (Robert Patrick) is an auto mechanic and David has blemish in his rebellious past.

Scripted by Joshua Safran (TV’s “Gossip Girl”) and director Shana Feste (“The Greatest,” “Country Strong”), it’s shamelessly clichéd and lamely contrived, discarding the tragic, pivotal elements of pyromania, prison and political activism that were so prevalent in Scott Spenser’s 1979 best-selling novel.  As a result, Hugh’s hostility and subsequent character arc seem more memorable than the titular angst suffered by the infatuated adolescents. Or perhaps it’s because Bruce Greenwood is a more accomplished actor than either Alex Pettyfer (“Magic Mike”) or Gabriella Wilde (“The Three Musketeers”). Which leads one to wonder why Feste cast two, bland 24 year-old Brits as prototypical American teens.

On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Endless Love” is a tepid 3, a maudlin melodrama not worth revisiting. Nicholas Sparks didn’t write the screenplay for Endless Love. Assuming as much is an easy mistake, though. The bestselling author has cornered the market on likeminded, puppy-dog love letters scribbled on the pink pages of pre-teenage girls’ diaries, and those who devour Sparks’ digestible novels should find plenty to appreciate on screen here. 

The rest of us might feel a distinct sense of déjà vu, for assorted reasons. Some will recognize Endless Love from the 1981 version of the story, a steamy take starring Brooke Shields, Martin Hewitt and a young Tom Cruise and James Spader. Others might have read the source material, Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel that has sold more than 2 million copies since first being released. 

Then there’s the simple fact that Endless Love consistently treads down familiar paths that are explored daily by daytime soap operas on each major television network. You have seen this material done countless times before, just by different, equally pretty people. 

Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) has supermodel-worthy looks, comes from a wealthy family, but sacrificed her high school years to study, ensuring a fast-track to Brown where she’ll conquer the pre-med program. Because the cool girls in her class won’t talk to her at graduation, though, Jade feels sad, and wonders if she just wasted the best years of her life. 

Enter David (Alex Pettyfer), the ridiculously handsome “outcast” who must be a rebel because he works at his father’s garage, has a wisecracking African-American best friend (Dayo Okeniyi), and is hellbent on showing Jade the greatest summer of her life… before she has to shoulder the burden of reality and venture off to the Ivy League college of her choosing. 

Say Anything? More like, “We’ve said all of this, over and over again, in earlier films.” You can practically hear John Mahoney’s voice when Bruce Greenwood begins exerting his influence over the film as Jade’s disapproving father, Hugh Butterfield. “Leave her alone, David,” Hugh pleads. “She has a bright future. If you actually love her, you’ll let her go on to med school and live the life she deserves.” 

How do you think that scenario is going to play out between these lovers from opposite sides of the tracks? 

Endless Love isn’t painful. It’s actually sweet in spots. Writer-director Shana Feste bathes her protagonists in that soft, candlelit glow reserved for the covers of tawdry romance novels, and sets her action to a tender acoustic soundtrack that usually sets the mood at your neighborhood Starbucks. Love finds the right cast members for the stereotypical roles that have to be filled, and the performances are above average. Wilde makes Jade tentative, shy and gawky, in a way pretty girls rarely understand. Pettyfer is borderline charismatic, as if he’s slowly realizing how to be comfortable in front of the camera. And Greenwood gives a legitimately invested turn as the sinister, overprotective father trying to do what’s best for his daughter (even though a subplot about one of Mr. Butterfield’s devious secrets goes absolutely nowhere). 

Watching Endless Love, it became clear that every generation deserves its own Say Anything, it’s own Some Kind of Wonderful. These star-crossed-lovers stories have been around for an eternity, and they’ll continue to be told by warm-hearted filmmakers for decades to come. Every generation, however, isn’t lucky enough to have its own John Hughes, or its own Cameron Crowe, and Endless Love lacks the edge and humor that makes the finest of this genre stand apart from the pack. I’m not going to look down on you if you need to see Endless Love this weekend. Just make me a promise that when you come home from it, you’ll also seek out recent movies like The Spectacular Now or 500 Days (of Summer), because they tell the same sort of story, but better. "

I'm not knocking any of those people/situations, I just know when I was looking for jobs, I found all of those things to be very, very frustrating.

The tl;dr of the job is we're looking for a paid intern (college student, recent college graduate, self-taught PHP developer that dropped out of high school - school status doesn't really matter) with PHP development experience to work either part-time or full-time in our office in Richardson. 

I'm one of the founders of Creatuity. We're a small (~25 employees) eCommerce development agency here in Richardson. Normally our HR team handles posting jobs, however, this position will be someone that I delegate to and work with quite a bit myself on some of our more interesting internal projects, so I have been trying to help locate some good candidates.

We have a pretty cool office and we focus just as much on our company culture and fun as we do on our work. It's a great environment and opportunity for someone who has taught themselves PHP but hasn't worked in a PHP position before so they're having a hard time getting their foot in the door (I was in that exact situation myself, so I know how it goes). Successful interns are generally offered full-time, permanent positions if they prove to be a good fit for the job and our company culture. 

Our hiring process is a bit of a gauntlet (we ask a lot of questions) because we really do invest in the people we hire, so we're looking for someone that's passionate and whose passion shows through in the entire application process. 

If you're interested, view the specifics and apply at http://creatuity.theresumator.com/apply/0jHJdy/PHP-ECommerce-Development-Intern.html - we're starting interviews this week, so apply ASAP."

The network consists of a pfsense box that does the firewall/routing. There is a windows 2008 server up that does DHCP and also another windows file server up. There are less than 30 computers. On an average day there are about 10-15 people on the network at a time. There are also 7 managed cisco switches. THere are six 2950s and one 4912? switch. Also 5 1200 series cisco access points.

The tasks I have are to:

* **Create network documentation for the network.** There is little to no documentation right now so I need to create a list of devices, IPs, network diagrams, protocols etc.

* **Configure a SNMP + TFTP + syslog server.** Right now I'm planning on setting up an Ubuntu VM to run on one of the servers. I will then have all of the devices log to this.

* I have downloaded spiceworks but I'm not really sure exactly how this would be beneficial. I see you can do network scans but I don't know if it will generate information I need.

I would like any opinions or tips on what I am trying to do. As for running SNMP on linux, are there any great SNMP programs to install or any other tools/programs that could help me accomplish these tasks?"

I have the option to fly or drive, but this seems like a great opportunity to take a ride. I have a limited amount of time to make this trip, as it is nested between school letting out and my internship starting. 
What are some tips for making this trip?

Pros:
I've been riding for a couple years now, and am intimate with my bike enough for basic repairs.
I have enough money saved for repairs, food, and housing.
I get paid for every mile. At 40 miles to a $3.50 gallon, it works out a couple thousand dollars.

Cons:
My bike is an old whore. It's had an illustrious 20 years spent satisfying three or four owners.
It's been dropped. The crankcase is mostly jb weld right now.
It has no fairings and a pretty aggressive riding triangle.
I cannot afford to break down in bumfuck Utah."

My degree requires that I do a 5 week internship. I have been looking hard and most of my efforts have been fruitless. That was until today. I went to an interview and the teacher made a mention of PC and Intel CPUs. Then I passingly said ""Oh sorry, I am not that familiar with Intel because I own an AMD CPU"". He looked at me with confusion and asked me what I meant. That is where I explained that I built my own PC and it was a pure AMD build; AMD video cards, CPU, motherboard, etc.

I don't think he knew much about computers outside of using one but his eyes lit up and was intrigued by what I explained to him. From what I gather, by explaining to him how I build and put together my own PCs, it demonstrated to him that I was a hands-on type of guy and could help accomplish his projects. I mean, I built a computer...that must be a feat on its own, right? We had had a phone interview earlier prior to the in-person interview and he asked me about how familiar I was with computers and technology. I guess me building my own computer demonstrated that I qualified and met his credentials. 

Two minutes after our PC-building conversation, he told me that the position was mine.

Honestly, to others, I think the fact that you can successfully put together a PC in this day and age should be a skill that you could put on a resume. Just in the proper terms.

Cheers."

I was taken in the office by my boss (sole IT guy of small office) and the HR woman and basically told I was fired.  I was told because I wasn't someone that could work independently, and I should have asked more questions.   Also they said they were looking for someone with more experience.

I recently received a contract opportunity for $20/hr for 3 months (ave. starting for my major is $55k per year). I would be getting paid through the recruitment company and would only have a ""technician"" title associated with my job, even though from the job description its clearly engineering work. Anyways, I was thinking of taking it for now, while I look for more permanent things. I spoke to the recruiter who hooked me up with this opportunity to accept the offer, but after that, he actually said, ""don't be insulted, but it looks like on your resume that the last internship you got was through your daddy"" (I interned as an engineer for a Fortune 500 company btw not through my ""daddy""). Unrelatedly, he further proceeded to tell me how awesome of jobs he helped get his kids jobs and how successful they are now. All b.s. that as a job searcher I don't really care about. I asked him why my job title doesn't include engineer, and his response was that the company didn't want to stamp that on there since they are only willing to pay $20/hr (obviously after this guy gets his fat cut of my earnings). Anyways, it felt like during that whole conversation, he tried to devalue my degree and experience to try to sell me this temporary, under-paid opportunity.

1yb8kr,4,2014-02-18,Graduating with BS in Statistics in May and would greatly appreciate some career advice,The_Tapatio_Man,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1yb8kr/graduating_with_bs_in_statistics_in_may_and_would/,"I am graduating from my University with a BS in Statistics this May, and I am just looking for some career advice from anyone willing to offer some insight. Any and all words of wisdom are greatly appreciated.

Here is my current situation. I am studying for exam 1/P to try and open up some doors down the actuarial pathway, but I know that I will have to take, and most importantly pass, about 3 exams before I will be able to get an entry level position. The studying for the Probability exam is going well, and I plan on passing the exam this March. However, I understand this process of breaking into the field may take a while since I don't have any internships or exams at the moment, I am unsure how this plan will play out.

So, given the amount of time it may take me to break into the EL actuarial field, which is fine, I was considering trying to get a job in industry, but I don't exactly know what the ""industry"" is. Are these just Analyst jobs for ""Company A"" or something along those lines? I have had to work between 25-40 hours a week my entire college career, so working an unpaid internship wasn't really an option for me, so I am lacking in that experience category. However, I have been a TA for upper division stats classes as well as Calc I and II, for the past 1.5 - 2 years, so that might benefit me a bit.

What I feel the job in ""industry"" might provide me is the insight to see whether or not I really want to go to grad school or not. I know that I genuinely enjoy my Statistics classes and programming. The math gets a little dry for me at times, but I am able to get it done and I get that sense of accomplishment after completing a proof. This is my last semester, and I am taking Real Analysis to boost my math credentials up for my grad school apps, since I saw a lot of them recommended having taken that. My overall GPA is 3.15, Major GPA is 3.35, and my GPA the last two years is 3.44. Thought I would throw that in there if it may help to show where I stand.

Basically, I am really willing to go into whatever direction hires me first. Grad school would be great, but I am unsure if I will be able to get into a good program. I really enjoy programming, I've completed Codecademy's Javascript and Python tracks, as well as taken classes which heavily utilize R and SAS. I plan on taking Courseras course on Machine Learning in March, cause to be honest it sounds fascinating. Also, besides R and SAS, would you recommend studying any particular language? I really enjoy Python personally, but recommendations are greatly appreciated. 

I live in the SF Bay Area, does anyone know of how job prospects out here are? I know they're supposed to be good with Silicon Valley south of me, but I 'm pretty certain you need at least a masters to work for companies like Google, and I don't know if I am ""Google Caliber"" if that makes sense.

Anyways, I would greatly appreciate all of your advice, feedback, and/or success stories. Thank you so much everyone!

1ybacf,321,2014-02-18,How I hired a graphic designer,gd2182014,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1ybacf/how_i_hired_a_graphic_designer/,"So, I'm a long time lurker, and I thought it would be great to share some insight on how I hired a graphic designer. I work for a very small firm that was expanding and we decided to hire another designer. Here are some of my thoughts, which might help others land a job.

**THE RESUME**

* **Design the resume a little but not overboard**. When I mean ""a little,"" I mean it better be more impressive than a standard Microsoft Word document with Times New Roman/Calibri font. However, at the same, do not go overboard with so many infographics, large body of text that's slanted, or bubbles that makes it overly complicated to read and pinpoint.
* **Make the contact information (including the portfolio link) visible and easy to find**. I'm surprised I have to emphasize this, but it's true, I've seen a bunch of resumes where it was hard to find the portfolio link. (ex: hiding a portfolio link in a QR code is not the preferred way to go.)
* **Always include a portfolio link.** This is a follow up to the above bullet. This is mandatory in order to be considered. Or at the very least, somehow include a sample pdf with the resume. A portfolio link is the preferred choice though.
* **Proper grammar/spelling**. This is self explanatory and surprisingly necessary to say.
* **Work experience = BRAG HERE**. This should be the meat and potatoes of the resume. Do not skimp on this. Do not make it a one-liner. I'm very impressed with work experience, so please brag here a LOT.
* **Pay attention to details.** It's one thing to say ""I'm detailed oriented"" and another thing to prove it. What I mean by this is, I will notice things like misalignment, bad font combinations, bad color combinations, etc. This sends a bad first impression, so please pay attention to details!
* **Do not overly complicate your resume.** I've seen resumes with just too much going on to the point that the eye doesn't know which way to read or where to go. I recommend choosing a smart layout that clearly demonstrates all of the candidate's assets.
* **I get it, you know the Adobe Suite, but saying you know the Suite shouldn't take up majority of the resume.** Guess what? Basically everybody who applies for a graphic designer position knows the Adobe Suite. It won't make somebody stand out, so please don't make it the highlight of the resume. 
* **Add a little personality to your resume.** This part, I'm just speaking from a friend's personal experience. She wrote on her resume in the ""interest"" section that she loves going to TV show tapings. She has told me that every single interview she has ever been on, people like to ask her about it. Personally, from looking at so many resumes, a little bit of personality cannot hurt and it's fun to see some differences between resumes.
* **Obviously, include things like anything AIGA-related, awards, and your education.** Most people include this, so it's a pretty moot point.
* **Always include a cover letter, regardless if it's asked or not.** I personally feel a cover letter gives an additional insight on the person. It does not need to be long, but please include one. I personally prefer something that is more than 2 paragraphs but less than 1 page.

**THE PORTFOLIO** - Here are the questions I am asking myself while looking at a candidate's portfolio

* **Is there a variety of workload that shows he/she has mastered the necessary skills?** What I mean by this is, I look at the pieces and I scan to see if he/she has mastered the basic skills. How are he/she's typography skills? Does this person have any working experience in the required field (eg: web/print) and has he/she worked for any clients? Are there any red flags? How does this person use color to convey thought? How about alignments? Also, quality is always more important than quantity.

* **What was this person's thought process?** What parts did he/she do? I love reading blurbs instead of seeing a still image and I'm supposed to guess what that person did. I also love seeing concepts from inception to completion.

* **What was the most creative piece and why?** Obviously, this is very subjective, but it is me asking ""What stood out in this person's portfolio?"" It's usually this piece that I use as a reference when comparing to other portfolios. I am not only looking for someone who can demonstrate the required skills, but I am looking for someone who can demonstrate creativity.   

**THE INTERVIEW**- so, now what?

* **Dress to impress**- This may or may not mean come in a suit, it really depends on where you're interviewing. Regardless of the work environment, I strongly recommend to dress to impress (eg: don't come in jeans!) 
* **Have a strong handshake**- Have a good firm grip and make eye contact when you greet your interviewer. 
* **Talk with confidence**- I know it's a nervous process, but the more confident people definitely stand out in a good way.
* **Have a predetermined set of examples that you can draw on.**- This definitely helps when answering the questions. Common questions that interviewers like to ask are 

1. Talk about a time when you had to complete a project under a short deadline
1. Tell me about a time when you had little guidance and needed to complete a project
1. Tell me about your greatest strengths/weaknesses
1. Tell me about a time when you had to take a leadership position in order to accomplish a task
1. Tell me about at time when things didn't go as expected and how did you react
1. Walk me through your portfolio. Tell me about this project, what your specific role was on it, why you approached it this way, what was the outcome of it, what feedback did the client give, etc.
 
* **Show some enthusiasm and knowledge about the company**- It's extremely impressive if the candidate does his/her research. I'm fairly confident that's how I got hired before (I read online that XYZ company did a big yearly event for the community which coincided with my internship; my interviewer was very impressed I knew and asked questions about it.)
* **Always ask questions**- Everyone should always asks questions at the end of an interview, preferably ones that are company specific. Here are some generically good questions to ask: ""What do you like the least/most about working here?"" or ""How is the company culture like?"" or ""What would my day to day schedule be like?"" At the very least, I think the best question at the end to ask is ""Do you have a business card so I can contact you if I have more questions?"" Being able to reach the interviewer is VERY important so he/she can write the Thank You Letter.

**FOLLOW UP**

* **Always write a Thank You Letter within the same day of the interview**- It does not need to be super long, but it does need to be sent. Preferably by *e-mail* and within the same day of the interview. I emphasize e-mail because I've talked to a friend before who interviewed a candidate and my friend was very disappointed that he/she did not get a Thank You letter. My friend ended up getting the Thank You Letter via post mail many days later, and somewhat too late. 
* **If about a week has past by, do not be afraid to follow up.** Because it happens so rarely, it's impressive when people follow up. Do not be afraid to follow up. 

**OTHER**

* **The importance of networking**- People who are referred have a much higher probability of getting into the interview stage. Even if it's a friend who knows a friend, do NOT be afraid to ask. (After all, the worse that could happen is so-and-so says no)
* **The impressiveness of recommendations**- I actually had people come with recommendation letters. I enjoyed receiving these and considered it a great bonus.
* **Apply early**- For a small company, I got an overwhelming large supply of resumes. I don't think it's normal for every company to shift through every single resume so applying early is a very good bonus to get towards the top of the pile."

The second interview was with the programmer who would be my mentor. The tone of it was ""let me break it to ya: this is basically updating the help document and taking screenshots over and over again and playing around with the software"". I wouldn't even be taking a look at a line of code. This did deflate my interest, and if I weren't scared of not having any experience prior to graduation (I haven't done any internships yet) I would've turned it down without a second thought. I didn't know how to get it across that I would really like to have the job but only because of my desperation without it counting against me though.

What are this subreddit's thoughts on all this? I tried to play it cool and when the second interviewer asked if I was still interested, I said ""I'll think about it"" instead of ""well, I'll take anything you've got"".

1ybfnk,9,2014-02-19,"Should I go for REUs, industry R&amp;D internships, or what else?",SRSSwoleAcceptance,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ybfnk/should_i_go_for_reus_industry_rd_internships_or/,"I have a lot of research experience so far, and for this summer I'd like to do something research related as well.

 - REU is good if I want to go on to grad school for PhD, especially because it can build a connection with a professor. If I want to get an industry R&amp;D job after graduation, though, would companies look down on me for having done only academic research and not industrial work?

 - Industry R&amp;D should still be alright if I want to go on to grad school, as I can ask for recommendations from the boss who knows well about my capacity to research. Obviously it has less connections with academia. It also might be a good idea to have an industry internship if I change my mind and decide not to go to grad school.

 - What other research jobs can I apply to? I heard through the grapevine that REUs are for people with less research experiences, and people with more should go for something more advanced (I don't know if this claim is true or not, total number of people saying this was 1). I've never done what's officially called an REU, but I've done paid research programs at school during summer and school year that are basically like REUs.

Thanks, y'all!"

[Have you tried getting on Face Off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfiyn6j?context=5)|JUST SENT THEM AN EMAIL TODAY!!!
[So when you are done does she just wash away 3 hours of work? Or do you at least go outside and scare a few people first.  How easy does it come off and are there any special things you have to do to get it off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfiyvhe?context=5)|Since it was done at night she did take it off once she got home, but we did have a chance to show it off a little. But it took 3 hours so apply and 2 hours to take off.  and something like this you would want to use conditioner to take off most of it by letting it sit and break down the products. and you would want to keep 99% alcohol on hand as well and that will be a lifesaver. 
[By break down the products, do you mean you let everything get soft and wipe it away? Or do you save pieces like the chin/cheeks to reuse? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfj4dwm?context=5)|What I mean by break down, is that conditioner removes natural oils from your hair when you use it. So when your using it to remove your makeup it's doing the same thing. You would be able to wipe it off after letting it sit for awhile. Depending on the type of prosthetic you would be able to keep it but not all of them are capable of keeping.
[Could you make a block of wood look like a human?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfiz1wt?context=5)|Im not sure, i should give it a try!

[What do you do to get the prostheses to attach?  My wife had trouble getting a bald cap and some sort of modeling wax to stick for a Darth Vader Halloween costume.  Any tips?  For the graduating project could you pick anything?  How did you come up with the creepy wooden doll idea?  Did you have a time limit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfiyj4o?context=5)|To get the prosthetics to attatch you would want to use a cosmetic grade glue. Prosade would be key. you would want to apply it to the surface you are wanting to connect it to and also the prosthetic. once you let both dry you would then connect the two together and they will stick to your skin. most cosmetic glues have to be sticky to work and last.  We had the duration of the class to do it but for the final we will have from 3pm to 8pm when the professional photoshoot starts!   
 |For the graduation piece we were told to pick anything form a website so when i went on i thought everything was amazing but i wanted to take the doll in a different direction and i am so glad that i did!

[For your final do they take into considerating other things besides just how it looks? Will they question you on, say, the particular products you used and why, because of how that particular product might last under bright lights maybe? I might think the way it looks is not all that matters, because it has to last, in some cases it might have to be water proof, or it might have to withstand wind or something else (water spray perhaps\). But would those kinds of considerations come into play in your final? I might think not every contingency but maybe the obvious ones? Or does that come later on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfizi2q?context=5)|The final is all based on the look and the techniques we used to accomplish it. we do have to be able to do a professional photoshoot tho. and for it lasting we used a pax paint with a paint mixed with glue so it is completely water proof and will last for hours.

[My daughter is very very interested in SFX makeup, and I'm going to be purchasing her some things and helping her to learn using any tutorials I can find on the internet.  I'd love to know if there are any resources or classes you can think of that are open to younger (think middle-high school age\) students?  Or do most SFX classes and workshops require that the student is 18+?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfj9w3v?context=5)|Most special effects classes require that you have your beauty 101 course.

 |@stephhanie_marie.
[How did you learn your skill? How can I go onto do this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfj7gz7?context=5)|I actually was really into art and painting I college and when I went into makeup it really helped to have an artist background.
 |And how you get into it is easy. Find a school and take a beauty 101 course to become a certified/ licensed artist and then decided if special effects is for you. But make sure you really research your school, just because something cost more and the products are top of the line it may not be the best school! Look at portfolios of the teachers, and see the outcome of all the students.
[How bad are most of the products for your skin? Does it cause break outs and clogged pores and such because there is so many layers of stuff? Honestly just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfj7wd8?context=5)|I would say the stuff we use for special effects makeup is not the best for your skin, we use products that dry it skin like alcohol paints. And cosmetic grade glue. So they all clog pores and cause breakouts. Your would really just have to moisturizers and full clean skin after to get everything off.
[I'm graduating this May with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and want to go to a college in my hometown for SFX makeup next year.

Also find some books that will helpfull to read and use as a reference. It would be hard to stay to start building your kit because you have no idea what your going to need or where to find it all. 
[Also, would you say being or going to L.A. would be advantageous? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfjg4b0?context=5)|I would say this, you  can be a makeup artist anywhere, and you have to decide where you want to end up living, going to a school on la will get you job in la, if you stay in your state it will be easier to get you jobs there. In the end it all depends on what your goal is. Sure going to school out here would be great because it is a city where you have a lot of television and film going on. But it depends if you want fashion, then New York would be the place to go. I hope this helps! Basically decided where you want to live in the long run and go there!

[The before picture shows your model with incredible skin. what would you do for someone who didn't have such easy skin to work with/active acne?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yb7sc/iam_the_makeup_artist_who_did_the_wooden_makeup/cfjafir?context=5)|If you are  working with a prosthetic  it doesn't matter the type of skin your working with.

Once  I did about 6 layers of the darkest color I used the lightest and dry brushes it to get the detail. Everything else was hand painted all the detail!

This is very similar to the recent 'ELI5' post concerning the bay area but I have a few more questions that didn't get answered. Some quick notes would be a lot of help, thanks in advance.

I am a graphic design student in the midwest who recently accepted an internship at a successful SF startup. I have family in San Mateo and Pacific Heights and I myself grew up in the Chicago area. Here are my fears for this coming summer and beyond:

The odd resentment of ""techies""- Quite a few posts on various subreddits imply that there is a general dislike of transplants in the silicon valley/startup business. That is exactly what I am. Where does this feeling come from? I understand the fear of gentrification of various historic neighborhoods, but is that mindset generally accepted by everyone or am I just seeing some more outspoken folks here on reddit?

Safe places to live- I am a pretty serious mountain biker and lived in British Columbia and Colorado for a couple summers to pursue that hobby. Obviously I want to live somewhere where I can drive out and be on a trail relatively quickly. On paper and after some preliminary research the East Bay and more specifically Oakland seems like it would be a great fit for me. However with the recent videos of sideshows and dangers I am a bit skeptical. I grew up in the Chicago area and while I won't pretend I ever experienced any of the south side gang violence, I am used to seeing multiple shootings on the news every morning and I know how to avoid bad neighborhoods. Are there enough safe neighborhoods in Oakland to make this work? I want to balance proximity to nature and the ability to have a car with city convenience to be able to meet up with friends and walk to some bars. Any other suggestions on a good place to live? My work will be in downtown SF.

Any help or opinions would be greatly appreciated!"

All the main players are back from the first film, simply titled Thor. Directed this time by Alan Taylor who is best known for directing some of the most popular television series on the small screen. Taylor has recently been sharpening his director’s swords on the hugely popular HBO fantasy Game of Thrones. With this type of pedigree the chap who is better known for television projects must have been seen as being perfect for the second Thor feature.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Chris Hemsworth is back as the blonde-locked demigod who has a romantic interest in Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster. Considering that this is the 30 year-old actor’s third outing as the son of Odin and brother of Loki, it isn’t too surprising that the role fits Hemsworth like a well worn, but tight, glove. As equally at home in his role as Loki, the untrustworthy and grandiose trickster who longs for his own throne, is Tom Hiddleston. The 33 year-old actor is perhaps the most qualified actor to play opposite Hemsworth as the two close and quarreling siblings. Although, Loki is, as Thor points out in The Avengers, adopted.

Equally impressive is Stellan Skarsgård who reprises his role as Erik Selvig friend and mentor to Jane and unwilling host to Loki, in his head, throughout most of The Avengers. This brilliant actor is equally at home in his character’s skin, again, because he also has played Selvig three times now in three different films. In Thor, Skarsgård was protector of Jane and reluctant friend to the Hammer swinging Asgard. With the news that there will be, at least, one if not two more Thor films in the offing, no doubt Stellan will be back and continue to impress with his skills as an actor.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online In Thor: The Dark World, which is dark, but not too much so; after Odin recites the tale of the dark elves, the audience is brought to “present day” and Thor is sorting out the nine realms and Loki is cooling his villainous heels in Asgardian dungeons. Thor is missing his human love interest and decides to pay her a very overdue visit. Meanwhile, back at Earth, Foster is attempting to move on having pretty much given up on the Demigod ever returning. After being interrupted on a date by her intern Darcy Lewis, played with kooky capability by Kat Dennings who tells her that something odd is happening and that Jane really should check it out; things move to a deserted warehouse in London.

While discovering an anomaly inside the warehouse, Foster stumbles over an artifact thought hidden since the defeat of the Dark Elf Malekith and it invades her body. Thor then turns up and after a short, and amusing, reunion the artifact which is known as Aether has taken over Jane’s system and apart from making her dangerous to others, she herself is in danger. After British police try, somewhat ham-handedly, to arrest Jane for trespassing, Thor takes Foster to Asgard to have her cured if possible.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film does an adequate job of recreating the Asgardian verse and the only disappointing thing about the film is the loss of Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano who plays Hogun, one of Thor’s band of Asgard colleagues who join him anytime battle is due to commence. At the start of the film, when Thor is sorting out Vanaheim and after defeating the rebellious natives, Hogan is allowed to stay behind to help clean things up. This more than capable actor, who is best known for his role in the Takashi Miike cult classic Ichi the Killer, has not had too much to do in either Thor movie, but, it is hoped that this creative genius will eventually play a larger role in future films.

The obligatory Stan Lee cameo is present, as in all Marvel films, this time as an asylum inmate with Erik Selvig who is teaching the assorted “crazies” in a common room. After the lesson, Lee asks for his shoe back, which Erik is using as a teaching aid. The film does have many small touches of humor, some more slapstick in nature; as when Malekith and Thor hit the roof and side of a glass topped building but even this touch is deft and not done in a “Three Stooges” sort of way.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The graphics in the film amaze and do not lose a thing by being watched on a smaller screen. The FX are just as brilliant and the battles are impressive. The acting is without a doubt top notch. In a film where “smaller” roles are filled by acting royalty, i.e. Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo – who may not class as royalty exactly, but does have an impressive pedigree – as Frigga, there can be no question as to delivery. Christopher Eccleston as Malekith is evilly brilliant and the award winning Idris Elba as the Asgard Sentry Guardian Heimdall is just as impressive in the second outing in the world of Thor as the first.

It would take too long and be ultimately boring to mention all the cast who adroitly make their characters come to life. Suffice to say the script combined with skilfull helmsmanship from Taylor as well as actors who all bring something to the party, Thor: The Dark World is a brilliant sequel to the first Asgard tale of a Demigod who fell in love with an earth woman and stayed on to become the planet’s defender. In this second tale, the film may be dark, but, not too dark. If the other sequels can maintain this quality the continuing story of Thor and his fellow Asgardians will be a special treat each and every time they appear. Available for streaming now and for sale from February 25, this is a real 5 star out of 5 film that in collector’s speak, “is a keeper.” Don’t forget to keep an eye out for another cameo of a miliary sort.

* **[Click Here to Watch Full Movie Online HD](http://w.atch.me/FMD0q0)**


Franco Zeffirelli’s sappy 1981 teen romance about obsessive love across the class divide – which was based on Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel and starred a young Brooke Shields – gets a glossy remake with Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the leads. He’s a brooding blue-collar guy from the wrong side of the tracks; she’s a sheltered rich girl who belongs with the country club set. And when they fall passionately in love, her overbearing dad (Bruce Greenwood), still mourning the death of her golden-boy elder brother from cancer, is equally passionate about putting a stop to the relationship. The ensuing love-conquers-all narrative bears as much resemblance to real life as The Lego Movie, but for all its blandness, Endless Love will be pure catnip for its target audience of teen girls.

Although Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) are members of the same Atlanta graduating class, it seems that she’s spent the past four years so buried in her studies that she never looked up and saw the handsomest hunk in her high school. But he’s had his eye on her – and when he’s parking cars at a posh country club, he finally attracts her attention. Under the watchful eye of her cardiologist father, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood), she’s headed for Brown University to study medicine and is scheduled to spend the summer working on an internship with a high-profile Georgia surgeon.  Although her mom, Anne (Joely Richardson), and brother, Keith (Rhys Wakefield), have gone through their mourning period, her dad is still grieving over his older son’s death from cancer – and he’s furious when lonely Jade ditches the internship and invites David to join them at the family’s magnificent lakeside summer home. The friction between the ardent working-class suitor and upper middle-class protective dad is palpable, presumably because David’s widower dad (Robert Patrick) is an auto mechanic and David has blemish in his rebellious past.

Scripted by Joshua Safran (TV’s “Gossip Girl”) and director Shana Feste (“The Greatest,” “Country Strong”), it’s shamelessly clichéd and lamely contrived, discarding the tragic, pivotal elements of pyromania, prison and political activism that were so prevalent in Scott Spenser’s 1979 best-selling novel.  As a result, Hugh’s hostility and subsequent character arc seem more memorable than the titular angst suffered by the infatuated adolescents. Or perhaps it’s because Bruce Greenwood is a more accomplished actor than either Alex Pettyfer (“Magic Mike”) or Gabriella Wilde (“The Three Musketeers”). Which leads one to wonder why Feste cast two, bland 24 year-old Brits as prototypical American teens.

On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Endless Love” is a tepid 3, a maudlin melodrama not worth revisiting. Nicholas Sparks didn’t write the screenplay for Endless Love. Assuming as much is an easy mistake, though. The bestselling author has cornered the market on likeminded, puppy-dog love letters scribbled on the pink pages of pre-teenage girls’ diaries, and those who devour Sparks’ digestible novels should find plenty to appreciate on screen here. 

The rest of us might feel a distinct sense of déjà vu, for assorted reasons. Some will recognize Endless Love from the 1981 version of the story, a steamy take starring Brooke Shields, Martin Hewitt and a young Tom Cruise and James Spader. Others might have read the source material, Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel that has sold more than 2 million copies since first being released. 

Then there’s the simple fact that Endless Love consistently treads down familiar paths that are explored daily by daytime soap operas on each major television network. You have seen this material done countless times before, just by different, equally pretty people. 

Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) has supermodel-worthy looks, comes from a wealthy family, but sacrificed her high school years to study, ensuring a fast-track to Brown where she’ll conquer the pre-med program. Because the cool girls in her class won’t talk to her at graduation, though, Jade feels sad, and wonders if she just wasted the best years of her life. 

Enter David (Alex Pettyfer), the ridiculously handsome “outcast” who must be a rebel because he works at his father’s garage, has a wisecracking African-American best friend (Dayo Okeniyi), and is hellbent on showing Jade the greatest summer of her life… before she has to shoulder the burden of reality and venture off to the Ivy League college of her choosing. 

Say Anything? More like, “We’ve said all of this, over and over again, in earlier films.” You can practically hear John Mahoney’s voice when Bruce Greenwood begins exerting his influence over the film as Jade’s disapproving father, Hugh Butterfield. “Leave her alone, David,” Hugh pleads. “She has a bright future. If you actually love her, you’ll let her go on to med school and live the life she deserves.” 

How do you think that scenario is going to play out between these lovers from opposite sides of the tracks? 

Endless Love isn’t painful. It’s actually sweet in spots. Writer-director Shana Feste bathes her protagonists in that soft, candlelit glow reserved for the covers of tawdry romance novels, and sets her action to a tender acoustic soundtrack that usually sets the mood at your neighborhood Starbucks. Love finds the right cast members for the stereotypical roles that have to be filled, and the performances are above average. Wilde makes Jade tentative, shy and gawky, in a way pretty girls rarely understand. Pettyfer is borderline charismatic, as if he’s slowly realizing how to be comfortable in front of the camera. And Greenwood gives a legitimately invested turn as the sinister, overprotective father trying to do what’s best for his daughter (even though a subplot about one of Mr. Butterfield’s devious secrets goes absolutely nowhere). 

Watching Endless Love, it became clear that every generation deserves its own Say Anything, it’s own Some Kind of Wonderful. These star-crossed-lovers stories have been around for an eternity, and they’ll continue to be told by warm-hearted filmmakers for decades to come. Every generation, however, isn’t lucky enough to have its own John Hughes, or its own Cameron Crowe, and Endless Love lacks the edge and humor that makes the finest of this genre stand apart from the pack. I’m not going to look down on you if you need to see Endless Love this weekend. Just make me a promise that when you come home from it, you’ll also seek out recent movies like The Spectacular Now or 500 Days (of Summer), because they tell the same sort of story, but better. "
1ycdo5,4,2014-02-19,ERP Internship: mapping out the administrive system and making sure the implementation goes well,sentinusdeus,ERP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ERP/comments/1ycdo5/erp_internship_mapping_out_the_administrive/,"Hi there Reddit!

I just started an internship in as small company which has started with the implementation of a new ERP system. They are now in the transition phase and are slowly implementing all the different tasks and software into this new ERP system. It's my task to entirely map out the company's administrative system and make sure the implementation will be successful.

My knowledge of ERP systems is quite small (had a course on SAP/ERP and Business Processes, but it's been 3 years ago). Where do I start? I've looked at a few books, this sub and of course wikipedia. Are there any books you can recommend or online courses I could follow?(preferably cheap/free) All the information and advice is welcome."
1ycflt,41,2014-02-19,"New career, already frustrated",mythrowaway_it,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1ycflt/new_career_already_frustrated/,"So, this is a throwaway account - uncouth I know.  But I am hoping this will garner some good advice from some seasoned IT pros.  I just started my career as a Network Administrator at a fairly large corporation.  However, it's been pretty..unprofessional thus far.  I was supposed to train on the helpdesk for a little while as to learn the systems we support, and then move to the actual networking department after 2 months.  Well, after a long delay, I finally moved, kind of.  I currently sit at a makeshift desk (read: an old return from a broken desk stuck in the corner, propped on someone else's desk), using another Admin's laptop.  My ""real desk"" is still in the helpdesk area, which is completely separated from the rest of the network engineers and admins.  Their excuse is that they ""are trying to figure out accommodations for everyone.""  I feel like that's not my problem and if they wanted to hire me so bad, they would have had it all planned out beforehand.  

It just seems like there's no real plans for everything, at a company that has a reputation for taking forever to accomplish anything.  I'm not going to be on a helpdesk answering tier 1 calls.  That's not what I applied for, that's not what I was hired for, and that's not what I want to do with my career.  I have already approached the boss and have been told something other than what I was hired for - namely, staying in the helpdesk area answering networking trouble calls.  

This is my first ""real"" IT job (barring internships and whatnot).  I'm starting in the industry later than most (mid 30s), so I've had my big boy pants on for quite a while in a different industry.  I hope this is all coherent to everyone and doesn't sound like a madman's manifesto - I just don't quite know how to approach this at the moment.



***EDIT:

I appreciate all the comments, whether supportive or otherwise.

I understand that I am not going to be messing with core routers and firewalls right away, or even a year from now.  However, should I be helping people reset their email passwords or restart their computer because they received a BSoD? No, I don't think I should be.  Answering a network outage call for a remote site?   That's the helpdesk work I am more than happy to do.  Do I expect a mahogany desk and leather high-back chair? No.  I don't think think an actual workspace located near the network team is too much to ask.

I have spent nearly two years answering desktop support and other tier-1 helpdesk calls, pulling wire, setting up APs, firewalls, and soforth, both as an intern and part-timer.  So I guess it being my first ""real"" IT job is a bit misleading.

But again, I appreciate all the feedback.

***EDIT 2

My boss and I actually spoke about this today.  His plan for my position (network admin) is to fill in on the helpdesk when absolutely needed while the empty slots are filled in the coming few weeks.  Intentions were that I would not be used as a stop-gap on a permanent basis.  Desks and whatnot are coming.  So we will see."
1ycmfm,13,2014-02-19,"Me [25 M] and my gf [22 F] of a year and half, financial problems on her side",baskerville654,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ycmfm/me_25_m_and_my_gf_22_f_of_a_year_and_half/,"So we've been in a relationship for nearly a year and half and we don't live together, although we live near each other. I've been working all this time and never had any financial problems, I was lucky that my parents paid for everything in my education, got me a car and helped me whenever I needed. My GF on the other hand, is finishing her degree, she has a moderate student loan that she will need to start paying in 2015, her parents (who live in another country) are near broke and can't help her with anything. She's taking her law degree, and for a good paying job and her dream job (as in lawyer) she would need to take a master's degree AND a non paid internship (it functions differently from the US afaik), and she just can't pay for it and she can't take another loan while she still has the previous one. I actually pay for most of our activities together, like movies, gas, half of dinners (the other half we split), I buy her lots of ""girly things"", etc.. She wouldn't die without me, but I know that I provide a lot of ""good"" things in her life, and I do it with love and pleasure from the bottom of my heart.

Now, I got this really well paying ""job"" in other city (I'm moving there in May), which is exactly where she wants to take her master's and wants to live with me (starting October). Now, three things that are major problems (for me):

- For this job I need to spend one year and half in training, where I only get paid the minimum wage (which is fairly low in my country, but my parents told me they would support me, again) + some expenses paid, before I start making some serious money (and no, it's not a scam, it's actually a government program). 

- Her master's is full-time with some ""after-school"" internships included. She **needs** to have some sort of sustain to pay her loan and pay house/bills. Or move with me and expect me to pay for most everything, and while I can depend on my parents, I want them to spend the minimum with me (if possible nothing at all, which is actually possible if I rent a small room instead of an apartment). Even if she does manage to fit a part-time in there, we would have 0 ""couple time"".

- I don't think I'm comfortable in moving together with her, currently we're going through a rough patch and I don't want to become like a friend of mine, who was living with his GF sharing a house, then they broke up and neither could move for almost a year. According to him, it was hell. Especially since if she decides to take her master's, she would have no other way of sustain and I wouldn't ever have the guts kick her out.

I love this girl, I care about her more than I care for some other immediate family, but I don't feel comfortable with her depending on me. I'm more rational in that department, the only way I would see of us moving together, was if she would have a full-time job and be able to move out (or keep the house) if things went south. But taking a full-time job would mean that she can't take her master's (and her dream). I don't want to break up with her, but with the current conditions, I don't see us living together and her depending on me. I've mentioned to her that it would be wiser to spend a year just working, but she says that she's afraid of never getting back to school and doing the master's, and that the master's would help her getting a much better paying job sooner.


  
**tl;dr**: My GF has a fair number of financial problems and kinda ""wants"" to depend on me. I'm not exactly financially stable right now (although I have no problems and my parents always supported me) and don't want her to depend on me. She would be able to follow her dreams if she would depend on me, I don't feel comfortable with the last part but I want the first to come true.

EDIT: we're not in the US, we're in Spain, so things like FAFSA don't really apply to us."
1ycxua,1,2014-02-19,Should I negotiate?,damage_noted,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ycxua/should_i_negotiate/,"Background: I graduated in December from a top twenty university in the USA with B.S. in engineering.

A company I'm interviewing with has an established salary range on the listing.  The difference between the low end and the high end of the listed potential income would be about twenty grand.

This is an entry level technical finance job, and I'm tempted to negotiate for the higher end of the listed range.  I've seen a lot of posts on here that advocate not negotiating for your first job, but I'm hesitant to take that advice because the prevailing opinion seems to be to negotiate even if it's your first job.

When a company has a stated salary range, should you attempt to negotiate for something higher than what is posted?  (I'm not thinking of negotiating outside the range, but I'm curious if it has ever been done successfully.)

If I get an offer on the lower end, how would I negotiate the salary towards the higher end?  I'm assuming I would have to leverage my past relevant experience(one three-month internship) and my technical background(when the recruiter called me he said I was the strongest candidate).

I understand this is all premature-I may not even get the offer.  But I think some answers to these questions would be useful for future job situations."
1ycyc4,2,2014-02-19,Tips on starting a career in Microprocessor/IC design?,Salicide,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1ycyc4/tips_on_starting_a_career_in_microprocessoric/,"Hey /r/ECE!

Since discovering VLSI during my undergraduate career, I've wanted to work in the field doing IC Designs for Microprocessors or GPUs. My dream job has always been to snag a position at AMD/Intel/Nvidia, but that's in the future. Right now I'm looking for tips on tweaking my resume, finding positions, and just generally getting a start in the IC design field.

I'll start with the basics. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering just under a year ago, and followed up by starting my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at a different school in Fall 2013. I graduated with a 3.50 in my undergraduate studies and currently hold a 4.0 in my graduate studies. So, I don't think my grades should hold me back. I have various Teaching Assistant positions on my resume in basic EE/CE courses like Digital Logic and Circuit Design. I also have a couple of Research Assistant positions on my resume but both are in the robotics field, not IC design.

My undergraduate studies heavily consisted of working in the robotics field, with a couple of published papers through two different fellowships. Through board design for the robots and the robotics field, I discovered I really enjoyed working closely with creating logic/circuit diagrams and the IC chips on-board. Unfortunately, since my undergraduate program was very small, with only one dedicated Computer Engineering professor, the school had no means to teach a VLSI course or any laboratory IC course.

Fast forward to my graduate studies. One of my first courses in my Computer Engineering track was VLSI Design. I realized very quickly that this was something I have a passion for. I loved making layouts, discovering new ways of making the circuits I was used to seeing on paper. It was just so damn interesting. I'd spend countless hours working on advanced layouts, and wouldn't even mind. The course gave me good experience with the Cadence Virtuoso Suite and the entire IC process.

Due to my graduate school's location, I now reside in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, so I don't think I'm in a terrible place to start a career in the IC design field, but I'm not entirely sure. I've applied to a few internships that briefly mention ""IC Design"" in the description, both amongst 10-12 other Computer Engineering keywords for jobs, but I haven't heard back from any of them yet. Not surprisingly, many of the positions had a ""Don't contact us, we'll contact you"" kind of description, assuming due to the large number of applicants. I'm worried since I haven't held a position in the IC field before, that I'm being looked over.

So, I'd like your guy's take. Am I living in a bad area for design careers? Could my various experiences on my resume be hurting me instead of helping? Where's a good place to begin?

Thanks!"

Obviously, most of these are unrealistic and are probably too expensive, but still, let me dream, you roach.

**New characters**

* Ed Helms- Todd Hutchinson 

Helms, executive producer of the show, seems almost guaranteed a spot in the show somewhere. Since they are in a new office, naturally they need a new boss. He tries to be a cool guy, but often loses his temper. Has his ""cousin (former NFL QB Chad Hutchinson)""'s jersey hanging in his office. Is not actually former NFL QB Chad Hutchinson's cousin.

* Paul Dano- Gaffney Jordan

Gaffney Jordan, a nerdy college graduate, works at the office as a programmer. He is often the butt of Amir's jokes and is defended by Jake, much like Pat Cassels. Also, like Pat Cassels, does not have a dad.

* Aaron Paul- Billy Braun

This is my own private Reddit post and I will not be harrassed...BITCH! Billy is an editor for the website and is Jake's adversary in the office, as he is intimidated by Billy's fashion sense and ability to get girls. Billy has seen every episode of Gossip Girl. Twice. 

* Cecily Strong- Candice Jemison

One of the actors and writers for the website, Candice is the love interest of both Billy and Jake. Jake is constantly writing sketches in which he ends up kissing her. While acting in one of his music videos, she became John Mayer's least famous sex partner.

* Michael B. Jordan- Lawrence Byrde

Jake's best friend in the office, Lawrence is a standup comedian and writer. Plays a foil to Jake's more eccentric side and is more level-headed than Jake when dealing with Amir's antics. Lawrence is a fan of underground hip-hop music and basketball, except for that blonde guy, #33 for the Celtics.


* H. Jon Benjamin- Royal Stubblefield 

The owner of StubCorp, the company that owns the website. A rich man with a Napoleon complex, Royal is extremely insecure and constantly needs to feel better than everyone. Coincidentally, he and Amir get along swimmingly.


**Characters from web-series (guest stars/cameos)**

* Charlie Day- LeRon

Charlie Day is good at playing crazy people. Whether it's Charlie Kelly, Dale Arbus, or Spaceman Benny, there's always some sort of insanity in his characters. LeRon is a rather crazy individual, and for a bonus point, Charlie and Amir sort of look alike.
*Possible scene: Amir leaves work to go play laser tag with LeRon and take the kids' juice*

* Don Cheadle- Amir's dad

It only seems natural, right? Was originally considering Idris Elba, but then realized that Amir's dad has to have skinny, spindly legs, which obviously suits Don Cheadle more. This cameo appearance would also possibly be doable, since Ben Schwartz stars alongside Cheadle in House of Lies.
*Possible episode: Amir's dad makes a surprise visit to the office*

* Julia Louis-Dreyfus- Amir's mom

This is a perfect fit. More than perfect, actually. Subpar.
*Possible episode: Amir's mom stays with Amir and visits the office and Amir embarrassed by her* 

* Louis C.K.- Jake's dad

Louie's reddish-brown hair matches Jake's and if you've ever seen Louie, which if you watch J&amp;A I assume you have, you know that he is quite capable of playing a fatherly character.
*Possible episode: We meet Jake's family at Christmas, where Amir somehow shows up at the Hurwitz' family party*

* Pete Holmes- All of Amir's oddly-named friends

Pete Holmes seems destined to be on the show as well, since he was a guest on the podcast and now also has his own show on TBS. A great way to utilize Pete's talents would be having him show up anytime Amir names one of his strange friends. 
*Possible scene: Bradlynn films Amir's audition tape for The Real Housewives of Atlanta*

* Ben Schwartz, Allison Williams, Thomas Middleditch, Rick Fox

It's not Jake and Amir without them.
 
* Shia LaBeouf- Mike Fink

Shia plays Mike, a lowly intern."

1yd1db,13,2014-02-19,[trigger warning] Found this subreddit recently and after reading it for awhile I think my parents may be narcissists.,Shadeslayers,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1yd1db/trigger_warning_found_this_subreddit_recently_and/,"Hi everyone,

This is difficult to type it all out, but I think it will be helpful to have feedback from such supportive people. I'm also not sure if my parents behavior can be explained by the fact that they're religious... or narcissists.... or a good amount of both.

I'm engaged to get married to a girl I've been with since high school, we've been togethor for 3 and a half years, I'm a junior in college and turned 20 a couple months ago.

For my 20th birthday, my parents sat me down (the night I got back from school) and told me that I need to marry my fiancee immediately or they will no longer support me. They tell me that in their religion it's not good for me to see her or be with her without us being married, and when I call them out on being hypocrites for treating their son poorly due to religion, they insist that they have to love their god, and love their prophet more than their children.  They are also VERY concerned with how god will judge them.. as opposed to my well-being.  My reaction to this was to not say much, and I just walked out. Immediate NC... I had had enough.  I couch surf for awhile, and then another family in the city hears what happened and intervenes and gives me a place to live until I can return to school. They probably saved my life... 

Anyway, my parents insist that I'm a liar and I was never honest with them.  Yea, I lie to them.  But it's unfair to say I was never honest with them. I always told them about my fiancee.  They were always against me being with her (As long as I lived in their house I wasn't allowed to see a girl!). When I first started liking her, I told my parents about her. I told them about all the things in my life, I wanted them to be able to support and help me with things.  But whenever I would open up to them, it would backfire with them threatening to kick me out, saying that they can't let me be with her because it makes them look bad (to their muslim community.... the nearest family of which lives about 50 miles away). Because of this, I eventually closed off. They make me have panic attacks, I have anxiety. The few times my fiancee would come over I wouldn't let her out of my sight because I CAN'T trust them! I'm paranoid about my privacy, because when I lived there I had none (go through my entire room, rifling through my desk drawers and stuff to find condoms to see if my fiancee and I were doing it or not, and then telling me that I should not have admitted to them that we had been! They went looking for that, and it's my fault they found an answer they didn't want to find. Oh, and at the same time I'm dishonest. Even though I was open about it when they finally asked me instead of going through my shit when I wasn't home).

My mother used to tell all of her kids (I have 3 younger siblings who are still stuck there) that nobody would ever love us like she and my dad do.  Now, that comes across to me as her being insecure, and trying to just have control over us. I have a wonderful fiancee and future in-law family who have all shown more love and acceptance towards me than my parents have.  I think she also said it just to guilt us whenever she wanted us to do something we didn't want to.

I've had LC since I moved out, beginning of December. I've gone back twice, once for my things and once to get mail that was sent there and my passport/soc card/w-2 etc.  Both times I've gone back end with them trying to guilt me, trying to explain to me how I'm wrong and they're right, which always makes me angry and ends with me yelling at them. I don't know how, but through everything I've managed to become very very assertive as an individual, and take no shit from nobody. I'm very sensitive to it now.  I also can't handle criticism well, I have panic attacks, and I can get angry very easily in reaction to witnissing somebody being treated poorly.  I also can't make friends, because I don't trust people. I'm always sure that a person will find a way to hurt you, one way or another. The only exception to the rule is my fiancee, for whatever reason I just think the world of her and she's perfect and all that nice stuff.
Anyway, the long term plan is for complete NC with my parents.  I've gone to the school psychological center and had a meeting with a nice lady, and she set me up for an intake appointment for next week.  I hope it helps.

Over the past 2 weeks I've been reading this subreddit, and it's helped me grow and be less angry already. Previously, I thought that having NC was the best way to hurt my parents and get revenge or whatever. Now I realize that NC is simply a healthy decision. They make me feel bad. So I will stay away from them. They are bullies, so I will just walk away.  They're angry? they're upset? Doesn't matter. I don't have to worry about it anymore. It's the best freaking feeling in the world man.  I COULD fight my parents, I'm good at arguing, I enjoy it even, and I'm sure that I would at least be able to break my mother down. But that doesn't accomplish anything good. I need to work on healing... and I am afraid that I show a lot of these tendencies as well so I want to better myself before the marriage and kids come long haha.

Doesn't the fact that I'm aware of my problems and want to fix them mean I'm not a narcissist?  
I know if I said to my parents they were narcissists their reaction would be to be outraged, hurt, oh how COULD I say something like that?!?!, etc..

In my head, even now, I think to myself ""Well maybe they're half-narcissists... surely they're not that bad. I'm just being dumb and acting up like they always said I do."". They always insisted I was overly emotional....... which is funny because if I'm overly emotional, then I don't know what my fiancee expects when she says I need to work on being more emotional ahahaha.  I keep thinking that my parents religion (Ahmadi Muslims, for the record) justifies their behaviour, that's what they've drilled into me for the past 20 years of my life.  It's really hard to think that they are like the people that I read about on this subreddit all the time..... but I have the same 'horror' stories, the insanity.. I just don't know.
I'm terrified of being told that I'm the one who is overly emotional, that I'm the one who is messed up and simply wants attention, and that my parents were right. And my parents were being good parents.  This summer will be my third summer working under a fortune 500 company (first summer I was in a contractor position, second and upcoming summer I will be in the internship program, rehired), they like having me there, I do good work there, I enjoy it. I do well in school, I'm on track for getting a computer science B.S.... I'm engaged to marry a wonderful beautiful kind woman.. what more could I do to make my life perfect? but to my parents i'm never doing enough.. idk.

I'm sorry I rambled.

**tl;dr - Not entirely sure if parents are narcissists. Have a few examples of stuff they've done as well as my experience of LC over past 3 months.  going to therapy now, to try to fix how I doubt myself and think that I am the one who is messed up. Are they narcissists? I don't know... I think so?**


Also, I have a full story typed out, but it's VERY long... so I will throwthe full story in the comments and apologize for the rambling nature of it. The full story is what I'm planning on showing to the psychology guy who I am seeing on monday."
1yd41p,2,2014-02-19,Shaky tech startup vs. established web agency?,thenwhowas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1yd41p/shaky_tech_startup_vs_established_web_agency/,"Hi everyone. I really want to thank you for your opinions in advance. 

Back story:

I'm a senior computer science major at a CT, USA state university. I am currently working as a front-end web dev intern ($13.50/hr) at a tech start-up and have been for about 7 months. The dev team here is comprised of about 2.5 people. (I say .5 because the CEO is not a developer but has to do html/css from time to time.) I haven't been paid in months, and I'm owed about 2k$. The CEO is a decent person and wouldn't steal from me, but we're not making enough revenue to pay any of the team members. We have a lot of great clients that are constantly referring new clients to us, as we have really reasonable pricing for their websites. (Think of us as similar to Loku or a Google for local data, though we have a very unique product). We have a huge workload. The CEO is very passionate about the company and wants it to succeed (as do I) but I have my doubts, as he has been trying to get us funding for months to no avail. He promised that I'd have shares in the company and that I will be paid soon. I don't feel that my CS skills have been put to use. I am creating HTML/CSS websites and injecting some already created JS, with no clear end of that in sight (as we don't have funding, can't hire new people/interns to do this) Needless to say I feel like I have plateaued in my learning there. 

I'm also running out of money. I have stuff to pay for and as a twenty-something, I'm trying to move out of my parents house.

Last week, I interviewed with a tech agency that has some pretty big clients (e.g. ski resorts) and seems like the type of place that would allow me to become a rock star front-end dev. They use an array of web tools so I'd be getting experience with .net, php and new front-end technologies. The only downside is the salary- they're offering me a full time salary of ~42k (without benefits b/c I have my father's insurance for ~6 more years). The commute will also be about 30minutes, instead of about 20 for my start up job. For me, I think that I'm not exactly the most seasoned dev out there, so in exchange for a lower salary, I'd be getting solid experience. Do you think this is too low and I should ask for a bit more?

tl;dr:
Should I stay with the tech start up that owes me ~2k and has a questionable future (and no funding right now), but could become successful? Or should I take the leap to start at a new job which will give solid experience and a so-so salary?


Thanks so much guys and gals. Ask any questions you want, we will all learn things from each other!

1yd7uf,6,2014-02-19,Tips on starting a career in Microprocessor/IC design? X-Post from /r/ECE,Salicide,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1yd7uf/tips_on_starting_a_career_in_microprocessoric/,"Hey /r/EngineeringStudents!

Since discovering VLSI during my undergraduate career, I've wanted to work in the field doing IC Designs for Microprocessors or GPUs. My dream job has always been to snag a position at AMD/Intel/Nvidia, but that's in the future. Right now I'm looking for tips on tweaking my resume, finding positions, and just generally getting a start in the IC design field.

I'll start with the basics. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering just under a year ago, and followed up by starting my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at a different school in Fall 2013. I graduated with a 3.50 in my undergraduate studies and currently hold a 4.0 in my graduate studies. So, I don't think my grades should hold me back. I have various Teaching Assistant positions on my resume in basic EE/CE courses like Digital Logic and Circuit Design. I also have a couple of Research Assistant positions on my resume but both are in the robotics field, not IC design.

My undergraduate studies heavily consisted of working in the robotics field, with a couple of published papers through two different fellowships. Through board design for the robots and the robotics field, I discovered I really enjoyed working closely with creating logic/circuit diagrams and the IC chips on-board. Unfortunately, since my undergraduate program was very small, with only one dedicated Computer Engineering professor, the school had no means to teach a VLSI course or any laboratory IC course.

Fast forward to my graduate studies. One of my first courses in my Computer Engineering track was VLSI Design. I realized very quickly that this was something I have a passion for. I loved making layouts, discovering new ways of making the circuits I was used to seeing on paper. It was just so damn interesting. I'd spend countless hours working on advanced layouts, and wouldn't even mind. The course gave me good experience with the Cadence Virtuoso Suite and the entire IC process.

Due to my graduate school's location, I now reside in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, so I don't think I'm in a terrible place to start a career in the IC design field, but I'm not entirely sure. I've applied to a few internships that briefly mention ""IC Design"" in the description, both amongst 10-12 other Computer Engineering keywords for jobs, but I haven't heard back from any of them yet. Not surprisingly, many of the positions had a ""Don't contact us, we'll contact you"" kind of description, assuming due to the large number of applicants. I'm worried since I haven't held a position in the IC field before, that I'm being looked over for even ""no experience"" positions.

So, I'd like your guy's take. Am I living in a bad area for design careers? Could my various experiences on my resume be hurting me instead of helping? Where's a good place to begin?

Thanks!"
1ydagt,8,2014-02-19,Canada -&gt; Netherlands,nedcan,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1ydagt/canada_netherlands/,"My girlfriend [23] and I [23] are looking to move to the Netherlands for a year,  possible more and/or permanently to experience Dutch culture and to tour the rest of Europe.  

I am currently finishing a one year internship at a large telecommunications company and have one more year of school to get a computer science degree ( we plan to move once I graduate)

My girlfriend has a 1 year diploma in teaching assisting and is currently working in a kitchen. 

We've both been learning Dutch for about 6 months and plan to keep learning until we leave,  and likely continue one we're there. 

I know that we can get a work holiday visa which is what we plan on doing. 

I'm wondering about finding jobs there. I've heard computer programmers and IT people are in high demand there so I hope this means I can find a good job.  I'm hoping someone can provide links to websites that have job postings. Is it possible to get a job before moving? I'd be worried about moving and not finding a job. 

As for my girlfriend,  she was hoping to work at a daycare or school,  It's this a possibility given her education (or is a university degree a requirement)?

I'm looking for any advice related to moving (jobs, money,  paperwork, etc).  I've read pretty posts and websites so i think i have a decent idea of what is needed and what to expect,  but any advice or information is helpful!   Thanks!!

Edit: I just want to clarify, both my university and internship are both in Canada where I am natural born citizen. "

I have a problem. I don't have a measurement system precise enough to measure a single unit of the population. The only way I can obtain any information is measuring 5 units and taking that value as the mean of the sample of 5 units.

The problem is how can I get information about the variance of the population? Is it possible to estimate the variance from the means of the samples?

Just to be clear this is the data I can measure:

Sample of 5 units 1  |   mean: 0.34

Sample of 5 units 2  |  mean: 0.55

Sample of 5 units 3  | mean: 0.32

and so on...

I am an Industrial Engineer in an internship at a manufacturing company. This problem is about measuring the output of a critical process. I am not a statistics expert and I realize this question may be, well, stupid. Sorry for that...

Any help would be much appreciated :-)"

[Watt is the unit of power?  Sorry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj9316?context=5)|You're my favorite. You can stay.
[We would appreciate a physicist on /r/mathematics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfk9hrn?context=5)|I'll stop by! :)
[Do you/did you ever have trouble with people not taking you seriously because of your age/gender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjc2ac?context=5)|Constantly. It's always been a struggle, especially when I was very young. It's gotten better as I've started to look older, which is why I dread telling people my age.
 |I've been able to figure out a few techniques for portraying myself as someone who should be taken seriously. The most effective technique, which surprised me, was telling people when I didn't know the answer that I honestly did not know. It throws people off to have an honest answer instead of being fed bullshit in order to sound smart. I feel like it gives me more credibility when I do know the answer because people know I won't just make shit up.
[It takes guts to say when you don't know things for sure.  As for looking older, an ex of mine used to wear glasses when he examined patients instead of his usual contact lenses.  If he wore contacts, he said people would ask things like ""Are you really the doctor?"" / ""Where's your father?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfk5sz1?context=5)|I tend to go for more of a Miss Frizzle look.
[I'm an attorney who has the same problem-- My career services office's solution was for me to start wearing pearls... Ummm, thanks? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfkdb6q?context=5)|Oh my god... that's my new favorite response. Wow. /headdesk.
[Are you religious?  Do you believe in the Big Bang?   Do you believe in Evolution?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjhupl?context=5)|Yes, I was raised as a Christian and I like the community aspect of the church and the choirs. I look at the Big Bang and Evolution objectively and without judgment of my own beliefs and in that view I see them as valid theories with solid science behind them. As far as how that affects my beliefs, jury is still out. I think about things critically for a really long time... so the jury will be out for a while.
[Have you been christened with a nickname from your work buddies yet?   Why did you go into the defense force?  What branch of Physics did you specialize in?  What most interests you about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj851v?context=5)|The Navy guys call me Batman because I wear a Batman lanyard and have Batman decorations all over my cube. My civilian coworkers call my Shelly because they all say I'm exactly like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory. (Before you ask, yes, I like The Big Bang Theory. There's literally nothing I enjoy more than nerd humor. I dressed up as the Doppler Effect for Halloween last year, in fact. The year before, I was Dr. Horrible)
 |I went into the defense force because I got picked up for a full ride scholarship when I was 17. It's called the SMART Scholarship and it's a scholarship for service program that pays for you to go to school and has internships every summer, etc. It's pretty amazing, but incredibly stressful because the requirements are insane. It's highly competitive, but it funds all STEM Fields in both undergrad and grad. If you're thinking of joining the STEM Field, I recommend you look into it!
 |I specialized in Energy. I have always been fascinated with sound... I started playing piano right before my 4th birthday. I love music and combining science and music just always seemed like the perfect fit. I actually created a device that converts ambient noise into storable energy for my Senior year science fair project in High School. I'm still working on the energy/waves side of Physics, but more recently I've become absolutely fascinated with what's going on in the field of bio-robotics. I am an avid programmer and have been building robots for years, and being able to help change someone's life while doing something I love? Sounds pretty awesome to me.
[How do you feel we should encourage women to become more interested in the Navy and in STEM fields?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjkubz?context=5)|Personally, I try to be as involved as possible in events that help teach kids or show them how cool science can be. I also try to encourage and be there for any kid who even barely shows an interest in science. I volunteer at space camps, STEM days, science fairs, and girl specific STEM days too. I am 100% for any way I can show girls that being a girl isn't an excuse to not be a bad ass scientist.
[How does your social life work at your age?  (ot to sound degrading at all, I'm just curious.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjkubz?context=5)|As far as my social life is concerned, I tend to have absolutely no problem making friends. I get along with almost everyone. I had some really close friends that didn't even realize I was smart until I had known them for several months and we were driving down the road and they asked an ""I wonder why this is"" question and I answered it. Their faces were priceless.
[Given the chance, what experiments, if any, would you carry out at CERN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj8cl4?context=5)|Oooo... good question. I took a particle physics class during my last semester in school and it became a favorite of mine. I would absolutely love to observe the Higgs Boson. Because mass creation. I mean, seriously. It *creates* mass. What the what?!
[I know, right? It's seriously cool. I can't wait to see what they do if they manage to upgrade the hadron collider!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj9d4x?context=5)|It's definitely a field to watch!! I try to keep up with it, but because it's not really in my field of work, I've been in the dark the last few months. That's the biggest thing I miss from being in school... always being up to date with the newest developments in science!
[Well, as I understand it, the Higgs Boson doesn't create mass, but rather is an excitation of the Higgs field. Particles that react with the Higgs field have mass. So rather, wouldn't the Higgs Boson be proof that something else is creating mass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjrwfh?context=5)|You are correct. You'll have to forgive me... I had 3 hours of sleep last night and I haven't touched particle physics in nearly a year (Higgs Boson was covered on March 14, actually) so it's been some time. From what I understand, the Higgs Boson is created from an interaction in the Higgs Field which means that during the expansion of the Schrodinger equation, there is an additional mass term that appears post reaction. So while the Higgs Boson doesn't create the mass, it is responsible for the additional mass term. I don't think I explained that well... I might try again tomorrow after I've had some sleep. Or maybe someone wants to jump in? I'm more versed on antenna theory than particle physics.
[Make youtube videos.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjzz03?context=5)|I've thought about it!! I haven't been able to narrow down what I would talk about, though. To me, everything is awesome and amazing and with people like One Minute Physics out there, the idea of setting up another physics youtube channel is hella intimidating.
[I'm just a sophomore math/theatre double major who heard some science things during the hype around the Higgs Boson.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjxyqr?context=5)|Well, the really awesome part of the Higgs Boson, and why it meant so much to me was that it was predicted mathematically before it was observed. Typically, equations are built upon the observations of nature. In this case, the equations were telling us something contrary to nature. The Higgs Boson had to exist theoretically, but there was great contention because there had never been a reaction observed that did not conserve mass. So, for the Higgs Boson to be predicted first through the expansion of the Schordinger Equation and **then** observed? That's pretty awesome.
[Do you give importance to the iq? if so what's yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj8e2i?context=5)|I don't. I don't believe that intelligence can be measured by any sort of standardized method. I happen to be very good at math and reasoning, where as my brother is very good with business. I can't balance a budget to save my life, and he has no idea how to solve a Bessel function. That doesn't mean we are any less intelligent. People are gifted in different areas, and I firmly believe people should be praised and rewarded on how well they do whatever it is they enjoy.
[I agree with you about the iq, although I believe a little bit of harmless competition spices up your life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj9vib?context=5)|Agreed. Which is why I still take those online IQ tests... I usually score above a 140.
[How have you been percieved when looking for employment? Was it difficult? Did people take you seriously?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj86j3?context=5)|It was extremely difficult to look for employment. I did my research, and found the SMART Scholarship while I was in my first year at the University of Colorado. I wasn't sure if I could really apply because you had to be 18 and I was only 17 at the time. I had to have my mom sign my application... but I ended up going through the whole process. Part of the scholarship is a series of phone interviews. I had 5 of them, and it was very strange because most of them didn't want to talk about my abilities, they just wanted to know about me. It threw me off, but I answered everything and I guess I made a good impression, because I became the youngest ever awardee of the SMART Scholarship.
 |I did go for an interview once with a company right before graduating school and I almost left. It was a series of 4 interviews that got progressively worse. They eventually just started harrassing me and making fun of me. It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I walked out thinking, ""You bitches wish you could hire me. You know what?? I want you to try to hire me. Just try. Watch me turn you assholes down."" /hairflip.
[I can almost relate, just trying to find summer employment. I kind of fret for once I finish my program in the spring (Summer actually\) trying to find decent employment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj92nm?context=5)|It's tough! Do you have any idea of what you want to specialize in or what you would want to do?
[I am in a CAD/CAM engineering technology program that has transfer credits into university. Plan is to enter electronics eng. and maybe mech eng. for fun. I would like to ultimately end up in development and design of consumer electrionics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjag71?context=5)|Wow! Well, my recommendation would be to find someone in that field and talk to them about how they found a job. Maybe one of your professors has had experience in industry and can help you out? Internships are absolutely key and sometimes your university can even help set those up. It might be worth a trip into the career center, if your school has one.
[I suppose I should persue some engineers (outsied of my teachers\)and research that a bit. Don't know why I haven't thougth about that yet, just not thinking wide enough. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjdg3o?context=5)|No problem! I'm glad I can help! 
[What age are you now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj84jp?context=5)|I'm 21. I turned 21 two weeks before I got my degree, actually. I could have graduated earlier, but I wanted to plan it so that I would get my degree after I turned 21... I really wanted to be able to drink at my graduation party. I did, btw. and it was awesome.
[Why did it take you 6 years to finish? Why didn't you go to grad school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjc0oc?context=5)|I chose to jump schools quite a bit. I went to two different colleges before I graduated high school, and then went to finish my degree at the University of Colorado. I started as a EE major and did really well but it was too easy. I transferred to the University of Maryland for a more challenging and prestigious education and it was the worst mistake I ever made. That year ended up handing me my ass in a hand basket and it really taught me a few life lessons. Chief among them was that I wasn't invincible, just human. I went back to the University of Colorado and switched to Physics which ended up being the best decision I ever made. Met some great guys and had a ton of fun. I always wanted to graduate after I turned 21 anyways so that I could drink at my graduation party. Which I did.
[So are you now at the same educational level as your peers, because you took longer to go through college? (I'm not too familiar with the U.S. education system, but here 21 is the standard age to graduate a bachelor's degree\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjzw90?context=5)|I'm a year younger than the people in my 'grade level', so most people my age are going to be graduating in May.
[How does one raise a child to be a physicist at 15?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjb08j?context=5)|Let them think they can do anything they set their mind to. Encourage and help them, but let them do the work. My parents always just sort of blindly encouraged me in an ""oh you wanna be a mad scientist? Okay... do you need a ride home after that?"" Kind of way. Also my brothers and I have a fierce competitive spirit. My oldest brother made it to the international science fair, and I always thought it would be awesome to do that too. I didn't ever make it that far, so I became valedictorian instead. Showed him.
[Are your parents exceptionally smart as well? I don't know much about genetics but I've noticed how some families are gifted with athletic talents and some are gifted in show business.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjgj91?context=5)|I don't know that I would credit that to genetics as much as I would credit that to the way people are raised. That being said, no, my parents aren't exceptionally smart. My dad was in the Navy and my mom was an artist. We're all pretty deep thinkers though and we love talking to each other about new ideas and fixes for random things. It's all in the problem solving.
[Hi, do you have any advice for a 15 year old of average intelligence wanting to be a physicist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjrvt0?context=5)|Don't give up. Ever. You want to be a physicist? Dedicate yourself, and you will be! Read any and all books written by Richard Feynman. My first recommendation is 'Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman'. Also, if you see a fun experiment, do it! Seeing things first hand will make doing problems on paper easier.
[Also, have you traveled at all? Do you have any coworkers who have gotten to because of their jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjrvt0?context=5)|I've traveled all over the world. I've lived in Japan, been to 47/50 states and studied music in Vienna and Prague. It's never been directly related to my work, though. I don't know anyone who has traveled for being a physicist besides professors who are asked to speak at conferences.
[How and when did you get all those travel oppurtunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjs8kb?context=5)|Well, thank you! That means a lot to me. This whole AMA has been a really amazing experience for me.
[Do you ever have major financial trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjs8kb?context=5)|I traveled mostly while my dad was in the Navy. We took the ridiculous flights in the back of a C-130 that were free and we were the family that went grocery shopping, not to a restaurant. I traveled to Europe to study music on a scholarship. I started college on an academic scholarship and then I took loans out for my first year at the University of colorado. I worked very hard to get my final academic scholarship which provided a full ride, a paid internship, and a stipend during the school year that allowed me to live in my own apartment for the last three years of my undergraduate degree. Basically, I worked hard and I didn't allow myself to slack off. I stayed focused and kept my eye on academic scholarships. That focus and hard work has kept me financially stable for the last few years.
[Any other books (science related or not\) you can reccomend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjs8kb?context=5)|I highly recommend Let's Just Pretend This Didn't Happen by Jenny Lawson. It's absolutely hysterical.
[ songs, since I heard you like music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfjs8kb?context=5)|Oh, also, the new We The Kings album is fantastic. 
[Who's your all-time favorite Physicist and why? if you got to meet that person what 1 question would you ask them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj9tzq?context=5)|Dead: Nikola Tesla. Alive: Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson.
 |Tesla because he had an amazing idea and was essentially pushed aside. I have a soft spot for the ones who are turned down even though they're brilliant. I would love to see a world where Tesla came on top. I have a feeling it would be a very different world. I would ask him (wow, this is a tough question) how many people he thought he would inspire.
 |Dr. NGT because of his outlook on science. I appreciate his dedication to the education of the general public on all things science. Also because he's the original badass. I have actually met him, and I couldn't think of a single question to ask him except where he got his tie. It was a really cool solar system tie and he said it was a gift. Super unhelpful.
[I'm a physicist as well and I started my college education at 16. I'm male so this may be different. How did you get the professors to take you seriously? I did undergrad research in astrophysics and basic quantum mechanics, but never got any real attention for it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfj9es7?context=5)|This is a tough one. The only way I have found to be taken seriously is to know everything I can about my subject. If I can always answer every question and speak intelligently on the topic, then usually people will start to take me seriously. Unfortunately, that means you have to work twice as hard as someone who is older. That does mean, though, that you'll have the upper hand when it comes to heated debates ;)
 |Never demand to be taken seriously, though. You won't gain anything just by the nature of the request. Just study up and be you.
 |Impressive that you did undergrad research in astrophysics and quantum mechanics!! I haven't received any attention on my research either, but don't worry... The good part of doing research when you start school so early is that you're always young and have more time to get acknowledgement for all of your hard work.
[I've since graduated but only with a BSc and decided not to continue schooling due to financial and personal reasons. Though I commend you for actually getting a job in the field. I'm very happy someone could be succeful in a similar situation as mine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ycfvz/iama_female_physicist_who_started_my_undergrad/cfja68j?context=5)|It's definitely tough. All of my friends who graduated with me were able to find jobs, all of them as engineers ironically enough.

I love to sing, so if I can sing to it, I'll listen to it. My current obsession is the new We The Kings album. As any of my friends will tell you, putting my phone on shuffle is dangerous.

Most of the time, you'll look insane no matter what comes on. Just the way I like it.  As far as playing is concerned, I love to play Baroque period pieces on flute and more of the Classical and Romantic era pieces on piano. I also really enjoy playing Spanish music on the piano... they're extraordinarily expressive. My favorite composer is Chopin, but I have never been able to actually play any of his music. My favorite music to sing chorally is anything by Josquin or Bach.

My parents were always supportive and made me think I was a freaking genius even if I had come to the simplest of conclusions. I give them a lot of credit for basically making me think I was a genius because then it was natural for me to kind of push myself to do better.

I wanted to start college classes at 13, but my high school wouldn't accept any of the credits if I did. I didn't want to waste the credits, so I waited until my junior year of high school (when I was 15). I took 3 college classes, 4 AP classes, and did the science fair all in one year. There were days I was in school from 8 am until 10 pm and I rocked the shit out of all of it. I still have absolutely no idea how.

I know that there are exceptions, but it seems to me that (and I'm no historian, so don't take my word as more than just a general observation) as a whole, mankind has changed from wanting to fight and be better than everyone to trying to elevate every person on this planet to a newer, better life. The way countries work together to advance medical sciences, create more efficient alternative energies, advance computers and their capabilities, or just help countries that may need it isn't a trivial matter.
[I believe that while people vary in their gifts, it is rarely the case that  a person is uniformly gifted. There are geniuses with poor social skills.

If I find an area where I am lacking, I try to focus on that. I had a hard time making friends, so I forced myself into social situations and have become more comfortable over the last few years. I guess my biggest problem is reasoning my way through life too much.

I have also always taken a very critical approach to faith, just because I feel like interpretation can play too large of a role in what is preached.

1ydr2z,2,2014-02-19,Looking for a mentor or some advice,[deleted],Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1ydr2z/looking_for_a_mentor_or_some_advice/,"**The Short Story:** I'm a recent graduate who is having trouble seeing what I should do for my future career goals. 

**The Long Story:**  
So I'm a recent graduate from an undergrad program at a liberal arts university. I come from a family that's not very well off, so I chose my university based upon how much financial support they would give me, and upon their level of prestige. 

I'm trying to figure my post-grad life out right now and I'm hoping maybe someone who has been down this road might be able to give me some advice. 1) The film production side of my school's department was basically killed off after my sophomore year 2) as a result I decided to not be a film major and just focus on teaching myself and making work on my own. and 3) because of the attitudes fostered at my alma mater there are not very many alumni working in film, or who are accessible to me. 

I'm looking for advice because I feel a need to focus myself and put together a more concise, more actionable idea of what I should do with my career. 

Here is my current situation. I graduated last May. Before graduating, I started my own student production company, since production had been mostly halted directly through our school. I directed 2 music videos in the Fall, and a short film in the Spring of my senior year. Technically this was all done outside of any official school program. I finished post production for the short film in November. 

My school is in Boston. I decided to go back to my home state of Texas after graduating. I now live in Austin. I'm currently working as a salesman in an AV store, and working a paid internship as a graphic designer at a start-up accelerator. 

I've done a little freelance work but in general it's a little hard to get paid in this town. I don't have a local work history, and my school, while being a well-endowed private university, is virtually unknown outside of New England. 

Most importantly though I am not exactly sure what I actually want to do... So technically I didn't major in film. I was originally double majoring in creative writing, and fine art, with a minor in film. (double majoring was pretty common at my school). I dropped the minor and the writing major because I felt I had taken all the classes useful for actually making stuff (versus writing academic focused articles). I chose to focus on teaching myself what I needed to know, and to strike out on my own. 

But what to do about an actual career? That's a hard question because on one hand I have a very specific idea of what I want to do, and I also do not have a very concise or actionable way to achieve it. I'm the kid who knew what he wanted to be when he grew up since 2nd grade, and yet there's an important gap in my thinking missing. 

Bear with me, as I try to put this into words. What I want to do is be a storyteller, and honestly the exact medium doesn't matter too much to me. I'm interested in film, books, visual art, games, literature, comics, any way of telling a story really. This isn't just a general interests, flights of fancy either, as I've created sustained work in multiple mediums, and I'm very conscious of the pitfalls of becoming a ""Jack-of-All"" trades. 

My thought process was that I would use the limited resources I had to make the best work I could, and after graduation I would try and get any kind of job I could in the creative industry and see where that took me, If I ended up getting a job in film, then I'd focus on film, and leave the other stuff as personal projects, if I ended up with a job in something else, then I'd pursue that, and film would take more of a backseat. So far that hasn't happened. 

Other people who I look up to who I think reflect my own positions are guys like Wayne White (currently a fine art painter, who was an art director for Pee Wee's Playhouse and directed music videos and other weird projects in the 90s) and Rob Schrab (went to school for illustration, made a famous comic, won an Oscar for his script of Monster House, and he's done a bunch of directing/writing for a bunch of TV shows too). 

I see my skill toolset as being an asset, but I feel like I need to focus things in order to start gaining ground. Right now I feel stuck, and I don't know what to do, or if I'm just treading water. 

Currently there are only 2 things I see as possibly on the horizon. 

1) I've applied for a grant through my school to do a year long documentary project which fuses my art, film, and story telling interests together. It's an exclusive grant but highly competitive. I won't find out about that till May. 

2) Working with start up companies has put me in the mind set of maybe... starting my own company or something? The student production company I started was pretty limited but if I could get some investors I feel like I could perhaps start growing something worthwhile. That seems like a pretty wishful option though. 

I've also thought about grad school but pretty strongly though against it. While I do feel like I have so much more to learn, I don't think it's worth accruing the extra debt, and the academic posts which those degrees open up, are supposed to be shrinking in number every year. 

Does anybody have any advice or life experience they'd like to share?

Oh yeah and just so you can get an idea of my experience level:

Here's a trailer for the film I directed: https://vimeo.com/80128671

That was made for a tiny budget, with a skeleton crew, outside of and in addition to an Honor's thesis. It has it's flaws but I still think it's impressive considering the circumstances. 

And parts of my other work, fine art/illustration related, can be found at my blog (I have an actual portfolio website but it's not super up to date right now) 
http://jackalopeconspiracy.tumblr.com/

**Lastly:**  

I want to hear people's honest advice. If you have had to make hard choices about these sort of things, in your life, I'd like to hear more about it. "

Don't know which one to choose,shokzw,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ydu2v/got_2_interns_positions_dont_know_which_one_to/,"I'm in my last year of Business Administration, and not from USA, so the rules for internship is a little different.

In my college I only have my last year to have an internship experience and for these positions I would start working now till the end of this year with the possibility of getting hired depending of my performance


One position is in a start-up company, where I would be working in Business Intelligence, I’ll have a lot of autonomy to do whatever I see fit if I see chances of improvement by analyzing all the data. Also, the company has only 8 employees so I would be doing a lot of other things, since things more operational till strategic ones.


The other one is a corporate bank, one of the biggest banks in the world, where I would be in the back office doing and learning all the operational functions. Also, they expected from me pro-activity because they said they won’t have time to teach me everything, so most of the things I’ll need to learn on my own. If I get hired after the internship, I’ll have the chance to move to others areas, grow in the company and possibility to have international experience working overseas.


Both of them pays almost the same, all the managers I talked to and my future co-workers are very nice, and the work seems interesting for me. However I can’t decide because I don’t know which internship may prove more valuable for me in the future, or will leave more doors opens for me if I decide do to others things.

If anyone can give some advice, I’ll be grateful


TL;DR : Don’t know if I choose a start-up company or a big corporate bank to work

1ydz5g,2,2014-02-19,Offer from another company *after* signing an offer letter.,linuxguy92,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ydz5g/offer_from_another_company_after_signing_an_offer/,"So, I did an internship at a *wonderful* company over the summer. The company is a medium sized .NET consulting shop that tries, but isn't super successful, in using new and upcoming technology. They're locked in to corporate customers, after all. Regardless, I truly enjoyed everything about the company, so when the offer came (after a couple of negotiations to the tune of about $5k more per year and a $1500 signing bonus to be paid after the first month) I happily signed it. Since then, I have been extremely excited to move to the city (about 2 hours away from where I live now) and start work in May. It's worth noting that this company made a couple special provisions for me because of a few life events, so they've been absolutely great to me.

However, a new offer has come along. The company is a small (~10 people) startup that is doing real good in the world. It's also not something I would be worried about just shutting down suddenly. This offer would let me stay where I am, saving a pile of money on moving. The offer is also for around $20k more per year plus bonuses, so that's hard to ignore. The second offer also has the benefit of allowing me to work in lots of current technologies that the first offer won't. The only sticking point that I can see is that the current employees are very performance driven, to the point of it being a bit off putting. To mitigate this though, I'm going to work a bit of a trial session (a couple of weeks) to determine if I'm a good fit.

So, assuming that I still like the place two weeks from now and we finalize the offer, I'll be in a real pickle. Each company has its pros and cons, and I'll weigh them all. The largest problem that I have is that I feel like I would be a doucebag to company one for rescinding acceptance of the offer letter in exchange of the new offer. I know that a few other interns have accepted and then later turned down an offer from the same company, but it just *feels* wrong.

With all of that rant out of the way, what is your advice? Would rejecting be too big of a douce move, or would it be understandable given the situation? Any thoughts or comments are very appreciated."
1ye8hm,2,2014-02-19,Is it acceptable for me (20f) to email an ex-coworker (26f) for some help with getting a job at her work?,workrelationship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ye8hm/is_it_acceptable_for_me_20f_to_email_an/,"I just want to start by saying I'm not expecting her to be able to do anything, but wondered if it were even possible or acceptable to reach out to her in this manner. 

To summarize - I was an intern at her last place of business, and she left at the end of the summer (I started in late May). She was a huge part of the reason I even got hired to begin with, as I wasn't very experienced at the time, and she was amazing to me when I started working there. She helped me with so much and was always very kind - this meant a lot to a pretty shy girl. I gave her a card and some well-wishes when she left, and she told me to email her at any time if I ever needed anything.

Welp..

Now I'm looking for a job for the summer. I would love a paid internship, and my goal is to try and secure one. The only problem is, in my field of interest, there are very few businesses that pay their interns full time. Actually, there are pretty much two (in my city, which I have to stay in due to financial constraints). This ex coworker of mine works at one of them.

-----

I was wondering if it is appropriate for me to reach out to her about this. I don't want to come off as if I'm asking for her to ""put in a good word"" for me, even though I suppose that's sort of the case. I guess I just need help a) knowing if this is even okay and b) figuring out what to say to her in the email. I figure I'd start off asking her how she's doing and whatnot, and then ask her if she knows of any summer intern positions opening up in her department. 

Does this sound like an okay idea? Let me know what you think, or if you have any better suggestions. Thanks!

TL;DR - Thinking of asking an ex-coworker about securing a position at her place of work... I'm applying in general already, but I'm wondering if reaching out to her could give me any further influence - and if this is even acceptable to do.

This may be the case in r/athiesm, but most high-school athiests I know would say that just because they dont believe in God that doesnt give them the right to trash any religion.

r/im14andthisisfunny is one of the most bullshit subreddits on here. Not only does it portay teenager in a stupid light, it acts like all teenagers growing up today act and talk like this. I will say that teenagers growing up today are much different from the ones say, 30 years ago. But that doesnt make them inferior. Lots of coverage on teenagers is focused around violent or stupid-ass things, like beating up people for fun and stealing stuff just to do it.

Lots of this shit going on is mainly from mainstream rap culture. Some rap is good, but most of the shit that gets famous now is total crap. If you want confermation, just go to the top 100 rap songs of 2013. It's pretty sad. In high school, I hear some of the most derogatory terms ever. Just today in English I hear two douchbags talking about if ""pulling bitches"" is a sport. Really? This is the kind of stuff that makes teenagers look bad.

Many people blame going against their parents as teenage angst, and while some of it is, the biggest reason is getting sick of doing the same routine since 1st grade. I hear so many ghetto teens saying theyre going to rely on their rap career or sports career to make money, and frankly, its the stupid stuff I hear. Most of them end up staying in my city, Charlotte NC. And unfortunatly most of them end up staying.

Most people agree that teenagers end up doing nothing immediatley after high school. This is also not true. I have worked my ass of junior and senior year to get an internship at Hearst Magazine in NYC. I wish I could say the same for others. Most of the people in my graduating class are going to the community collage here.

To sum this up, all teenagers arent bad, just kindof stuck."

(It's at a university whose program is good, but not well known, though it is respected in the area.) Two people I know and I would like to attempt something this summer. We want to come up with an idea and just try to develop it. We're going to rent an office and really try to do 40 hours a week.
The only problem worry I have is that this won't look as good on a resume as an internship. I live in the St. Louis area, so the opportunity for development jobs is not huge, as compared to IT people (which I do not want to do.)
The question I have, is will this start-up look good on a resume / help me get a job down the road. The plan is if we're successful to incorporate as an LLC and look for investors/get our product out at places like South by South-West etc. If we aren't, we'll all have the code to put on our git-hub accounts to help show what we can do. Is this a good trade-off, or could it hurt my future employ-ability?"
1yellw,2,2014-02-19,[20F] Trying to figure this out,hawkxs,questioning,https://www.reddit.com/r/questioning/comments/1yellw/20f_trying_to_figure_this_out/,"Also, this really is probably not my only issue (general depression/anxiety [on meds] has been getting more annoying lately, mostly due to type 1 diabetes/stress/life), but right now I feel like it's the biggest one, affecting my general quality of life and self-whateverness. And 'solving' this one I think will help with the rest.

I really like labels. Being able to say I fit in this box, this box, etc helps me know where I am in the world and what I need to do next. (I am an INTJ. If you know anything about us you will understand this whole post.) So my sexuality being more or less the only thing I can't put in a box right now is really bothering me. I just wish there was a definitive gay-straight-bi-pan-etc quiz or something. 

So I guess I'll start from the beginning. Was always a tomboy. Wore my hair short 1st-3rd grade, grew it out, and chopped it off again for 5th-7th grade. Want to chop it off again now, but professionalism and internships and all that crap (says my mom) so ought not to do that. I totally get it because last time I gave zero fucks about my hair. Still don't really, ponytail everyday, so understandable. (end random tangent #1)

Never had pink crap. Parents had no desire to give it to me, I had no desire to want it. Since the age of 5 I've probably worn a dress five times. Since I was old enough to pick my own clothes reasonably I've pretty much exclusively worn cargo pants and tshirts. (it gets worse?) Obviously these are guy's pants, and honestly the only women's clothing I own are a couple of dress shirts and pants. (end tangent #2)

I play ice hockey, have since 5th grade. Bari sax. Am going to school to be a biomedical engineer. Attending a traditionally male dominated school (ratio 3:1 right now guy:girl). Know of LGBTQ stuff on campus but don't really know who/what/when/where and don't really have the time for it right now. It's a smaller school, Midwest, but pretty progressive for our area I'd like to think. (end tangent #3)

So I always kind of thought I'd end up with one of my two best friends throughout elementary/high school. Both were guys and are super cool. High school came and as one does, I thought about a lot of things then. One of my good friends has a sister who is gay and had a hard time coming to terms with it due to her religion. So I kind of put my thoughts aside at that point because it didn't seem like the best thing to be talking about. The rest of my friends were/are atheist or agnostic so that whole thing didn't really matter to them (at the time I considered myself agnostic, now pretty sure in my atheist label). So I put that box aside and didn't really consider it again until now.

In high school I would go through my friends and random other people in my mind and do the whole 'would I go out with them?' thing. I had way more girls on my list than guys. My high school only had about 800 kids though. But I could only come up with 3-4 guys I would have gone out with and easily 10 or more girls. 

Add another thing to my pot - I've never actually been in a relationship with either gender, kissed anyone, etc. the whole shebang. So I have no idea really. But the idea of the male body is not as attractive as the female body to me. I will look through the assorted subreddits from time to time and definitely enjoy women, clothed or not, more than the guys (although I still appreciate a shirtless guy in good shape). Also /r/dykesgonemild...

In tune with the whole internet thing I've started watching a ton of YouTubers who are gay or otherwise not straight and find myself identifying and agreeing with a lot of the things they say. 

I guess I currently am pretty darn sure I'm not straight. I just don't know if I can really call myself gay. Self-labeling and all that, but I don't want to offend (?) anyone by trying to be something that they may not define me as. It would just be easier to not deal with this, but I think it's dragging me down a lot and I want to figure it out. 

I guess with some reassurance then we go to the whole coming out thing. This is part of it, I think. I think I know the truth and just want it out there, so I'm not using a throwaway; I want anyone who knows that hawkxs is this other person (a couple people irl have found me and honestly it's not too hard if you know me) to just know. I am not good at asking about or telling about touchy-feely stuff; it's why I'm going to be an engineer. I just want to box this and have it out there. 

Last tangent, I think. I have a number of family members who I really respect and love and do care about what they think of me. I am reasonably sure that some of them won't care at all, but I'm not as certain about others and would be really sad to lose them over this. They are somewhat serious Catholics, definitely politically conservative, but also not stupid.

I really want to talk to my mom about this. I've been stewing over this for the past few weeks if I'm honest, and just am not sure how she will take it. I think she'd be fine, but I don't know because obviously I've never told her anything like this before. She's from a conservative and intelligent background, and was raised Methodist but obviously never indoctrinated me in anything. I've heard my parents discuss a couple other gay people we know (we actually have neighbors, they're super nice), particularly during the whole Boy Scouts thing because there was a boy in the troop who while in the troop wasn't out for a number of reasons but came out shortly after he got his Eagle. Their opinions of him had nothing to do with that fact, and I think my dad said that if the board had said something about his being gay, my dad would have been obliged to say something - he's very much a separation of church and state kind of guy, and although the troop is chartered to a Methodist church, there's no reason to discriminate based on your own or the organization you represent's beliefs.

I told myself I'd write this post, and I have. Please help me figure this out, or otherwise how to become comfortable in society as whatever I am. Also, thanks for reading if you got this far."

1yez9n,113,2014-02-20,IamA former SpaceX engineer intern AMA!,enderfusion,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yez9n/iama_former_spacex_engineer_intern_ama/,"Howdy, Reddit! My name is Andrew, and I'm a mechanical engineer from Texas A&amp;M. During the summer of '11, I had an awesome experience at SpaceX as an intern for the Structures department.  
My school was having an engineering career fair with about 250 companies attending. Most of the companies were your standard oil and gas types, and I’m not the climb-the-corporate-ladder-type. I walked up to the SpaceX booth, handed them my resume, and told them I had no interest in any other company except theirs. I explained to them how I was the most hands-on, critical problem-solving engineer they were going to find in the sea of khakis walking around. It didn’t hurt that I happened to have a video on my phone of some static firings of large scale rocket engines I had recently machined.

About a month later I was called from an L.A. phone number, and more information was collected. They requested that I write a two-page essay detailing why I was the right candidate for the internship. I sweated over that thing for like a week. In the end, I tried to cram as much passion into my explanation as possible. It makes me sad that I couldn’t be an engineer in the golden days of the 1960’s and the Apollo era, but this was the next best thing. A few weeks later, I did a few phone interviews with some senior structural engineers. Tip: Google your interviewers; knowing their grad papers on torsional chassis stiffness clenched it. After getting to L.A., I learned that they collected about 8,000 applications for the hundred or so positions. Apparently they appreciated my passion and enthusiasm. The single factor that probably helped me the most was being a part of the Formula SAE car team at school. Literally 50% of the interns and a lot of the employees had been through a similar program. I absolutely advocate doing the program if you’re still in school. It prepares you so well for facing real work deadlines, budgets, and working conditions. #becauseracecar

At the time, SpaceX only had about 1,300 employees. They hired 125 interns and crammed them into one apartment complex in Venice Beach about two blocks from the water. We carpooled every day because not many people had cars. That definitely led to some people getting stuck at work and spending the night there!

The culture at SpaceX, at least while I was there, was fantastic. The caliber of people in terms of technical excellence and talent was the most impressive I've ever seen.  Very rarely did I ever feel like I had a complete grasp on the problem I was tackling. It was a complete fire hose of real world engineering concepts no one outside of advanced aerospace would hear on a daily basis. I brought some structural theory books from school (Shigleys) and definitely used them. While cliché, the term I would use to best describe the engineers I worked with was passionate. They were there for the same reason we were there. WE WERE BUILDING FREAKING ROCKETS! I could never get over the fact that one could go downstairs and walk amidst Merlin engine bells and giant composite structures. Thai food, lots of coffee, and unlimited frozen yogurt is currently fueling the American private space race. 

My particular role in the Structures department had to do with the solar panel assembly and the electromechanical widgets. My mentor threw down the challenge within the first couple hours of starting there. I think we had my first print to the shop within the first week there. It was a crazy, insane rush of CAD, prints, FEA, and manufacturing. Shipments from McMaster arrived twice daily, and it was a slow day if nothing went to prototype. The challenge of it all was the most fun.  A lot of our parts are visible in this shot. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BgykXmJCcAAlONc.jpg
There were a few fun incidents. The first was a scheduling nightmare. Our team was holding up a test that apparently had a $50k / day penalty. We worked for something like 30 straight hours and through the night to finish assembling the solar array for its deployment test. In the middle of the night, we realized that we were one titanium fastener short, and the inventory room was closed for the night (it was 2 a.m. at the time). There was no way we could burn 5 hours of time waiting, so my mentor decided screw it, scaled the 15-foot chain link fence surrounding the storage room, let me in, and we got the part we needed. He said he’d rather explain to Elon why he broke a rule than a $50,000 delay. Security sent him some nice screenshots, and his boss didn’t say crap. 

Another fun time had to do with that same looming test. Back then the machine shop didn’t have any shifts running on Sunday. No matter who we pleaded with, we couldn’t get any approval to get someone to come in on Sunday to make some super-hot parts for us.  They were my design, and I felt responsible for getting them done and didn’t want to be the cause of the delays. I ended up convincing the manager of the auxiliary machine shop to give me key-card access to the machine shop after hours so I could come in to machine the parts on a Bridgeport mill after hours on Sunday. I probably broke about a million HR and union rules with that one. It was one lonely intern making chips in a 100,000 ft^2 shop, after having set off the building alarm badging in (security never checked it out).  Needless to say, I tried to finish quick. Six hours later, I threw the parts down on my mentor’s desk. Win. The unspoken expectation there was that you knew what the hell you were doing. This was an immense privilege that was not taken lightly. Most of the interns got to do things that full time aerospace engineers wouldn't get to achieve with 20 years. 

There was a lot of drinking, partying, and nerding out. In the end, I had 30 or so parts make it to A-rev and fly in space. It was an absolutely fantastic experience that I wouldn’t trade for the world. When I got the job offer, I had lunch with one of the VP’s and talked about it. He said I would be absolutely crazy for turning it down. In the end, I had to say no to the full-time offer. I chose instead to stay in Texas, get married, and work at a startup engineering firm.  Now I work with electron beam fusion and advanced additive manufacturing. Definitely a good decision, though I still miss the grandeur of it all.  Thank you Elon for the great experience!!! I’m happy to answer any questions.

1yfcoc,158,2014-02-20,The 12:30 AM phone call. An exercise in controlling contact.,BigAngryDinosaur,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1yfcoc/the_1230_am_phone_call_an_exercise_in_controlling/,"It's arguably one of the last tools in the toolbox. We all know how a phone call after a certain hour is highly troubling. When a family member calls you in the middle of the night, its more often than not bad news, and depending on your family's habits, it may be the signal of very bad news. 

So here I sit with my phone on my desk, showing one missed call. ""Parents. 12:29 AM""

I sat and watched it ring. I had no intention of answering this call. I already know that standard family conventions do not apply when that particular name appears. And even though I've been trained so well that such calls have been, with a 100% reliability factor, utter bullshit, I still could feel myself jump out of my skin. Every inner voice screaming: ""*What if this is the one time it really is important?*"" and putting all these visions in my head of every possible scenario, from a full-scale family disaster to my father sitting beside an empty bottle of brandy and a gun, reaching out to finally make amends for his behavior before doing something drastic. 

That inner child in me shrieks in panic. Ready to jump into action, to pick up and take care of whatever the problem is this time, and carry it until everything is better once more.

**That's what they want**. That's why treated you like you were so incapable for so very long. That's why they dressed you, why they picked out your hobbies and chose your friends and washed your hair for you in the bathtub even after puberty, even when you tried to cover yourself with a washcloth, hoping they would get the message that you were embarrassed.

And it was this knowledge of what they really want, hard-earned after decades of shame, guilt, insecurity, needless distress and emotional breakdowns, that told me not to answer that call.

*Shame on you*, my frontal lobes stepped in and said at the last second. Shame on you if you answer that call and spend the rest of the night staring into space and replaying the belligerent, inebriated, overly-emotional and dramatic conversation in your head. Over and over, wondering what you could have said different, imagining the things you should have said, the alternatives you could have tried this time. A new strategy in hopes of finally achieving some kind of connection, or at least getting through to them in some way the message that they are hurting you.

""*If you can just get them to realize that they're hurting you, they might change, just try to explain..*."" That tiny voice grasps at slippery straws, desperate in some deep, long unkempt corner of your psyche, desperate to have daddy and mommy happy, giving you love, reassuring you again. 

*jingle, jingle!* There it goes again. A second call. That means it must be important, right? No, no voicemail. It's bullshit. Like everything else you were ever led to believe. 

By answering that call you are allowing them into your room, to adjust your covers, to arrange your nightstand while you sleep, to control this quiet hour when you should be resting and at peace. 

Do not answer that knock. Do not forget what happens when you let them in on their own terms. They are like vampires. Do not feel guilt, because you did not do this. You did not create this long and incomprehensible story. You are not the one who has abused so many privileges for so very long.

Just for tonight, rest and be yourself. Do not be a product of them, do not be anyone's son or daughter. Right now you are just *you*, and you are not accountable for the problems of the poor, broken people who brought you into the world. You do not owe them anything, least of all your well-being.

*jingle, jingle!* ""1:00 AM. Missed Call: Parents. (3)""

You've responded like a good child over and over and over, and how did it make you feel each time? Was your reward worth it? Was it even about you at all, or are you just a part of the narrative being written in the mind of someone who doesn't even recognize the existence of other people?

It's time to stop feeling guilty. You are the star of your life, not an extra or an unpaid intern to your parents. You will not be punished for not wanting to be used. Get some rest and do something great for yourself tomorrow."
1yfdv4,6,2014-02-20,I don't know what to do,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1yfdv4/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I feel like I have destroyed my life and will never be able to be proud of myself. I didn't study in high school and did very poorly, It took me 2 extra years after i finished high school to get into college and when I got there I didn't feel the desire to learn so I failed and flunked out. I'm back in school now and have to make a CV so that I can apply for an internship. However, my GPA is really bad and because I failed a really important course during my first year, I don't have the knowledge I am supposed to have for my career path so I don't see how I can get an internship or be of any use when I get there.

My parents like to remind me how much of a failure and disappointment I am. Unfortunately they only have one child and that child is a source of shame. I'm afraid for my future because I am a failure and I'm not sure if I will ever find employment if I do.

Can you please check my logic?

1. My current rent is 1300. One year renewal lease will be 1400, two year renewal lease is 1450.

2. Market: from craigslist and trulia, the cheapest apt I found in my area is 1200. The next cheapest is 1250. But there is one apt of each. 3 apts available for 1300. I didn't like any of these because they were either on the 1st floor, they were smaller than my current apt or no dogs. There were also 2 apt for 1350, 3 for 1400 and 5 for 1450.

3. I don't want to move to a different area because I will be further away from the city, won't have a grocery store/laundromat near by and I don't have a car/don't drive, I need to be very close to the train station. 

4. I figure with broker fee/realtor's fee (1200), credit check (150) and 1st months rent (1200), moving (600) it would only make sense to move to an apt that costs 1200 or less; and I stay in it for 2 years. Over a 2 year period that will save me ~1700.

5. I'm apprehensive about my decision because I was laid off late last year and I decided to go back to school this fall. I'm currently studying for the GMAT and will be applying shortly. If I get into the school then I will take 1 - 2 years off and live off my savings (which I can afford). I will also do internships during the summer. If I don't get into school I will get a job and nothing will change. 


From my observation:

It makes sense to stay in my current residence, since there is nothing available under 1200. I'm not 100% set on a 1 or 2 year lease, but they are both within the market value of apts renting in my area. I plan to stay in my current city for at least 5+ years. And I'm assuming the prices will continue to rise next year. I will pay an extra 1200 if I take the 2 year renewal lease. I think 2 years would make sense?

edited: added: moving costs, ""realtor's fee"", savings for 2 years if my apt costs 1200."

(Sophomore Computer Engineering Student),sporaticism,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1yh8c5/which_internship_should_i_choose_sophomore/,"So, I'm in the lucky position of having to choose between two possible internships for this summer. I have talked to my professors, family, and friends, and I haven't really gotten a good consensus as to which would be better. So the first one is with..

 * [Gentex Corporation](http://www.gentex.com/): This company is the world's leading producer of auto-dimming rear view mirrors sold to every major car manufacturer in the world (as well as some other cool products, like the Dreamliner's dimming windows). They are a growing company and are located near Grand Rapids MI, which would be a good place to live in the summer (I have people I can stay with there). They pay $16.50 an hour, and allow interns to work overtime (Time and a half over 40 hours, up to 60 hours). I was the only sophomore interviewed by the company (out of ~20 students), and all my friends who were interviewed were not given an offer (I was the day after the interview). They have a more structured intern program, but I'm not sure exactly what projects I would work on. So not too many cons, besides that if I were to get hired by them after graduation, it's a ""work your way from the bottom"" type of company. Which would be kinda rough. 

So the next choice is..

 * [The Air Force Institute of Technology](http://www.afit.edu/) located on Wright Patterson Air Force Base. I was offered an intern position with their Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics to help graduate students design and develop satellite technology. They were able to give me a tour of their labs and command center, and it was very impressive stuff. The work environment is much more relaxed, and focused on learning (it is an accredited graduate school after all). I would work 40 hours a week, without the option of overtime, at 14-16$ an hour. However, many students from my school (A smaller private school in south western Ohio) have continued to work with AFIT part time during the following school year. I am planning on pursuing a masters degree sometime after I get my undergraduate degree, and having this experience would definitely help my grad school applications. 

So, what are your opinions on which one I should choose? I must let Gentex know my decision early next week.

I ended up going to grad school the next year, and got a Finance Master of Science in one full year (normally a two year degree), because Finance was an extension of the math skills I picked up in physics, and it seemed much more interesting than any physics job would be. I never had a specific job in mind when I got the degree, and that is coming back to bite me in the ass.

Since I did my degree so quickly, out of necessity, I again didn't have time for internships. I know that is my fault, and I should have worked harder to make time, but that's moot at this point.

It's been two years since I graduated from that masters program, and I still haven't found a job. I've had some summer jobs in the interim, but nothing steady, and now my parents are saying that I have to move back home in short order if I can't find work. Any work, since they will still help me out, they're just looking to move and can't afford to pay for me to live in Chicago anymore if they buy a new house (Michigan housing market, they'd have two houses for a while).

I am looking for some advice on what kind of jobs, either a field or a specific position, that hires people without experience. Even jobs that say 0 - 2 year only really want people with 1 - 2 years, and ""entry level"" jobs all seem to require at least an internship in that field. I am really sick of going in to interviews just to have them tell me that someone else with a similar academic background is getting the job because they have experience. It got really bad for a while, with people who got fired from jobs and were willing to take pay cuts to do these entry level positions.  How was I supposed to compete with someone who has been doing this since I was in elementary school?

One of my friends told me the IT guy at his doctoral lab was a physics undergrad with a computer science minor like me who had no experience. Do tech jobs really hire people who have no previous IT experience as long as they're knowledgeable about computers? I could do that, and I do have a minor in computer science, but I don't want to open my search up to another field if there's no chance of getting a job there."

I underestimated the difficulty of doing this and balancing sleep/work/staying in shape, plus I need to buy a new car so I've been dealing with that. 
Basically, I've realized that I probably need to drop Comp Architecture or forsake my social life because sleep + work aren't going away. If I do, I'll be taking it next fall whenever I won't be working (or at least only part time) and I'll be more ready to take that on.
The only issues are a) I've already been in college for a while (ideally I would be graduating this year) and full-time work this semester has only slowed me down more and b) I'm not sure what the consequences could be for dropping a class besides wasting the money I borrowed to pay for it (which obviously really, really sucks). If it's just losing the money, then I'll probably suck it up and do it.  

So basically I'm just looking for insight here before I make my decision. Thanks a lot, whoosh, etc."
1yi1ad,1,2014-02-20,Biochemistry major looking to do Mathematics of Computation Double major or Bioinformatics minor. Career Possibilities/Prospects?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1yi1ad/biochemistry_major_looking_to_do_mathematics_of/,"Hi. I am currently a student that goes to UCLA. I entered UCLA thinking I would go the pre-medicine route with a biochemsitry major However, Biochemistry is one of the few ""Life/Physical Science"" majors that requires undergraduates  to take the engineering chemistry and math series.  Around winter quarter of my freshman year, I lost interest in the pre-medicine route and was thinking about doing engineering instead because I had taken a handful of the engineering pre-reqs and I enjoyed them, even though I was struggling in these classes. I worked hard Spring Quarter of my freshman year and took summer courses and the end of my sophomore year fall quarter, I applied to UCLA's Bioengineering program but was not able to get in because my GPA was lower than their requirements. At this point, it is still possible but highly unlikely that I will get into the bioengineering program. 

So I started to think of a back up plan. 

Over Winter break, I did a little Code Academy and enjoyed learning the basics of JavaScript and really wanted to learn a lot more. Unfortunately, UCLA's computer science department falls under the College of Engineering and my likelihood of getting in is very slim. However, I definitely wanted to incorporate some computer science in addition to the the curriculum I was taking. Furthermore even though biochemistry was a hard subject and I was struggling, I really enjoyed it. I also realized that I enjoyed many of the math classes that I had taken up to that that point (everything but differential equations). 

So this quarter I had decided that I want to go for a mathematics of computation- Biochemistry double major. However, upon talking to the counselor about my plan, she said that I am most likely going to go over my unit cap of 216 units. I would probably petition. My counselor also suggested that i look into bioinformatics. I did a ton of research and it does sound very interesting.  

All in all, I was wondering:

* If anyone works in the Bioinformatics field or Computational Biology or any field that incorporates elements of Biochemistry and Math, could you give me some input on what you do and what the field in general entails? How is your job like, etc..

* How marketable will I be with a Math degree paired with Biochemistry if I am interested in going into the Pharmaceutical or Biotech industries? Will it pay well or do I need to pursue a PhD?

* If my petition is denied and I am unable to do a double major with math, I am most likely going to pursue a minor in bioinformatics. Will this make me marketable in the job market or do I need to continue my education and pursue a PhD? Is there even any future prospect along that route?

* My GPA is currently very average ( slightly above 3.0). Apart from working on my GPA, what more can I do to make myself more marketable in front of a potential employer?

I am currently looking for a internship in the Bioinformatics field. Any advice would be more than helpful. Thanks!"

I realize there are a lot of prospective college students on this subreddit, but figured I'd ask this question for other college students and above.

I had a study abroad opportunity in the summer fall through today, and I'm going to have to find an internship or something to not waste my summer away.

Though my hometown has a lot of great opportunities, I honestly don't want to stay home with my parents for three whole months. Last summer, I met someone, from a different state, who was staying at an apartment for her internship. Another friend of mine was living in her friend's, who were away for the summer. The thing is, I have no idea how they got those opportunities.  

So, few questions: 

1. Is renting apartments for only a summer (~3 months) a conventional thing? 

2. If so, how the hell do I go about that? 

Thanks in advance! "

My brother and I were homeschooled until high school, because my dad told my mother her spending habits (which are on par with his) were out of control and she needed to get a job again to support them, and therefore she couldn't continue homeschooling us. I lived in the (freshmen only except in special cases) dorms all through my undergraduate education except for my final year, because I had the choice of living there or at home (an hour and 45 minutes from where I went to college) and then moved back in for my final year. 

Things were semi-okay until I moved out after I graduated in order to do an internship in another state and attempt to be an adult. Since then, she enjoys calling me and berating me during her drive to and/or from work about never coming home (which has to be for the *entire* weekend Friday night to Monday morning even though I am not a minor and do not live there even part-time, can't be just for Saturday night dinner or something), how I must hate my 82-year-old grandmother, detailing everyone's physical ailments to me and how horrible that it is I'm not there to help them and be with them, telling me how miserable and unsuccessful I'll be if I don't listen to her and/or come home because she's ""seen it in other people"". I realize it's probably completely unfair to block out my dad, brother, and grandmother along with her, but she drives me crazy. Every time I talk to her I can't focus for several hours afterward, I feel like probably killing myself is the only way I could get away from her, and she dismisses anything I have to say against her and her behaviour because my family loves me, and if I loved them and was a good daughter I'd just come visit them for a weekend. Her favourite thing to say is either ""I didn't say that"" or ""you're being dramatic again."" My whole life she's told me I have a dramatic personality. Maybe I do. I'm not even sure anymore since she exaggerates everything else, and considering I'm incredibly introverted and generally try to avoid causing any trouble or having any attention on me negative or positive, I highly doubt that's the case.

She says they have a great time and always get along and stuff, but whenever I visit or am at their house for any period of time &gt; 2 hours, some drama always goes down, whether it's my brother tuning everyone out by playing video games and refusing to answer anyone who talks to him, my grandmother shutting herself in her room too much, my dad getting angry/paranoid for no reason and breaking shit or just being verbally destructive, or my mom just creating unneccessary noise and drama. I'm terrified I'm like her or that something's wrong with me in general because I'm pushing them away, but whenever I overcome my doubt and interact with her it just ends up fucking with my head again. If I answer the phone she verbally beats me up either over my shortcomings or things that have gone wrong during her day; if I come home she complains to me constantly and all kinds of drama that could be avoided happens. 

It makes me want to never speak to anyone again, especially people who profess love for me, and it's made having meaningful romantic relationships really, really hard. I started going to a therapist and that's helping some, but I don't know what to do. There's no way I can change her, and to avoid her is to avoid the rest of my family. The worst part is, the concerns she brings up are at least partially valid, though her reasoning is full of logical flaws and I generally don't have the 4 hours of travel time plus multiple hours of social ""oh you can't go to your room now, the TV show is getting good, sit here and watch it with us even though you don't watch TV, profess to hate it, and don't own a TV"" because I'm in graduate school and working at the same time, to be there as much as she'd like. 

My grandma is getting old, and I do need to call her more often. I'd like to hang out with my brother more but I don't generally know what to say. if I spend extended time with my mother, my father, or my grandmother they just talk at me to fill space even though I have absolutely nothing to contribute to the conversation other than ""yeah, uh huh, that sounds horrible, oh my goodness"" over and over and over. I've never told any of them shit and yet my mother tells me I never share anything *anymore* and I used to.

Am I a terrible person for wanting to stay away from her so much I start to lie and tell her how much homework I have even if I am done for the week, or if I have plans (even if then she makes me feel bad for having plans because I can't spare *one single weekend* to come home)? Is there something wrong with me that I want pretty much absolutely nothing to do with any of them, have nothing in common with any of them (they're fundamentalist, conservative, capitalistic, and demand everyone share their views) except my brother, and want them to leave me the fuck alone? I've even started researching personality disorders because I'm terrified *I* have one, because the way she/my dad/everyone tells it is everything is perfect all the time, except then I come home and everything's a shambles and people are yelling and drama everywhere and my brother shuts everything out and my grandmother hides in her room. I just want them to forget I exist. Is there any way to be in *good* contact with them, convince my mother I don't need to come home for an entire weekend, and interact with her/my dad/my grandmother without being overwhelmed by the amount of emotion I get barraged with any time I talk to any of them, especially my mom? How do I avoid emulating their behaviour? How do I have a better relationship with my brother without jeopardizing his relationship (or lack thereof) with the rest of my family? Is it bad that I just want them to leave me alone to the extent that I start to avoid all humanity in general when my mum's really gotten to me?

tl;dr entire family messed up, how can I deal with it without unravelling myself? I'm not entirely sure *I'm* not the crazy one and that they're all normal and people are just like this but I can't cope. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, and holy crap that was way longer than intended D: !!"
1yij8x,9,2014-02-21,[Build Help] A different build for specific needs. Should I go hackintosh?,galaxy_beef,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1yij8x/build_help_a_different_build_for_specific_needs/,"I've been lurking on buildapc for just under a year now. I've built computers in the past, so I'm not worried about being able to assemble the parts I order. My biggest problem lies in matching up the kind of build I need with my specific uses, and I'd like to see if anyone on here has been in a similar position to me. 

For starters, I DO want a gaming pc. That is why I'm building a rig. If it were that simple, I'd have no reason to ask a question here. My problem lies with a couple factors. 1) I'm an amateur sound engineer/ music producer, and 2) because of that, I'm pretty heavily into the apple ecosystem when it comes to software, plugins, etc. 

1) When I first got into recording bands and whatnot, I built a &lt;$400 pc back in 2009. It wasn't a great pc, couldn't handle games or anything because a graphics card didn't fit in the budget. It had driver errors here and pops and clicks and all kinds of horrendous hiccups, but it got the job done for some light recording in Cubase.  After finding a studio to intern at in Atlanta, I decided to save up and buy a macbook Pro. I bought Pro Tools 9 (which I've upgraded to 10), and man.. It was a whole different world. I've rarely had any problems with recording, and things just work really well all the time.

I'm getting to the point that I'm ready to upgrade, although the macbook still gets the job done just fine. It's a late 2011 MBP 15"". Processor:  2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 || Memory  16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3. Like I said, not bad, but I want a gaming pc AND I could use some boosted performance for recording. 

2) So the biggest problem here is moving over to a windows rig. Protools support on windows is nonexistent from what I hear, and every person I've talked to in the industry (albeit they aren't computer guys) say to stay away from pc with pro tools. If someone here is able to use protools with no errors on their pc, please let me know. Besides pro tools, I've got tons of other softwares/ plugins for mac that I don't know if it would be worth the full switch over. Another problem I have is that I hear firewire support with windows is sketchy, and I've got $500 invested in a great firewire audio interface (Saffire Pro 40). 

So I see my options like this..

1. Dual boot Hackintosh &amp; Windows 7. I wouldn't have to lose anything I currently have going on my current setup. I could make a beast of a computer for way less money than I could buy it for, and still be able to get into pc gaming. The problem here is money. I'd end up having to buy more specific parts that the hackintosh community has deemed usable (there may be better values out there if I went with any parts I wanted). I'd have to go with two SSDs to have both OS's on different drives. I'd also have to deal with the hassle of having to reboot in and out of the OS's, which seems like it would get annoying. Still, unless someone can convince me that protools/firewire is a safe bet on windows, this seems like the best way to go. 

2. Figure out a way to use windows 7 for everything. I am a CS student and will need a mac to do some programming, but I'll have the laptop regardless. I'm just not convinced that a windows machine will run my recording setup with no issues. 

3. Keep using the macbook for recording bands, build a computer just for gaming. I feel like this would just be a waste of money. I have video game systems and I don't think I'll be shelling out $1,500 for another one. 

Seriously, if anyone has any experience in a situation similar to mine, I would really appreciate the feedback. Oh, and the most I'd like to spend on this rig is $1,800. I'd like to keep it around $1,500 if possible.

1yiqka,10,2014-02-21,"I am a 20 year old man, looking for advice in many personal/professional aspects of life, and for direction towards a self-disciplined path.",[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1yiqka/i_am_a_20_year_old_man_looking_for_advice_in_many/,"I am a 20 year old American male. Sophomore at University on full merit scholarship, studying Computer Science and Math. I am of slim physique, 135 lbs. and nearly 6 feet tall. I am of decent intelligence (3.6 GPA in Computer Science, generally excel at liberal arts studies, online IQ tests lead me to believe I am at around a 130 IQ). I am a musician: I play the saxophone and was brought up learning piano. I've always been a good student, a decent friend, and everyone has told me I am going to be great. Now that I have so much freedom with my time and habits, I want to really start becoming the man I want to be.

I am a decent student at a small liberal arts school, I think often, I write rarely. I would like to work in the computer science industry and I'm pretty sure I can be successful there. I already have a paid summer internship lined up and my resume, by the time I graduate, will be a tremendous asset for starting my career. My school is well-regarded for the liberal arts, and its CS/engineering department is growing but small. I am an only child, and close (but growing distant from the long distance) with my parents. Ultimately, I see myself doing something unique - starting my own business, working in animation or film, or teaching English - but before I get there, and before I get too rooted down in a career, I want to begin bettering myself, and broaden my experiences. I am just not sure where to start.

My goals are (in no particular order):

1.) Gain mass, and become as physically fit as possible. I enjoy swimming, I am okay at the gym, but I have no regiment or schedule, and my form on most weight-training exercises is not good. My posture is poor and my flexibility and mobility is below average. I am not sure where to start to fix all of this. Recommendations for particular fitness programs geared toward young slim men trying to gain mass and strength, for yoga programs for someone with absolutely no experience with yoga and poor flexibility/posture, for meditation, for diet, all of that, I would gladly accept. 

2.) Become a man. I am an only child, and have never really had to share or be overly concerned with the comforts of others. I want to change this, become more selfless, develop meaningful relationships, and become more confident in general with new people, friendships, and women. I have looked at The Red Pill and I don't know how much it resonates with me. I want to remain respectful of women, and learn from them, but I also want to be a man, and know what that means, too. I want to look like a manly man, act like a manly man, keep neat, respectful, informed, and confident like a man. Short of joining the armed forces, how can I start building these key habits? How can I become disciplined, confident, and manly?

3.) Become more disciplined with my time. My sleep schedule is generally unpredictable and shitty. I live in a Fraternity house so there are always many sources of distraction, but I want to become productive during the day, rise early, work in my free time, and relax in the evenings. On weekends, I want to still rise early, and be productive. I always think of myself as a successful adult, rising with the sunrise, going for a jog, eating a full breakfast and coffee, reading and writing, really taking advantage of that 5am-9am time before any of my classes start, to better myself and make good use of my early morning, rather than sleep it away.

4.) Become a better writer. I'm not bad (I receive good grades on essays in classes, I'm better than most, and I have a good voice), but there are areas that need improvement: my grammar needs to be strengthened, vocabulary enriched, and mindset broadened. Ultimately I would like to teach English, or write. Much will happen between now and then, but I want to know what to do. Should I read more classics? Write every day? Both? Something else?

5.) Gain an edge in the Computer Science industry. Right now I have only completed a few courses (have completed Fundamentals I and II, both in Python, with II teaching most data structures, also completed Calc I-III, currently in Computer Organization - a hardware class - and Interactive Computer Graphics - an OpenGL/C++ class - and Linear Algebra and College Physics II) but I'm starting to get well on my way to completing a B.S.; however, I want to self-study and I'm not sure where to start. What are the most important aspects of CS to dedicate my time to, if I truly want to be successful?

6.) Become better with money, budgeting, taxes, all of that - I will be making a decent salary this summer for three months at an internship, and this will be my first time having such an income. What should I know about budgeting, saving money, paying taxes, all of that.

7.) Cut the vices. Over my first two years away from home, I've smoked a decent amount of weed, a cig here and there, hookah with friends, a few drinks if there's a party, LSD once. I don't really regret going through any of that -- I never did any of that in high school, so I needed to experience it at the end of my teens -- but now that I am entering my 20s I feel like I need to cut out all that crap and be an old-fashioned good man who drinks a decent amount of coffee, alcohol socially, drugs rarely. I want to be able to live with myself, and take good care of my body. I also tentatively include pornography with these vices and I, like most young men, am an avid consumer, and I think it needs to stop.

8.) Take good care of my body. This sort of goes with (1). I want to learn how to cook good meals (I really have no idea how to cook most things) so I can stop going to restaurants so much when I'm not at school/home, I want to develop good eating habits (I am underweight, always have been, and fed up with being that way). I want to have good quality of sleep. I want to be flexible. I want to have a healthy heart, organs, brain, and skin (I've always had light acne and I want it to stop, advice for that would be great). I want to fix my posture. I want to think clearly. What vitamins, nootropics, lotions, face soaps, etc should I invest in? Good ways to start meditating? Recipes for those clueless about cooking?

That is about it. I'm open to anything. I'm a 20-year old male, with the world in front of him. I've had a sheltered life. I've travelled but always had a plan. I've gone far away for school but collected no debt. I'm only a few semesters into my major yet I have a full-time internship lined up. I weigh 135 on a good day and 130 on a bad one. I am just kinda floating along doing well enough, but I'm not truly happy. Things seem to fall into place pretty well for me, and I don't want to screw it up. I want to take advantage of this freedom and these good circumstances to become a man, confident and well-dressed, fit and flexible, disciplined and productive, neat and old-fashioned, rested and healthy, informed and well-read, prepared for a CS career and a better writer, and comfortable with money.

When my father was 20, he dropped out of college and worked shit jobs to stay afloat, and made himself a success. He gained discipline through rough times. Sometimes I think I need to experience such roughness to become a man. Because my circumstances don't force me to become more disciplined, but rather provide me freedom of time and money, I need to learn self-discipline. I know there is a wealth of information out there about the things I have asked for help with. But if any of you have gone through similar times, and found answers in a particular place, plan, idea, or subreddit, I would love your advice and direction. Thank you, and best of luck with your own endeavors. "

That said, note that I am completely new to web development (I have only done minimal Java, C++ and Objective C prior to this internship).  

This burning out issue bothers me because 1) I'm only five days in to my ""career"" and I'm already feeling this way and 2) well, I want to have a life after work -- I want to be able to hit the gym with enough energy to complete my workout, or to be able to go out with my friends for dinner without calling it a night at 9pm citing tiredness.  

For those of you who are in this line of work, regardless of how many days/years of experience you have, do you feel the same way after a day of work? And for those of you who have spent a longer time in this field, do you become immune (or at least less prone) to burning out? How do you guys generally feel after work?

edit: punctuation
edit2: Thank you all for your responses! I don't want to reply to them all individually because I'd consider that rather spam-y. It's great to have an idea of how each of you handle this issue and I will keep all of your advice in mind when (if) I do go on to become a programmer."
1yjiqc,1,2014-02-21,Facebook’s Company Pages Strategy and How-To,VonazonInc,socialmedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1yjiqc/facebooks_company_pages_strategy_and_howto/,"This article will guide you in how to set up a company Facebook page as well as strategies for how to manage it.

While Facebook may have lost a step with the cool kids it is still America’s go-to social network. If you don’t think your company or brand need to have a Facebook page(s) consider this: chances are your competitors already have them. This is a lost opportunity to increase brand awareness and drive revenue. If that’s not enough think about the multiple social outlets willing to give voice to your clients opinion about an experience with your organization. There is no need for you to be unaware of publicly posted complaints about your organization. Setting up a page is easy. While there are fifteen steps to setting up a Facebook page for your company (we know three more than an addiction recovery program) it shouldn’t involve tears.

Facebook Company Page Setup Instructions:

Go to Facebook.com and make sure you are logged into the account you want to manage this new page from- probably your personal account.
Click on the “Create Page” option
Choose what type of page you want to have. This will be generally either be “company” or “brand/product” depending on your needs.
Choose the category best describing your industry. Be careful, you cannot change your company category unless you delete the page once chosen.
Type in the name of your company; no capital letters in the middle of a word. For example, Facebook would have been acceptable but not FaceBook.
Check the “Agree to Terms” box (perhaps you should have a lawyer for this part)
Click “Get Started”
Add a description of your page. Keep it clear and brief.
Add websites your clients will be able to access from Facebook page.
Facebook wants to know if your organization is real, we’ll leave this one up to you.
If you answered “Yes” Facebook wants to know if it is your company. This is where you can add administration privileges so you can potentially prevent the intern from posting photos of what they looked like after happy hour.
Upload your company logo. Follow Facebook’s specifications.
Add the page to your favorites on your Facebook account and your web browser for easy access.
Ad posting. This will be the first of Facebook’s many attempts to separate your organization from some of its money. Skip this for now
Voila, you have a Facebook page.
 

Your Facebook Company Page Strategies

We do not recommend posting every minute to your account. Consider how often you want to be updated on social networks from your clients when deciding to post a message. Until your page has thirty “likes” and you have access to Facebook’s analytical tools (data about your customers browsing habits), block search engines from finding the page. Make it a perk for your biggest fans and favored clients to have the first look at your Facebook page and “like” your page and make suggestions to spruce it up. Once you are confident everything is in working order unblock search engines and let anyone “like” you on Facebook.

There is a variety of content that can be posted to Facebook. You can link to sections of your website, photos, videos, product information, blogs, customer testimonials and more. Most of your content should be about your company, but feel free to post client content, acceptable humor, unsung employee heroes and the occasional viral video.

Don’t forget to play good defense. Set up Facebook pages for names like “(Yourcompany)sucks” and use your imagination as to what anyone with an ax to grind can dream up to follow your company or product name. You may want to have a duplicate page for common misspellings of your page name as well. Follow these tips and with the new business your page brings in you may be able to afford a social media department!"

1ykdcx,3,2014-02-21,I made a big mistake in my one year relationship with my girlfriend,[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1ykdcx/i_made_a_big_mistake_in_my_one_year_relationship/,"I've been going out with my girlfriend for about a year. I started dating her for personal reasons while she was a senior in high school. Today she's a 19 year old freshmen and I am a 21 year old male commuting to campus while she lives in the dorms.

Last semester we spent every moment we could together, made plans to see each other every weekend, and she didn't even go to parties just to be with me. The result of this was that by the time she was gone for winter break? I really didn't have much to do. I played video games, went to my internship, worked out, and hanged with my friends who I didn't get to hang out with for a while.

An important thing to note is that I transferred to the same university as she did (not because of her but because to was the closest one) and my social circle is back to ground zero. I have my friends from high school but they all chose to discontinue their academics meanwhile I pursued. My girlfriend came to the university because it was coincidentally her first choice.

I'm not here to discuss the issues of my relationship but I am noticing that she is not hanging out with me as much often, she's been busy with academics, and she just got initiated by a sorority. 

One weekend I realized after she had to go to a mixer that I really didn't have any other plans. It felt weird not being with her, sleeping over, going out, etc.

I felt alone. I took the initiative by joining some clubs and organizations (I refuse to do Greek life) and starting to make new people, get my name out there, and get my mind off of my girlfriend.

I've joined a college catholic ministry, martial arts club, Latino Leadership Club, and a salsa club. I can say I'm having a great time but unfortunately I still wish I could be with my girlfriend most of the time.

What can I do to cope with these feelings? Am I taking the right steps to being social/creating a new social circle?

Please share your thoughts. "

1ykka5,1,2014-02-21,"(EX) Girlfriend [20F] of 3 months broke up with me [20M], said she doesn’t feel like being in a relationship at the moment but still wants to be friends. I can’t move on, and desperately want her back. Need advice.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ykka5/ex_girlfriend_20f_of_3_months_broke_up_with_me/,"A bit of background information on our relationship. We met in college during the first week of classes and we quickly became friends. We could tell that we both liked each other, and after a month or so of getting to know each other and formalities we started dating. Everything was great. We spent almost every day together, practically lived under the same roof for the rest of the semester.  We clicked, fell hard and fast. After the semester ended, she landed herself an internship and moved back to her home city to work for the next semester, while I stayed in school. During this time, I live 1.5 hr drive away from her, and we would skype/call every day and I would go to visit her over the weekends. 

About a month earlier on a Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I got into an argument over something really small (I think it was about music preferences). She’s pretty sensitive, so similar situations had happened before where she’d get mad initially, but I would apologize and suck it up and the arguments would be over in an hr. However, this time I had brought up the issue that she’s always overreacting to small things, which made me feel like I’m always getting the shorter end of the stick. I had a feeling that eventually everything that’s stored inside will break because there’s only so much I can take, and I didn’t want anyone to get hurt in the future, so I wanted us to work together and fix this issue. But after a talk over skype she said she’s seeing more problems in our relationship, and that she can’t change or compromise. She asked for some time alone to think about stuff, to which I agreed.
 
Fast-forward to the weekend, I went over to see her. We had a talk and she said we shouldn’t see each other for a while. She said she doesn’t want to be in a relationship right now because she can’t compromise, she’s treating me less than what I deserve, doesn’t appreciate me as much as she should, and that I’ll be better off finding someone else that deserves me. She also says that she loves and cares for me and still wants to be friends, and that “if we’re meant to be, we’ll be together again”. As much as I tried going against it, she said she has made up her mind. I want to wait for her, so I asked if she still sees us back together in the future, she said yes, but she doesn’t want to make empty promises and give me false hope.

For the next couple of weeks, we still talk/text/skype every day, and although they were in a bit of a platonic manner, I can tell that we still have feelings for each other. Our texts would be the first things we see in the morning, and our voices would be the last thing we hear before we sleep. Following these signs, I thought this wasn’t gonna be as bad as I thought it’d be, and that I can wait for her and be back together again sometime in the future. But since last week, she has been talking less and less, and just seems very uninterested. I feel that she’s given up and moved on.

Needless to say, I was heartbroken since the breakup. Still am.  I know that 3 months is relatively short compared to most, but it doesn’t indicate how we felt about each other. Aside from the occasional bickerings, we were perfect for one another. We really wanted each other to be “the one”, as cliché as that sounds. We loved each other so much that our relationship suddenly falling apart seems so unreal, almost like a nightmare. If anything, the thought that “we had loved” is the only thing that eases me to sleep at night for the past few days.

And now the worst part is that not only has she moved on and I haven’t (don’t think I ever will, at least for a while), I don’t know if I can be friends with her, because I can’t bear the thought or sight of her dating anyone else, although she said she won’t. I also feel that the reasons she gave for the breakup, the good old “it’s not you it’s me” is not the main or only reason we broke up, and I want to know more about what she thinks, but I’m afraid that I’ll push her away even further if I press her for answers.

I feel lost and confused. I’m angry but I don’t know who or what I’m angry at. What do what do.

Thanks


---   
TL;DR

G/f of 3 months broke up saying she doesn’t want a relationship, still wants to be friends, but her recent actions lately says otherwise. She seems to have moved on pretty quick, I haven’t and I don’t think I can, and I want to wait for her, as foolish as that sounds. There are also many questions that I want to ask her, but don’t know how to bring it up given the situation that we’re in. I don’t know what to do. How do I move on so that we can at least still be friends?

* What sort of projects should I be working on to make my resume look good? 

* What are the different types of web development? What sort of languages/frameworks do you need to do them?

* I'm planning to learn JavaScript, PHP, the Django/Flask frameworks for Python, and some Java/Android stuff. Is there anything I'm missing? 

* Are there any websites that focus specifically on web dev job postings?

* Does anyone know of any summer web dev internships in Seattle?

* What's your favorite platform (Windows, OSX, Linux) for web development?

1ylpe9,2,2014-02-22,I don't know what to do with my car.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ylpe9/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_car/,"Today, I considered the decision to possibly get rid of my car. My car is a Volvo 740 GLE Station Wagon with 197,000 miles. I bought it about a year and a half ago and it has treated me well. It is my first car and It has lots of personality, I like it a lot. I bought it as a broke college student for only $1200. But at this point in my life, I feel as if the car is dragging me down, I always have to do these little things to make it work properly, I've beaten it to hell, but even though I've beaten it up, she still runs. I barely use it, but when I do, it is very convenient. 

I live on a college campus and go to school full time. I also work on campus so my job is a short walk. I only make $8.00 and hour and work 20 hours a week, I consistently run low on money all the time. I live paycheck to paycheck. My insurance costs about $70 a month and I feel as if I didn't have a car, that money could be more suitable for my savings account, I have next to nothing saved. Plus, I wouldn't be spending any money on gas which the car isn't good at conserving either. Although, it runs okay now, it's still a hassle sometimes to use my car because I have stupid electrical issues that make my car hard to start, so i always need a jump. I could just get a new battery and have my electrical system looked at, but that costs money, and I don't really have money if you haven't picked up on that yet. I also notice small signs of the car failing at some point in the future like many oil leakages after heavy usage of the car. Also, a possible water pump/gasket replacement in the future, considering the coolant leaks out of it. There are other tiny things that could fail at any moment; probably at a time where I would need the car most. 

Before I got my car, I used to bike everywhere, I was in decent shape. I biked 12 miles everyday or rode the bus to get to work(before I worked on campus). Yes, sometimes I didn't want to do it, but I managed to get it done. Since getting a car, I have become lazy, I've gained 60 pounds and I am in less of the shape I used to be. I value health greatly, but I've let stress and laziness get the best of me; If I go back to the way it used to be, I'd be forced to bike or bus to places I need to get too. With a car, I would decide on a whim to go to eat food at a restaurant, which also doesn't help me keeping my weight down and saving money. Overall, I think biking helps keep my stress levels down as well. 

That being said, there are some things my car is very useful for; I can go to my parents house to pick up stuff I might need. My parents house is only about 10 miles away but I don't typically need to go to my parents house all the time. Also, I plan on, although it isn't set in stone, to live off campus next semester, which would make my commute to campus a hassle with a bike, especially in cold or rainy weather. If I lived off campus, I would of course have a better job to afford living there, probably an internship for computer science. My dad also might help me with some money to pay the rent, but my dad unfortunately isn't a very dependable person but sometimes he comes through. Point being, having an internship would mean a commute for that as well. There is decent public transportation and I have a few good friends that might help me get to important places(interviews, doctors appointments, grocery shopping) if I have no other options. If you have any other questions to help you help me, let me know! Thanks Reddit.

**TL;DR I have a car that I feel is dragging me down. I make $8 an hour on campus, don't have enough money to save and I feel the car will soon be a money pit, but sometimes the car is very useful and I'll be missing out on that. what should I do?**

I'm still thinking about ending, but your words have helped me consider the consequences of my actions, and your guidance has helped as well. Thank you.]

The last year and a half has been absolute hell. 

My wife and I married in Oct 2012 and we found out my wife was pregnant in late November. 
We were so happy.  We had waited 3 long years to get her into the states from her home country of Egypt. Everything was great. I had a good paying job, and I was 2 semesters away from graduating with my B.A. 

In Dec '12 and Jan '13, my wife became very ill due to the pregnancy. I had to leave early from work 3 times because she had fainted or became very dizzy. My boss decided to fire me because of this. When I stated that it was due to her health he coldly responded, ""You two chose to have a baby, and that's not my problem."" I felt so terrible. 

We had to move out of our apartment and move in with my mother. My idea of being a provider and an independent person were shattered in a month. I have always been proud, but my pride ended when I knew we needed financial assistance through unemployment benefits and other programs. It was so emasculating. I know programs are there for situations like this but it did not hurt any less to think that I was unable to provide for my family. What hurt more was we couldn't get any assistance beyond unemployment benefits because immigration rules. 

By May '13, I was hopeless. I hated myself, and I couldn't help but blame my wife and the baby for me losing my job. I never told her that, and I never will. I was grasping for any job, and I finally took a job out of desperation at an office supply mega-chain store.  It was sole crushing. Driving 40 miles one-way for a job that paid only $12 at 20 hours a week. At least it paid more than unemployment. 

Things improved in July '13 when a business offered me a good paying position as a Bookkeeper and Compliance specialist. My son was born in July as well. My premature happiness set me up for a big fall.

My wife wanted to return to Egypt with our son to show him to the in-laws and finish out her last year of school. After a great deal of discussion, I agreed and she said she would be gone for 9 months. I was alone, again. After all that time it took to be together, she wanted to leave me again. I understand why. Our son would spend most of his life in the US and it wouldn't be fair to exclude her family from seeing him growing up. 

By Oct '13 my new well paying job was in danger. Part of the business was running at a loss. I recommended to the owner that we either shut down that part of the business or reorganize to make it more profitable. I provided an entire outline of what we could do. The owner said this was her business and she will run it how she wanted to. My salary was cut 3 times and she still did not close the failing side of the business. By Dec '13 the entire business folded and I am now without work. I had finished my degree, but now I have no way to pay my loans. 

My wife and son are far away. I have no job, and I am literally worth more dead than alive. All the debt is in my name, and they can't go after my family. In Egypt, they would be taken care of by her family. I am borrowing money left and right to pay the minimum balance credit card debt that I accrued during my last bout of unemployment, and the only job I have is as an unpaid intern for a local government agency. They have no budget to offer a part-time job or even a stipend.  

I am desperate for work and without hope. I have no money to get my family back here, and if they were here, I wouldn't be able to provide for them. 

I know this is the life I chose, but now I feel the only way out of the pain is by choosing ending it. I know my problems are probably trivial to true suffering, but I'm probably not very strong compared to others. "

1ylqxs,1,2014-02-22,I'm [23/m] not sure if I should even have the idea of rekindling my friendship with [23/f]. How can I get over her?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ylqxs/im_23m_not_sure_if_i_should_even_have_the_idea_of/,"I'll try to make it as non-cringy as possible but I feel that it is not possible and its super cheesy and overtly melodramatic.

So, I had a confidant and to me she was a really good buddy. She was in a relationship with a friend, so I never actually 'liked' her but I really enjoyed her company. Maybe because she was one of the very few girls we had in our program or because she was super nice. Anyways, I was a man-child and I had my tantrums, but generally it was against other people and I would then confide my issues in her. It was not a healthy relationship but overall I feel that she enjoyed the time with me and we had a good friendship.

Because of our program, we sort of worked in different companies for a year and she started having family issues. But me being a man-child and a massive idiot got really annoyed at her when she didn't reply to my texts or messages. (A year earlier it had been perfect where we would talk regularly and it was really fun). This went on for about 7-8 months where I would get angry at her every few weeks for not replying or other things. Frankly now that I think about it, I can't believe she even kept that going for 7-8 months. I was in a really bad depression in that time frame because the work was boring and it was a drag. Eventually, we had a huge fight where words were exchanged and then it was imminent that its not gonna last long. However, we tried being friends, being nice to each other. But eventually, in one of our group events it went really bad to the point where I pushed her really hard in anger and it blew up to a point where we just ended it.

However, once it ended, I began to really miss her, and in my desperate attempts, I tried to talk to her to bring things back to normal because it was effecting our friend circle as well but it turned uglier. Eventually our school started again and I generally ignored her for a bit but then I realized that she actually doesn't look at me altogether and as a reaction, I started staring at her trying to be her opposite. In the mean time, I had hit rock bottom and contemplated suicide multiple times. The reason it went so bad because everything went bad for me, my other friends laughed at me, having her around really made it much worse, my marks were bad, i had to rethink the area i was going to major in. At the end of the semester, I was finally invited to a friends gathering (first in 6 months) and she came there and did the same thing where she didn't acknowledge me at all. In my reaction (sheer stupidity) I intimidated her, trying to make the experience really bad, it may even be classified as harassment. Obviously, once it happened, and some more kicking and screaming, I avoided her again for four more months. At the end of my undergrad, I burst out at them once in a lab, but to her boyfriend and not her. After that, in my four months I finally had a break as she moved away to intern before she started her masters. I spent that time to look back at what happened and I realized what the fuck I had been doing. Out of that year and a half long ordeal, I felt that finally i was out of the depression. Things mended between my friends, and I finally felt ""grown up"" and in control. There was some anger towards her as I feel that she really provoked me certain times to prove a point to my friends how I am some sort of rapist.

Fast forward to now, we both are doing out masters. For the first semester, we had same classes but I managed to do my thing while she did hers, we avoided any sort of contact including eye contact. I still haven't spoken to her in real life. However, I am taking the same salsa classes as she is, so we end up dancing together and to me I don't really feel any emotions while dancing with her. The issue is, we talked (a couple of email exchanges) about insignificant things but I suddenly got the idea in my head that there maybe a chance to be friends again. So for a past couple of weeks, all these emotions are surging again, sometimes I am really angry, sometimes, I feel like really apologizing to her. The very fact that these emotions are coming up again has gotten me really scared. What do you guys suggest I do? I will see her around as we are in the same program for 6 more months. I think that there is a lot of bad blood between us and it is impossible to fix it. How can I get over her?

EDIT: The reason why I am so hung up over her was because she was the first person in my entire life to whom I actually opened up and she helped me a great deal."

And in the way I assume most companies do it, anyone in the hospital submits a Work Order anytime they need something done.

So one day we get a work order request from a lady requesting a new keyboard. Nothing else. Just a keyboard.

So we walk all the way to the other end of the hospital (it's quite a ways).
So we get there and the ladies screen says ""No video input""

Okay... So we open up the computer and it's *full* of dust. We blow it out and turns out the video card was completely fried and the CPU was hotter than the depths of hell.

The lady said she didn't know what to put, so she just asked for a new keyboard. This resulted in us walking the distance back to our department, getting a new computer, and taking it back and setting it up for her.

Protip: If you don't know what's wrong with your computer, try telling IT what is on the screen."
1ylzzp,6,2014-02-22,Just got out of debt,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ylzzp/just_got_out_of_debt/,"Side question: What is a boglehead and how do i learn from them?

 I am 24 working since I was 16. My current and latest job has paid the most  netting about $25k for the past 3 years...only...I have no idea where that money has gone. All my years of work. Other than having a motorcycle, travelling Asia a bit twice, and raving for a couple years, I don't know what I did to use it all. Even doing all of that I should still have tons saved.

I have bills, but I still live at home and even w those bills, I should still have thousands saved. I have nothing. I recently (just last week) got out of debt. I didn't have much but it was just always a few hundred dollars in liability holding me back. It's amazing how just $500 in debt is so damaging. I can't imagine thousands. At least I was that sensible.

I basically feel so stupid when I talk to my friends who have all this money saved, or envious when they tell me their parents paid for their college. I have a $17k bill waiting when I graduate this May.  Luckily I have a job which makes $53k a year I landed that I'll be starting. 

A couple goals I have are getting braces ASAP as I would like to start that 2 years  wearing period elapsing as soon as possible. Total price is about $6200 (2k down payment with $268 pmts for 16 months, or 3k down with $187 pmts for 16 months. Both no interest)

I want to start an emergency fund as I have nothing. Ironically, I am interning at a financial services firm. I am learning TONS about retirement, investing (mutual funds, etc), and all the ways the advisors help clients meet their investment goals. I am also learning the true importance and seeing actual figures and the power of compound interest. I'm so lucky to have found a real internship, teaching me instead of having me fetch coffee. Right now I'm studying Kaplan's Series 6 with them.

I also want to pay off my loan obviously, and move out of my house later this year. I want a small place and I honestly don't care if it's a studio as long as it's pretty nice and the area is good (dependent on where I'm placed at the new job). 

I will edit and write more when I get home, I'm on my phone. 

I own YNAB. What do u guys think I should do? How should I start towards these goals?

**edit**: at home now, adding more info. So basically, to clarify, *which* goals should I start towards first? On the one hand, I want to start the braces so I can get them going. I want to get my teeth straightened as soon as possible because regardless of what anyone says, people judge during interviews, for jobs, etc. They aren't bad, but I just want them fixed. But then I also realize from reading this sub that emergency funds are incredibly important, so I want to work towards that as well. So, the consolidated list of my goals for the next 6 mo.-1 year are. Not sure which order they should be in:

1. Get braces, going to cost roughly $6200 (~278/mo. with 2k down for 16 mo. OR ~$180/mo. with 3k down for 16 mo. Ideally i'd like the lower dp, but with my other goals, and my start time desired might not work?)

2. Emergency fund. Right now I have literally $60. I want to start saving. I feel embarassed that people my age or younger have so much money saved. On top of their parents paying their tuition jealousy etc. I need to get these finances in order. (I also want to invest into mutual funds too, but I know this fund is more important now)

3. Move out my parents home. I'm 25 this year and I think it's time to go. Not to look too much in the past on my life and make excuses, but I really think leaving the house is necessary for a young man to find his way. I've spent my life since 16 working and going to school, while trying to maintain sanity with a social life on the side. I feel I need my own space to truly see what I want to do, map my path, and go after my goals. Currently, I don't know what the fuck I want to do tbh, since all i've been doing is striving to keep sane while doing what I do now.

4.Pay my college loan. I have about $17k in loans incl. interest. I went to community college and then a CSU school so thankfully it's not crushingly large debt. I do want to go for a Masters in the future. Perhaps in Finance or MBA. *This would be some years down the line though.* I'm not sure, but I'd like to go to a top school (for that chance, I need to start finding out what I want to do and work into an incredible career to outshine my 3.0 GPA) and also I need to get 760+ on GMAT. If i got into a top school, I'd take loans and quit a job. It'd be worth it to me, because I never got the true school experience of just studying. and also, if it was a top school, the chances of me getting a job would be a lot higher. I don't think i'd get a loan to attend a whatever MBA school.

1ym2kx,5,2014-02-22,My sister (26/F) thinks that I (24/F) am using her and am being unfair to her. My younger sister and mom are on her side.,throw_sisaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ym2kx/my_sister_26f_thinks_that_i_24f_am_using_her_and/,"First some background on my sister: My sister has always been unmotivated to work. Friends pushed her to go to college and so she got into Interior Design and got her degree. She tried working with a friend and that friend was an asshole because she used her and did not pay her for six months of work. She had also been in a long distance relationship for about seven years but his family did not agree to their marriage and they both decided on a mutual break-up. He's married now but they still talk. I think my sister needs to go no-contact on him but it's her life. After the six months of work she didn't do anything else. She gained back all the weight she lost and her skin developed acne. My mother doesn't help by criticising her all the time (although it's lessened now because I told mom a bit harshly to stop it). She sits around reading stories, fan-fictions and obsessing over one thing or another (the Olympics and now K-pop for example). In the beginning I resented her for not helping dad out by getting a job and working, but then she told me that she just didn't want to work. We pushed her to start her baking business but she only waits to miraculously get a job so she does it and even that's rare. Family and friends have tried talking to her, to explain that it's not good for her to do nothing but she gets defensive and continues doing nothing. She gets proposals for arranged marriages but they all reject her. I'm not a big fan of arranged marriage and think she can do better but that's her choice. Her day consists of her sitting by her laptop reading stories and driving one of us to any place we may want to go to (not a regular occurrence) and only recently, after an aunt suggested and I helped, that she decided to go volunteering. So she now volunteers once a week.


Background on me: I always wanted to be a graphic designer. After I finished school, I got a degree in Multimedia but the school sucked and I pretty much studied Comp Science. During college I discovered that I was a homosexual, something that is illegal where I live and a huge taboo. I came out to my sister who adjusted and I'm so grateful for that. I fell in love with my best friend who used my feelings to make herself feel less lonely. That lasted three years and things got bad enough that I developed bulimia and started cutting. I kicked the friend out of my life and kept looking for work while doing freelance jobs. I got back with my girlfriend and she and I both changed ourselves in positive ways, so we're much happier with each other (we're long distance). I got over Bulimia (almost completely recovered but not entirely) and cutting too. I almost relapsed just now but that's why I'm keeping myself distracted by writing this post. I recently landed a dream internship, and they could hire me if I worked hard enough. But the commute is hell... and so for what the problem is.


I don't have a driver's license yet. I procrastinated because I have a fear, especially where I live, where cars and people come in front out of nowhere but also because of money. My father is supporting my two sisters, me and our mom. Because of outside expenses, money's been a bit tight for a while. My family has followed the patriarchal system and so it was only after graduating college that I dipped my toes in professional work without my father feeling offended about it. I want to be independent and I want to help out my family with bills. I started freelancing in my field. In the past few months, my jobs have required to travel long distances to meet with clients. I asked my older sister to drive me around and since she was drove me around a couple of times, I told her that I would give her some percentage of the money I got, which I did. Besides that, some days where she would have to wait, I'd give her money to relax at a coffee shop or have lunch somewhere nice. Now with this job, it's two hours away and I have to take a bus -&gt; the metro -&gt; another bus, where going back: walk twenty minutes -&gt; metro -&gt; bus -&gt; cab, that after a 9 - 10 hour shift. It's my first week and it's been awful after freelancing for a year. I'm hoping that it gets easier. Till then I'll be using my pay to help dad pay for my driver's license (I'll have to take weekend classes though) Oh well, life's shitty. In the beginning, I made a proposal to my sister. I told her that if she would pick me up in the evening, I would once again give her some percentage and if she collects that, she will have enough to buy that machine she wants at the end of my internship. She told me that her life did not revolve around mine and since then has been cold with me.


I should explain the room situation, as well. My sister and I share a room, while my younger sister has one of her own. We shared fine in the beginning, but after I graduated and started freelancing, I would often spend nights working and I needed the lights on or needed to concentrate while I worked so I preferred working alone. She started sleeping and then spending all her time in the living room. I told her that she could use our room and sleep there but she told me she preferred the living room where she got her privacy as well. I do have some issues with control, as in sometimes I need things to be in a certain manner and they have to be that way, otherwise I get very anxious, so I can also understand why. I have mild OCD that my sister has been aware of since she's witnessed my ""rituals"" from a young age. I take care of our room, I clean it even on days when I've been working for hours and have no time. I even clean the mess she makes. My mother and a maid do all the house work. The only time my sister takes charge of the house is when my mother leaves for the home country.


The younger sister is 16, pampered and does nothing at all, in case you are all wondering.


So now the problem is, today it all came out. My sister has been talking to my mother and sister and now mom told me that my sister thinks I'm being a snob who thinks I can throw around money and use her. My younger sister thinks that I'm using my sister too and being really unfair by not letting her use her room. I have done no such thing. I have two days off and my sister volunteers on the first day of the weekend. I told my sister that I want her to get ready (to go out to her volunteering job) in another room because I am completely exhausted and I would like to sleep in. My younger sister is angry at the injustice of my older sister not having use of her room (she's so angry guys, she can't even muster up enough generosity to share her own room) and of me using her in general. The reason why I offer to pay my sister because I've needed her assistance desperately in the past and I've always had to beg and plead her for it, so now I offer money instead.


I'm trying to help myself now so I can help my family in the future. I don't have any money - I'm strapped for cash. My pay isn't much and I'm still looking for freelancing jobs. I'm trying to gather enough money so I can travel and visit my girlfriend but it's so difficult because I have to pay for my mother as well (she won't let me travel alone since it'll be my first time). For now, I try to take as many of my own personal expenses on my own as I can, and some of the house too. I am conscious of the electricity that is wasted by my sisters and always try to keep the bill low for dad. It's all I can do for now. 


Sometimes I feel sorry for my sister but then I see myself and just think that she's lazy. I don't know how to approach this at all. And why am I being blamed and accused like that? Like I'm this bad guy who thinks I can do anything I want and walk over anyone with all the money I have - I'm not like that. I've been thinking about giving my sisters an allowance so they don't ask dad. I wish so bad that my sister would help out so my parents could get a break, I'm trying really hard from my side and I feel hopeless and alone. They need savings desperately but this is an expensive place to live in. I know things are difficult but I am not a victim. And I am not what they think I am - but why do they think that and what can I do?

**TL;DR: My siblings and mother think that I have kicked my sister out of her room and that I am using her by treating her like a chauffeur.**

I recently signed a contract for a paid internship in Canada, which I got after going through a couple of technical interviews. I just have a couple of questions about what should I expect during the first couple months of this internship:

* what kind of programming tasks would be expected of me in the beginning? 
* what kind of knowledge of software engineering practices do they expect from an intern?
* how lenient would they be with an intern? This pertains to maybe some mistakes/mishaps I may commit during the duration of the internship.

I really don't know what to expect for this job. I'm going to be starting it at the end of the winter semester, which ends in May. I'm currently working on my C++ more and more because none of my courses are in C++ (actually, my university doesn't even offer C++ courses). Otherwise, I'm really nervous.

I have several internships under my belt and was just denied from my dream internship. 

Right now, I have an offer from a Fortune 5 company that is offering to pay me a substantial amount of money. However, my passion is startups and entrepreneurship. I also have an offer to join a very early stage startup this summer that has received a fair amount of funding. Both are forcing me to give a response by the end of next week.

My parents are big fans of me taking the Fortune 5 company, because well...it looks good on a resume, but I think I would sooner take the startup over the other. Also, I'm speaking with other companies right now that I would be interested in working for right now. Several of which are considered big tech companies. I don't have anything too promising from any of them, but I feel fairly confident in my ability.

Would I be crazy to turn down these opportunities and wait it out for something I like more? Should I do the startup or the Fortune 5 company? "

Over my summer internship, I grossed $10,500. From January 13- January 14, I received about $18,000 in scholarships/grants. I would say about $12,000 went to my tuition. This leaves about $6,000 in taxable income plus the $10,500 from summer. I already had my wages withheld from my summer internship.

My issue is that my dad is planning on claiming my tuition and scholarships on his tax returns and I am claiming my summer wages on my tax returns. Is this going to pose an issue?

Wouldn't the most correct way to do it is that I file all my tuition, scholarships, and wages on my own tax returns? What happens if he claims my partial income of scholarships on his and I file my taxes on my summer wages?

He is also claiming me as a dependent, when I am pretty sure he didn't provide 1/2 of my income of the past year, but I can't cause issues because he'll refuse to give me his tax returns for my college education.

The recruiter began the interview with some administrative questions which I answered all with a yes. Afterwards, he began to ask me cliche questions like when was the last time you helped someone? etc. I think I answered them ok, some caught me off guard. He made persistent eye contact, and smiled in some cases. He then looked at my resume and asked about some of my roles at my prior internships and activities. Afterwards, he began talking about how the company is looking to recruit 200 people, while thousands have applied, and said that sitting here interviewing, is a huge accomplishment in itself, and he began to say how her feedback doesn't hold much weight, and it is ultimately the hiring managers, etc who will decide if I am in or not, and said I will be notified in 2-3 weeks with either a YES or NO. He then proceeded to ask if I had any questions, and I asked about 4 questions that made her laugh in a good way and say they were good questions. Then, he walked me out and I thanked her and shook her hand. 

I previously had an interview that lasted a mere 9 minutes so I felt pretty good that an interview lasted about 30 minutes for once . Me and another guy were the only ones to be interviewed at the school as well. I have not heard from the company as of yet.

I'm currently a junior majoring in Computer Engineering. I haven't had a co=op or an internship yet, but I'm looking for one for this upcoming summer. I'm in a bit of a weird position, since I'm going to school in the midwest, but I live back East (DC-Metro area). So my school's career fair isn't SUPER helpful if I'm looking for something I can commute to from home.

As of now, my plans are to simply email as many DC-area-based companies that I can and hope that I hit it off with someone. Obviously, I'd introduce myself, attach my updated resume, etc. I'll be going home for Spring Break (March 7-17), so I guess the best case scenario would be for me to have an interview (or a few) set up for when I'm home. Is there anything I should be aware of when sending these emails? Anything specific I should be looking for? Tips?

**EDIT after reading the initial responses that suggest I open up to relocation**

Sorry, I guess it sounds like I'm 100% locked into staying in the DC area. This is not so. Heck, I'm open to working anywhere in the US this Summer. Literally anywhere. I just figured there must be thousands of positions nationwide, and probably hundreds in the DC area. So it's not like I'll be able to apply to every single one. Would it maybe be better to try to search through my school's career center? We've already had our career fair this semester, but I wasn't in town (I had to be back home getting some emergency dental work done). 

It's just that there are so many positions available to apply for I don't even know how to narrow them down. I don't really have a preference as to what type of work I'd be doing. I don't have much hands on experience, as this would be my first internship position. I'm just looking to get my feet wet and go into any experience with an open mind. If I don't fall in love with the work I'm doing, at least I'll leave with a better feel of the engineering workplace environment and hopefully some new peers.

Thanks for all the responses and please keep them coming."

Then got in to finance by doing internships. 

However, the internships were all UNPAID with no chances of employment. This went on for ~2 years and 4 internships. Drove 4 hours round trip to go to some of these. Was not reimbursed for gas. Worked many 80-100 hour weeks and became subject matter expert.

Then I was hired at another place, where the guy actually offered to pay me. Fired me after a couple weeks because he had no idea what he was doing and fired the other guy who was working with him who actually knew that he was an idiot and told him. I was let go after this guy was, because he was supervising me. Was in later rounds with 2 very legit places when I took the offer (which was exploding) with this place. Had to drop them because I felt it was my word of honor and because I needed a job bad.

Spent all my money/put myself in debt to fly myself across the country once for an interview and a chance. Educated myself on the industry (specialized), presented a stock they specialized in that I thought would be a winner. Thought I interviewed well. Hear nothing for 2 weeks. Then, the stock I make the pitch of had a 100% gain. Thought it was in the bag. Then interview guy tells me I didn't show enough ""enthusiasm"" during the interview. 

More context, plane I had been on the previous day was supposed to get in 5 hours early but snow came. Long story short, had to reschedule for the day after. Got rerouted around the country, 1 day trip became 3 day shit fest with no change of clothes/phone charger (phone died first day). That extra couple days/reroute of my ticket that was supposed to be that day to the next day cost me 800... in all, put myself another 1000 in the hole from that. Thought I'd be like Chris Gardner. Welp, it doesnt always end up like in the movies.

Only 2 bosses have offered to go to bat for me, but neither of them followed through. The other bosses were all impersonal and/or hated all the interns.

Now, I have had no money for a long time, am working feverishly towards a professional designation that I hope will help, and I am interviewing for everything I can try for.

I'm pretty sure I need a root canal. Tooth chipped a few months back and has only been getting more chipped since. Lost feeling in the lower side of my jaw where that tooth is a few days ago. Cant afford to see a dentist. Student loans can no longer be put off.

Love finance and want to be in it badly, and won't stop until I'm successful.

Computational science would prepare me for a career in the industry. But I still have no idea what computational scientists even do, despite googling and looking around.

I know what quants do, but outside of finance, what do computational scientists do?

And I'm not sure if I would even enjoy it. I have taken around 25 college math classes, but they were pretty much all pure math.

I guess I could try to find an internship this summer in computational science and then spend my first semester taking computational science classes and see if I enjoy it?"

1yo5ac,4,2014-02-22,How do you go about finding purpose in your lives?,dan_1993,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1yo5ac/how_do_you_go_about_finding_purpose_in_your_lives/,"I don't know if this post has any place on here, as I am neither suicicidal, nor diagnosed with depression. And frankly, as I know what other people have been through, I always feel like an entitled brat whenever I try to bring these things up. I'm trying now, so please don't judge.

I have so many reasons to be happy. I was brought up by loving parents. I'm a sophomore in a prestigious college, yet I can't remember the last time I was happy. I engage in student life as much as I possibly can, being chief editor of the student magazine and honor rep of the business society. 

Still, I simply cannot connect with anyone there and at their exclusive parties I feel excluded even though I was the one sending the invitiations. Whenever I tell my parents how lonely I feel they just tell me to get out even more, to engage even more. But I'm just so sick of fake smiles, spending time with people I don't like and who don't like me. I'm sick of the drinking, the constant nagging about internships or grades, sick of feeling like a loser for not appreciating those things. 

I've tried to escape into my academic work in economics but deep down I suspect that I'm not intelligent enough to produce anything of significance. My parents live far away and seem to be getting by just fine without me, I have no siblings, few friends and no SO to care for. Thus, I guess I've put all my expectations on myself. My only forms of self-validation are work and academics and if I can't even excel in those things, what good am I? I feel like shit. 

Seeing everyone's successful image in fb doesn't help, and while I have thought about deleting it, I can't force myself to cut my online friends off. These relationships are double-edged swords because while I can engage in rewarding, meaningful and fun conversations with these people, unlike my fellow students at college, they all live so far away that I can't go and see them.

While I haven't suffered much from depression before, I really feel like I'm losing ground and the uncertainty scares the shit out of me. Maybe there's something out there for me but I just can't see it. Friends on r/depressuin, how do you find purpose in your lives and what would you suggest I do?

And to those who suffer way more than I do, my heart goes out to you too. Hang in there!

Just for your information: I'm a 22 year old male, with little to no dating/relationship experience..

I've met this girl (21 years old) online, and we've been talking via facebook-text-whatsapp-snapchat-... for more than a month now.
Conversations have ranged from serious, to funny, to even flirting with eachother.

However.. Every time I try to ask her out, she's either always busy, or something comes up a couple of hours before the 'date'.
Because she has an internship that also sometimes requires her to show up during the weekends from 2-10pm, I realize that she wants to use some of her free time as 'me'-time just to relax. 

But a couple of days ago she also refused to go do something together because she had to start at 9am the next day, which is no problem for me of course. I went out with some friends and had a great evening, but for some reason, she and I kept talking via sms/snapchat/facebook/whatsapp/... where she told me she was bored and was going to watch a movie on her laptop. It's not that we were miles apart, because the pub we went to is in walking distance from her home..

I've asked her out a couple of times now, and I've even apologized for asking so many times, but she replied saying it was not a problem at all, and that we should hang out sometime.

I don't want to look obsessed or 'overly attached', but I also don't want to lose my chance to get to know this girl.

So I'm kind of clueless as of what I'm supposed to do now..

**TL;DR: Girl is avoiding to meet in real life, even though I've received more than enough pictures from her (snapchat/facebook).**"
1yo7qe,1,2014-02-22,Overachievement Anxiety,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1yo7qe/overachievement_anxiety/,"I am currently a 3L law student. In second year, I ranked 2nd out of 320 undergraduate law students. I have a social life (well somewhat), I love what I do and my standard of work is pretty high. I am the executive editor of my schools law review and I have a fair amount of internships under my belt.

The last few weeks have been unusually rough. Despite all these things above, the fact that I've been rejected from four particular co-curricular things in the last few months has me really demotivated and anxious. It's not enough for me to graduate with honors...I can't seem to move past not getting through with these other activities and it has me in a rut. 

I have not really talked about this to anyone...it would make my parents worry, some friends don't seem to understand the depth of the problem or what it is to me. I do talk to one friend whom I live with but i feel like I can't talk to them about this because one I don't want to be running to talk to people about my problems all the time like I can't keep it together and two he's smart but ranked lower so I don't want to trivialize what he's done.

It feels as though things like making law review and my grades aren't important because I haven't achieved what I set my sights on. Keep in mind that these are fairly ambitious, one is getting published in a practitioner law journal as an undergrad.

I'm glad there's reddit though, because for some reason I never feel like I'm bothering anyone, like I would to talk to friends in person...


This has probably made not one ounce of sense but it does help to have it written out and I'll clarify what I can.

I'm an undergrad currently studying Computer Science. I'm trying to get my foot in the door by finding an internship this summer that would be good for my level. I'm not seeking anything paid, since I won't meet most of their requirements for another year(I'm just now getting deep into OOP in Java, have completed some logic and theory classes, and now learning HTML,CSS, and JavaScript). I've worked on projects on my own(text-based quiz game, bank transaction simulator, phone book program, etc) but nothing too advanced. 



I'm wondering if any of you could give me advice the best approach with companies here since I'd be bringing more of a lot of enthusiasm and willingness to learn, rather than a deep understanding of things. 

So basically, where did you guys intern here and how did it work out for you? What do your companies usually look for in interns and what do the interns typically do at your company? Any additional info/advice would be greatly appreciated. "

1yol9r,2,2014-02-23,[25/m] seeking relationship advice on where i should go from here,notbeforelong,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1yol9r/25m_seeking_relationship_advice_on_where_i_should/,"I [25/m] have been with my girlfriend [23/f] for 2 and a half years. 

First off, I want to say that I do enjoy spending time with her and ditto for her. She is pretty, cute and smart. If given a chance I would gladly marry her. 

We are two very different people. I am a pretty laid back person who follows my passions. She's more of a practical person. I like sports, she doesn't like the sun. I like quiet places, she likes being in crowded areas. I like dogs, she likes cats.

Our first 'date' started off with her scolding me for not being contactable in the 20 minutes before that. It's mainly my fault for not planning my time properly. I bought a new phone on that day and had to get a micro SIM card. This was 20 minutes before the date. After changing the SIM card and setting up the phone, I realized she had been trying to contact me for the past 10 minutes. We were in the same building and I rushed up to meet her and she told me off pretty badly. I guess this set the tone for the rest of the relationship.

I am nowhere near a perfect person. Since the start of the relationship, she has been weeding out my problems and telling me about them. This has resulted in countless quarrels and telling offs centered around me. Having to wake up everyday, for the past two and a half years, to hear that I have this or that problem I have to change is pretty exhausting. Problems ranging from the way I cough to me not having the confidence to show that I'm in control of the relationship. I know that she is doing this for my own good because she cares about me and that it is for the better me. These quarrels and telling offs usually end with her calling me names like 'stupid' and 'dog', but happen less often nowadays. I am determined to improve myself no matter what it takes or how long it takes. She has actually hung onto me during this time, and is determined to help me improve as well. 

Unfortunately, all this has made me lose a significant chunk of my confidence. I no longer feel good about myself and have all the other issues related to low self-confidence. I do fake it but I know that I have confidence issues because of hearing that I have this many problems everyday. 

She just got a job after graduating from her Bachelor's program. I'll be graduating in August and she will have a couple of months head start. During this 6 or so months, she will definitely berate me about how she is getting a higher income than I am. When I graduate, there is a high possibility that I would have to go for an internship before being able to secure a job in the industry I have decided I want to be in. She also said that if her pay is higher than mine after a couple of years working in the industry I chose, I should get a job in a different industry.  Shes working as a business development executive in an international freight company and I am looking to work in public relations. I definitely do not want to have a lower salary than her but there is a chance that will happen. 

I love her and enjoy her presence. She has stuck with me through good and bad times. I feel that we're at a crossroads but I do not want to give up so easily. Does anyone have advice that I can use to make this relationship better?"

1yoxcb,45,2014-02-23,All men with game are just good salesmen,puaSenator,AlreadyRed,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlreadyRed/comments/1yoxcb/all_men_with_game_are_just_good_salesmen/,"A common objection to PUAs is how ""it's creepy"", or ""The whole idea of them having routines, and thinking through every situation, just seems so manipulative!"" And I'll admit, it is manipulative. But you'd have to be absolutely naive to think ""naturals"" aren't being manipulative. The only difference between a PUA and a natural is the PUA started with a script, just like an entry level sales intern. 

See, women often have this objection, because they don't have to actually game themselves. To them, when they find a guy to be with, they didn't get him because she was good at game. No, because a women's role isn't to sale a product, but to be a potential customer. To them, relationships and ONS develop from just ""going with the flow"" and seeing how she ""feels about it."" She's the customer, not trying to sell a damn thing. As the gatekeeper of sex, it's not her job to sell anything, instead, it's her job to (shit)test the salesmen to see if the product he's trying to sell is any good, or if he's just a scam. 

No great salesman is naturally a great salesman, he's just more experienced than the rest:  
Like EVERYTHING in life, to be good at something, it takes practice. A great salesman wasn't just born great at navigating society. Not a single one. Instead, the ""natural"" has just been selling for a really long time. 

Since they were kids they were selling their parents on buying them something, selling their friends on where to play, and even selling their teachers with their charm to turn the other cheek when they dick around in class. They know the tricks. They've practiced it all. They know what works, and what doesn't. Every great salesman has routines. Meanwhile, the other great salesman started out in a call center or a retail outlet. They were trained and given a script. They were told, just say this, and just do this -- to every customer that walks in. They tell him, ""You suck at sales, so for now, just stick to the script and never veer from it. Your odds of closing a deal will be much higher than if you tried your own shitty sales tactics."" Then eventually he'll have that script mastered. He'll learn exactly what works, and what doesn't. Then he'll start incorporating some of his own stuff into the script. Then eventually, he's done with the script entirely and has his own pitch that works best for him. With enough experience, just like the natural, he has a rebuttal and retort with anything you can possibly throw at him. He too is now a great salesperson.  

This is just like game. You'd have to be absolutely crazy to think that the ""natural"" player is any different than the player who started out with a script. When a natural is talking to a woman, he definitely knows what he's doing. He's heard every rejection in the book, so he's familiar with how to respond. His reactions are planned and intentional. When a natural wants to get a girl to bed, damn right he has a ""manipulative"" tactic he's going to use. He knows how to calm the potential customer down, how to deal with shit tests, and how to ease her into the idea of coming to his house.

When we give advice to someone on ""How do I deal with this shit-test?"" Yes the answer we may give is a routine, and it is manipulative -- just like the natural's. However, the answer a natural will give is also a routine, and intended to be manipulative. He's just a salesman trying to close the deal. However, the only difference, is the natural learned his through experience and by watching others, while we openly discuss what works and what doesn't. In fact, this is probably the most effective person there is, and women should be scared of this person. Because unlike the natural who will fail an go back home either thinking through how they failed to close the deal, or maybe talk to a buddy, a PUA will go back home and talk to hundreds of people ensuring that the solution they get is going to be far more effective than what just one guy could give.

Players on both sides are ALWAYS trying to close a woman. They are ALWAYS running routines. Because men are salesmen trying to make a buck/pussy. The difference is one salesguy just has one really good mentor to get advice from, while the other sits on a committee of salesmen always giving each other tips and advice. 

So if there are any women out there reading this that think these type of open forums of discussion are ""manipulative"" just remember, all guys are manipulative -- just some openly talk about it and others don't. And you should be afraid, really afraid. This shit is like ""Project Manhattan"" of getting laid. I'm far from the ""nerd"" type -- I'm a semi-natty using TRP/PUA like steroids--, but the truth is, a good portion of guys that start out on their journey here are or were pathetic nerds, and it gives me incredible joy to know that we are building an army of these assholes by giving them the secrets to nuclear power. It's like when the world ressented Germany for their role in the wars, but now they are an economic powerhouse, and they run the entire EU. I bet the German's fucking love it. I fucking love it. 

And remember, Always Be Closing.

EDIT: I never actually proof read the shit I post -- I didn't in college either. So typo's an clarity are subject to whatever. "

I also think NF gives exponential returns when paired with other productive habits (nutrition, exercise, meditation, cutting out bad habits). These seem to strengthen each other and the total effect is insane. I’ve been NF for almost a year, never made it to 2 months but routinely get to 3-4 weeks. Almost all hard mode. Only disadvantage is once I was with a girl I was really attracted to and I came way to fast. The two other times I just didn’t feel an emotional connection with the girls and it kind of made the sex weird which wouldn’t have bothered me before. I don’t know for me it improves my life, but not sex so I’m going to stick to hard mode until I finish school and get my goals in order (only 1 more year).  Here are the changes (remember NF acts like a battery fueling these changes, it’s not necessarily solely responsible) 

* Started waking up at 5am every morning- been months since Ive slept in past 5:30 

* Cold showers in the morning 

* Got offered a paid internship that was supposed to be unavailable but they wanted me on board so bad they squeezed me in. 

* Insane emotional control, have not gotten angry. This is very closely linked with meditation which I used to think was bullshit, but definitely is not. I also don’t get stressed or worried despite an insane class and work schedule. 

* Studying has become slightly easier 

* Have been able to save 2-3x more money per week because my impulse control has gotten better.

* Much more confidence. Deeper &amp; smoother voice. I can almost even sing now which before it was just a squeaky mess. 

* Much more energy. I feel it deep in my stomach like boiling water. Sometimes a girl smiles at me and warm blood just surges through my body. As soon as I wake up I’m like let’s do this. Sometimes I look at heavy objects and just feel like hurling them across the room. 

* No longer addicted to TV. House of Cards season 2 came out last week and I’ve only seen 5 episodes. Before I would have watched all 13 in a day and it would have left me feeling unproductive and tired. 

Good luck guys, I know everyone has different physiology, but I really think this works for most people-especially if you have a highly sexed nature, which I’m guessing most of us do. Good news, if you don’t let it control you, it is a blessing much more than a curse."

I'm Paul and I’m a French student who's looking for an international internship. I'm currently in a second year of Business School and I choose Strategic Marketing as my specialization. 
This internship must start in the middle of April and end early October. 

In regards to my legal eligibility to train with your organization, I would be participating in the J-1 Visa Internship USA program, sponsored by the Council on International Educational Exchange [CIEE]. (www.ciee.org).

-	Federal Unemployment Taxes (FUTA)

By participating in the J-1 Visa program, you will be contributing to the United States’ cultural exchange and public diplomacy policies and will benefit from the support of CIEE for the duration of the internship.   

I really want to do my internship in New-York City, I already went in this Big Apple and I loved my trip. But know I don’t want to go as a tripper but as a worker.  During this internship I want first to gain a lot of experience, as a French/European student I will bring my vision in order to help your company. I also desire to discover a new city and a new way of life. I can give you my sense of humour, my enjoyment of life, and my creative skills.
If you want my resume please ask me in private. 

Thanks you for taking time to read this and I wish you the best.

Found boyfriend's online dating profile, he denies it, I feel like I'm being gaslighted!",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ypa4q/help_me_found_boyfriends_online_dating_profile_he/,"Last night I went on to OKCupid because I've had my suspicions about my boyfriend. We've been together a year and already, the sex started to dry up. He claimed that he didn't want to have sex because he didn't feel attractive. I told him that I thought he just had low libido because of his health condition. He said no, he actually ""jerks off"" when I'm not home. 

Our relationship has been pretty rocky from the start. On our first date he admitted that he had low self esteem. Through our relationship he would ask me ""do you really love me?"" ""do I look ok?"" ""is my body ugly?"" ""you would rather be with someone else wouldn't you?"" Honestly, his lack of confidence in our relationship started throwing up red flags to me. My last boyfriend was so insecure with himself too and cheated on me with his ex.

So last night my eyes about bugged out when I saw my boyfriend's picture. It wasn't of his face though, it was of his chest but I can recognize that chest anywhere. I searched through my pictures and found a similar chest shot that he sent me when we were first dating. They are the same except the one on OKC is tilted and black and white.

So the picture had my head spinning. The creases in his body were the same and the nipple placements were the same. Even if there was doubt in my mind about the picture being his, I went on to read his stats.

Age: 43

Yup, he was 43.

City:  H........

Yup that's the city we live in

Height: 6'2""

That's his height

Occupation: Sales

Right on the money

No kids, has dogs:

Yes and Yes

The self-summary was rather strange. It had four paragraphs describing various sexual things he wants to do with women's breasts. I've never known him to have a breast fetish before. Every time I tried to get him to touch my boobs, he would giggle and pull away. Like he was embarrassed or something.

Now I know that these statistics can describe a lot of people but combined with the picture, the odds of that being not him is astronomical. If I would've been smart, I would've messaged him and set up a meeting. I was just so stunned and shaking that I immediately ran into the living room to confront him. He denied it up one side and down the other. He said we live in a big city (100K people) and anyone can have those stats. He also said ""I'm 6'1"" not 6'2""!

I asked him to come and look at the profile on my computer screen. He said the picture wasn't his and even if it was his, someone must have stole it. I start crying and screaming at the top of my lungs. How can he deny so much evidence I had right in front of me?

I then proceed to call my sister because at this point I'm going to lose it. I felt like I was going crazy because I knew what I was seeing but he swore he had no idea what it was. He even went so far to grab my mouse and close the tab.

Then, the final piece of evidence happened. As I was on the phone with my sister, I opened up the tab some 15 minutes later. Lo and fucking behold, the profile had somehow MAGICALLY VANISHED. I wrote down the username so I typed that in the search bar. It said ""this profile has been deleted"" or whatever language they use.

By this time I'm hysteric. Boyfriend comes into the room and I ask him about the profile disappearing. He is still denying he had anything to do with it but now he starts getting angry. I ask him to give me his phone. He says no and starts getting pissed and offended saying that I don't trust him. He then goes on to point out all the stuff he buys me and tells me about all the nice things he's done for me.

By this time, I'm feeling so gaslighted that I feel like I'm glowing. I knocked a stack of papers of my desk in a fit of rage. He countered by yelling and knocking over a small table. He then starts yelling at me to get out of his house tomorrow.

Here's where it gets sticky. I live in his house and I have no job. I have no job because I'm doing a full time internship for school that ends in two months. Anytime I've rented an apartment in the past, they asked for employment and to show pay stubs. I suppose I could tell them I'm a student but the financial aid I got went straight to tuition. I had none left over that I could claim as income. I have some money saved up so I'd be able to pay rent, but I'm not sure if they would even rent to me.

Here's where it gets stickier: we got a dog together and I want to take him with me. I could leave today and stay with my mom or sister but they won't let me bring the dog because they have cats.

Ok, so I'm kind of fucked and the huge man I live with is pissed at me. He has never done anything physical to me in the past but he does joke about doing violent stuff to me. One time he asked me ""what would you do if I just punched you in the face?"" Another time he was holding the sharp lid of a tin can and said that he should use it to slice my throat.

Now, I have no idea if his dark sense of humor would equal any of that really happening. But I have no idea, I'm grasping at straws here. 

He wants me out now but I can't find an apartment that will take me and my dog that fast. Also, it would be ideal to move spring break which is in a month so I can stay home with my dog for a week while he gets acclimated to the new place. He has bad separation anxiety issues and is used to living in a house with a yard with another dog (it's my boyfriend's dog that he had before we got together.)

Is this what people try to do to mentally manipulate you even though they've been caught red fucking handed??? He had me so convinced that it wasn't him that I started to question my mental state. He was pissed at me for the rest of the night for accusing him of cheating and not trusting him. He said since I don't trust him, that I should just move out. I asked him if I can stay a little while until I find another place. He said he's afraid he will feel too awkward.

TL;DR Found boyfriend's profile on OKCupid. No head shot, only body shot, stats match up, mysteriously gets deleted after I confront him. He denies it. Am I being gaslighted?


EDIT 1: So I'm still sitting here trying to figure out what the fuck to do. Everyone has been so thoughtful and caring. I don't feel like my immediate safety is danger but I'm going to do what I can to leave. He still denies that was his profile but whatever. He said I could stay as long as I needed to. He did admit that he pulled back emotionally from the relationship because he doesn't feel good enough for me and that he feels like he's holding me back. He has a disease that causes physical limitations but I never cared about that, I looked passed it and went hiking alone or with friends. He has had this condition for 12 years and he said it has eaten away at his self-esteem. Why would he even start dating in the first place? I'm on the search for a dog friendly apartment. 

EDIT 2: Today I went to his parents house and told them everything. They were pretty shocked and didn't know what to say. I asked them if he had ever been physically violent with a woman before and they no, not that they know of. They promised that they wouldn't mention our visit today with him. They said that he was always insecure, even as a kid. They also said that he's always has been pre-occupied with his looks and needed constant assurance. My (ex)boyfriend has been strangely pleasant since I found the profile two nights ago. He said I could stay as long as I don't date other guys and come home smelling like penis. Wtf, gross. Can't wait to move out."

I'm an intern at an international school and I'm looking for some fun maths games dealing with money for a year 3 class (6-7 years). Since I'm in Spain the games have to deal with Euros. 

I hope some of you can help me. The only games I have found are these two: 
http://www.mathsisfun.com/money/money-master.html
http://www.freeteacher.co.uk/learn_to_count_euros.aspx?t=euro&amp;c=r
But I would really like a game with some sort of story (I found one were you had to be a bus driver and then had to collect money from the passengers, but the game was only dealing with dollars).

I really hope you can help me.

1ypocw,0,2014-02-23,A simple change to make Soraka viable?,evilsider,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ypocw/a_simple_change_to_make_soraka_viable/,"Hi guys, I was wondering when my second most favorite support (Soraka) will become viable again. It's been some time now and even after her revamp she continued to be avoided by the majority of players. I see Riot are trying out making skills scale with AP, but I really believe that's a wrong approach (here I said it..sry Riot I still love you). The problem (imHo) is that the current meta requires engage/disengage abilities in 90% of the cases so that the given champion can be considered viable. If that's the case then why not just add a new mechanic into her E or her Q?

I have 3 ideas circling my mind:

1. Make her E function like LB's E (skillshot) but a little tweaked so she doesn't lose her charm there. It can be like ""If connect to enemy roots for X seconds after Y seconds"" or ""If connect to ally fills X amount of mana after Y seconds""

2. Make her E function like Karma's W. Basically the same as 1. but without the skillshot part.

3. Make her Q root for X amount of seconds after Y amounts of successful hits.

NOTE: In all honesty, I don't really care if my idea gets picked up or any other solution is found. But if a Rioter by any chance reads this, please be sure to raise Soraka for an intern discussion, she really needs some love after not being viable for 1 full season and counting...

**TL;DR Give Soraka some kind of root effect (it's the one and only thing she needs to become viable in the current meta).**"

1yq3nq,3,2014-02-23,What to do if you lose someone's favor?,azngoHAPPY,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1yq3nq/what_to_do_if_you_lose_someones_favor/,"Over the summer, I had an internship which I ended up doing pretty well in and received favorable reviews from my team leader and coworkers. As a result, I was even able to receive a job offer which I later accepted.

As I started up school again, I kept in touch here and there with my colleagues from the summer and everything appeared to be okay. I made sure not to overburden them with too many emails so that they wouldn't get annoyed (I sent maybe 4-5 emails since last August).

Within the past 2-3 months, however, they no longer reply to my emails. I'm not quite sure what went wrong, but I feel like I somehow soured my professional relationship with them. My only guesses is that maybe I asked for something I shouldn't have? (i.e. I asked for the email of another colleague who I forgot to get before the summer ended. This was to help me reach out for help on a side project I thought that person could give insight on. I never received a reply.) Recently, I also reached out to see how they were doing and asked for a recommendation. Still no reply (it has been over a week and they used to be pretty responsive). 

What do you do in this type of situation in order to gain someone's favor you may have lost?

**tl;dr Haven't received communication from coworkers from this past summer, feel like I lost favor with them, what can I do to fix this?**"

What's the process?,maktob-el-qahwa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1yq3rc/can_a_foreign_fresh_grad_find_good_positions_in/,"Hey! I'm a second-year CS student minoring in math. I'm graduating in Spring 2015, with a GPA of ~3.6, from a relatively prestigious, accredited university with very strong ties to the US. (It's chartered in a US state.) As of yet I have *some* professional experience (very likely to grow over the next year), no internships (one expected this summer), and a few interesting personal projects. I might publish a paper with my professor (a known name in a certain algorithms field) before graduating.

The fields I'm interested in and am good at are, in descending order of interest-competence:

* algorithms and data structs, esp. graphs, dynamic programming, and discrete optimization generally
* high-frequency trading algorithms
* forensic linguistics
* encryption; cryptography
* scalability; analyzing ""big data""
* web design and development (more interested in backend)

I have it as a goal to get out of my current country (which is starting to get dangerous and economically in the sinks anyway), and I'd love to work for one of the big names in the industry and the fields I've mentioned. The US is my preference, but anywhere really would be a boon.

How can I make myself desirable to the likes of Google and Amazon, given my situation? What skillset of languages, frameworks, et-cetera is most valuable to the big names? What is the process like for an international applicant? Is achieving what I've set out to do hard in this scenario?

Thanks!"

I know it's probably skill based too so I'll say I do a lot of learning out of school all programming related."

I have a 3-month summer internship coming up, where I'll have to move from PA to TX and back. I was wondering what the options were for bringing my gaming PC along. Keep in mind that I'll likely have more travel in my future, so I'd like to come up with a method that'll work several times.

Here is my current build:

* Full-size ATX Case: HAF 912

* CPU: Sandy Bridge i7 2600

* Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212+

* Mobo: ASUS P8P67 Rev C

* RAM: 4x2 GB Kingston HyperX DDR3

* GPU: XFX HD 6950 flashed to use extra cores

* Soundcard: ASUS Xonar D1

* PSU: Antec Neo Eco 520C

One option is to ship the computer over using a courier service and back, but I'm a bit hesitant, as I know packages get mistreated a lot in transit. Anyone have any recommended services/methods to use? What are the prices like?

Another option is to sell the entire build off and build a mini-ITX computer. What would my current build sell for; would it cover the price of a mid-range mini-ITX build? Would there be room to fit in a soundcard next to a GPU? Anything I can carry over from my existing build? I'm thinking of mini-ITX so that I can bring it in my carry-on in the plane.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance."
1yq9ap,34,2014-02-23,"My girlfriend [23F] of 13 months hardly spends any time with me [23M] (also, other issues). I've been patient but it's getting difficult.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1yq9ap/my_girlfriend_23f_of_13_months_hardly_spends_any/,"As a bit of an update to my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1uvage/girlfriend_23f_of_one_year_is_experiencing_mental/), my girlfriend has since recovered from her state and is doing wonderfully. She is seeing a therapist and has been getting better ever since. I am now employed part-time, but unhappy with my job and still really discouraged that I can't find any work in the field I would actually like to pursue.

During the past few weeks, it feels to me that we've been growing more distant. She used to come by after her work in the evenings but now she spends the evening at her house (we both live with our parents), stating she needs to spend more time with her family. Granted, that's one of the things her therapist suggested she do, but now our time together is limited to about once a week, if that. When she has full days free, she shies away from hanging out with me, saying she would like a day to herself.

This sort of thing is the subject of most of our fights, and she tells me that she is busy with her job. My rebuttal to that is that when I was still at my university, I would wake up at 7:30, go to a job, an internship, and school full-time, get back to my place at 10:30 pm and begin doing homework, all the while still finding time to spend an hour or two with her over the phone. Right now she has a part-time job that requires her to put in some extra hours every so often, but she still can't seem to make time for us.

Whenever she has needed me, I supported her, dropping whatever responsibilities I was able to just to be there for her. I'm at probably the lowest point in my life right now and all I want to do is have dinner with her once or twice a week. Her response? ""We'll see.""

At her workplace, her co-worker, who is also her best friend and ex-boyfriend, has just gone through a bad breakup. According to her, he's incredibly sad and might be slipping into alcoholism. Whenever we're together, she talks about him and texts him often. I once asked her if she still had feelings for him, and she replied ""I don't know."" I understand he's going through a lot right now, but whenever the subject of him comes up I feel like such a consolation prize.

I have half a mind to break up with her, despite all the good times we've had. I've been okay with us not spending much time together for a bit, but her constant avoidance has been really getting to me. I have all of her stuff she brought to my house in a pile and am seriously considering driving to her place and breaking up with her right now.

Am I crazy for feeling this way? Do I just need to be more patient with her? What the hell am I supposed to do right now?
---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend says there's no time for me when I think she can clearly make it happen. Also, she is very concerned with (and spends a lot of time talking to and about) her co-worker/best friend/ex-boyfriend. What do I do?"

-Graduating with BA – May 2014 (Major: History; Minor: Spanish)

-5 years experience as a clerk in two academic libraries

-1 summer experience as a clerk in a public library

-2 years experience working on major research projects focusing on Latin America.

-I mostly focus on U.S. Neoliberal economic policies in the region as well as CIA covert operations in the Southern Cone.

-High proficiency in grant writing. (I’ve been awarded multiple grant awards to continue my research).

-International Experience- 1 semester studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina
			    -I’ll be traveling to Cuba to perform field research this May.

-Language proficiency- High academic proficiency in Spanish, both written and spoken.

-Internship experience- 
1 summer with an international non-profit as a logistics intern helping to organize an international conference for something like 1,500 people. Long story short, I had to figure out how to organize the travel intermarries of hundreds of people and feed over 500 staff for a week with a tiny budget. 

1 summer as an informatics/logistics intern with a U.S. federal organization focusing on Telehealth and the efficient organization of large amounts of patient data to make it more useful.

For the sake of staying anonymous, I’ll be omitting some information. I’ve been accepted into two separate masters’ degree programs at a major U.S. research university. The first is a MA in Latin American studies, and the second is a MS in Information Science from the department of library and info science in the school of informatics and computing. This university has a pretty cool program where I can take the two masters degrees and complete them simultaneously while doing fewer credits than doing them separately.

Here’s my dilemma. I can do the dual degree and come out with a MA in LAS and MS in IS, or I could do one or the other. I’m not interested in doing just the LAS degree, but I am considering doing just the IS degree.

From the copious amount of research I’ve been doing, it seems like the dual degree route is more geared towards becoming an academic librarian as it leaves less room for electives in informatics and computing.  I’m not against becoming an academic librarian, but the number of years I’ve worked in libraries has taught me how much and how rapidly the industry is changing. I don’t want to get a degree that is going to pigeon hole me into doing one job that may be drastically different in 10-20 years.  

Just going with the MSIS, I could specialize in data science or information architecture and take a variety of courses in metadata, database creation/maintenance, computer-human-interaction, web development and programming.
I love my research and have been doing it for a while, but when I see so many of my extremely capable professors working as low paid adjuncts  in a field where only 25% of people with terminal degrees actually find themselves in tenure track jobs, I feel like I do not want to focus on humanities research.

Nevertheless, besides my socioeconomic research in Latin America, I also have a high interest in data technology developments and research into database system efficiency. The Big Data explosion that we are currently experiencing fascinates me, and I want to be a part of the vanguard working to make that information more accessible and useable in the future. The internships I’ve done in logistics and data analysis have helped to foster this interest, and I’m seriously considering pursuing this field. I don’t have a ton of interest in programming, but I’ll have the opportunity to pick it up very soon.

The reality is that I don’t need a degree to continue researching Latin American issues. On the other hand, if I want to secure a sweet position in the exploding computing and information industry, I would need to focus on the MSIS.

I’m just getting a lot of different pieces of advice from professors that ranges from “the dual program will be great!,”, to “If you get both masters degrees and attempt to go on to a PhD later, they will question the nature of your focus”.
I just also wanted to note that the MSIS program is top ten in the U.S.A. if that means anything.

TLDR: I’m the first person in my family to get accepted into graduate school and I don’t know how to proceed.

1yql4x,19,2014-02-23,24 yo looking to get some feedback on PF plan,throwawayPFhelpPls,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1yql4x/24_yo_looking_to_get_some_feedback_on_pf_plan/,"Hi all,

I have been pretty terrible in the past in terms of finances but have been really proactive in the last couple of months in trying to educate myself in all this (thanks to this subreddit! and other PF books!). I have come up with a plan for myself for the next few years and would like some feedback on it. I apologize for any grammar mistakes in advance as I am a 1st generation immigrant.

Goals: Pay off student loans and buy a house in my mid thirties (10 years from now, if plausible)

Situation:  
24 years old  
Income: Gross 70k/year (take home $3800/month)  

Student Loans: ~117k (5 years of undergrad)  
Break down:  
40k charged off  
Loan 1: 24,328 @ 10.13%  
Loan 2: 2,941 @ 7.63%  
Loan 3: 21,686 @ 6%  
Loan 4 (Consolidated Fed loans): 29,000 @ 5.88%  

roth-IRA: $1000  

Car: Own a 1996 Volvo that is about to die. Cant pass a smog test that it needs to pass for me to reregister for this year.  

Motorcycle: Made a stupid impulsive buy with some money I earned at an internship a few months ago. (Paid off)  

No emergency funds. Dumping excess money in bank account to loans.  

Spent the last couple of months paying off 3k of CC debt  

How this happened:   
My parents’ income were deemed pretty high when I was in highschool and so when I applied for financial aid for college I didnt get any. Even though my parents could have technically helped pay for my education, they couldnt because theyre pretty bad with their money as well (different story). My parents had me be responsible for signing up for my own private loans and really at the time, I had no idea what I was doing and so I just signed up with the first bank that was willing to give me money for school.

My parents filled for bankruptcy during my 3rd year and since they cosigned my loans, the loans automatically went into repayment. I had no job at the time and so I couldnt pay and had 2 of my loans at ~20k each go into “charged off” state. I asked an uncle of mine to cosign for me for my future loans so I could finish my degree.

Recently graduated this past June and had a 3 month internship. At the end of the internship, my company liked me and brought me in full time at 70k.


Plan:
Currently paying $1400 a month on student loans (more whenever theres any surplus in my bank account). Doing the minimum payments on all of the loans except for the big one at 10% which Im dumping as much as I can into.

Vehicle:
My car is probably going to cost me more to repair than it is worth so I am thinking of getting a (new to me) used car. I know that the general mentality that I found here is to buy a $5000 car but Im thinking that going with that route might result in the same thing that is happening now. Me having to pay for repairs in a couple of years. So Im thinking of getting a used car that is closer to $12k worth and use the hell out of that in the next 15 years. Can I get some feedback on this, please?

Posted my motorcycle on craigslist to sell and use that money either as down payment for a car or use to drop the principal on that 10% student loan.

Budget:
I have one (I use mint). I set my budget to $640 for groceries, restaurants, gas, fast food, and coffee. Ive been under that budget the last couple of months though so I think I can pull off a $500 budget per month.

Expected increase in rent in June. I am currently living with 4 other guys in a 2 bedroom 1 ba apartment. Been living like this for a year now to save cost in rent (~300/mo) at the moment. I know its really cheap but I can’t stand it anymore (theres barely any room to breathe, especially when they all bring their SO over, there’s like 8 people in one tiny apt). When our lease ends in June, I plan on moving out and getting my own room in a house thats renting out a room that will increase my rent to ~$700-750/month.

Investments:
I opened a roth-IRA account because the idea of investing for my retirement now, really appealed to me. But after I thought about it, maybe paying off my loans would be a higher priority before maxing out my roth.
Investing 3% of salary to 401k, my company does NOT match. Should I use this money into paying off my loans instead of shoving that 3% there?


I would really appreciate some advice on the my vehicle situation, investments vs loans, and lastly if anyone has any advice on that charged off loan. When I talked to the bank about it, they said that it is not accumulating any interest because of its status. When I heard this, I thought “Great! I can pay a little on that one and focus on the big 10% interest rate loan” but then I started really thinking and thought that its probably really bad for my credit that that is there, right? I really wish to purchase my own home in my mid thirties if possible and so I would want clean credit the next 10 years right?

Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

A little background: 

I'm a married 30 year-old with one child living in a high cost-of-living area in the US.  My wife and I both work, and we handle all our finances jointly.  I'm in my final year of graduate school, working as student intern with the promise to become a full employee upon finishing my PhD (my tuition is paid by my employer).  Our combined income is $93,000.  When I graduate this fall it will become $110,000.

We live as cheaply as we can in the area, saving every penny for a 20% down payment on a house.  Seriously, we make breakfast, lunch and dinner at home every day (and even make our own baby food).  We eat out less than twice in a month.  Our total expenses every month are $4000 for rent, transportation, child care, utilities, groceries,  insurance, etc.  

The only debt we have is a combined ~$5000 in student loans that we are actively paying off.  We have and emergency fund ($15,000 in an online savings account), and $27,000 between two different credit union savings accounts.  We both have retirement plans through work, into which we are contributing the employer-matching amount (5%).

I have had issues with my credit reports in the past.  In 2009, I was once 60 days late on paying my student loan (it was a simple, stupid mistake of me forgetting to pay the bill).  Additionally within the past two months, I successfully disputed a tax lien that had been incorrectly reported to my credit history.  That issue was removed without incident from my reports.

We have no credit cards.  We did up until last November.  We had two Bank of America credit cards that never carried a balance and we hadn't used in over four years.  We got fed up with BOA for their shitty customer service, and the nickle-and-dime fees they kept charging over the years.  Our disgust came to a head last fall and we closed all deposit accounts and both cards.  In hindsight, it was a bad idea to close those cards since they were our oldest (~7 years), but at the time we didn't know that it could negatively affect our credit.
 
Questions:

1)  I tend to be old school and do everything with paper statements, and pay our bills with checks in the mail.  I know this is inefficient, and can be dangerous (like when I forgot to make my student loan payment once).  I'd like to set up automatic bill pay, but I'd also like to make the money go further.  Would it be beneficial to open a new credit card to pay bills with (preferably, one that has a good rewards program)?  We would pay it off every month.  My wife has never had any issues with credit, and her reports are all positive.

2) Would applying for said credit card now be a good thing for our credit rating and mortgage application if we want to buy a house in 9-12 months?

3) I don't know much about rewards programs, and ones we should consider to be ""good.""  For example, we spend a lot on gas/groceries, but we also like to travel once a year, so I don't know if a cash back card would be better than a travel rewards points card.  How do I decide which type of card would give me the most bang for the buck?

4) Should we maintain our current ethos of joint finances and get card(s) that we can both use?  Or would it be better for us to get individual ones?"

I quickly realized finding a job in a new place where I don't know anyone, with just an English degree, was going to be extremely hard. After searching fruitlessly for a few months, I accepted the first job I was offered, at a daycare. I've worked there for about 4 months now and I *hate* it. 

Soon after I began my job and realized childcare definitely isn't for me, I began searching for other jobs, and still am. I try to apply for a few jobs every day. I don't really know where to look except indeed.com and linkedin, but so far they have been fruitless. 

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Right now I just want a job where I don't have to clean up puke, change diapers, and deal with screaming children every day. I also want something that will perhaps point me in a good direction for the future and teach me some new skills--in other words, something with room for advancement (unlike my current job which is a dead end). I would also really like a job with regular hours, ie not evenings or weekends. So my first question is, is all of that too much to ask for someone in my position? And if so, what do I need to change about myself to make that goal feasible?

I feel like I made a huge mistake by majoring in English. I have some work experience from being a TA several times, having two different internships, and having held down various part-time jobs and volunteer positions through high school and college. But I'm so scared it's not enough. I just want to break into the professional world in some way but I don't know how. Networking is out because neither my boyfriend nor I know anyone here; all of my connections are in my home state. I could go to grad school but I don't know what to go for, and what if I go and it just turns into the same scenario over again? So my other questions are 1) What am I doing wrong? and 2) What do I need to do differently? "
1yr56x,12,2014-02-23,The problem with a long hair fetish (x-post with sex),[deleted],BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/1yr56x/the_problem_with_a_long_hair_fetish_xpost_with_sex/,"Hello everyone,

I'm a girl with a fetish for cismen who have long hair (what I consider long is past the shoulders). I lucked out and got a boyfriend with hair down to his waist (he has many other fantastic qualities, but it is just particularly refreshing to indulge in my fetish and have him enjoy it too).

Of course, I am getting to the age where everyone is starting to cut their hair for work-related reasons. In particular, my boyfriend is looking at a summer internship that would require him to keep his hair collar-length, and no longer (that's what the interviewer told him). He says that if he is hired, he will grow it out again after the internship, and he will wear polos so the collar will be as low as possible.

I won't leave him over this. I joke that I am pretty shallow, but not that shallow. I just worry that I am going to find him less physically attractive if he does get this internship. Or that he will think having short hair is easier and not ever grow it out again. I also won't be able to do a lot of what I enjoy about hair. I get a thrill out of playing with it, brushing it, and feeling it on me, as well as using it as sort of a form of mental bondage (as an example, if he feels possessive, he drapes it over me).

I guess I am not sure what I am asking, since I know I will need to just suck it up and deal with it until he grows it back out. Maybe I just need to vent. But maybe other people can give me some advice on not having access to a fetish while in a relationship? Or talk about similar experiences? Polyamory is not an option, fyi. And long hair fetishists, if you are out there, how would you find a way to indulge with hair shorter than shoulder length?

Sorry for the length! This sub is fantastic with giving advice so I thought I would ask everyone here."

Here is my current build:

    Full-size ATX Case: HAF 912

    CPU: Sandy Bridge i7 2600

    Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212+

    Mobo: ASUS P8P67 Rev C

    Soundcard: ASUS Xonar D1

    PSU: Antec Neo Eco 520C

One option is to ship the computer over using a courier service and back, but I'm a bit hesitant, as I know packages get mistreated a lot in transit. Anyone have any recommended services/methods to use? What are the prices like?

Another option is to sell the entire build off and build a mini-ITX computer. What would my current build sell for; would it cover the price of a mid-range mini-ITX build? Would there be room to fit in a soundcard next to a GPU? Anything I can carry over from my existing build? I'm thinking of mini-ITX so that I can bring it in my carry-on in the plane.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

Hi, i'm 22 and about to finish an actuarial science bachelor degree. The thing is I think I hate this field.

I did however manage to land two internships and a research job so my resume is not too shabby. I could probably land a job not too far after graduation.

I've been reading and posting in this sub for the past three months, but I'd like to ask a question about myself, something I've not done before.

I am about to enter college. Since I did well on the PSAT, I can get paid about $4k per year to go to the University of Kentucky. However, I could also potentially get in to some of the big name schools that people on this subreddit seem to view as exceptions when it comes to student loans: places like Harvard, Stanford, etc. My parents will pay most of the costs, but will probably leave me a deficit to make up that will be around the subsidized loan limit (afaik anyone can take these out and they have a current max of about $30k over four years). My prospective major is a mixture of Computer Science and Mathematics (with finance classes if I go to a big name target school for banking). I am interested in the software, consulting, actuarial, and banking sectors.

I am wondering if it is financially smart to take out the rather small loans (relative to my earning potential, that is. They could probably be paid off in a year) and get a degree that is probably ""worth"" more, has better recruiting potential, and will allow me to network with the social/financial/academic elite or to take the degree that will leave me with net worth coming out of undergrad. 

I can work during college, of course, but I'm not sure how well this will pay. I am thinking of doing standardized test tutoring throughout the year (because, hey, I'm good at it) and I know internships in the CS/banking area can be quite lucrative, but I don't want to count these chickens before they hatch. 


Now, what I'm really worrying about is what to do after college. As of right now I am planning on going into industry (perhaps to go back to get an MS or MBA if necessary to climb the corporate ladder), and my anticipated fields will probably have first year salaries in the $70k-$120k range, albeit in more expensive living areas like SF and NY. After socking away whatever is possible in a Roth IRA, provided that I am eligible, what investment vehicle would you recommend? I do not expect to have living expenses totalling more than $35k in today's dollars (unless I live in NYC), so even after taxes and loan repayment and an IRA (who knows if I will have a 401k) I will likely have some excess dough. Right now I am thinking of getting equity in a duplex and renting out the other half for money, the benefit of this being that I suspect that duplexes are a little more liquid (and definitely more renter friendly) than condoes and normal houses, which would be good if I had to relocate or if I wanted to upgrade. 

I appreciate any and all advice regarding my questions as well as any general tips when it comes to accumulating wealth during my 20's. I am aware that during my first year of living alone I will likely have some unanticipated expenses/first-timer expenses such as basic furniture, a mattress, perhaps a bike for a commute, etc. In fact, I expect that most excess income during my first year living alone will be spent on these things + building an emergency fund."

* Hiking/camping

* Casual gaming

* Music listening/playing guitar

I'd love to be in the bay area but I don't know if its possible at this point.  I know its too late for the big companies but I see a lot of postings on indeed.com and similar sites for startups and even a few for bigger companies.  "

We're currently in Lexington KY and I've got intern experience + salaried experience at a large tech company where I was able to move up fairly quickly to a mid-to-senior tier C++/Java Dev role. With that in mind, I'm trying to figure out where might be the best places to apply to in boulder. Obviously Google is one, and I've applied for a few positions, but I don't currently know anyone devs in the area to get recommendations from. Companies that pay for new hires to move are definitely a plus, but finding the best job for the long term is better in my mind than short term things like that.

Also, if anyone has any pointers for moving this far that would be great. I would ideally be moving mid-May(after fiancee's graduation) and I've never moved anywhere near this far so I'm still not exactly sure what to expect as far as the move itself."

You know what? You fuckers were right about the ""beetus touch"". It's like the stink is on me, and I am forever doomed to witness the worst of humanity's fat logic. I'm not happy about this Jan!

&gt; Last Friday

&gt; Friday drinks at work

&gt; Nothing like a cold cider after detangling a mess of a server rack

&gt; Lusers on my case about things so mundane I felt like smashing my head into a desk

&gt; Hey interns, lets take a break, and head down for some after work McBeetus!

&gt; Don't judge me, I fucking love deep fried food

Maybe it's just my love of fast food (in moderation, unlike my cider) that causes me to be in the shouting field of these fat fucks, but after my major encounter with *her,* I've been seeing fatlogic alllllll around.

&gt; Walk in

&gt; HHNNGGGHHH Air conditioning

1yrsqf,1,2014-02-24,[Career] The Path to Intelligence Analysis,randompostings,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yrsqf/career_the_path_to_intelligence_analysis/,"I'm a freshman in college right now, and for the longest time I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do after college. However, last semester I looked into a ton of different jobs, job fields, and majors, and the one area that truly looked interesting to me was in the field of intelligence, specifically intelligence analysis.

I decided that was what I wanted to do with my life, and so far, the more I read and learn about it, the more I am convinced that this field is for me. That being said, the more I learn about it, the more I realize that it is a lot more complicated to get into than what I imagined. 

Right now I am an International Studies major in a major city in the US. I have taken 1 credit hour National Security Overview classes that touch base on all the different aspects of the field (and then some). I have also applied to an internship at the FBI, albeit a very, very competitive one. I guess my question would be what exactly should I be doing right now to break into this field? I know that it will take a lot of school, and it may even take a military service or two to get my foot into the door, but I am prepared to do what is necessary to make it happen. Would anyone happen to know of anyone that works in the field, or better yet, does anyone here have any prior experience in it?"
1yrsvi,1,2014-02-24,Graduate electrical engineer that likes to make things (for now),[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yrsvi/graduate_electrical_engineer_that_likes_to_make/,"Warning, long post, but with a tl;dr:

So I graduated with two degrees in electrical engineering and math from a decent school and couldn't find a job with it...so now I'm here, in grad school at the same place. I flip-flopped around a ton of things in undergrad. Learned about math, programming, electrical engineering. I studied. A lot. Took just about every class I could, got great grades, but that's really the only thing I did. I didn't do any internships except this one in my second year that I did not enjoy, but that was more of a company thing and not the work. Not how I would have spent my time thinking about this retrospect. While I enjoy being a student, I couldn't see the stuff I was learning become a career path. None of the interviews I've managed to get panned out. It probably doesn't help that I'm not the most personable individual either and just generally suck at interviews :/ 

Towards my last semesters though, I did find myself really interested (even more so) in stuff like hobby electronics, maker culture, and shifted as much of my attention to it as much as I could. It did culminate in some large-ish projects that got some attention, but I think still started ""doing"" as opposed to ""learning"" a little too late. And now I'm in grad school because I couldn't get a job before graduating. I'm focusing on embedded systems and computer architecture, but to what end?

I'll say that there's a product development company in Seattle that has seemed like a dream job for about as long as my recent shift in interest, but I'm still waiting to hear back. 

So I'll take whatever you've got for me reddit, what should I do? Don't want to graduate again without being able to get a job.

tl;dr - grad student studying electrical and computer engineering, likes math, programming, electronics, maker culture, and just about anything even tangentially related. 

Also, a plug at my website http://benpyeh.com/, which will give you a better idea of what I'm into, and the aforementioned projects:

1yrtwi,1,2014-02-24,What are my options?,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yrtwi/what_are_my_options/,"First of all, thanks to everyone who's trying to help people.

Currently undergraduate student in one of the top 20 Universities in the world in Canada, majoring in Computer Science. It's my thing, so I'm fairly sure I will be able to graduate with fairly nice grades. And I love programming, so it's one of my career choices, however i'm an international student, so staying in NA might be a bit challenging. So, my first question is, how can i successfully stay in NA?

But in addition, I have developed a little passion in rating stuff. Like, whenever I go to restaurant or watch a movie, I can fairly well distinguish 'something bad' from 'something good'. And everyone whoever followed my advice agreed with me in the end. Of course, I always recommend them stuff according to their tastes. I'm not fairly sure how I can make this 'skill' useful, but I just love doing that. In addition to my passion to traveling, it would be like the perfect choice for me, if i was able to make a living out of this. And also, i'm fluent in 4 completely different languages and have basic knowledge of two more languages.

Oh and one more, I always wanted to start my own independent business, let's say in tech industry. But I have got no idea where and how I can start. It might sound really stupid, but sometimes I think of really nice ideas, which in business could be easily profitable, but was never able to find someone who would pursue and help me to develop that idea, so I end up with doing nothing.

So, in general, I've got programming skills. However got no proper resume, or haven't done any work that I could put into my resume, so basically, I can't find any internships in my current situations. For example, I can easily develop mediocre web applications with my current skills, but can enhance my abilities further easily whenever I want to (finding motivation is not a problem as long as I've got a certain goal). And ability to recommend people stuff as long as I know their taste.

Sorry for the long text, but I tried to be as specific as I could. Thanks again!"
1yrw5i,1,2014-02-24,[Career] I just finished my undergraduate degree and a huge part of me regrets it. Now I'm clueless,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yrw5i/career_i_just_finished_my_undergraduate_degree/,"I just finished an undergraduate degree in Communication and Media studies. When I began, I naively dreamed of being some sort of literary journalist. Before ending high school and up to my first semesters in the university, I wanted to be a writer.

Today, almost 4 years later, I have not written anything out of creativity in years, have deep resentment towards journalism (but a high sense of respect to the profession, regardless) and with a huge amount of uncertainty with what to do with my life.

This past year has been one of many attempts and experiments. I tried to draw and see if I had any kind of knack for art, and while I don't exactly suck at drawing, I most certainly don't have any mad skillz. I took up a comms. internship at a video game developer and tried to dabble in a world I know I love. I love video games and thought that love would allow me to find a path in that industry. I took up programming and code writing. I quickly found it exasperating and monotonous, and realized that making a video game was less about dreaming and creating fantasies and more about emotionless and constant raw data input.

I did some hindsight and though hard what was that which I really enjoyed doing while doing my undergrad. The only sincere answer was film making. I had many courses that required going out, filming something and then madly editing to get a finished product. While I really didn't do a lot of filmmaking I really enjoyed all the genres I dabbled into: commercials, short films, documentaries, news sections, PR videos, sketches. I loved filming them and editing them. There came a time when I was working with some other guys in a group for a corporate comms. course, and while some tasks included dreadful data crunching and analytics, other tasks required doing video material. I immediately volunteered to do *everything* related to that video material as long as it implied less data crunching and such. I loved every moment of it. My friends where always so annoyed when working with me because I was so rigorous and meticulous in all aspects of filming.

And yet, I remain uncertain. The only thing I know for sure, and perhaps you may tell is that I always strive to create. In writing, I always wanted to create worlds and characters and places and symbols and environments. I am a hardcore Jorge Luis Borges reader, if that gives you any ideas. In video games, I absolutely enjoy the whole lore aspect of it. I can spend hours on an open world game just admiring and exploring and getting to know the setting. I'm the kind of guy who reads all the databases and in-game information. In filmmaking I don't usually have good ideas, but I know I'm good at taking somebody else's draft of an idea and doing my best to make it real. I think that is one of my greatest strengths.

Other things you should know about me: 

- Huge, HUGE history nerd without any formal education. I love learning about it all, from Ottoman military tactics to Norse family structure. Everything, anything.
- Language junkie. The sounds, the writings, the grammatical structure. I don't want to die without speaking at least 8 languages and being able to read phonetically at least triple that.
- I love the internet and any tool it offers me to get my job done I will use it.

A year ago I wanted to work in video games, before that, I wanted to be a writer, and today, I kinda want to make movies.

In any case, HALP."

I understand having a core group of five characters can get kind of boring, and there isn't much to be done and new people can shake it up which makes Jeph's job easier, but...

Before it had a homely [""Friends""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) feel to it, but now its more of a [""soap opera""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera) and I cant help but wonder if every new character needs to stick around.  

[Emily](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/emily.png) is comedic relief and adds nothing to the story besides being a secondary Pintsize.  I get that she is ditzy but that means she is only Raven 2.0.  Introduce her as an intern, and leave it at that.  

[Dale](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/dale.png) was a pizza guy but now he is on the fast track to full cast member when his role of wishy washy depressed guy was already being fulfilled by Marten.  So now all he does is Marten's job but that means we lose Marten time.  

[Amir](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/amir.png) is the bassist for Deathmole and isn't being shoehorned is as a love interest for the inner circle.  More side characters need to be like him.  Do your job then go away.

I could analyze every character but what I'm getting at is we were all drawn to Questionable Content because [these](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/marten.png) [five](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/pintsize.png) [characters](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/faye.png) [felt](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/dora.png) [like friends.](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/steve.png)

I didn't fall in love with 20 people, I loved reading the strip and keeping up with just a few of them and seeing them hang out.  it was a simple good time watching them drink and hang out.  Now with the Marten/Claire situation I feel like we're being set up for some huge trans-acceptance movement which puts QC more in the 'South Park' preachy mode and not in the 'Simpsons' family mode.  Regardless of [which side](http://imgur.com/gallery/NmKf7) [you're on](http://www2.palomar.edu/users/scrouthamel/ams105/images/hippies_2.jpg) when you bring politics and these debates into the picture it becomes slightly muddied.

I feel like i'm going to be bashed for ""defending trans phobia"" but that's not what I'm getting at.

The strip isn't what is used to be.  It used to be watching a few [friends](http://guestofaguest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc.jpg) hang out but now I have to keep track of [everyone](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Castpoto.jpg) and their [killer robot](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSy4aGwPYvkVp6Vf7V3Scki3MbXOZ8o0XFAPK62iiiYa0oD92WZ).  

It is just different.  I don't have an amazing closing speech or a main point of discussion.  I'm just sad that its gone. 

Am I alone? or does everyone get what I'm putting down

Jeph if you're reading this, know that I still love the strip.  "

What do? :(",timstm,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yrxbt/sophomore_in_college_studying_computer/,"So since about halfway through my third semester taking Computer Engineering here, I've really started to lose interest in the subject matter, or the career possibilities. Since I no longer am really interested in the things I'm learning, I've been kind of slacking off, which causes me to procrastinate, average grades, etc. (Honeslty I should be doing homework right now, but I just found this sub and wanted to post.)

Anyway, in the last month or so, my gf of 4+ years broke up which has caused me to be even more distracted than I already was, and idk, it just feels like this isnt for me anymore. Problem is, I'm on a pretty hefty scholarship - I dont think I would necessarily lose it if I were to drop out of some of my major courses, but then I'd be stuck with like 6 credit hours across two non major courses. Also have a reallly nice internship doing IT support... I dunno, its pretty complicated, and Ill answer more in the comments if asked.

I always felt that I had NO idea what I wanted to go into even if I left, but recently, I kinda had one of those moments where I thought of something that really hit me kinda hard. Since I had been with that girl for so long, and everything through high school and even first year of college was kind of going my way, I always thought I knew *who* I was, if that makes sense. Now that I no longer like what Im learning, and no longer have her around, I feel lost, like in myself. But the other day, I thought of something that I thought honestly might 1.) help me in finding myself in terms of what I want to do, 2) help by helping others, and 3.) help my become more confident in myself, and other things I think I am lacking.

The thing I thought of was that I reallllly want to go on a service trip abroad - like, South Africa abroad, working with kids or something. The more I think about it, the crazier it seems, but at the same time, the more RIGHT it feels. I dunno, its like its something I think I could do well (like being a TA or something in a grade school), and like something that would help myself. (And if I'm being completely honest, it is something that I kind of hope will help rekindle the things that were lost in the long life of my ex's and my relationship, like maybe she'll feel for me again like she originally did. I know its not healthy to think that way... But i just miss her like crazy..)

Anyway, I know this is really kind of ranty, and I'm sorry, but I would realllly love anyone's advice or words from experience on the matter. I know a trip like that could be really expensive, but I think I can handle it, and it would be worth it."

Economics is an immensely valuable degree, especially where I'm attending - it's a feeder school for I-banks, VC, hedge funds, etc. Problem is, that's not at all what I want. I'm not into the hours, I'm not into the stress, I'm not into just pushing money around for the rest of my life. Other problem is, I'm a fairly mediocre Econ student pulling a very blah 3.0 GPA in intro and intermediate courses right now. Granted, I'm taking them with other majors and grading out at roughly average, and it will rise slightly in upper-level classes that play more to my strengths (theory, paper writing) but still...average. Not exactly appealing to employers, esp. without any internships (my previous summers have been devoted to gigging, summer classes,  and building my music network).

About that...I've also decided that if I do pursue a career in music, it won't be as a performer, as I spent the last two years of music school watching something I love become something I dreaded doing every day. My love for music has been reawakened though; I direct a couple student ensembles  now (fun!) and compose in my free time, learning Logic on the school computers. I guess I'm intrigued by film/game composing...but how on earth do you get into a field like that?!

So here's where I'm at. I'm a mediocre Econ student who loves the coursework but is put off by the traditional path of my school's econ majors (not to mention probably not accomplished or connected enough to get those jobs anyway). I'd love to switch my major to American History (and am getting a 3.8+ GPA in my history courses to go along w/ a 3.75 cumulative), but am worried that without internships a history major won't get me anywhere with future employers, no current interest in a phD in any field, with the spectre of a potential rebirth of my planned and discarded career in music looming in the background. I'm graduating next year and I have absolutely no clue whatsoever what to do afterwards.

Help! Where do I go from here? I like writing, I like learning, I like composing, I'm not put off by statistics, I want to learn programming, I won't shy away from creative work...what could I do?"

I'm very interested in technology, but new technology trends come and go and I don't want to take 2-4 years in school to learn a passing trend.  Or, spending those years to learn that I went to school for something in a field which I can't stand.

The things I enjoy most are computers: building fixing and taking apart.  All windows based, with minor experience in Linux and osx.  I took a two year computer repair / CISCO course in Highschool and they ended up passing me through repair the first day and onto CISCO.  I enjoy learning about networking devices, and figuring out how to use new hardware/software.  My understanding of networking, and CISCO is very limited and slightly dated however.  I enjoy most motorsports, motorcycles, stuff like that.  I race a dirtbike in my spare time if time allows.  Currently, I'm a CDL driver delivering for an orchid company with a few years experience driving.  I don't mind hard physical dirty work, especially if it gets me away from dealing with irate or ditsy users.

The things I don't particularly enjoy, programming, CISCO (I'm almost certain I do not want a job focusing on these devices), jobs where memorization and customer interaction are valued more than tech knowledge or anything else.  I'm not a complete social bomb, but I just prefer jobs that aren't customer service oriented.  I'm not interested in helping senior citizens learn computers, but my current delivery job has me dealing with customers at delivery locations daily.  My last jobs were mostly customer service, and I just want to get away from that.

I'm not chasing massive wealth, or anything like that.  I just want a career which is relevant to what I love and am interested in.  I'm not very solid with the things I do not like.  I'm sure with my current interests, learning programming is only a matter of time.  I try to pick it up here and there in different languages but nothing really clicks.  Maybe this computer stuff of mine is just a hobby and I should focus my career choices somewhere else.  I'm interested by just about everything, but computers/tech devices is what comes to mind when people think about me.  I've considered joining military or coast guard just for the hands on opportunities, but the idea of a contract involving my life seems too much for me at this time.  I've also entertained the idea of looking for an unpaid internship somewhere just to see what kind of jobs people do.  I wish there was a way I could hang out with a lot of different people at their jobs to see what they do and if I would enjoy it.

any sort of career paths anyone could recommend for someone like me would be amazing, thank you for your time and considerations!  feel free to ask questions about me if you want to know more, or if you do a job which you think I might like tell me all about it!"

Most of the unis I have applied to are on the West Coast, but a few are in different regions (New York, Colorado, North Carolina, Illinois). While speaking to a few friends and family (who are working there), most of them told me not to accept any college unless it was in the Bay Area. Not just California, but the Bay Area ONLY. I found this extremely restrictive, but they said that the location was a crucial aspect in getting part-time work or internships, and no one would care about the Uni I went to once I graduate with industry experience. Also, with my profile, I haven't applied to Berkeley or CMU, but to less selective universities.

I have been accepted to 2 state colleges and await the decisions from the rest. However, is there any merit to the advice I've been given? Will studying in CO or NC (at good colleges) be a lot worse than a locally known college in the Bay Area? I hope this isn't off-topic in this subreddit, but since many of you are either working, recruiting or applying for tech jobs, I figured this would be the best place to ask.

1ysc5s,8,2014-02-24,How does a Sysadmin handle a mid-life crisis,svdcxz207,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ysc5s/how_does_a_sysadmin_handle_a_midlife_crisis/,"Hi SYSADMIN reddit!

.

Over the past year, I’ve applied over 80 jobs and been in 30 phone interviews. 7 of those turned into to On-site interviews for Jr Linux System Admin positions.  Only **2** of them made it into the final rounds.  On some interviews, I connected well with the interviewers but failed to pass the technical. On others, I did excellent on the technical part and failed to convey that fit job. 

.

There are several reasons I think contributed to failing:

1)	 **I use to wing it**. (Not anymore though)

2)	**Hard to keep technical knowledge**. I am constantly learning and studying. However, the upkeep of technical knowledge is difficult without using them on a daily bases. It feels like a catch22. On one hand if you learned it and don’t use it you will forget it. On the other, in order to use what you’ve learned you must be practicing it on the job. A job which I don’t have.

3)	**Honest to a fault**. It has been written time and time again that one should turn their weakness into strength but I showed my real weaknesses. Interviews would ask “What is your experience with python?” I would say, “Just the basics and the syntax”. Interview would ask “What is your experience with VMware?” I would say, “Just creating VMs and deleting them”

4)	**I am not use to being asked so many questions**. In a social setting, I’m the type of person that adds to the conversation once enough information is shared. 

.


I’ve always had a love for technology; built my own PC at 9yr old and programmed in C++ in middle school, but I rarely had any interview experience. Now I am almost turning 30 without a job and a useless MIS degree. I could not even get my foot in the door with almost 2 years of linux internship experience. I go to sys admin meetups that are beyond my understanding. I have enough skills to take the RHSCA, Network+, and then some. In the worst case scenario I guess I can shell out what I have left to get those certs…

.

**What are your thoughts /r/sysadmin? I would very much like to hear what you have to say and learn from your wisdom.**

.

Some thoughts:

How can I improve my approach to all this?

What are the most valuable skills to focus on at jr level?

I have aws instances but I am also thinking of investing in a 150$ server to practice on.

Not quite sure on how to improve on the non-technical aspect of the interview.

Am I hustling hard enough? Should I contact their HR recruiting or just show up with a resume?

.

Thanks for listening.

""Yeah, over there."" She pointed at the skinny, quiet kid that always sat in the back of the class. Alone. Eyes the colour of hazelnuts, his hair greasy and awkwardly combed to the back of his head, as if he was constantly riding his bike into an oncoming storm. His bike, probably his most valued possession. It was only the shadow of the shiny blue brand new it used to be. But he loved it, as if it was his only friend.

One day, he came out of school and walked towards the bicycle parking station, unknowingly walking in on a scene he would not want to witness, let alone be the victim of. ""Shit guys, he's there!"", giggled a ginger haired girl he had never seen before, while she waved her hand in a gesture that said *let's run*. Only a glimpse of her is what he caught, a glimpse that was imprinted in his memory forever. He caressed the wreck of his bike as if it was a dying friend - which it probably was, to him. Then and there, he swore he would make it his life goal to blossom good and do away with evil.

Years had gone by, and God had just won the election. He had worked hard for it, too: he had graduated cum laude from high school, finished four years of university law studies and had spent the past seven years working as a campaign intern for various political parties, to gather experience, which he then used to start his own party. He campaigned and picketed,  and now he made it: he was president of the universe. Things were going to change, but in a very democratic and non-dictatorship way. He installed Heaven and he installed Hell. He encouraged good and punished evil. He was an all-seeing, all loving God, but what the public didn't know, was his history. The reason why. And more importantly, the secret grudge he held that dictated his life in more ways than he could imagine himself, at that point.

And then came I. I was born after he had been in presidency for a long time. He knew about every baby born in his universe, and he somewhat influenced the way their life would go, from womb to casket. When he saw me, he gasped. I was a small chubby baby with eyes as blue as the sky. My upper lip sat there awkwardly, as if it was too big for my face, and I looked like I just invented the duckface photo fad years before its time - but I smiled. I thought I was going to be happy, I honestly believed that. I had this small pluck of ginger hair on my head, fluffy enough for it to be petted by everyone I met. A small pluck, but big enough for him to notice. With the glimpse of my gingery, silky hair, the memory he had locked up years ago yet based his entire existence on broke out of the depths of his mind, and filled him with a rage he had never deemed possible. ""No!"" he thought, ""No, I can't allow her to live... but what kind of a God would I be, were I to kill her right here, right now?"" The sadistic undertone of his intelligent mind took over, and he swore then and there that I would pay for what I made him feel that moment. 

Within years, my allergies had already taken out most of my healthy days. My parents had divorced, I was moved from here to there and then back, never feeling the warmth of a place called Home. Growing up,  I was that weird kid God once was, sitting in the back of the class, alone, with a book and a bike, without any friends. I was an outcast, or at least I felt like one. Everyone I ever loved either died or abandoned me, everyone I ever trusted misused that trust to abuse and hurt me. He took it all out, on me, for my entire life.

Until one day, he ran into her. The girl that had bullied him, the girl that had deceived him and trashed his bike. She was dying, and only then, she turned to him. She prayed  and begged, apologised and flattered, wanting to stay alive. He realised he should forgive her, but he could not. ""You turn to me in a moment of death, after deceiving me for a lifetime?"" He left her to die, alone and painfully. It was in that moment he realised how he had it wrong. How he should not have punished me for something I had not done. He needed to make things right.

He reached into his Heaven, massively underpopulated, and found the kindest soul in there. ""It is time"", he whispered, ""I have the most important mission for you"". He took that kindest soul, wrapped him up in the most handsome human being he could possibly imagine, gave him a warm heart, a great sense of humour and most of all, a personality that was just the right amount of different yet the same to mine. He sent him down, smack in the middle of my shitty life. 

I smiled. Genuinely, for the first time in what seemed forever."

In a year I will be done with my BA in Sports Management, and for the last semester I have to go on an internship in a sports organization or club.

Having followed eSport for the past 10 years I am aware of the growth and potential of the market, but I am still in doubt of whether I should try to get an internship in a eSport organization/club, since I don't know if it is worth following this branch of sports.

I love both football (soccer) and eSports equally.

With a career in the football business I will get a stable income and future, but in a line of business that already are developed, and my chances of doing anything groundbreaking is smaller than with a career in eSport.

E-sport is a young line of business, where I can't be sure to get a job and an income where I can live of it, but on the other hand, I will be doing what I love, and I will be able to combine hobby with job (every ones wish, right?). Except somewhere in the future I want to actually be able to provide for a family.

So my question for you is, do you think that eSport will grow large enough for me to have my entire life-career in the business? If anyone got any statistics, inside knowledge or anything else that would be useful, I would be glad if they where to be posted here :-)

TL;DR: Do you think that eSport will grow large enough for me to have my entire life-career in the business?"

So long story short I'm one year away from graduating with my degree and besides doing programming courses I can't really think of anything I can put on my resume that is related to coding that will make me stand out.

So, long story short, I come to you guys to ask - what kind of work can I participate in in order to prove that I can code at a semi competent level and where? Unfortunately vacation/part time work is incredibly hard to come by for coding around my part without showing something on your resume and I know online projects to participate in are often the best way to go, but where would I start with this?  

Without rambling too much, where did you go/what did you do in order to prove you have the skills for the job, and are there any particular types of projects you would recommend I attempt to participate in? Is there a reasonably common language that I should consider learning in order to increase my chances of finding work?

Any help is appreciated, thanks guys! 

Edit:

Thank you all for the feedback! I should have mentioned that I'm Australian and for the most part, internships are quite uncommon. Part time/Vacation work does happen and I will attempt to apply for this kind of work, although in my area its very difficult to pick these up.  
From here, I think I'm going to start writing mobile phone apps and contribute to both github and stack overflow. I'll write up a website myself to demonstrate the apps I produce to ensure its easily accessible for employers. Thank you very much, its really appreciated! "

I'm 21 and based out of Ohio

I will be graduating in May with a B.A. in Computer Science from  a small, private Liberal Arts college. I am completely open to working / training before that happens.  

*I am passionate about technology*, and I would love to join a company who shares this passion. Another passion of mine is being able to take really complex things, and explain them in layman's terms. I feel that I could also do very well in sales, but I understand that my lack of any formal experience in sales doesn't help that claim. While I am a CS major, I don't feel that my calling is in development. While the mental puzzles offered by coding do intellectually stimulate me, I don't feel that I could best serve a company by sitting at a terminal all day crunching code. 

**About me:**  

*I have technical experience*. I spent last summer in San Diego working as a backend server intern for a travel agency data consolidation company. I mostly worked with SQL, and the data analysis was done with Crystal Reporting. In my computer science courses, I have learned C++ and Python, with some minor experience in C, Java, and Ruby. I have set up a few websites, and I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails. 

*I have extensive leadership experience*. For example, I was the Vice President of the student body, and have served on the student government for all 4 years. I served on the Presidential Selection Committee, which has the honor of screening possible presidential candidates. I am an Eagle Scout. I will walk first and speak at graduation because I am the Senior Co-Governor, and announce the class gift, which I have been working all year to fundraise for. I started my own organization on campus, whose mission it was to foster interpersonal relationships between students, and create a campus culture of respect and appreciation. I am a proud member of Beta Theta Pi, of which I served as the secretary. I was just nominated for the Distinguished Leadership Award, which is given to less than 30 graduating seniors for their accomplishments on campus. 

*I am a very creative person*. I work on campus in the media lab, where I tutor students on creative applications such as Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Logic. I actively read and write. I am very involved in my community. The summer after my sophomore year I spent in service, counseling juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program centered around a community garden. 

I value work ethic and the relationships I form. I can relocate to anywhere. I know the significance of professional mannerism, but I feel that I can liven up any office. 

Thank you so very much for looking at my posting. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me via pm and I can send you my resume. 

Thank you!"
1yt944,54,2014-02-24,Career Fair reflections from an Employer,yellowjacketcoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1yt944/career_fair_reflections_from_an_employer/,"So, my company is hiring interns and co-ops from my alma mater for a QA position (we're full up on resumes, sorry if you're still looking). We went to a career fair down at the local college, and I thought I would share my thoughts as an employer and ask if there's any advice for next time. 

**Dos and Don'ts for a Career Fair**

* DO dress nicely - suit and tie. The guy that showed up in a stained sweater got his resume binned without even looking at it. 

* DO apply even if you aren't a perfect fit. Sure, we're a Java shop, but if you know C# or python you can learn Java. Or, you know Java but don't know JUnit? Yea, we don't expect our candidates to know that, we know we'll be teaching you. On the other hand...

* DON'T apply to something totally inappropriate. Sorry dude, I'm sure you're learning a lot in your Environmental Engineering classes but a software QA spot is not right for you. You're just wasting your time *and* ours. 

* DON'T get discouraged. We got 14 resumes for ONE opening. And we're a tiny company you've never heard of. A lot of people aren't going to make it. That means...

* DO apply to several places. Really, we understand that our first choice might go someplace that pays better. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 

* DO try out more than one career fair. My alma mater has a CS specific, intern-specific career fair that we would have *loved* to go to, but it filled up before we could register. So we're stuck at the general career fair. If you only went to one, you might have missed out. 

* DON'T bring backpacks in. All you need is a folder with your resume - if you have to digging past your gym socks to get me a resume (no kidding), it's not making you look good.

* DO hand me your resume early on. It doesn't have to be the first thing you do (that should be ""Hi, my name is &lt;&gt;, what positions do you have open?""), but if we've been chatting for a while and I have to ask for it, that's annoying. 

* DON'T keep yapping about something you're obviously not interested in. Yes, it's a QA spot, not pure development or PM. If you are unwilling to take a QA spot, and have made that obvious, it's kinda awkward to hold up the line. 

* DO have an elevator speech lined up. Answering ""Are you looking for an internship or a co-op?"" with ""Hmm, um, what WOULD I like? hmm, maybe I should have looked up the difference before I came here..."" is not putting your best foot forward.

* DO speak up. A career fair is a noisy place - you might be the best candidate in the world, but if I can't understand anything you say, it's hard to want to go to the second round.

* Lastly, DO sort out whatever internal requirements your college has for interning before going to the career fair. As a company we believe in getting back you with a yay or nay on the interview *the next day*; when I got half our accepts back with ""I can't register for the interviews through our college system"" I first freaked out that I had done something wrong. Nope, all those people hadn't checked the boxes required by the college to sign up for an interview. Do you think that made them look good? Not really.... (Not enough to reverse our decision, but it was exasperating). 

EDIT: Another DON'T a coworker brought up - DON'T include irrelevant junk on your resume. Yes, it's nice that you backpacked through Europe or that you played with Pandas for a month, but that doesn't belong on your resume, ESPECIALLY when it takes up room that could have described the projects you worked on.

But enough about you, let me ask about me. **What things do employers do at career fairs that turn you off?** 

* We did have a banner announcing who were were, with taped up sheets noting what major we were looking for, what term they would start, and whether intern or co-op. 

* We didn't have swag to give away, but really are you looking for swag at a career fair, or are you looking for a job?

* We didn't have company literature to hand out. We missed the boat on that one. 

* We had more than one person to talk to, to keep the line down. 

* Obviously we would have preferred to go to the CS-specific career fair - we'll get that next time. 

* We pledged to let anyone that applied know if they were moving to the next round (or not) within 24 hours and we stuck to it.

But what else could we do as a company to attract candidates? Or just not waste your time? We had a few people whose name tag indicated they were the right major and year for us to hire, they looked at our sign, shrugged, and walked right past. :( Really, we weren't busy, come and say hello at least.

For example, I'd like to learn python, html/css/javascript, and java (and MAYBE ruby/perl if time) while working on a few projects to build up my skill level while also having something to show for it. 

If I *do* get an internship, I'll have the work experience, but I'll also come at still only knowing C++. I'm just wondering which is more important for me? Thanks!"
1ytacr,2,2014-02-24,Equipment U's in Rack,creamersrealm,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ytacr/equipment_us_in_rack/,"If I can pick your brains for a minute, im wondering how most people cable there racks with what equipment per rack and how they use the equipment.

Currently the way my current company is doing it is like this for 1Gb networks

Rack A
4 Side Mount PDUS for power - zero u.
Switch 24 port
1u cable organizer

Rack B
4 Side Mount PDUS for power - zero u.
1u cable organizer
Switch 24 port
1u cable organizer
24-32 port kvm

I feel like there are better ways to do this, also the equiment is mounted midway which kinda messes up the u spacing depending if they used cable management or not, also it does save money on cables.

To me it would make more sense to put a A and B 48 port switch in this configuration or use 2 u cable managers to save an extra u.

Rack A
4 Side Mount PDUS for power - zero u.

Rack B
4 Side Mount PDUS for power - zero u.
SW1
1u cable organizer
SW2
1u cable organizer
KVM
1u cable organizer

Rack C
4 Side Mount PDUS for power - zero u.

With this you would have switch redundancy with switch cost savings so you you would buy one less switch per 2 racks and you would have more centralized cabling.

What is everyone's thoughts on this and how do you do yours if you can share?

1ytmvi,2,2014-02-24,Advice on summer internship,MPowerSwag,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1ytmvi/advice_on_summer_internship/,"Hi everyone, I need some advice or insight on my current situation. I am an undergrad junior studying Finance and Accountancy. To make a long story short, I just recently decided I want a career in IB or asset management and relied on networking too much to get my foot in the door someplace so I did not apply to as many places as I should have. I figured I did not stand a chance at the big banks with people preparing 6 months prior for the interviews. I currently work at a state treasury as a part time analyst, and while the pay is not great and the work is not that exciting, I am learning a lot and getting good experience, especially with Bloomberg. 

But here is my situation where I need advice. I have the opportunity to complete an internship abroad in London for a small real estate asset management firm. I had been relying on this opportunity for a while, so I did not try as hard as I should have to find other options. But now as this can become a reality, I am learning more about the logistics and details about the summer internship. It's a small shop but they do a lot of work with Blackstone and have quite a bit of assets throughout Europe, and it seems like a great opportunity for me to learn as well as experience life outside the US. But I have a few concerns...

* I would not be getting paid much. About 50 pounds a day, so just enough to cover food costs. I would have to pay out of pocket for living expenses.

* It's a small firm that does not usually take interns, and when they do, the interns are grad students from the London Business School. 

* Work visas and travel is expensive...they MAY cover some of these costs.

Overall, I want to hear some of your advice if this opportunity is worth it. I was told by some contacts I have at large banks that international experience will help me stand out and give me a better chance when I start looking for a job. My parents and my savings can help me afford the expenses for the opportunity. But I do not want to spend all this money if the internship will not help me in the long run.

1ytp3h,2,2014-02-24,Should I send one last email?,pmunkyandpals,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1ytp3h/should_i_send_one_last_email/,"**2/6/14** - I went to my university's career fair and spoke with a company that seemed very interested in me. I got a call later that night for an interview that next morning.

**2/7/14** - Interview went extremely well, and I asked when I could expect to hear back. He said that evening or the next day. He didn't sound too sure about it so I didn't hold him to it. 

**2/14/14** - I sent a ""Thanks for the interview"" email a little later than I should have but he responded almost immediately. He said he was very impressed with my interview, I have a great future ahead of me, etc. He said that I would have a definitive answer either Friday evening or Monday morning. No problem.


**TODAY (1:29pm)** - No calls, no emails. I was being considered for a summer internship and this kind of determines my plans for the next year. Are they just screwing with me or did I get lost in the pile? 

Should I send one more email just to make sure I'm still in the running or should I wait a day or two?

Thanks!"
1yts3z,14,2014-02-24,"Results of my first bulk - 5 months clean, Diet &amp; Routine included",danny_b87,naturalbodybuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1yts3z/results_of_my_first_bulk_5_months_clean_diet/,"tl;dr did clean bulk too clean, only gained 6 lb (3 lb LBM)  
  
I thought I would make an update post with the results of my 5 month clean bulk and the diet/workout I used since some people appreciate how anal I get about my nutrition. I am a 26 year old male, 6’1”, 190lb, ~10% body fat, almost 8 years lifting experience (not all of it serious)  
  
Here is my initial post last year: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1h6el2/7_year_progress_60lbs_and_25_body_fat_xpost_from/  
  
Overall a little disappointed, this was my first bulk since losing 60 lbs and I found it really hard mentally to let myself gain weight, my goal was 10 lbs in ~5 months but I only gained 6 lb, 3 lb LBM and 3 lb fat (via Dexascan) up to ~190 lb with 10% body fat. The first few months I averaged 3200 calories and then I upped it to 3300 calories and then 3500 the last month. I don't have as many progress photos since it annoyed me getting softer but here are my measurement improvements: 
  
from 10/2013 to 2/2014, measurements were taking in the morning after a rest day for consistent comparison  
Left Arm: 14.75” -&gt; 15.25”  
Right Arm: 14.25” -&gt;15.25”  
Chest 41” -&gt; 43.5”  
Waist 31.5” -&gt; 31”  
Left Thigh 23” -&gt; 24.25”  
Right Thigh 23.5” -&gt; 24.25”  
Left Calf 14.75” -&gt; 15.5”  
Right Calf 14.5” -&gt; 15.5”  
  
The workout I was doing the last 3 months was P.H.A.T., I didn't feel like I get the most out of it due to some injuries. I strained my rotator cuff during the first month and my MCL felt tight a majority of the time which set me back a month or so.

My diet was pretty similar to my previous post as I like those foods and the macros were about right but I'll relist them here. Aim was ~50/25/25  
  
*High calorie breakfast:*
  
* Pancakes w/dark chocolate chips &amp; blueberries ~ 450 calories  
* 1 Tbsp Honey  
* 2 Egg omelet with 2% cheese

*Low Calorie breakfast:*

*Lunches:*  
  
* 93/7 Beef 1/4 lb - 1/2 lb or 93/7 ground turkey ~1/3 lb  
* Potato/Sweet Potato cubes baked in olive oil ~ calories  
* 1 Apple  
* 1 Cup V8 Low Sodium  
* Fish Oil Pills (depending on strength)  
  
*Snacks*  
  
* 1 Banana  
* Almonds  
* Greek Yogurt or Greek Yogurt/Oats mix  
* ½ PB&amp;J Sandwich (when needed extra calories)
* Post Workout Protein Powder 260 cal (20g pro, 40g carb)  
  
*Dinner 1*  
  
* 1/2 lb grilled chicken  
* Brown Rice cooked in olive oil  
* Green Peas  
  
*Dinner 2*

* Corn  
 
*Dinner 3*  
  
* 1 Can tuna ~4 oz  
* Brown Rice cooked in olive oil 
* Green Peas 
  
Supplements: I prefer a whole foods approach so I don’t take many supplements, just the protein powder I mentioned (EAS's Recovery Protein which does have 1.5g HMB), creatine (ON's creatine monohydrate), fish oil, and recently started taking a glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM supp in the off chance it helps speed my joint/tendon injuries.  
Started my cut last week, aiming for 3000 calories since upping my cardio as well by biking to and from gym 3x/week, 2 warm up jogs/week, and one 30 min jog. Pretty much only change in diet is having the low calorie breakfast and just greek yogurt without oats as a snack. In a week or 2 will go down to ~2700.  
  
The new workout I designed is a 5 day split - Shoulders &amp; Abs, Legs, Chest &amp; Abs, Back, then Arms. Still tweeking since just did the first week but here is what I did: http://imgur.com/Jnf1nsp  
If anyone has any feedback on the workout definitely let me know, want to make sure it hits all the major muscles and shooting for ~45 min. Arms workout definitely needs help, barely felt worked out when done. Here is my fitocracy for anyone that wants to follow: http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/KingBeer/  
  
I don't know if I will be doing a June competition in Longview, TX or Austin, TX in July (will find out first week of April if I got into an internship) so will refine calorie goals then but goal is to be at 5% body fat by competition so ~1 lb/week. I'll keep you updated as competition gets closer! Thanks in advance for any feedback or advice.  
  
edit: pics from a year ago almost at the height of my last cut ~7% front: http://imgur.com/KAoQhEa &amp; back http://imgur.com/9puChUu  
will try to find some decent recent pics but the lighting at new gym sucks :-/ basically just softer

To give you some background, I am 26, female, currently living in NJ (moved here from India almost 8 months ago). I have been unemployed since I moved here and my previous job was quite unrelated to software/IT. I worked in the power sector and did not like it very much and want to get back into programming. I have a US degree in electronics engineering, did some IT internships in college (mostly QA stuff for Enterprise applications - but did not write any test scripts or such, had to do some work with Access and VBA) 

I am uncertain as to how to proceed. I am familiar with Java and am starting to go over some android tutorials and ruby on rails tutorials. But I feel I am just doing it because I hear about these things being so popular. I don't know what kind of a job in software I want, has good prospects, and is gettable too. I get confused as to whether I should focus on Java/Springs/Struts or mobile/web development or ASP/.NET.I feel like I will never get a job with a career path because I'm so confused and not focussed on one thing. I have started applying to Business Analyst/QA positions even though I dont want to work that position because I feel I will atleast increase my likelihood of getting a job and I can keep working on switching later on. 

Please help if you have any suggestions, advice, experience with this. I feel even more depressed just being unemployed while everybody I know is making 90k+ or atleast have a career. 

I did interview for an entry level java position which I didn't get, but entry level positions seem to come by once in a while, and I feel I don't even have enough knowledge for an entry level position

My appointment according to the online sign-up sheet was scheduled from 1:00-1:45 PM. In actuality, it lasted for 35 minute total. The recruiter began the interview with some administrative questions which I answered all with a yes. Afterwards, she began to ask me cliche questions like when was the last time you helped someone? when did you get yourself out of a difficult situation? etc. I think I answered them okay, some caught me off guard. She made persistent eye contact, and smiled in some cases. She then looked at my resume and asked about some of my roles at my prior internships and activities. Afterwards, she began talking about how the company is looking to recruit 200 people, while thousands have applied, and said that sitting here interviewing, is a huge accomplishment in itself, and she began to say how her feedback doesn't hold much weight, and it is ultimately the hiring managers, etc who will decide if I am in or not, and said I will be notified in 2-3 weeks with either a YES or NO. She then proceeded to ask if I had any questions, and I asked about 4 questions that made her laugh in a good way and say they were good questions. Then, she walked me out and I thanked her and shook her hand.

I previously had an interview that lasted a mere 9 minutes so I felt pretty good that an interview lasted about 30 minutes for once . Me and another guy were the only ones to be interviewed at the school as well. I have not heard from the company as of yet.

How do you all think I did? Please be honest and thanks for your time and feedback! The 2 week mark is soon approaching so I'm getting restless.

I won't be done till my mid 30's if I'm lucky. i don't even have an AA yet so there is so much to relearn that i feel it will take me to long and that i won't get jobs. my biggest fear with this is that younger kids will get the jobs first because really are you going to hired a young 24 year old fresh out with a masters or a 35 year old. I'm probably just listening to myself to much and allowing myself to be discouraged. but idk what to do. i already have a good job as a uber x driver. but if i go back to school i want to do something that will earn me more then what i make now and i feel learning computers can give me a job that pays even better. problem is doing it. i don't know if i can handle the work load. and trying to not worry about the younger kids who have been doing it longer then me. i guess I'm really hard on myself but i just can't help it. any advice or encouragement and even criticism is welcome. :D thanks "

I spoke with the VP today over the phone and he mentioned that they will be making a formal offer within the next week.

[ I will be working part time for the company before I graduate @ about 10-15 hours a week. ]
I am a graduating senior from a BSCE program at a good school.

I do have no relevant work or internship experience, but that is the point of coming in before graduation. By the time I graduate I plan to have my EIT license. 

This is about a 500 person company and the division that I am going into is their bread winner [handles ~$9M annually purely in engineering work costs. (analysis &amp; design) ]
The office I will be in will be a small office, a satellite of the main company (if relevant.) 
I expect it to be a technical position, lots and lots of calcs, analysis and design (structural). 
I think that they like me a lot, and they seem like they are the type to make a fair offer.

Given this information, what kind of salary should I be expecting to be offered for the full time position?
 
My research seems to imply that salaries are between 50k and 60k, does that seem reasonable? I'd like to narrow this guess a bit.

I don't want to undervalue myself, but I also recognize that as a new grad I have basically no leverage outside of my personality and education.

I walked in the door to my mother sitting in her chair with her face in her hands crying. She showed me the paper stating there was no longer anything we could do to save our house, it was an official document stating we had to get out. My mother had been battling with my recently divorced father about getting all the documents needed, but both my selfish father and the constantly losing things bank never quite had what they needed to help. So now, my poor mother and myself have to leave.

I was just car shopping as my car was taken out of commission, I was saving for something decent, something I could be proud of. I didn't know we were going to have to leave our house anytime soon, I had no idea the state of things. I was in the middle of their relationship, as the rock for 10 years, the intermediary, they never understood when I checked out, when I was done. 

Yesterday I was happy.

But now here I am absolutely destroyed. I need a new car, a new place to live, a place for my cats, I have $725/mo in student loans. I work 40 miles away, I make OK money, and I love my job, but it's in my contract that I can't work another job. I'm not due a raise for another 4 months. not to mention living in this part of the state is exceedingly expensive.

1yuucn,3,2014-02-24,What are my options?,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yuucn/what_are_my_options/,"First of all, thanks to everyone who's trying to help people.

Currently undergraduate student in one of the top 20 Universities in the world in Canada, majoring in Computer Science. It's my thing, so I'm fairly sure I will be able to graduate with fairly nice grades. And I love programming, so it's one of my career choices, however i'm an international student, so staying in NA might be a bit challenging. So, my first question is, how can i successfully stay in NA?

But in addition, I have developed a little passion in rating stuff. Like, whenever I go to restaurant or watch a movie, I can fairly well distinguish 'something bad' from 'something good'. And everyone whoever followed my advice agreed with me in the end. Of course, I always recommend them stuff according to their tastes. I'm not fairly sure how I can make this 'skill' useful, but I just love doing that. In addition to my passion to traveling, it would be like the perfect choice for me, if i was able to make a living out of this. And also, i'm fluent in 4 completely different languages and have basic knowledge of two more languages.

Oh and one more, I always wanted to start my own independent business, let's say in tech industry. But I have got no idea where and how I can start. It might sound really stupid, but sometimes I think of really nice ideas, which in business could be easily profitable, but was never able to find someone who would pursue and help me to develop that idea, so I end up with doing nothing.

So, in general, I've got programming skills. However got no proper resume, or haven't done any work that I could put into my resume, so basically, I can't find any internships in my current situations. For example, I can easily develop mediocre web applications with my current skills, but can enhance my abilities further easily whenever I want to (finding motivation is not a problem as long as I've got a certain goal). And ability to recommend people stuff as long as I know their taste.

Sorry for the long text, but I tried to be as specific as I could. Thanks again!"
1yv2n2,5,2014-02-24,When is age more than a number?,shiny_samurai,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1yv2n2/when_is_age_more_than_a_number/,"A little background:  


I'm 19, he's about to turn 27. We've been working together for the past two months in a shipyard where my typical apparel includes coveralls and dirt on my face. I started work there as an intern that was supposed to be temporary but I loved the work so much that I'm going to be making it a permanent position once I take a couple weeks off to make the permanent move.

The first day we worked together, there was instant chemistry, at least our personalities melded well together. For 8 hours, there was hardly a lull in communication. He knew my age from day 1. After several weeks of working together, it seemed that at the very least we had the potential to be really great friends.

The last week I worked as an intern in the shipyard he confessed that he didn't have many friends yet I was one of them. On my last day, he asked about my roommate search and suggested we try to find a place together. He also asked me to be his gym buddy and said we could be ""bros."" I hardly tried to keep it a secret at any point that I had a major crush on him. But, I'm not sure if the age difference means more to him than it does to me.

I love his person, that's what I've come to realize. The fact that we can talk for hours and spend half the day playing 20 questions while we work is amazing and I haven't gotten close to many people in the area. But, I'm not sure if I should make a move and risk making things awkward when I need a friend? It seems like he may be interested but hesitant to do anything about it because of the stigma attached.  Or I might just be friendzoned, which is entirely possible.
What should I do? His birthday is coming up and I could try and do something for him then.  Or do I just let it be and see if he makes a move first?    
   
TLDR; Should a 19 year old woman make a move on a 27 year old man or let it be and see where it leads?"

I'm a second year student in computer science and looking for someone to critique my resumes. This is the first time I look for an internship position.

The first resume is my older resume and the one the career office helped me write, they kept telling me to add details and more info, in my opinion it came out to be way too long and boring.

The second resume is the one that is most recent, I rewrote it myself following the first long one and made it only a page. My issue is that it feels pretty empty being a page.

1yv5nb,3,2014-02-24,Less is more? Looking for resume critique,gunnerheadboy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1yv5nb/less_is_more_looking_for_resume_critique/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a second year student in computer science and looking for someone to critique my resumes. This is the first time I look for an internship position.

The first resume is my older resume and the one the career office helped me write, they kept telling me to add details and more info, in my opinion it came out to be way too long and boring.

The second resume is the one that is most recent, I rewrote it myself following the first long one and made it only a page. My issue is that it feels pretty empty being a page.

Onto the links:

1yv61d,1,2014-02-24,Need some real advice here. Please help.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1yv61d/need_some_real_advice_here_please_help/,"Im a 20 year old junior in college. Im a computer science major, that just transferred from community college.

I’m in this dilemma. 

I constantly struggle with my math classes. It took me a whole year to pass calc 1. And I am starting to struggle with calc 2 and my discrete mathematics courses. I love computer science, I have a passion for coding, but math isn’t my strong suit. I have only 4 more math courses to take then I am done with math forever. Currently I have to take: calc 2, discrete mathematics 1, discrete mathematics 2, and a statistics class. I constantly and consistently go to office hours, tutors, patrickjmt.com, always do my homework, always attend class, always sit in the front row, and I still have a difficult time in these courses. 

I currently have no job. In the past, I’ve tried looking for a part time job, but I have had no luck. I had an internship at an electrical engineering company once, but even with that on my resume, no one will hire me. I don’t do anything stupid with my money, all my money goes towards is school and gas. I am a full time student. I live at home, with my parents and my brother. I don’t do drugs. I only live 10 minutes away from college (freeway), and my parents currently pay for everything as in (e.g. gas, car insurance, health insurance). My mother is currently paying for my tuition via my grandfathers inheritance. I would of liked to go to a UC even though I got in, but I have no money. My father said that I can stay at home until I finish my degree.

My dad is an irrational person with a temper, he is retired. One day he will be fine. And the next day he will be slamming doors, yelling at one of us, or doing irrational things like changing the house phone number that we’ve had for 25+ years. He has been in a mental facility before, and he is currently on medication. He got so angry one day, that he took his pills that the doctor prescribed for him, and flushed them down the toilet. He said that his doctor didn’t know what she was doing, and found a new doctor. One who put him on the same medication as before. He has been constantly doing this my whole life, and I am sick of being verbally abused at for being worthless, and needing to find a job, and move out of the house. He brings up stories on how he came to the USA when he was my age and got a job working for some wiring company. 

He has little to no friends. He doesn’t know what to do with his life now that he is retired. He has nothing to do except walk violently back and forth around the house, verbally abuse my brother, mother and I. He has no hobbies other than reading his stack of engineering books. He yells, gets angry, and if we say anything, he just turns it back on us.

I am struggling to figure out what I should do. My father won’t give me his financial information so I can’t receive financial aid. Living in California is expensive, and I have no idea how I would be able to manage a job, school and pay rent at the same time.

I know I need to move out as soon as I get my degree. Hopefully even sooner, at least till I can get these math classes out of the way. I don’t mess around when I am in school; I seldom play any games or what not. I usually go to class, go to office hours, then come home and start doing homework. I’ve been stressed more than often due to my fathers outbursts, and have even more difficulty paying attention in class.

I fear as though at any moment, my mother will have a heart attack, or I’ll get kicked out of my house because of him. I am sick of the way my life is. I fail when I am at school, and when I am at home. 


What do I do?

1yvdo6,4,2014-02-25,PC Application: 10 Months of Paperwork and Waiting,[deleted],peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/1yvdo6/pc_application_10_months_of_paperwork_and_waiting/,"~A former college professor reached out to me to share my experiences applying to the Peace Corps to give one of his students some insight into the process. I'm not one to be concise, and before I knew it, the novella below is what I typed. I thought it might be insightful for some PC applicants, or at the very least a look at what the process felt like in 2009.
  
  
Hi [former professor] and [prospective PCV],
  
I served in the Peace Corps starting in 2009, and from what I hear, there have been some changes to the application process, mainly giving the volunteers more say in where they wish to serve. That being said, the fundamentals are still the same, so I'll try to lay out everything I can think of regarding the application process, and what the PC recruiters are looking for in potential volunteers.
  
First, the application process is lengthy; both to be thorough and to deter anyone who decided to join the Peace Corps on a whim. The process begins with an online application via www.peacecorps.gov. For reference, I began filling out my application in late September of my senior year of college, and submitted it a month later. This part is similar to many college applications - there are parts for your personal information, education, job history, as well as essays. All of the application is important, but I'd say 2 of the traits you want to highlight are your flexibility and your philanthropic nature. They want to know how well you can handle the unexpected (and believe me, you will experience the unexpected during 2 years in the Peace Corps) and they want to know that you have a history of volunteering. If you do not currently volunteer - go out tomorrow morning and find somewhere to start volunteering! This could be anything from tutoring kids after school, to building houses with Habitat for Humanity. Don't worry if your volunteer work isn't exactly what you want to do in the Peace Corps; what you do as a volunteer isn't as important as having a track record of giving back to others. After all, that's what the Peace Corps is all about. Along with these traits, they also like to see any type of inter-cultural experience. For me, I talked about working in a warehouse with people of many nationalities – so don’t think you need study abroad experience or missionary trips to qualify for this part. Take your time with the online application; this is an important part of your application process, as a good online application will set the foundation for the rest of the application process.  
  
I should mention here, that before I even began my application, I was in touch with a PC recruiter in [local university]. I would suggest you contact either that office, or the one in Boston to just chat with them about applying to the Peace Corps. They are all former PC volunteers, and their job is to give insight into the application process, what volunteering in the Peace Corps is really like, and to answer any other questions you have. This helped me immensely; as I had someone I knew who could give me direct answers regarding the nuances of the application process. Get to know your recruiter – they will be a valuable asset while you apply for the Peace Corps, and they can give you first-hand insight into why part of the process seems to be taking long, or let you know if you need to fill out an extra form here or there.  
  
But I digress – shortly after submitting my online application, my recruiter mailed me an information packet to complete and return. The information they ask for is pretty basic: official college transcripts, skill addenda, 3 references (if not already done through the online app.), background check form, fingerprint cards, health form, and student loan worksheet (if applicable). The recruiter will also set up an interview.
  
For me, the interview felt relaxed, but that had to do with how well I got to know my recruiter in the month or so leading up to the interview. It should still be approached with the same professionalism as any job or internship interview. Dress nice and act professionally. This interview is used for the recruiter to learn about you and your desire to be a Peace Corps volunteer as well as learn about your preferences regarding geographical location or program. While your preferences are taken into consideration, it is still up to the Peace Corps to place you where they see the best fit.
  
After the interview, you will eventually get a nomination. This will not give you a definite country or leave date, but rather a broad geographical location, a volunteer program/sector, and an estimated departure date. For me, I received my nomination in late December, about 3 weeks after my interview. I was nominated to teach math in a French speaking country in sub-Saharan Africa, and leaving in July 2009. That’s about as specific as it gets.
  
Between December and July, many things happened regarding my Peace Corps application, but honestly it was a LOT of waiting. There are medical forms you need to have filled out by physicians and dentists (reimbursed by the PC), and you need to wait and hear back about getting legally cleared by the PC background check. This is probably the most difficult part of the process as many prospective volunteers are anxious, but it’s good to keep in mind that once your recruiter knows something, they will tell you.
  
The final piece you await as a future Peace Corps volunteer is an official Invitation. This is a large white envelope that you get in the mail and has your country of service and your departure date on it. For me the timing couldn’t have been better. I had just finished my last day at my internship at the end of May and the next day I got my invitation in the mail. Don’t be surprised if your invitation isn’t exactly the same as your nomination. There are only finite positions, and infinite variables the recruiters deal with in placing volunteers. For the most part, my invitation was the same, except my volunteer description was no longer teaching math – I was going to Niger to be a community and youth educator. You will have to officially accept the offer (I believe you have 7 days), and then you will be given a flight to somewhere on the east coast to do orientation with the other volunteers going to your country. Then, before you can blink, you’re on a plane full of strangers going to a strange country to have the experience of a lifetime."
1yvjkn,2,2014-02-25,Is there a tool that allows temporary ftp access?,Dicethrower,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1yvjkn/is_there_a_tool_that_allows_temporary_ftp_access/,"My boss doesn't like the idea that every person that walks through these doors as an employee, especially interns, has full access to every ftp login of every site that we've ever done. He asked if I could look for a tool that stores encrypted ftp data, which can't be exported to an external file and where the source of this ftp data is preferably not even on the same machine.  
  
He basically wants interns to login without being able to know what the actual password is, so that they can't mess with anything when they get back home or when they're done with their internship.

I already explained to him that this is part of a more fundamental problem in the pipeline, since the best course would be to use source control with a central repository and only 1-2 people being able to actually update the live sites, but he wants me to look for this tool anyway.

Does such a tool exist?"
1yvk8i,1,2014-02-25,21 years of bullshit.,[deleted],Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1yvk8i/21_years_of_bullshit/,"I just deleted my old Reddit account in the hopes of starting over and erasing the massive pile of bullshit that has fallen into my lap. My life will hopefully change for the better after posting this. I’m finally cracking down on the bullshit that consistently appears throughout my life.

First of all, I am a 21-year-old senior (last semester) at an awesome university. I have a decent gpa,  and an internship at a very reputable agency. I have all this good shit going for me, yet I feel absolutely terrible. I have been thinking about this for a good while now, and I finally have the stones to address it. Here’s where my story begins. Oh, and I am fully aware that not very many people are going to see this. I’m just venting.

I live with one of those unbelievably annoying yolo 18-year-old straight out of high schoolers. I know, a senior living with a fish? And this isn’t some random highschooler. This is one of those football kids who talks a lot about “bitches” and works out all the time. He is overly obsessed with his image. I was going to move out to a kick ass apartment complex, but my plans fell through and I was stuck in the same room that I had spent my junior year. I hate it. 

Anyway, I was paired up with this kid who wanted to get ""fucked up"" every other weekend last semester (and yes, he really is 18). I'm one of those people who likes to play a nice game of hold'em (hence my username) instead of going out to bars and clubs. I prefer mentally stimulating stuff which is the complete opposite of everything that my roommate likes. 

That’s not even the worst part. All my friends moved out of the dorms and away from campus. And as you can imagine, none of my friends would want to chill at my place, but every damn one of my roommate’s friend has stepped foot in here. One in particular always comes back and insists we play dragon ball z video games. I liked the series, but I have never played those lame-ass fighting games before. I was more into the need for speed and bioshock genre. Anyway, we play every time this particular friend comes over, and they beat me to a pulp because they have no life and can practice all the time. They sometimes let me win, and I have to act happy or surprised when I win when, truly, I could not give a smaller shit about what they consider fun. 

The reason I mention all this is because I just realized that I’m actually in this fucked up situation. 

Oh, and it gets worse. Fuck the fact that I am 21. My birthday (october) was a few days after the cut off date for when kids were accepted into school. This meant I was always the youngest person in my class. And because I started school in germany, I was even younger than the youngest kids in my grade when I moved back to the US. I have military parents, so I move around a lot. And that reminds me, I left all of my friends and had to start high school at my incredibly young age not knowing a single person. Those were the worst years of my life. It was a truly awful and painful experience.

This unfortunate age factor had a lot to do with how fucked up my school life was. It was worse than you can imagine, and it’s something that I will never talk about, even though I know I will remain completely anonymous. I was never bullied or anything like that mostly because kids didn't want to fuck with me. That’s not to say that there were people big enough to pick on me. I remember this one asshole gave me a black eye because I told him to “stop messing around”... Anyway, I  think my issue was more of not knowing who I was. I changed to go with the flow instead of identifying myself. Afterall, I was too damn young. I got my shit together in college, but it took  more than half my life to get to a normal life. And I'm still not even where I want to be emotionally/mentally/phisically.

Also, I believe I am on the very edge of two distinct generations, which sucks ass. I can honestly say I am more in favor of the older generation instead of this bull shit yolo crap that I have to hear every day. You might be thinking “Oh, you have all this good shit going for you”, but I have been struggling to overcome simple obstacles that slightly older people in the same class take on without an issue. I have issues with self confidence. Sometimes (not often), I can't even pronounce my name correctly. It's so embarrassing... I have to fucking practice saying stuff before I actually say it just to make sure I wont fuck it up. I slip up once and become overly aware of everything around me. I guess my awareness of everything around me is what makes me a good poker player. I also rarely show emotion *sigh... 

Damn, since venting, I have found myself much more relaxed. This little post doesn't even the 2 months I spent with a raging alcoholic / ex-friend. And I don't think I have mentioned how I have lost a lot of money in the stock market in the past year. Or even how I went through a quarter life crisis with weekly anxiety attacks... but I am a bit more happier now that I have this one thing off my chest.

Anyway, that’s what I have going on right now. A lot of self-change in going to happen in the next few weeks. Mark my words...

TL;DR: I realized how shitty my life has been.

so I'll be moving to the US (DFW) for an internship and I'll need a car.

He says the car has around 120k miles.
I would have also to sell it after my internship, so I need to know if it would be easy or not.

so is that car a no brainer to get? or should I wait until I am in the states to get something cheaper; I was thinking $5k max : a reliable used car with a manual transmission (like a Civic or something)"

1yw6dg,8,2014-02-25,Graduate electrical engineer that likes to make things (for now),[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1yw6dg/graduate_electrical_engineer_that_likes_to_make/,"Warning, long post, but with a tl;dr:

So I graduated with two degrees in electrical engineering and math from a decent school and couldn't find a job with it...so now I'm here, in grad school at the same place. I flip-flopped around a ton of things in undergrad. Learned about math, programming, electrical engineering. I studied. A lot. Took just about every class I could, got great grades, but that's really the only thing I did. I didn't do any internships except this one in my second year that I did not enjoy, but that was more of a company thing and not the work. Not how I would have spent my time thinking about this retrospect. While I enjoy being a student, I couldn't see the stuff I was learning become a career path. None of the interviews I've managed to get panned out. It probably doesn't help that I'm not the most personable individual either and just generally suck at interviews :/

Towards my last semesters though, I did find myself really interested (even more so) in stuff like hobby electronics, maker culture, and shifted as much of my attention to it as much as I could. It did culminate in some large-ish projects that got some attention, but I think still started ""doing"" as opposed to ""learning"" a little too late. And now I'm in grad school because I couldn't get a job before graduating. I'm focusing on embedded systems and computer architecture, but to what end?

I'll say that there's a product development company in Seattle that has seemed like a dream job for about as long as my recent shift in interest, but I'm still waiting to hear back.

So I'll take whatever you've got for me reddit, what should I do? Don't want to graduate again without being able to get a job.

tl;dr - grad student studying electrical and computer engineering, likes math, programming, electronics, maker culture, and just about anything even tangentially related.

Also, a plug at my website http://benpyeh.com/[1] , which will give you a better idea of what I'm into, and the aforementioned projects:

Accepting an internship would be with a fairly large company called Viking, they never posted anywhere that they needed an intern - I just simply sent them an application, and about 4 weeks ago I was at an interview about this unpaid internship at their company. After the Interview they said they would call me after a few days. But I never heard anything from them until today - they want me to come do the internship in the company, 3-4 weeks after they were supposed to call me. (highly unprofessional in my opinion) 

Accepting the internship would mean that I can finish my bachelor ½ year earlier than normal, but I would have to work very hard in my spare time and my summer vacation, but would give me a good working experience.

Starting my own company is an idea I got after 2 weeks of not hearing from Viking, I thought of a good business opportunity that could help me create a stable company that creates apps for smart phones.

I don’t have a lot experience in programming, but I already have the design and functionality of my first application worked out. So I would also have to learn programming step-by-step as I am creating this application.

Starting my own company would mean I have to publish at least one application before August, because I study Marketing management – we should at least have 1 ‘product’ to promote. My school offers us a 3 month period with the possibility of creating our own company where we normally would be doing an unpaid internship at a company. The company start-up would take little to no money, as I am the only person who will be in the company, I don’t have to worry about my living expenses because I get paid by the government to study, and this would just count as part of my education.

I myself am of course leaning towards starting my own company, because it could eventually lead to something bigger, if not – then I have just used 1 semester on giving it my best shot and I will have the possibility of doing an internship again as the final semester of my Bachelor.

But my family think it would be better to go with the ‘safer’ option and take the internship with the company, as they could provide with work experience and if all went well a stable workplace after my education. 

I don’t think I can explain my situation better than this – are there any out there with some advice ?

Edit: Spelling

TL;DR - Play it safe and get some work experience or try something more or less risk-free that could lead to greater things - but might not.

I have been working for about 3 months @ 70k a year, have about 40k in my savings, 4k in my 401k. Most of my savings came from internships I've had during school. Every paycheck it put 20% into my 401k and have about 2800 in spendable income a month, of that I try to put about 2200 into my savings. I have no debt, no loans. At the moment I am living with my parents and I don't mind living here to cut down a lot of expenses. My SO its making 50k a year but most of it is going towards paying off her student loans.

This might be unrealistic but my goal is to buy one house in Mountain View, CA and live in it for the rest of my life. I would really want a family home 3-4br/3.5ba ish area. new homes in this area list for about .9 million - 1.2 million. 

My vision is that my and my SO will be able to put down a down payment on a house in ~5 years and a couple (2-3) of friends of mine want to move in and pay me rent for a few years while my income increases. Another option I thought of is my friend contributing for the down payment and paying their portion off to possible move in earlier than 5 years?

How realistic is my vision and what kind of advice can you give me to achieve my goal / get close to it?

I am currently working at a tech company in Silicon Valley, in a training program to become a SQL Server DBA. On top of the training I am receiving form my team, my manager suggested that I should look for certification related to SQL Server administration. 

I was looking up certifications on the Microsoft [website](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/sql-certification.aspx) and came across several certifications I could use. I saw the MCITP/MCSA certifications which seem DBA oriented, but I am unsure of which to go for. Also found the Exam 70-432, which seems very DBA centric as well.

Does anyone have any suggestions for certification that can help me build a better foundation in MSSQL DB administration? I already have basic knowledge of SQL and IT infrastructure from school and my last internship as a Jr. Sys admin."

What software/technologies/etc would you recommend I look into?,theqial,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1yxua1/newbie_sys_admin_for_a_small_company_what/,"Hi! A little bit of background: I've been working as a programmer at a software company for the last 7 years. I started as a Java development intern my first year of college, and was hired full-time when I left. I joined when the company was just 3 people, 2 of which were my boss and his wife (both programmers). We now have about 15 full-time employees and contractors, and we're finally getting to the point of needing a dedicated sysadmin to take ownership of making sure our network is working fine, doing maintenance on ours and client servers, and handling code deployments for projects. Up until this point our boss had mainly taken care of setting up and maintaining our internal servers, but if he's busy or out of town it has caused problems. I had been feeling burnt out from the development work, and my boss offered me the position of sysadmin, which I gladly took.

My main question is this: What resources and technologies would you recommend I look into and make sure I know so that I can the most successful I can be. Now that I'm actually going to be doing this for my job, I'm wondering where to even start. I've been running servers on the side for my own projects because I enjoy learning how they work. I have decent linux experience through that.

Are there any indispensable tools/best practices/etc you would recommend to make my life easier? I really want to improve our whole network and server setup to make life easier for all of us. Our internal servers are primarly CentOS, client servers are often Redhat or Ubuntu. We focus primarily on development for Java based content management systems. Our developer machines are mostly Windows with a few Mac users thrown in. Luckily I won't be having to do much user-space tech support because all our employees are technical-oriented developers who know how to take care of their own machines. My main focus will likely be ensuring the servers are working well and developing automated systems for code deployment. I suspect I'll need to set up monitoring software too so that I can either find out about an issue before it starts causing problems or be alerted soon after.

Thanks for the help! :)"
1yy29k,1,2014-02-25,College [Rant] [Discussion],sagull,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1yy29k/college_rant_discussion/,"So I've only come to this realization very recently while I was playing around with a calculator, but I decided to try to find out how much college would cost me.

My dream job is to be a psychiatrist, but after finding out how much medical school costs, I think i'll just have to settle for being a clinical psychologist or something along those lines.

So per say I was to still try to become a psychiatrist, I would have to go through: 

- 4-6 Years of College to get my bachelors degree

- 4-6 Years of Medical School to get my PhD.

- 4-6 years of Residency (Basically an Internship).

- 1-2 years to get licensed.

Thats about 16 years of my life. So if it wasn't enough that all of my young life would be spent in school, lets talk about the costs.

Its about $50,000 a year for a good college/university.

So make that x4.

Boom. $200,000.

Then add on medical school, which is about $70,000 a year.

So make that x4

Boom. $280,000

Then Residency, which I'm not in school, I'm just an intern now. So maybe 10,000 a year for rent because I'm still a student/intern.

Make that x4

Boom. $40,000

The license is free, so at least I've got that going for me, which is nice. 

Lets add that all up now,

200,000 + 280,000 + 40,000 = 520,000

Thats over half a fucking million dollars guys. 

Like. Fuck. Fuck. *Fuck*

I assume most of you don't want to get PhD related careers, and that you plan to get just a bachelors, but keep in mind, thats still about $200,000. And if you want a masters, which most careers are starting to require, then thats an extra 4 years, so an extra $200,000. Thats $400,000.

Put that into perpective, thats the cost of a huge house, thats almost half a million dollars. Shit you can buy a ferrari with that money.

I'm just ranting at this point, but I hope you can see why I'm so buttsmacked. Fuck.

I have NO idea what is going on. I did 6 months of keto in 2013 and everything went smoothly. I have been back doing keto for 4 weeks and things are not going as well as before. I hit 196 and then fluctuate between 196 and 193 over and over, for 2 weeks now I have bounced between 196 and 193 (literally it seems every other day), I often find on sunday nights after a weekend of debauchery I am defintely near the 196, then I am battling back down by friday.

Week 1- Initial weight, 203 lb.
Week 2-196 
Week 3- 193
Week4-196 

Social History

* Diet- 
* AM: 0 carbs, occasional diet gingerale (cheese n bacon generally)
* Lunch: 5-7 carbs (cheese n bacon in a wrap + almonds generally)
* Dinner: 7-13 carbs (steak or chicken n veggies generally)
* Dessert: 3-8 carbs( Quest peanut cups 1-2 or Low carb tortilla w/ almond butter) 
* **(total carbs never exceed 40. usually well under 30 or even 20)**

* Caffeine: 1-3 cups coffee per day, 2 equals total per day
* Diet cola: 1 a week unless with booze
* EtoH: 1 1 oz whiskey diet gingerale every other day in the evening. 3-5 whiskey n diet on Fri and Sat
* H20- Looots
* Exercise: lifting 4-5 days a week

On the plus side, I am a pharmacy intern so I have access to health testing, After 4 week Keto my Cholesterol panel (1 hour after a bacon cheese tortilla factory taco) is:

* Total-198(at goal)
* LDL(115)- close to goal, may be inaccurate from food intake
* Triglyceride (138)- Below goal and falsely elevated from food intake
* HDL-55- WAY above goal, almost a negative risk factor for heart disease
* Blood sugar after eating- 85, normal goal after a meal is &lt;140, killed it.

BUT WHERE IS MY WEIGHT LOSSSSS WHY DO I KEEEP YOYOING. the only thing I can see is the booze affecting it, but I dont have that much, is it the soda from the booze, could the quest cups be affecting my losses?

1yy97w,0,2014-02-25,my honest fitness story (a lot of text inside),[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1yy97w/my_honest_fitness_story_a_lot_of_text_inside/,"Hello, 

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/XmwPN

The following text is going to be a long one so I apologize to those who don’t want to take the time to help an honest fellow out. So please, read through this entirely and post with extreme seriousness because I truly need guidance. Alright, so I guess we’ll start.

I’m no one to be honest. I was that kid in high school who ate about half his weight everyday and miraculously maintained his bodyweight at 190-200lbs. As soon as I got my first job at 16 I ate all the popcorn, hotdogs, and drank soda like a motherfucker. I was then inspired later on in my nutrition class to change my lifestyle because my metabolic rate is eventually going to come to a screeching halt.

“What to do then?” So I hopped on the treadmill or hamster wheel as I felt that is what it was. I would run consistently for 20 minutes three times a day and saw absolutely no change. Each time I stepped on the scale I would cringe because weeks would go by and although the running was dreadful I forced myself to go through it. The weight never changed, I stayed at a whopping 195 lbs.

“Fine.” I started to go to my local rec center and played with all the machines, dumbbells, and avoided the barbell at all costs mainly because my mother told me weights were not good for my health. Of course, mom knows best right? Again, I go for a few months, stepped on the scale, and boom. I was then 197 lbs. I’m 18 years old at this point so I practically gave up, went to prom, graduated, went to community college, played Call of Duty religiously, and sucked at life. I was depressed, occasionally got a girlfriend or two thanks to my Latin charm (I’m a romantic, who knew?). I am a very social, likable, and easy going fellow. I never really claimed that I knew anything unless it was about pop culture or video games but when it came to the gym? Insert, lolwtfamidoing.jpg.

Anyway, one winter break my overweight buddy of mine --- Holy shit! Dude! You look fucking huge, not fat, and amazing! How did you do it?! “I picked up the barbell bro. You should try something called StrongLifts.” “Dafaq?” 

The next day we went to my rec center and I asked him if we were about to do like 10 exercises, “Nah bro. I’m teaching you 5 basic lifts today and you’ll be doing 3 lifts 3 days a week.” I was dumbfounded. How is it that you just do three lifts and get stronger? He made me read the report, I bought a copy of Starting Strength as well and I began doing my own personal research.

A year later, OMFG! I could barely squat 45 lbs but as of January 2014 my lifts were the following 1RM: 

Squat: 375 lbs
Bench Press: 225 lbs
Overhead Press: 175 lbs
Barbell Rows: 165 lbs
Deadlifts: 315 lbs

Please, for a moment, I would like to ask everyone here to stop there soft nose snorting. I get it, in the course of a year my numbers should be absolutely higher. But let’s face it, I also have a life outside of the gym. I have to go to classes, participate in an internship, maintain a healthy relationship with my girlfriend, and deal with the everyday stresses of being a Latin American 21 year old (I know, crazy isn’t it?). 

I should totally looked ripped now shouldn’t I? Well, I know one thing for sure is ripped… My jeans, my khakis, and some boxers I had to throw away. Worst part? I stepped on the scale for 2014… 200 lbs. Dude! How the fuck did I do one year of StrongLifts and still look the same! Mehdi! You lied to me! Fuck my life!

Then the doubts came in, “Maybe I should start running? Maybe I should stop eating McD’s? Maybe I’m fapping too much? Maybe I am not burning enough calories? My protein shakes are making me fat? Mom stop calling me fat! I’m not fat! I’m muscular!” I’ve just about had it.

&lt;insertnamehere&gt;
Age: 21
Height: 5 feet 10 inches
Sex: Male
Weight: 200 lbs

The pictures I’ve attached to this post are me. I’ve always felt uncomfortable sharing my body mainly because of the bad self image I have of myself but I felt the need to post the pictures mainly because I know I’m not doing so good. I did my research and I can only say I think I know what to do at this point.

THE SOLUTION: 

So, I get it. The more weight I push with barbell strength training the more stronger I become as long as I do low reps and bounce up the weight every time. Cool. Muscular hypertrophy? That’s just doing certain sets with lighter weight and increasing muscular growth. Cardio? Doing the same shit over and over again using aerobic &lt;insertthewordhere&gt;. I’m 200 lbs and I have no interest in increasing the size of my muscles through hypertrophy. My dream is to become a wonderful powerful powerlifter who can push heavy weights and perform the snatch/clean and jerk one day. 

Again, my GOAL is to be a POWERLIFTER/WEIGHTLIFTER. I just want to have that awesome body as a compliment due to the amount of weights I can push. I THINK I know the diet portion of this new potential routine is going to have to involve a higher protein intake, good fats, and less bad carbs (I love my oatmeal and brown rice please don’t take that away!).

In order to shred the fat off of my body I know that I don’t have to jog/run steadily mainly because I am not going for endurance, I’m going for QUICK use of my muscles which technically means anaerobic exercises right? I’m thinking of either going for sprints or doing compound barbell movements which forces my body to work twice as hard than just running on the hamster wheel (Check this vid out: http://youtu.be/TmEJGR1_sZc?t=11m34s).

AS OF RIGHT NOW: 

I stopped heavy lifting because I felt depressed on how my thick thighs looked in my jeans, I stopped because I was tired of hearing people calling me fat despite my goals, and I’m just overall confused on how to approach this fitness gig. It really sucks, I went towards a split and I feel miserable doing it because it’s not as fun as doing the barbell exercises.

So /r/fitness, judging by the pictures, my history, and clear goals. What are your thoughts on this?

Please be brutally honest as possible, I need the motivation. If Chris Pratt could do it, why can't I?

diarena

tl;dr - I felt the need to be honest.

1yybis,3,2014-02-25,Should I pay off my car with high-interest before upgrading?,LadyLabRat,askcarsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1yybis/should_i_pay_off_my_car_with_highinterest_before/,"I would like to get a newer car. Mostly because my car payment is high and it would be nice to be paying that for something newer since our finances are improving.

A few things:

I am a 25 year old student graduating next month. I have been at my job for almost two years but only work 4 hours a week (it is basically an internship). They are in the process of trying to hire me full-time since I will be getting a degree and can move up now. It will be about 40,000 per year. My husband currently makes about 40,000 per year. He was furloughed January-June this year though, but has been back since then. Our credit isn't fantastic. The recent credit we have is all good. The bad credit is at least 3 years old and there are no balances. It was small stuff like a cell phone bill, but my husband was cosigned on a loan that was late a few times years ago, but it was paid off. Our scores are probably in the low 600s. We have my student loan debt around $20,000 that we will need to start making payments on soon, and we have been renting at the same place for almost 4 years

The car I have currently is a 2006 Kia sportage. It is worth about 5,000 maximum and I owe around 10,000. My payment is $320 per month. We financed this car out of desperation 2 years ago when I got offered a full-ride to finish school and I need a newer car to put miles on and that I have done! The interest rate is about 20% through capital one (the only place that would finance us). Back then we only had a couple small loans we had paid perfectly, but our negative credit was recent, we still had an outstanding balance on credit and my husband had not been at his job long and was not making as much money. We also added a warranty that we have never used.

We have made 2 years of car payments perfectly on time. No negative balances, and had a small loan or two that we have completely paid and was always on time. Our finances are much better.

I would like to get a new/slightly used crossover SUV (we have two kids), AWD around $25,000. I plan on keeping it for a good 10 years at least.

Should we pay off this car first before we get another?

Should we get another and roll over this debt because of interest?

Should I wait until I am working a few months and save up a large down payment?

Does the college graduate financing include our situation?

I am afraid I am being impatient. I have worked really hard in school and I have a tough 2 months ahead and would love to have a small bit of enjoyment. Graduation present?

Help!!!

1yyi1w,1,2014-02-25,I have to decide between two jobs and I need some unbiased advice.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1yyi1w/i_have_to_decide_between_two_jobs_and_i_need_some/,"Obviously my family and friends are not ones to provide unbiased advice.

Here it goes...

I'm a senior at a large university in the Southern United States. I am a Hospitality Management major specializing in Club Management required to do an internship to graduate. I have the opportunity to do this internship at a club in either Columbus, Ohio or San Francisco, California.

Both clubs are gorgeous and have great internship programs. In Ohio, I would be staying with a guy that likes me that I also like. They offered me the job on the spot and were the first club to respond to my email inquiries.

In San Francisco, they provide housing, meals while on duty, and $600/week pay. However, I would have to drive across country to get to the club because I need my own form of transportation.

I really want to spend the summer with this guy and work in that club, and he wants me to come there, but at the same time I want to go to California because that is a great opportunity.

I'm from the South and SF is completely different from where I live at the moment. It will be a huge culture shock and I'm not sure how much I'll like it, but the point of going is to work in a prestigious club and learn as much as I can.

Also, I know I mentioned that I was going to stay with a guy in Ohio, but I also just started casually dating an Engineering grad student that lives in my city. I like him a lot, he's a great guy. But the relationships are completely different, and I want to see if it could be worth it at all. Maybe it's not, but I don't know that. The point is, I'm not going to Ohio specifically for him. I applied to jobs all over the country and this is all a matter of circumstance.

So, based on this information...what would you suggest I do?"

I'm a sophomore in high school. I have a few interests and skills, but I really don't know what career options I could have that could combine these skills/interests. I go to a special school for smart individuals and I am one of the top students grade-wise. I have done a few internships already with business and technology companies.

---
Interests:

The biggest thing I want is a job that involves travel around the world.  I'm ok with learning foreign languages because that would allow me to communicate with more people around the world.

I also don't want to sit in a room and code all day, though if that entailed being able to work around the world I would be fine with that.

I really like the topics of history and current politics/political issues.

I like computers and the internet.

I like spacecraft/astrophysics, particularly because I believe it will be the world's next economic boom/frontier. Astrophysics I really like because the universe is awesome.

I like particle/quantum physics. 

I like business, particularly of the international variety.

---
Skills:
I know how to code in a few languages. I can write programs provided I can look up syntax.

I have basic knowledge of most Adobe CS software. I do some video editing in my free time occasionally.

I have years of Linux server admin experience (I started relatively young).

I appear to be good with customer service, as my current job deals with such things and I haven't been fired for the years I've been there.

I do well in all of my classes, though math and science come the most easy to me. History/current world issues and science (particularly physics) are the classes I find the most interesting."

I hate that I can't complain to my parents about what's happening because I don't trust them with my feelings and it'll only cause me trouble.

I hate that I can't be more involved in school and with internships because I hardly have transportation and even if I did, who would take care of the baby?

I hate that I'm only doing the bare minimum in school when I could be so much more productive.

I hate that I feel envy at the people who somehow manage to live either on or off campus. I hate that I hate them for being more fortunate than me in that respect. I hate as I see them walking past me on the way to class in pajamas or jogging suits because they have the time and opportunity to do so.

I hate that I have made no friends at my new college yet. 

I hate that I'm hardly on campus. 

I hate being alone. I hate being introverted. I hate not being able to connect to people. 

I hate that I have no control over how productive I could truly be.

I hate that I have potential and drive and competence but no outlet. I hate that this somehow will affect my future, my resume, my desirability as a graduate student and as job candidate. 

I hate that I don't have a car. 

I hate to feel this way because even now I realize that however I manage to do it, going to college is in itself a privilege.

I hate, and hate, and hate. 

I have all this anger and all this envy and all this scream inside and on the outside I hide it all with not one person I can talk to face to face to help me cope. 

There, it's out."

I'm a grad student on the east coast. After much deliberation, I've decided that working at a startup will be a good fit for me. But I really need to get a first-hand experience before diving in. Though it might be a little late now, I've applied to a few through websites for internships, especially in NYC. Yet, I don't have a sound strategy. However, most startups seem to hire only full-time employees.

How would you recommend applying to internships? Any tips, strategies and personal experiences are welcome. I'm interested in web development and product management if that matters.

Edit: Also, would you recommended interning at a startup accelerator? The experience isn't quite the same as working in a single startup, but you get to experience how a startup operates.

Im doing an internship at our crossfit gym aswell as my level 1 cert - plan is to be coaching.
Our gym is 80% women, and we (the interns and coaches) have asked our members what it is they need, dont like, would like more of etc. We've had a few common responses - not liking the ""manly hands"" that come with bar work, more time spent with technique, better crossfit clothing for women.
Basically we just want to be able to provide the best crossfit experience possible for the members.

SO, i thought to ask all of you the same question:
As a women doing Crossfit what do you want or need? what dont you like? what do you wish you had more of? - it can be ANYTHING.
(Ill do the same for men if this post goes well)

Thanks everyone, hope you'r all ready for the Open!

EDIT: wow! Thanks so much for the feedback, your suggestions/ comments are so valuable and I will be definitely pushing these in our next meeting!
Thanks so much everyone! And feel free to add more if you think of any!
Good luck for 14.1!!!"

1yyxmo,1,2014-02-26,Trying to figure out how to forgive myself,Trying_to_forgive,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1yyxmo/trying_to_figure_out_how_to_forgive_myself/,"I am trying to figure out how to forgive and move past some very shameful decisions I made. 

Here is the story:

A little over two years ago I was completing my last semester of college doing an internship in Indonesia.  When I got there I moved into a tiny, one bedroom apartment complex near where I was doing the internship. It was a very lonely time there.  The people I worked with were nice and I got along with them well but they all lived in the suburbs and work was in the city.  There isn't much of a nightlife in the area I was in and the areas where expats hungout was on the other side of town from where I live; the traffic there was terrible so going across town was a big ordeal. 

Being as lonely as I was I was starting to get this craving for intimacy.  Just the feel of someones body next to yours and knowing that they want to be there too.  At that point, it had been over 2 years since I kissed a woman.  I am not a virgin but the last time I had sex was in high school  I've never been great with women but i dated a little in college and wasn't too worried about; I would eventually find someone.  The need for intimacy while I was in Indonesia got to the point I had to do something about or at least that what my effed up brain told me.  I knew there were brothels in town and I went to one.  I slept with one of the prostitutes.  I didn't really go for the sex, I really just wanted to lay with someone and hold them.  The touch aspect was what I was after and because I am so incompetent with women I felt I needed to pay for it.  I ended up visiting the brothel 6 times and sleeping with 5 different prostitutes.  I never imagined in a million lifetimes that I would ever do such a heinous act but I did.   
 
I some how have to figure out how to get over this.  My anxiety with women is at a all time low.  I am afraid to even think about getting into a relationship and I nearly have a anxiety attack if I start to feel interested in someone or they may possibly be interested in me.  I've always felt this but it is much stronger and debilitating than before.  I used protection at the brothels and have been tested but the fear that I could get someone sick freaks me out.  Also, thinking that I have the immoral event in my life that I will probably have to tell my significant other about.  I just can't move past it.  Its been a emotional brick-wall for me.

I am writing this more to get it off my chest.  I have told three of my closest friends about it and that is it.  I am not sure what I am trying to accomplish with this; hopefully something positive comes from it.  I live in the US, I am dirt poor and don't have health insurance are the main reasons I haven't seen professional help about it and some embarrassment about admitting it to someone in person.

TL;DR:  Slept with prostitutes while abroad; ashamed about it
Thanks for reading.

I'm still an undergrad myself, but I've had some really good internships, 1 with a big-4, and really good grades so that initial job out of college doesn't worry me. What does worry me is the career path once I hit 40.

I'm told there's a lot of ageism in the industry. What do I do to stay relevant in my field? Is management really the only route once you hit a certain age? Even as a senior developer, will be too old once I hit 50?

We all tout how awesome our industry is, but how good is it once we start to really age?

We were friends since before our memories began. We grew up together in our stupid little hillbilly town, and took refuge in each other when everyone around us was ridiculous and cruel, and everything in our lives was hard. I was there for you when you came out of the closet, and I helped you learn to love the new self you were getting to know. You were there for me when I was almost kicked out. I helped pull you out of the bottom of a bottle. You helped me forget about a broken heart. We spent all our time together. People at school called us the twins, and I think I took it to heart a little more than you did. To me, you were my other half, the Will to my Grace, my best friend, and my brother. 

It was really hard on me when we started drifting apart in college, but you should know how insanely proud of you I was for all your accomplishments there. I wasn't jealous. I was doing well enough in my own field, but not nearly as impressive as you, and that was fine. I only ever wanted you to be happy, and I was elated that you finally were. Top of the class, shiny new internship, respectable job, double major, conference speaker, award-winning research - it was awesome. I always knew you had it in you. I was happy. 

But things took a really dark turn when you finally dropped me like a rock that summer that we graduated college. You gave me the slip on your birthday, taking all our friends out but lying to me in order to ditch me. I found you by accident. You took me out in the street and told me I was going nowhere with my life, that I wasted my time on ""worthless things and people"", that I was too old to be goofing off like I like to do, and that I ""held no value for you anymore"". I looked into the face of my brother, my twin, and never wanted to hit someone so badly in my life - to be dumped from that kind of friendship hurt worse than anything I ever experienced. It remains the second hardest thing I've ever gone through. You walked away and left me crying in the street holding 22 years of our history in a broken heart. 

I know why you did it. You had just been accepted to your big fancy grown-up job and full-ride graduate scholarship in another state. You hated that you came from such an embarrassing, poor, dirty, classless town like ours, you hated your family, you hated who you used to be when we were young, and there was no way I couldn't remind you of that. You had to cut me out to remake your identity. You couldn't look at me and know that I knew you better than anyone else and wouldn't let you lie to yourself. I would hold you to your past, hold you to who you are, and so you had to do it. You had to leave your baggage behind. You wanted more now - money, notoriety, professional esteem, feathers in your cap, expensive parties with people high up on the ladder eating shrimp and clapping each other heartily on the back and talking about elections and city ordinances and press releases and quarterly reports. There's no room for high school nostalgia in that world. I get that. So that, I could almost forgive. 

But when my dad died - when I spent a week in the hospital watching my father grow weaker and yellower and dryer and slip into a coma, and hear the tattered husk of his body gasp for breath for the last two days while I held his hand, hoping that just one more time I'd feel him squeeze back - when my dad died, you weren't there. You weren't there for the funeral. You weren't there after. You didn't say one word to me, or my brother, or my mother, who you'd known your whole life. 

For that, I can never forgive you. Because I believe that the true measure of a man is when he can put aside his selfish pursuits to show first and foremost his love and his kindness to others in need, especially friends, especially family. While I buried my father, you were having drinks with coworkers and adjusting your tie at some place I'll never afford, laughing and putting on airs, and not thinking about me at all. Your other half. The broken half. The half that needed you. 

I had to rebuild everything after that. I have lost so much. Not just my father, not just you. I've lost a lot in the last two years. Losing you was the second hardest. But I've done it. I built myself a real, whole, functioning human being, see? I haven't got it perfect yet, but dammit, she'll do just fine. I'll do just fine. I only need me now. I don't need you. And even when you came back last year and pretended to make amends only to disappear on me two weeks later and never talk to me again *again*, I was still ok. 

You were wrong about me. I never fully believed that until now. But I'm not worthless. I'm intelligent, I'm passionate, I'm a *good friend*, I was and am a good daughter and sister, I have dreams and goals, and I'm not afraid of anything anymore, so you know what? I *am* going somewhere with my life. And I like the looks of that place a lot better than where you went. 

I hope the plaques on your wall and your slacks and blazers keep your cold heart warm at night. 

I won't be there to pick you up when it's your turn for the fall. "

I was lucky enough to get an winter 2015 internship offer from one of the big 4.

However I am having doubts about whether it is the best route for Me to take. I am currently a sophomire on the 4 year plan for the CPA and will have the 150 hours by graduation. If I take the internship ill have to take a semester off and take classes over the summer term to graduate on time.

My question is: if I am fairly confident that during fall recruiting I can secure a summer internship should I decline this one? Is it even common for applicants to deny an internship opportunity? How does the firm view this?

Any advice would be appreciated!"

- Social problems all my life, never had friends, always bullied
- Years and years of therapy, focused on social interactions and cues
- Got a girl pregnant in my late teens.  Her parents adopted the kid and asked me not to be a part of the kids life.  I listened and its been 13 years.  Getting back involved doesn't seem fair to the kid.  I pay child support and have every week since birth.  I will be paying child support until the kid is 21 (New York law)
- Got married young to a girl because she would have me.  Got fat while married.  Wife left me.  I was devastated.  I had just begun my undergrad in a new state and I knew no one/had no support network there.  Her younger sister tried to console me.  Ended up kissing.  She initiated but that doesn't matter, legally or morally.  She was slightly under age, I was slightly over age.
- Went back to school for my undergrad in my late twenties.  Junior year, second semester, contacted by the police for the kiss.  Plead guilty to two misdemeanors.  Did two years probation, therapy, etc.  Luckily, I did not have to register as a sex offender.  The $5,000 spent on a lawyer was worth it in the end.
- Currently enrolled in a graduate program.  Was told funding was available for anyone who actively pursues it.  Applied to 62 and counting positions with 3 interviews.  Been told my resume and cover letter are great by various employment/help centers.  I can't continue to borrow money to go to school.
- Deathly afraid I can't get a job because of my record.  I have an internship now and they said I could have a job once it is done.  However, that position requires the background check I didn't have to do for the internship.  No job if I fail.
- Still no friends.  I relocated for graduate school and things are very different here.  I hate my life here.  I'm still very uncomfortable in social situations.  All of my therapy has made me able to read social cues that make it so obvious I'm unwanted.  I could give many different examples.
- Physically - I'm overweight(ish), I have bad hair that needs to be kept short, I have bad teeth (broken tooth needs a crown, not yellow/jagged), my glasses are very broken and slanted.  I'm very tall/broad so my clothes are poor fitting.  All of my shoes are broken/falling apart but I can't find shoes big enough for my feet (plus I can't afford them).
- Financially - I have no money.  I have no groceries.  I live off ramen.  I need to fix my car.  I need to put gas in my car to get to work (public transportation is about 1h40m each way, which means I couldn't get to school in time).  I need to replace my glasses, get a haircut.  I need to fix my tooth so I can eat with both sides of my mouth or drink cold drinks.  I have large school payments.  I'm behind on all of my bills.
- I have no time.  I have multiple jobs to try to stay on top of my bills.  I go to school full time.  I have a house to take care of (clean, dishes, pets, etc.).  I rarely have time to sleep more than 6hrs a night.
- Everyone lets me down.  I let everyone down.  It is a vicious cycle.
- I will not except financial help.  There is a lot of reasons for this but I feel strongly I cannot adequately repay the helper and I can't accept that.  I've created enough debts in my life.

I won't accept a life of living in an apartment, eating ramen, and hating every day.  I don't necessarily want to die but I don't see a purpose.  I feel like someone with a terminal illness and I'm just waiting to expire.  I don't drink or do drugs.  I just take up space.  Everything is a waiting game.  Wait for the work day to end so I can go to school.  Wait for class to end so I can do my work.  Wait to get paid so I can pay my bills.  Wait, wait, wait, wait...and end up in exactly the same place.

Help?  I'm losing my mind.  I see it everyday and I'm helpless to stop it.

After being rejected once by Riot in her request to do work experience in their Dublin Offices, them saying that they didn't have the time for under-18 internships, here she tries again to persuade Riot to take her in. I felt like this might be a good post to put on Reddit, if any Rioters may see this, and give her some more information on the possibilities. That'd be amazing, sorry for the long read.**

**what do you think she could do to make a living from her future dream job, Reddit?**


The Mail:

I am very sorry to bother you again after having received your response already. Though after reading and re-reading your e-mail, I believe there might have been some slight misunderstandings. 

As I am under 18, of course I am not able to do full-time work or even most internships, which I understand. However I am I asking for neither. 

Work experience, to me is something on a completely different level. I have no intention on interfering with your work, or being taught how to do anything. You are not by any means supposed to be my baby-sitter or professor. I, on the other hand, am of absolute service to you and the other employees. 

I have excellent cooking skills, you can ask my friends if you wish for a recommendation. I make amazing brownies and cookies. I can learn how to make tea and coffee. I am available for small tasks such as cleaning windows, vacuuming etc... Basically anything that you might need, for free! And don't worry, it doesn't count as child labour, it's ""work experience"". 

All I ask in return is that you help me get an idea of what you do for Riot. The point of work experience is to narrow down what students think they want to do in the future. I am almost 100% sure that I'd love nothing more than to do software engineering, game development and/or cyber criminology. 
This would be such a great opportunity for me to so see further into the career choice I have in mind and make sure it's something I want to do, simply by observing (and giving you and the employees freshly-made and poison-free brownies). 

My school is also not involved in my decision making or anything to do with the -work experience- itself, and therefore this cannot be counted as a school program. My school is simply facilitating the ability for students in my year to help out in a local business that is linked with their interests by giving the students three days off school. They also give us guidelines on how to apply to businesses and how to create our CV's. 

Seeing as I am not a local here in this small town (I'm Australian), it's very difficult for me to find something here in Kerry due to the variety of relatives who offer their nieces, nephews, grandchildren and second cousins twice removed all the positions, I must look a little further all the way to Dublin, where I would've made my first choice with Riot anyway (I am planning on traveling all the way to Dublin from Kerry and staying overnight).

After all, it's only for three days and then I'll be out of your way. If three days is too much, this can be compromised to two days. Even one day! Or half a day! 

If there are any specifics that need to be considered, if you want me to sign a contract that promises I won't sue you if I get injured on your premises or if you want me to leave out walnuts from my brownies because one of the employees is allergic to nuts (or just doesn't like them), I will do so. 

Please understand how important this is for my future, and if you still refuse, I understand. However to ease the pain, perhaps a more detailed explanation as to why it isn't possible could be helpful. 

Yours sincerely and apologetically for pestering, 

Sceine (Real name left out)

P.S. My CV is attached in case you want to sneak a peak, even if you're not interested in my application, I think you'll find it an entertaining read. Goodbye fellow summoner!

P.P.S. Since my last e-mail I have now reached level 20 on LoL, another step closer to Challenger!

I'm thinking, oh shit, my 280x is broken, it's a good thing I've had it less than a month. I go to my newegg account, and check when I ordered it. 1/24/2014. Yesterday was 2/25/2014. I can't return it because its been more that 30 days. It broke on the 31st day. Besides that, it never stayed above 600khash, so I definitly didn't break even on the $458 card.

So I've got a few questions - One, how can I validate for sure that it's broken? Two, what is neweggs parts warranty? It says it's still covered by that and I've never taken off the fan or heatsink or messed with the card... will they be able to tell I overclocked(only undervolted..) it?

Because the universe hadn't kicked me in the balls enough, today I found out from my boss I'm only supposed to be working 20 hour weeks at my work. I feel like an idiot because I just signed the lease and am moving into my first apartment on my own... I found this out about an hour and a half after I wrote my first months rent check and got the key to the place. How do I casually mention to my girlfriend that I'm looking for a job, while we are moving our stuff into the new apartment we JUST got?

Also, is it safe to order a 290x and put it in the slot the 280x that broke was in?\

Edit: A day later, all is well. I won't have to default on the apartment, because my dad will make up the difference. We work for the same corporate and I guess he feels bad that I got my hours cut at such a convienient time... Anyway, he's going to do everything he can to make the new apartment stick. It kindof sucks that the first place I'm moving into on my own, I have to have my parents help me pay for. I was looking forward to being completely independent -- but I'm sure that's not all it's cracked up to be. So I'm kindof, subsidized... I call this condition ""funderemployed"". I'm making the most of it. Today, Instead of the usual getting to work at 9, I slept in with my girlfriend, woke up at 10, took a shower and she cooked bacon and I drove her to school and I rolled up to work at like 11. Then I took an incredibly long lunch break and played a game of league of legends at a gaming cafe with my girlfriends friend that I finally got to meet. It's not going to be very hard to adjust to the new lifestyle of working 20 hours, I'll try to have a lot of fun.

On the 280x, I'm in the process of RMA'ing it, thank you everyone for telling me that the parts warranty should cover this. In the mean time, one of my co-workers gave me $600 to own a portion of my mining rig, and I ordered [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080) today. That should pick up my hash speed until the 280x comes back. I made good use of my $800 credit limit, as I used that $600 to pay rent and then ordered the graphics card with my new credit card. That'll work out too, I can afford it I think. Anyway, with less hours I need to be mining as much as possible. Once the 290 and the 280x are both back, I'll be at a cool 2.3 Mhash. I also ordered 5 PCI risers, so that they don't get so hot and break. I actually ordered the risers this time, not just ""I'll get some risers eventually"".

Telling my girlfriend about my hours getting cut went okay, especially since I won't be bringing in less money with the help from my dad. I took everyone's advice to tell her ASAP, because it only would get harder. I didn't want to tell her before she went to work because as a server if she's in a good mood she'll get more tips, and I didn't want to make her sad anyway. So after work I told her and even waiting 6 hours to tell her I felt like I was just lying entirely too much, and I would be not myself until I told her. I'm glad I didn't wait longer than I did, because the question ""How long have you known?"" still came up, and I would've been in trouble if I had said ""a week"" or something, and yeah, don't hide things from your SO... I thought my life would be really shitty after yesterdays events but it all worked out. In fact, It's a step toward the future, especially for my career. My job right now is ""Intern"" and I've been working as a Jr. Software Dev here for almost 6 months -they hired me for a part time position. I worked too much and they ran out of money to give me- So really, they could've just fired me yesterday. My boss was kind enough to go out and ask for more money so I can continue to work until my contract is up on 4/15. So now, I'm really in the job market, and my next job will be my second job as a software developer! My second job as a software developer means that I'm **not entirely new** to programming and I can get paid more in my next job! In the past 6 months I've learned so much PHP and MYSQL, and with my cryptocurrency hobby, I'm actually kindof awesome and employable! I now get to look for a full-time, higher paying job, and that's the most exciting thing for any 18 year old. It's just scary to be looking for a job while also moving into a new place, and also getting a programming job at a company where my dad doesn't also work will be scary too, but hey, life is scary. Walk Hard!

And some best case scenario shit happened too! My girlfriend and I went to go get gas &amp; electric set up for the new apartment, and she left the lights on in the car! and the battery died! I turned my head 90 degrees, and we were parked literally in front of a Firestone car place. I walked, got a jump box and it took all of 120 seconds to get our car jumped! :)"

A little background on myself. I graduated a couple of months ago with a BS in computer engineering. I worked at an internship for 1.5 years and was hired as a full-time software engineer starting two months ago. Life is good, but I want to continue with grad school.

One thing my work offers (which I find great) is tuition reimbursement/payment of up to $10k/year. To make it easier, HR has a list of schools that work with my company to stay within that price range and make the transition painless.

One program I am really interested in is the MS in software engineering that is offered through Brandeis University. First of all, what sort of weight does that school hold on a resume? I have no interest in going to a diploma mill, I truly want to expand my knowledge but I cannot go for my master degree full-time during the day as a traditional student would.

Secondly, are only MS degrees looked down upon? I surely could find a campus that has a night learning MS degree program, but the idea of online appeals to me in this case.

Any advice anyone can give?"

Original thread is here: 510435461

Let's get to it.

Last time you saw me, I was 17 and had just attempted sex with a girl who was in love with me, and I her. While consummation did not fully occur the event itself definitely cemented my feelings for her.

And now...here we go. 

Note: All those guys asking someone to email them the story are hilarious, please whatever you do, do not email them. maybe add their Google+ profiles.

(and another side note, I laughed at every ""mfw"" reply in the other topic, so don't overdo it but realize I appreciate those)

Getting on the plane was so difficult. It felt like a nightmare when I landed back in the states, back to my family, back to my normal basement-filled existence with only my vidya games and my online friends for company. Talking with Lily was great and I did like it and looked forward to it - but the image of being on top of her, or of her lips on mine, made typing on a keyboard feel stupid.

My masturbatory fantasies were literally solely focused around that encounter in the park. Sometimes I changed it up by just jacking off to the thought of us kissing. Sometimes I dared to imagine the future. Basically, my penis ended up being sore for days by the time I was done with it.

I had a real girl and she lived across (down?) the globe. It wasn't fair - but it was also exciting. I loved the thought, and could feel myself going full pedo -- though I preferred to think of it as going ""full Lily"". 

I tried to not have all our conversations revolve around sex, but I did remind her over and over that I loved her and that I wanted to kiss her more. She said much the same, sometimes adding that she wondered what others would think if they knew she had a cute boyfriend who was in high school. I attempted not to freak out and tell her I'd die if she told anyone - but she did in fact use the word ""cute"" to describe me, after seeing my 'o' face. The only person to ever see it. It made me wonder if maybe I could actually be desirable or attractive. But fuck it, I was attractive to HER, and no one else mattered.

After several weeks I asked if she was okay with what we had done in the park. I said I was sorry if I had forced her - she just went with the same line, she was disappointed we didn't get to really 'do it'. It had been enough for me, as detailed before, but she had hoped to deliver more.

""I'm too small."" I remember her saying that, as it mirrored her statement about being too short to kiss. I assured her she wasn't, that I just didn't know what I was doing, and one day we could maybe try again. She said she hoped so. And that was enough to have me jacking off like a maniac yet again. 

She was turning 13 in a bit over a month. I was happy about this, as it was one year closer to being an acceptable age, even if it was still horribly young when I thought about it - thought about me, acne and braces, at 13. Yet one year closer was one year closer. A five year difference meant literally nothing by the time she was...18? 16? I tried to push the definition, wondering where the line would be.

Trying to shop for your girlfriend who exists in a culture you don't get in an age you don't entirely get is hard. I looked around for a while before settling on getting flowers delivered to her from an 'anonymous friend'. 

And oh boy did that go over well. I was afraid it was too mature or her parents would catch on, but that night she told me she was overjoyed and her parents assumed it was a boy from school with a crush. It was...perfect. And started a new tradition, that will be mentioned in the future.

We never talked about her body or mine, never got into having 'cyber'. That seemed sort of like perverting her, more than what I had already done. And plus who knew if she knew how to delete logs or hide her computer activities. Best to play it kind of, but not really, safe.

Her birthday was the precursor to Christmas, and I decided to not do anything big for that, just maybe a picture of me, or an emotional chat, or something. However she got to me first - ""guess what I asked for for Christmas""

I did not guess, as my first thought was a doll or an iPod. Of course when you come from decently wealthy stock, as her dad was, gifts tend to be a bit...big.

""i want to go back to america for a week.""

SPROING. My pants flew across the room from the power of my erection. I'd waited half a year, and figured I had another half left before I'd see her again. Suddenly there was potential for... soon! Really soon! She hadn't been back to America since they moved away and the request made sense. They used to live in our city (a big one, don't ask) 

and thus it made sense that they'd come back to the same city if they were going to see their old friends/places. I was overjoyed, especially when she said her dad had bought tickets for the first week of January. I started taking care of personal hygiene and stopped wearing sweatpants and began lifting like a champ (none of that really happened) to prepare for her arrival.

This was going to be it. I was going to open the year, before I turned 18, by losing my virginity. I was going to do it. I was. 

Power of positive thinking aside, I was just excited to have her back again. Really our emotional bond had hardly changed, we talked all the time, we were just missing everything physical - from holding hands to hugging to kissing to...the 'beyond'. Or maybe I was just missing it, who knows.

December crawled by. I finished my second to last semester of high school, got accepted to a decent college for business, basically made sure I did not bring shame to my family while I did everything to create a scenario in which my family would be more shamed than one would think possible (um I am not sure that sentence worked, you know what I mean). 

Christmas was coming, not that I cared. Each day was like an eternity, and I looked forward to logging onto the computer in the evening just to get in some talking before I went to sleep, praying the next day would come sooner.

Then one day she stopped signing on. A few days off here and there made sense, but in the middle of December she was just gone. Never online, not invisible or anything else. Just...gone. My heart sank when I saw that, immediately traveling down the worst possible solution, assuming she had found a new guy or had told on me or... That it was over. I couldn't handle it being over. We signed off our chats with ""i love you"" and/or ""i miss you"". How could it end so unceremoniously?

A week passed. No Lily. Christmas day was just me sitting under a massive tree with a huge pit of anxiety in my stomach. Two weeks had passed now - no Lily.

I had been living the dream and it was time to come back to earth. I...tried to find it in myself to accept that. 

We were supposed to meet up in my home city. We were supposed to, uh, take one more step in our relationship together. I was supposed to at least be able to kiss her one more time.

Masturbation came to a near-halt as each time I fantasized about that one early evening in the park, all I could see was her face, her smile, and then it vanishing. The way she had vanished, suddenly, leaving me alone.

The first week of January. It had now been three weeks since I'd spoken to her, the longest we'd gone in years.

I was devastated. Thinking about going to college, even thinking about going to classes in high school...it all felt so pointless. My parents noticed something wrong, and I admitted it had to do with a girl, they told me that young love was always like this, like it was the end of the world.

But this was MORE than that, it wasn't just an immature relationship. It was...she was...

She was my everything.

As I write this I can feel my chest tightening up. That was the furthest I've fallen, the darkest I've allowed my mind to go. Was it codependency or sick or something else? Maybe.

I NEEDED her.

Lily.

Lily.

Lily. 

I had thought about skimming over this part, fortunately I know you guys all know the pain of having something ripped away from you, whether or not you ever really 'had it' in the first place.

I knew she was supposedly in our city in early January, and as I woke up each morning I wondered where she was, who she was with, what she was doing. I wondered if she missed me.

It was stupid to wonder, stupid to consider that a lovely girl would-

I was in the midst of just such a downward, flagellating spiral when my mother told me that some Spanish person was on the phone for me.

I assumed immediately, trying to keep my heart from leaping (it did), trying to keep myself from sprinting to the phone (I did), trying to keep my voice from quavering as I said ""ola?"" (it quavered like WT Snacks when he sees cheese pizza).

""Ola. Puedos ir tu habitacion?""

(Yeah yeah don't make fun of me at least I tried)

I knew that voice.

I went to my room. 

In my room we switched to English, thank moot, as I had reached the limit of my ability the moment I said ""ola"". I guess a summer down there hadn't actually improved the espanol at all.

""It's me."" It was Lily. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't decide what to say before finally settling on ""where have you been?"" I knew girls don't like desperate guys and I tried to keep it together, but what the hell, what she'd done was bullshit. ""Our computer broke."" That made sense. Sort of. ""Why didn't you FIX it?"" ""My dad got me a new one for Christmas. But I don't know how to put AOL on it.""

To this day I blame Mac OS X and its coolness for almost ending my life. Parents, buy your young daughters Windows computers so their communication with their pervert boyfriends can continue. And that's the moral of the story.

""Are you here? In America?"" My voice sounded like I was on the verge of crying. I cleared my throat and tried to blink away the, uh, mist in my eyes. ""Yeah. We got here last night, we're staying at the [large hotel]."" A long pause. I had no idea what to say. My day had suddenly gone from the worst of my life to the best yet (or maybe second best) and I hardly knew what was next. ""I missed you so much, I love you, I-""

She interrupted me, which was probably a good thing before I went full-beta on her once again.

""When can I see you? 

My first response was I'd sprint to her hotel room in the next five minutes, but tried to play it slightly cooler. ""I'm sure our dads have a dinner or something, try and find out."" She hung up and was off. I clung to the phone for dear life, snarling and hissing at my mother when she tried to take it from me, eventually biting her hand off to show her who the alpha was.

It rang again, after ages and ages of waiting. ""They had one tomorrow night but I got him to change it to tonight.""

I laughed. Lily's ability to manipulate her father was always outstanding and it seemed like this was no different. ""I told him I'm meeting a friend tomorrow night, but I wanted to see you guys.""

Perfect. In several different ways - she was definitely not meeting a friend the next day. And I would be seeing her TONIGHT. Assuming my parents were fine with the switch, which they had to be due to them being window dressing for this story/my life. 

Dinner came. She was wearing a black dress with a wide neckline, one that showed off her collarbone and the upper part of her chest, no cleavage popping despite breasts clearing being shoved upwards by a bra that was clearly a feat of engineering. She was on slight heels, just an inch perhaps, and looked even better than the last time I saw her. Gorgeous, perfect, everything I wanted in one human form. Lily wore a white headband holding her black hair away from her face, a face that shone brightly as she turned and smiled at me.

""Hey.""

""Hey.""

We hugged awkwardly. My erection said hello within milliseconds, then we all sat down to a meal together.

I tried to talk and not stare at Lily. She looked so good, how could everyone not see it? My counterpart, a fellow senior in high school now, an expert bitch like most senior girls, ignored me.

I seriously considered going to the bathroom with her, or playing footsy under the table, or just running out the front door with her hand in mine until we found a place we could be alone.

Really though the bathroom plan was halfway real in my mind. Quick kisses in the hallway - simple enough, right? But how to get her to come with...hmm... These thoughts took up most of dinner, except when I chimed in to talk business with ""the guys"". Other than that I looked like my usual strange closed-off socially maladjusted self. 

The mystery of why any girl would like me is still not solved, by the way. Don't expect a how-to manual at the end of this, I am still as mystified as you are.

Dinner ended. More hugs. I really, really, really wanted to kiss Lily. Just for a moment, just to feel what it was like after half a year without it.

They got in a taxi and were gone. I floated back home and tried to remember how to breathe. 

Then the planning went into full effect. I was going to get alone time with Lily and I was going to get it soon. She had an excuse for the following night, and I was going to take advantage of it. We spoke on the phone again that evening -- going to my home was not possible, going to her hotel room wasn't either. Unlike parks in exotic foreign lands, we would definitely be caught by a group of /b/tards and raped to death if we attempted anything out in the open.

So it was time to bust out daddy's credit card. Or just a pile of cash. Or use the credit card to get a pile of cash.

School vacation was still on. Lily had plans from approximately nine am until seven pm when she was supposedly meeting up with her friends.

We planned it together, after I told her what I was thinking.

I paid for the hotel room -- a nice one, though not too nice. I sat back in my home while she did whatever she did with her family. I resisted the urge to masturbate. I wondered if this was going to happen or if a bear was just going to break down the door and eat me. I wondered for hours, tossing and turning, before she called me.

It was on.

I told her the location.

We both took taxis, with me arriving just slightly before her, trying to not look incredibly suspicious as I moseyed past the front desk looking incredibly suspicious. She probably did the same. I was sitting in the room, wearing 'nice clothes' - a polo shirt and jeans - when I heard a light knock.

I opened the door. She jumped into my arms. I staggered backwards and closed the door, locking it, wondering... No, no need to wonder. This was about to happen. 

Now despite all my research on sex (i.e. all the porn I watched) I was not feeling very confident in my ability to perform oral. This was, in all seriousness, the number one concern in my mind as we kissed one another, held one another, fell backwards onto the bed. I am not sure what she was wearing to be honest, that became a very small matter all things considered. Soon her top was off, revealing the juvenile bra beneath -- the first time I'd actually seen her like that. I kissed her firmly, pulling her on top of me, maneuvering her body over mine, marveling in her litheness, her beauty, her...everything.

We pulled away from one another with an almost audible pop, both of us gasping, faces wet and messy, eyes shining, her hair already a mess from me running my hands through it.

""I need to call my mom.""

This was almost as much as the period comment, causing me to throb in my pants as she moved to the bedstand, pulling a scrap of paper from her jeans and dialing, informing her mother she had arrived safely. She hung up and I pulled her back to me, onto my lap as I sat with my back up against the headboard, Lily facing me, almost like that first time we had kissed.

I could see her breasts pushing into the bra just inches away from me. I took a long look, not afraid to let her see me enjoy her body, before shifting my eyes back to her face and smiling.

""I love you. I missed you so much.""

She grinned. ""Do you want me to take it off?""

Honestly each thing she said made me want to blow a load in my pants. But instead I took a breath and nodded.

She seemed to take her goddamn sweet time with it, unsnapping, pulling it forward, letting the patches of fabric hang on her breasts for interminable seconds before letting it fall off.

My first in-person boobs. They did not disappoint at all. Small, just handfuls I would say, topped with soft pink nipples. My mouth was definitely dropped open as I looked and she watched me with obvious delight. 

""You're gorgeous."" I breathed it out without even thinking, voice full of lustful desire. My hand came up practically on its own, cupping underneath one youthful breasts, feeling its slight give, the taut warm flesh beneath my hand... Again, enough to make me cum a hundred times over. I leaned in and kissed her, one hand on her boob, the other behind her back, holding her close to me, our mouths opening, coming into one another, kissing like old pros now, like two people fully in love. Obviously at this point her age didn't matter, nothing mattered, all that mattered was her.

Her nipple didn't harden - I do remember that quite specifically. I wonder if I fucked up? No matter. It remained soft, pliable, and I rubbed my palm over it for a moment before Lily grimaced and shook her head. This was enough to make me move both hands to her back, smiling apologetically.

She backed off of me, pulling down her tight jeans with mild difficulty, revealing panties with some sort of silly pattern, before getting back onto the bed with me, where I had taken off my own shirt to reveal my oh-so-beautiful skinny torso. 

We kept kissing. I was trying desperately to take it slow. I knew where this was heading and wanted to do it right - and do it all the way. 

The kissing was, honestly, almost enough. If I forgot the sensation of my dick against her then I was able to imagine that I could be satisfied with just kissing.

Seriously, have I said enough about the kissing yet? Let me know.

We rolled over so I was atop her now, her hands lightly pushing against my chest as I bore down on her, mouth nuzzling, probing, tongue against her own. Finally I pulled back and away from her.

I had Lily here, in bed, in her underwear. Nothing to interrupt us. I sat back and took off my own pants, the massive tent of my erection (I'm like sixteen inches you guys) as obvious as anything. ""Ahe. I'm sort of..."" I had no idea how to explain this. Eh, she had to know what it meant. Or hopefully she did.

I moved between her legs, both of us with our underwear still on, and rocked against her, feeling my erection press into that soft flesh between her legs, her stomach shuddering as she took deep breaths, breasts expanding upwards slightly each time.

""Can we...""

I tried to ask for permission.

""Can we try?""

I am not sure if that is exactly what I said, it was something like that. Then it was her turn -- ""I love you, anon. I. Love. You.""

Seemed like permission.

I moved backwards and pulled my underwear off, now fully naked with a girl for the first time.

""It's too big."" She pulled her mouth to the side as she took her panties off, then laying back against the headboard, head propped up by pillows.

""We can go slow, it's okay, we don't have to-"" I started to back off mentally before trying. I wanted to have the right expectations. Maybe it wouldn't work, maybe she couldn't, maybe I was actually 'too big', though that seemed like such a porn thing to say. 

I moved up between her legs, dick bobbing between my own as I lay on top of her. First we kissed some more, feeling our naked bodies against one another for the first time. Her kisses were slightly more hesitant, kind of nervous, or perhaps I was just projecting my own insecurities onto her (almost definitely that). 

I could feel my penis, slightly wet already, resting on top of her folds. My shaft was lengthwise against her labia, just moving gently up and down, head hovering below her belly button. Finally I propped myself up onto one hand, raising my torso so we met at the hips only.

Pulling back I reached a hand down to try and reposition myself. This time around I noticed she had a tiny bit of fuzz on her pussy, just enough to make me feel slightly less pedo (but not much). Should I have worried about her period? Definitely yes. Did I? Nope.

Lily spread her legs side, those puffy, reddened parting slightly, and I pressed my cockhead against her, this time fully cognizant of what I was doing, seeing it all beneath me, pressing in oh-so-gently and yet firmly. Her folds pressed inwards, dragged in slightly by my penetrating erection, a strange look that made me worry I was hurting her.

I stopped. Looked up at her. ""Are you okay?"" Maybe it was beta to ask, but I had to. She nodded. ""It feels like stretching.""

Well...better than ripping and tearing pain. I withdrew, repositioned, pressed in again. The same thing happened, slight inward folding, about half my cockhead successfully making it 'in', but clearly some sort of tight ring preventing me from going further. 

I kept going like that. Pull out, press in, try and get a millimeter further each time. It was slow going and I was on the edge of cumming, and ruining the moment, from the instant I saw my penis press inside of her even slightly. Finally, finally, finally I pressed harder, my hands moving to her hips to hold her in place as I tried to get past that first little 'trial'. 

I felt a ring of what seemed like muscle pop down around my cockhead. Have you guys felt that? Oh my god. Oh. My. God.

Paused for a moment. Looked at Lily. Kissed her more, until she actually pushed me away with a soft hand on my chest. ""You don't have to stop.""

That took me aback for a moment.

""I want to kiss you. I don't just...""

I looked at her for a moment, dick buried a solid inch inside of her, trying to decide what my best move was.

""We love each other. This isn't...some stupid..."" I couldn't find the exact words to say. So I kissed her more.

She didn't speak up. I felt my dick beating inside of her, my heartbeat seeming to come from the very tip of my cock now. Finally: ""I love you too. I do. I want you to...""

It was her turn to trail off.

I was past talking, and looked downwards, humping my hips into her, trying to get any further, feeling like it was an impossible task, especially when I could see 5/6 of my penis outside of her.

With extreme delicacy, trying not to get too, uh, overwhelmed, I pulled myself out and pushed in again, to the same point, right where I felt her 'snap' around me. Then out, then in, just that one little bit of my length. 

Who knows how long that went on - it could have been an hour or thirty seconds. After a while I felt like I could go deeper, and on one thrust I tried, pushing in a little further, a little faster, a little harder.

FINALLY I felt myself really penetrate her, my dick now slightly further in, the hot grip encasing my head and the top of my shaft. There was a slight resistance inside her, despite it feeling like I could go further. Really hard to describe.

I think you know what I'm trying to describe - I am unsure how many of you have deflowered a thirteen year old, but I have, and I'm here to say it is really hard to put down in words. Won't stop me from trying though.

So I pushed. And pulled back, and pushed again. It took three attempts, the third more straining, pressing, feeling her clench up against me, her hands suddenly on my stomach as I closed my eyes and strained. Yeah - not quite as romantic as you might hope. And then the resistance was gone, my penis moving inside another inch, maybe less. On pulling back, I saw red fluid on myself, as if I needed confirmation of what had just happened. 

It dripped onto the bedspread (though I didn't see this, just discovered it later), those final remnants of Lily's girlhood.

She was obviously in pain, eyes clenched tight, mouth a thin line that she held closed as well. I said something trite and stupid like ""it's okay"", or even more likely I let out an animalistic gurgle.

But that sort of clenching, stressed-out, pained response had one negative impact on my perfect sexual form - and that was that she had clamped to the point that I couldn't move in and out of her any more.

Now I did clear my head, or try to, looking down at this beautiful girl, my everything, moving a hand from her hip to her face, stroking my thumb against her cheek.

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry - it's okay."" 

I did not magically become a porn star at any point, so things stayed pretty real, sorry if you are expecting a unicorn to pop out of her ass while I fuck her mouth. (I'm looking at you, furry guy)

But she did open her eyes finally, smiling for real now, shiny with slight tears. I didn't try and explain it to her, she wasn't a five-year-old, but instead just kissed her nose, running my hand up and down her side now, moving my kisses to her upper lip, then her full mouth. As I did this, I started to move my hips again, gently, feeling myself go in noticeably deeper. I was still 'bottoming out' before I got myself fully inside of her, but I figured that this was to be expected.

I was actually fucking her. I looked down at my penis shifting in and out, her labia dragged inward and outward with it, the blood still present, along with plenty of other liquids I wasn't about to try and identify.

A year previous I'd have been surprised had I died NOT a virgin, and now here I was, having sex in a hotel room. Having sex! Yes, these thoughts were actually in my head. It was exciting to finally be doing it, even if I was a little late (little did I know that 18 isn't really that late). And with someone I loved, and someone who loved me back, enough to do this with me...it was... 

I could have almost cried, were it not for the bolts of pleasure shooting through my body each time our hips came together, each time I thrust into Lily's body, each time I felt myself begin to slide out of her...it was indescribable. Better than kissing, better than masturbating, better even than dubs (no seriously).

The time it took you to read this is almost definitely longer than the amount of time I lasted, though in my memory we fucked like old lovers for a minimum of six hours. The idea of even bothering to pull out was silly - I had managed to get inside her, I was going to end there as well.

I could feel it building- 

My balls tightened as I picked up my pace, now thrusting in and out more frantically, with less timing and precision, mouth probably hanging open, first looking between us to see myself actually penetrating her, before deciding that wasn't what I wanted to cum while looking at -- I moved my eyes up her body, to Lily, my beloved, my everything. She was looking down as well, but then up at me as she felt my gaze shift.

I tried to say I love you, it came out more like grunts, and then-

I felt myself unload inside her, hot jets spurting inside her body, against her immature womb, the liquid building and making my cock slide easily as I continued to jab into her with each throb of pure pleasure. I saw white, fell downwards onto her as it began to subside, letting out moans as I slowly began to come down, the realization of what we'd just done...if anything turning me on again. No regret, no fear - only love and lust in perfect combination.

I'd just felt my first boob, lost my virginity, taken a girl's virginity, and cum inside her all in one fell swoop.

Jesus christ please excuse OP while he cums from remembering. 

I managed to get off of her before I smothered her to death. The aura of sex lay heavy in the air, and with regret I felt myself slip out of her - a place I never wanted to leave again. I don't like a mess, but the semen, blood, and lubricating, uh, stuff was basically everywhere and there was no cleaning it up. I checked the clock - she had to be back to hers within the next couple hours. Enough time to cuddle and talk, and maybe...But then again judging by how she was wincing as she sat up, Lily wasn't going to be up for round 2 in the near future.

""That was...amazing.""

The first thing I said was about as cliched as they come, and I was ashamed of myself but also knew there was no more honest way to express myself.

""I love you.""

She said it back this time - ""I love you too."" I leaned over to kiss her before standing, walking to the dresser and getting some kleenex to clean myself off a bit, OCD shining through.

I brought her back a handful - as I came towards her I did look lecherously between her legs, where her labia remained parted open slightly, sticky white globules oozing out of her at a slow crawl, an amount I don't think I've ever produced before, creeping down her ass and landing on the bed.

Lily took the tissues and pushed them between her legs. 

We kissed again, a quick peck on the lips, as she stood up slightly shakily. The amount of stains on the sheets was kind of gross, if not incredible, and she maneuvered to wipe away between her legs several more times, the amount of semen inside of her seeming to finally come to an end.

Whether or not cumming inside her was a bad idea didn't matter, I had done it and that was that. What did matter was hugging her again, which I did, kissing her forehead - the only place I could reach while I was standing - and telling her I loved her.

""I think I need a shower."" Lily said, with a little giggle, my first sign that I could relax and freak out just slightly less. We went into the bathroom together, stood underneath the spray, ran soap over one another.

Of course I was sporting another boner quickly, which made Lily laugh as she noticed it poking her in the belly. ""I don't think I can do that again right now."" She said, looking downwards, the angle just right for me to pick her up and impale her and have shower sex just the way -- I broke myself away from that train of thought and nodded. 

""I can't help it when I see you!"" It felt nice to...not be ashamed of my erections, or of any part of my body, to have someone loving and gorgeous appreciate very bit of me, when she could see literally every flaw. 

We got out of the shower and I made the bed again - she put her clothes back on, much to my disappointment, as now that I'd seen her naked it seemed a shame to ever cover it up. I dressed as well. With me sitting on the lovely hotel chair (joke, it was not lovely), Lily got onto my lap, resting her legs sideways over mind, nestling her head underneath my chin. I put my arms around her, pulling her tightly to me. She let out a happy sigh. I did as well. I drew in her scent, the soap of the shower mostly prevalent, perhaps I just imagined an odor of what we'd just done still present on her body.

We stayed like that. Maybe she slept, maybe I did. But the moment she had to leave came far too soon.

She walked out the door, leaving well before me to prevent things from looking odd. Or whatever reasoning my 007 mind had come up with.

My heart wanted to break again as she walked away. But the door closed, and she was gone. I wondered when the next time would be... I wondered if I'd made a huge fucking mistake.

Mostly I basked in the afterglow of what we'd just done.

Holy shit. It had really happened. 

We did not get private time again before she was back to her home. We saw each other a few more times, hugged, said our goodbyes on her last day. Again, I had a hard time looking her parents in the face knowing what I had done. I also researched as much as I could about whether or not there was a way to know if my kid was inside of her...as that was obviously not going to be okay. Sadly the internet did not have an easy solution for that one, so I knew I just had to wait it out.

Time passed.

We kept talking.

I brought up the sex every now and then, and she seemed mostly perturbed by how painful it had been, and that an orgasm had eluded her. She did not seem to be pregnant, though I did not push the issue of her period as that seemed weird.

But I did mention missing her body, her perfect breasts, the feeling of her arms around me or hands on my chest... Every now and then mentioning the hotel room, what we had done.

Phew.

It was hard, and by it I mean my penis every time we spoke. Cybering with her was not going to happen, but there was plenty of simultaneous chat/fap that she was unaware of. I think.

I had the chance to go back down there to do the same internship as the summer previous, and while it'd be notably shorter due to prepping for FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE, I obviously did everything to ensure it'd happen. 

(Okay guys. Where do we go now?)"
1z1beu,2,2014-02-26,"17 &amp; attending college next year. Not quite sure what to major in, enjoy Bitcoin trading, coding, and doing what I like.",Phrontier,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1z1beu/17_attending_college_next_year_not_quite_sure/,"Hey there,

A little bit of background, I enjoy doing what I like, and if I enjoy it, I'll pursue it with my heart. I've gotten into many different things with the latest being trading Bitcoins. I've been very successful at it, but I simply don't have the means to move large volumes so I'm doing it for a little pocket cash right now. 

Other things I've gotten into include starting Minecraft servers, and even trying to run my own VPS business renting out servers to other players. I stopped attempting that as I can potentially get in a lot of trouble when I'm messing with other peoples money. I've developed a few simple Java plugins for Minecraft and would love to enter the indie scene and develop games. I want to run my own business matter of fact. 

I said I enjoyed coding, well, that's sort of correct. I enjoy coding what I like. I had an internship with Harris where I had to code a few projects for them in VBA (behind the scenes language for Excel) and didn't particular enjoy that. It was interesting, I liked trying to solve the problems and being able to fix them, but I didn't so much enjoy it because I wasn't really coding for a project I had any interest in. My dream would be able to develop my own games, but I wouldn't so much mind coding for a larger game company. 

My other option is to join an ROTC program in college, try to become a Navy pilot and from then on I'll work my way with the eventual goal of trying to be an astronaut. That'd be pretty sweet. But if I choose that option I'll have dedicated my life to something I might not even receive and by that point I won't have as much time to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams.

I'm lost. 

I really don't know what to major in when I enter college. I feel like Computer Science is just my go to plan. I'm not sure if it's the right choice. It really sucks making a decision at 17 for something I'm going to potentially do the rest of my life, so I might as well try to make the right one. 

Does anyone have any advice whatsoever? Whether it's how to determine my own major, or some interesting career paths I would enjoy, any help is appreciated. "

[For those who received a Supplemental Questionnaire, what are our chances of getting admitted after successfully completing them? Who are our applications compared with? How does admissions work for those select students? I know it's different for each student, but what have you heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnehp?context=5)|Those who receive a supplemental questionnaire do not have a higher or lower chance of getting admitted than those who do not receive the questionnaire. The questionnaire just means that the admissions office/readers wanted additional information. -Grant.
[Hey UCLA! I think the #1 question I have is...  When do decisions come out??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnxvv?context=5)|Decisions come out mid-late March for Freshman applicants. Good luck! -Jennie.
[Do UCLA and Berkeley communicate with each other regarding admissions decisions? Most people say that you either get in to one or the other, so I'm wondering if there's a reason for that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpo0oz?context=5)|I heard about the Berkeley and UCLA ""curse"" when I was applying to both schools as well. As someone who has applied to both and received acceptance to both, I can wholeheartedly tell you that none of the UC's communicate with each other regarding admissions decisions. Good luck! -Michelle.
[What part of an application do you find has the highest correlation with success in college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpni4o?context=5)|""Hi! Note this answer is not a reflection of the admission process, but just my personal opinion as a current student. I believe your extracurricular in high school are an accurate representation of how well a student will do in college. Strong extracurricular shows you can manage your time, have strong social skills, and are proactive. In my opinion these are 3 characteristics of a successful college student.  -Grant""
[Hi there!  HS Senior that applied here, and these questions can go to any of you guys.  1\) Is it necessary to be in a sorority/fraternity to have a social life?  2\) What's your favorite thing about UCLA?  3\) Why shouldn't I go to USC? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnkf2?context=5)|So exciting that you applied to UCLA. 1) It is not necessary to be involved in Greek life to have a social life. In fact, only 15% of the student population is in a sorority or a fraternity. That being said, it's still a significant amount given our student body size. With a large and diverse student population, we have nearlhy 1000 clubs and organizations for you to get involved in. Additionally, UCLA is located in the vibrant, fun Greater Los Angeles area with concerts, sporting events, and nightlife to keep your social life busy :) 2) My favorite thing about UCLA are the students. They're not only passionate and brilliant, but also very involved in their campus community. The amount of Bruin pride and spirit is infectious and the student life is wonderful. 3) Because blue will look better on you than red! -Michelle 
[Does the Personal Statement carry more weight than overall GPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnhdm?context=5)|We review applications holistically. This means we consider GPA, extra-curricular activities, volunteer work, and personal statements into consideration and equally. GPA does play a major factor into our decisions. The personal statement is used as a better way to understand the applicant outside of academic life.  -Eldrin.
[Hey! I am a senior in high school and I applied to UCLA this fall.  Students today have increased online presences in social media. As part of the admissions process do you ever look up a student online to get a better feel of who they are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnth8?context=5)|UCLA Admissions will not “look up” a student to get a feel of who they are, that’s what the application is for! We leave ample room to express yourself and gauge an applicant as a whole student, so don’t worry. We won’t go facebook stalking you! ~Veronika.

[Is it difficult to have a double major at UCLA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnfn7?context=5)|It is very possible to Double Major at UCLA. I even know some students who have two majors as well as a minor. As long as you stay on top of your requirements for your major and meet with a counselor having a double major can be done!
[When are acceptances sent out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnfn7?context=5)|Admission letters go out mid to late March.
[What is the effect of applying to an impacted major? (like CS\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnfn7?context=5)|Major has no effect on whether a student is accepted or not. The only time major affects the admission process is if you apply to one of our 4 professional schools (Engineering, Theater Film and Television, Nursing, and Art and Architecture). -Grant.
[I received an invitation to apply for the alumni scholarship. However, since the invite is not a sign of admission, why would UCLA invite us to apply? What if we got accepted for the scholarship but not for the admission into UCLA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnvs7?context=5)|I was also an alumni scholar. Being invited as an alumni scholar does not guarantee admission. However, the fact that you got accepted as an alumni scholar means you are a well-rounded student and that will also be reflected in your application to UCLA. Alumni scholarships are given to outstanding students so I congratulate you for receiving it! -Eldrin.
[Did I get in? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnx5y?context=5)|Decisions have not yet been made. You will receive your admissions decision by late march. But I hope you do! ;) -Eldirn.

He will hopefully lead UCLA to another championship next year :) -Eldrin.
[How difficult is it to graduate from UCLA in 4 years, specifically for an engineering major?  For the political science majors, could you please tell me about the opportunities available at UCLA in terms of internships at congressional offices and research opportunities?  Thank you!  Class of 2014 Applicant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnojn?context=5)|The average graduation rate for UCLA students is 4 years and a quarter. That being said, I do have many friends in the engineering program who have graduated within four years exactly. Your graduation rate all depends on how you plan your courses, whether or not you take summer school, and whether you stay on top of uour degree planning when enrolling in your classes each quarter. I'm personally a political science major and I can tell you I'm constantly e-mailed by the department advisor about opportunities to intern with Congressional representatives, political campaign organizations, etc. All professors at UCLA conduct their own research as well so there are plenty of opportunities to participate in research in a subject of your interest. -Michelle.
[What is the most desirable quality you as admissions officers look for in a prospective student?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpni6l?context=5)|UCLA admissions officers are looking for a variety of factors when reviewing applications. Of course any university loves to see good grades and high test scores but there is more to applications than the numbers! UCLA reviews applications as a whole and likes to see that you are a well-rounded and balanced student. Some specific things are strength of schedule (are you challenging yourself with your classes?), extra curriculars (are you involved in them for an extended period? i.e. not just senior year), and overall if you would be a good fit and an asset to the university. -Jennie.
[Why do you send so many emails and letters about campus life, majors, etc if no one has been accepted yet? It stresses me out haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnzhf?context=5)|We want to make sure our prospective applicants are receiving useful information before receiving their admissions decisions.

You have to be able to see yourself going to that school for the next 4 years. I was torn between two schools and I wasn't sure what to do but once I visited UCLA it felt right, there was so much diversity and UCLA students are known to work hard but are able to have fun and balance everything. -Rebecka 
[How is the food and gyms at ucla?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpo3sz?context=5)|Delicious food! Awesome workout facility! We have dining halls ranging all different food preferences. Whether you're Vegan, Vegetarian, or Meat-eater UCLA has something for everyone. The dining halls have delicious menu's daily with different meals every single day. Some personal favorites are gelato at Cafe 1919, sushi at Hedrick Hall, and anything at our new healthy-themed dining hall, Bruin Plate. The John Wooden Center (our student gym) boasts a 3-story rockwall, plenty of space for workout machines and mats, raquetball courts, and group exercise classes such as yoga, kickboxing, zumba, and spin. The hours are very extensive too whether you want to work out early in the morning or late at night. -Michelle.
[Do you think the current admissions process is too formulaic? (Good GPA + good SAT scores + extracurriculars with substance = good chance of acceptance\) What would you do if you could change the process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnypf?context=5)|Hi, UCLA does not have a formulaic admissions process. Many colleges have thresholds where if an applicant’s GPA + SAT is above this threshold then they will be accepted. At UCLA we do not have a threshold or formula. We have a holistic review which looks for 16 different points.

[What is your response to Sy Stokes's ""The Black Bruins"" spoken word piece and the information it represents? Has the popularity of this video lead to any big discussions in the administrative sphere about race and representation on campus? Link: Link to www.youtube.com.

Here is the link to the statement: [Link to newsroom.ucla.edu](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/statement-on-video-by-african-249314.aspx) In response to your second question, all UC's make the admissions decision independently from one another. -Eldrin

Thanks in advance. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnu23?context=5)|Hey iSDRC. Biology is a pretty popular major here at UCLA but don't let that scare you, it does not have an effect on admissions! Besides the professional schools (Arts, Theater, Engineering, Nursing) which biology doesn't fall under, the major selection does not impact admissions decisions. Basically everyone is reviewed using the same guideline regardless of what they choose so there aren't any majors that are ""easier"" or ""harder"" to get into. For your question about living close.. NOPE! Doesn't affect it at all  -Jennie.

I've taken honors and AP classes since freshman year and have been very active outside the classroom, however, my GPA is hoovering at around 3.3 and ACT 25.

How much does UCLA consider extra-curriculars when put next to an average GPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpp15g?context=5)|UCLA Admissions officers are trained to look at every application holistically and definitely take into account a student taking challenging courses while in high school. We look at honors and AP classes and definitely consider that a strong pull for the student who would then come and taking even more difficult classes here at UCLA. No one part of the application is more important or weighted more than others so show us all you have done and we will take all of it into account in our decision! Best of luck! ~Veronika.
[I live on the East Coast and was wondering if there are any outstanding campus events or activities that take place in the time span between when decisions are released to when we are expected to decide which university we are going to attend.

We also have events at UCLA specifically for admitted students to give them a more in depth tour or more specific information if you happen to be in the area to check out the campus itself on those dates.

[On behalf of my girlfriend who's preparing for her freshman undergrad year, how much of a boon would you consider the freshman cluster program? Do you have any experiences with what she can hope to encounter through it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpojlc?context=5)|First off, what a nice and supportive boyfriend you are! The cluster program is a nice way to learn a certain subject at a deep level throughout the entirety of your freshman year. I took the cluster on the 60s and got to learn about the political theory, history, and music of the era and its influence to this day. I also took a seminar on the literature of the atomic bomb in tandem with this cluster.

(GPA's around 3.2, I live in San Diego\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpnsco?context=5)|Hello mmiikeee! So of course UCLA loves to see strong GPAs and high test scores (what school doesn't?). But it's important to know that when admissions officers read your application they are looking at it as a whole which means that they will be taking your GPA, test scores, extracurriculars, high school attended, rigor of courses, as well as peronal achievements etc. into account! As a basic rule try to keep your scores up and take the most challening schedule that you can balance with an active extracurricular schedule. -Jennie.
[ off, I want to thank you guys for doing this AMA, it is going to be a tremendous resource for high school students trying to get into the university that they want to.  Is it more advantageous for a student to stay in easy classes and have a very high unweighted GPA, or is that frowned upon by admissions officers? Also, which is considered as a student's true average: their weighted, or unweighted average?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z1i2f/we_are_ucla_admissionstudent_ambassadors/cfpowg5?context=5)|We would always encourage a student to take a rigorous high school program (Honors/AP/IB classes). We would question why a student who gets straight A's did not seek to challenge him/herself by taking these kinds of classes (if available at their school). The weighted GPA is really a representation of how rigorous the high school program was.

To be honest, I was quite lucky and had parents that helped me out with a college fund but yes, out-of-state tuition is a lot. I relied heavily on my high school career center that had a whole slew of scholarships my counselor helped me apply for. After getting in to UCLA then looking up scholarships specific to my demographic or major is how I have gotten most of my scholarships whilst being a bruin. It took some hours searching and applying but it has been absolutely completely worth it!! ~Veronika

As for the MCAT, I don’t want to go to medical school so I have not taken it yet! Many of my friends are in fact going the doctor route and they took it between their junior and senior year as an undergrad, but there are a large number of folks who choose to wait until after they have graduated to focus on the test. They have felt quite prepared in terms of material but everyone I have talked to bought books or took prep courses before the test to learn the test itself, and not necessarily the material if that makes sense.

I'm a third year university student with several successful, high-paying internships at tech companies and I'm two months into another internship as well (they're four month terms per our university's co-op program), and when I'm in school, I work part time. I have savings, I've successfully paid months upon months of rent and phone bills on time, and I'm paying for my university tuition with student loans.

I feel like I'm a pretty good candidate.

My only blemish on my credit check (which is otherwise inexistent) is that over a year ago my parents asked me to sign for them in order to register for a phone (my parents have terrible credit and are terrible with money) and I ended up signing for them. They promised they'd pay it on time, but of course they didn't, and it went to collections and they kept calling me until I paid it. I didn't even know they weren't paying it.

This is my fault. I know that, I naively trusted my parents to be adults and pay off their bill like I would have, and I suffered. I wouldn't and haven't made that mistake again.

But I apply for a BMO Student MasterCard, and they deny me due to this situation (even though I explain it wasn't directly me) and the fact that I'm a student and haven't worked at a place for 6 months straight (I have had jobs for the last 2.5 years straight, just due to my co-op program the jobs are internships (paid) for 4 month periods). It's a student MasterCard, this restriction seems absurd, how would a student work for 6 months straight? If it's part-time, surely the fact I've worked multiple four-month full time terms should come into play?

I've applied to TD as well and was denied, I assume for similar reasons.

Where do I go from here? I honestly feel like I'm a great candidate, I'm paid well, save money well and have no problem paying off bills, but it just seems like no one is willing to give me a chance."

I'm a fourth year electrical engineering and so far most of my experience has been in C/C++ with a tad of Java.  I've been looking to start a couple smallish side projects to talk about at interviews as personal projects have been a hot topic in previous internship interviews.

Basically I want to have the software side based on Python as it is the most common language I see in job postings that I don't have much experience in.  

The project itself is going to be a raspberry pi or beaglebone or something of my own creation with an attached LCD and ethernet connection.  The hardware side I have covered and understand completely.  

On the software side I want the program to connect to my Cryptsy account and retrieve balance information and recent transactions which will be displayed on the LCD.  Or possibly just connect to a common market site and retrieve the most recent cryptocurrency prices.

I'm not asking for the solution but just a push in the right direction on what kind of programming I need to look into.  I know this is more computer/software engineering stuff but it seems like more and more electrical engineering postings are asking for more than the usual Assembly and C programming experience.

1z2k7r,3,2014-02-27,I think Canadian Medical Schools should have (more) affirmative action for Rural Origin students. CMV.,[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1z2k7r/i_think_canadian_medical_schools_should_have_more/,"Finding doctors willing to practice medicine in rural Canada is hard. Straight up. The patient to doctor ratio is significantly higher in rural settings (1:1200 doctor/patient as opposed to 1:980 in urban Canada) and doctors in rural practices and hospitals feed overworked.

&gt; [Although 20% of Canadians live in rural communities, only 10% of the country’s family physicians practise in these areas. The shortage of physicians in many rural Canadian communities has been attributed to issues such as lack of access to teaching hospitals, less vacation time, demanding call schedules, and financial considerations. Medical students have cited difficulties finding employment for their partners, distance from family members, geographic isolation, and lack of professional support as disadvantages of rural practices.](http://www.cfp.ca/content/55/1/72.full)

It has also been indicated that students who grew up in rural situations are much more inclined to return to rural settings when they have graduated from medical school. They are more likely to favour family medicine. Therefore it is advantageous to have rural origin students in medical school as they are necessary for medical systems in rural areas. We need doctors who are willing and able to live in remote settings for the accessibility of all to our health care system.

Presently it seems rural students appear to be underrepresented in medical schools.

&gt; [National data on applicants including grade points averages and offers is not available, but Ontario data suggests that fewer rural students than their urban counterparts apply to medical school and even those who do apply, with similar grade point averages and MCAT scores to their urban counterparts, fewer rural students are accepted. (Hutten-Czapski in press)](http://www.cfpc.ca/uploadedFiles/Resources/Resource_Items/Health_Professionals/AdmissionRuralOrigin.pdf)

Students from rural backgrounds face several key problems in gaining admission to - and attending - medical school. Some of them are outlined in the report linked above but they include:

* Medical students have disproportionately highly educated parents who, more frequently than not, live in urban settings. Kids growing up in rural townships lack the exposure to highly educated role models that these children often do via relationships with their parents and their circle of typically similarly educated friends.
* Rural students are frequently economically disadvantaged. They were less likely to come from money (see also above: highly educated parents are more likely to have higher incomes than lesser educated parents of rural childrend). This provides dual problems: they often have to work to support themselves through university leaving less time for internships, volunteer work and other CV enriching opportunities and, furthermore, makes medical tuition particularly onerous. Also no medical schools are located in rural areas. Rural students face further economic hardship in that there is no ability to commute like their urban counterparts can. They also must pay for travel to and from their homes if they want to see their families.
* Rural students frequently have fewer academic and extra curricular opportunities in highschool which impacts their CVs. This impacts their ability to obtain competitive paid positions within the medical/science field prior to medical school that favourably add to one's medical school application.
* Admissions committees are largely comprised of people who are from and currently reside in urban locations. They don't necessarily see the demand or feel the acute need for rural doctors as they are somewhat divorced from that reality. (In the 2003 survey, of Canadian medical school admission associate deans, only 3 indicated they had a rural physician on their schools admission committee. It is difficult to develop policies that take the rural admission issues into account if there is not rural representation on the admission committee. Similarly, the heavy preponderance of urban interviewers at most medical schools may result in an unintentional urban selection bias as it may be that “medical school admission committee members tend to give high ratings to those students whose backgrounds, values and orientation are similar to their own”). Only the University of Manitoba has a policy to specifically help rural applicants and it only pertains to Manitobans.

I think we should both reserve spots in medical school for rural origin students and provide scholarships and bursaries to help provide incentive and offset expenses. Though this is unfair to urban origin students, it is necessary to help address the growing shortage of doctors willing to practice in remote locations and is the best recourse for growing rural practices and generating better equality in accessibility for healthcare among rural Canadians."

Meanwhile, Derek doesn't keep a promise, leaving Meredith feeling betrayed; Arizona and Callie make a decision about their relationship; and Bailey uncovers the real reason why Ben returned to Seattle.

After previously on ""Get Up, Stand Up"", Meredith admits that she’s jealous of Cristina's success, and Cristina confesses that Meredith is a great mom and a great surgeon. April cuts the sappiness short by demanding that people make her feel special because it’s her day. Bailey tells Ben that it's essentially his fault for her OCD troubles because her symptoms only worsened when he quit surgery.

Webber has to take over Shane’s surgery because Shane had become so wrapped up in his abilities and reliving the night of Brooks' death that he got himself into trouble . During April and Matthew's wedding, Derek gets a call from the President of the United States, and Jackson stands up and confesses his love for April.

Inspired by the 1979 novel and 1981 film of the same name, ENDLESS LOVE will be released on Valentine's Day, 2014.

""Endless Love"" isn't so much a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film as it is an extended ad for the idyllic Abercrombie &amp; Fitch lifestyle.

This is supposed to be a film about the throes of teenage first love—a love you would go to jail for, set a house on fire for, a love that requires a restraining order—but it's awfully tasteful and emotionally detached in its blissed-out depiction of beautiful young people cavorting in the sunlight.

Toned, tanned David and Jade (Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde, both former models) frolic in a meadow, leap off a dock in slow motion and splash in a lake, all to the blare of alt rock music to signal to us how we should react to these images. They make romantic love on the carpet by the fireplace light (but this time there's no creepy mom watching them from the shadows). Even their vaguely grungy moments—kissing in the back of a beat-up pickup truck or in the hot summer rain—feel impeccably art designed.

In short, director and co-writer Shana Feste has remade ""Endless Love"" but she's taken out all the crazy. Not that the original was all that great to begin with; a six-time Razzie Award nominee, it was screechy, melodramatic and over-acted, with an awkwardly flat lead performance from Brooke Shields. But at least it had passion. Pettyfer and Wilde look lovely together—although they're both in their mid-20s playing 17-year-olds, and it shows—and they do enjoy some real chemistry throughout their flirtatious, falling-in-love stage. But the sense that something vital is at stake is woefully lacking.

Some of the basic details and visual touchstones are in place, but Feste (""Country Strong"") and co-writer Joshua Safran have reconfigured this story entirely—and, notably, omitted the Oscar-nominated Lionel Richie-Diana Ross theme song which was such a ubiquitous hit on radios and prom dance floors alike. (Also missing this time around: the small role of the wild-eyed arsonist played by a young Tom Cruise in mercilessly short Daisy Dukes.)

Now, instead of an age difference, there's a class difference. David is a smart, decent, blue-collar guy who's happy to go into business with his father (Robert Patrick) as a mechanic rather than apply to college. Jade is a wealthy, sheltered and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University in the fall and become a cardiologist like her father (Bruce Greenwood).

The resemblance to the least-demanding sort of YA fiction, on the other hand, seems intentional. He is David (Alex Pettyfer), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. She is Jade (Gabriella Wilde), a smart, privileged girl who’s lived a sheltered life. They spent high school not talking to one another, but that hasn’t stopped David from seeing, as he explains in a gooey bit of opening voiceover, “the possibility of us.” After a cute escapade at a country club where David works as a valet, Jade sees the possibility, too. 

With little prompting, she’s on David like an electromagnet on a Buick, determined to make up for years of lost time during her last summer vacation before embarking on a demanding internship designed to feed into a medical career. He’s good for her, bringing a crowd to her party and a smile to her face, and she’s good for him, inspiring him to reconsider going to college. And everyone sees it, from Jade’s frustrated writer mom Anne (Joely Richardson) to her brother Keith (Rhys Wakefield) to David’s aw-shucks, salt-of-the-earth mechanic dad Harry (Robert Patrick, slowly morphing into Martin Sheen). 

The night of their high school graduation, David and Jade meet cute at the swanky restaurant where David works as a valet alongside his wisecracking best friend (a likable Dayo Okeniyi). Sparks fly instantly and the two become inseparable for the rest of the summer, to the vocal disapproval of Jade's snobbish dad. His overprotectiveness also stems from his continued grief over the loss of Jade's superstar older brother a few years back.

But the rest of the family welcomes David in; Jade's mother (Joely Richardson) and older brother (Rhys Wakefield) both experience much-needed emotional awakenings at the sight of Jade reveling in her first love. As David insinuates himself further with these folks—in a sweet and hunky way, rather than a dark and stalky way—something clearly has to give.

Director Shana Feste brought an occasionally entertaining fondness for melodramatic extremes to her 2010 film Country Strong, but here, she colors inside the lines. Working from a script co-written by Joshua Safran, a veteran of the TV shows Gossip Girl and Smash, Feste puts her photogenic cast through the expected paces in what ultimately becomes a conflict between a perfectly unobjectionable summer romance and a father unaware of the deleterious effects of the bug up his ass. Greenwood and a dewy-eyed Richardson overcompensate for younger leads not trying hard enough. Pettyfer and Wilde look the parts, but any scenes asking them to emote quickly turn disastrous. (A supporting cast of suspiciously mature-looking “teen” friends, one of them sporting a pair of distractingly inflated lips, doesn’t help.)

Just as the tension between father and suitor should be increasing, though, Feste goes through the motions en route to her happy ending. Strong, veteran character actors like Greenwood, Patrick and Richardson certainly elevate this predictable, lightweight material, but they can only do so much.

The film features many scenes with analogues to the novel, but they’ve been emptied out and drastically reworked, most notably a house fire that sets the novel into motion, but here shows up much later, and serves a considerably different purpose. That purpose, as with every element in the film, is to confirm the rightness of Jade and David’s passion for each other, any outside objections be damned. That’s far removed from the source, but more troublingly, presented in the least challenging way possible. Of course these kids belong together. They look great next to each other! End

Watching ""Endless Love,"" you long for it to be riskier, edgier, or at least more reflective of actual teenage experiences and emotions. Even the partying feels false, with freshly scrubbed kids talking about getting drunk and high without actually taking part in such activities or indicating their eventual effects. (Ostensibly, this creative decision was intended to secure a PG-13 rating.)"
1z2wtd,1,2014-02-27,Should I go to counselling or figure this out myself,throwawayelizabeth,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1z2wtd/should_i_go_to_counselling_or_figure_this_out/,"Hi, apologies if this is the wrong place! Throwaway as some people irl know my normal user name.

Basically - I don't know if I should go and receive counselling for an issue. My university has a free counselling service, but its quite busy so I don't want to take up a spot incase my issue is too trivial and someone else really needs one.

My issue is I've been offered a great summer internship in a city 4 hours away, meaning I'll need to move away from my flat. It will probably lead to employment when I graduate too.

The issue is 4 years ago I attempted to move far away from home and where I went to high school to attend university and became awfully homesick. I put on easily 80+ pounds in weight (that I am currently in the midst of losing thanks r/loseit!), I would lie in my dorm room and cry all the time, barely left my room or went to class, felt worthless, lost all my confidence drank pretty much everyday until I blacked out, self harmed and tried to kill myself at one point. I wound up transferring to a different University in a city I'd went to highschool in, where all my friends lived, where my boyfriend lived and only a 30 minute train ride to my parents. As soon as I moved back I stopped feeling so awful and I've slowly been building up my confidence again. No one really knows how badly I suffered from homesickness apart from my boyfriend who I now live with.

I've came on so much since then and I'm now a very self confident, with a wide circle of friends, doing really well in my academics and I'm president of a few different clubs/teams at university.

However I'm so scared that if I move away I'll get homesick like I was before (I'm almost in tears thinking about it as I type this) - I know that this feeling might be silly because I am a very different person now than what I was 4 years ago so. I'm not sure going to counselling would be able to help me in anyway, and I really don't know if I should bother the Uni's counselling team and potentially take up a slot in their very busy time table.

What do you all think I should do?"

In all my internships I've been working at 110%, to the point of them telling me I should reduce my intensity. I'm not that intense because I have a passion for pharmacy, in fact my passion is towards effectiveness, knowledge, self improvement, competition and extreme emotions. 

The thing is I don't want to work for or with any of them. In the last years I learned to know myself and I know working in a hospital or a retail pharmacy won't be enough for me. 

In the last days, I met the vice-president of human ressources of one of the 3 biggest pharmaceutical companies and she asked me to send her my CV so she can start looking for something within her company.

Now, around November of 2013, I had the opportunity to work under a developer on the call center's internal application (This contained an employee schedule, employee reviews, and other vital apps that are more specific to what the call center is actually for). Soon after, the main developer got moved to a different project and I am managing this internal site as the sole developer. Keep in mind, my title is still as a Help Desk Technician and I still have responsibilities in the call center. ALSO, I really did not have the knowledge needed.  
  
I have learned a lot while working here (We use .NET, so a lot of C# and ASP.NET, as well as T-SQL. Also participated in a SCRUM team) and I literally started with only experience in HTML/CSS, JS, and some Java. However, it is starting to take its toll. I really need to focus on school, while they expect me to be at work 24/7 supporting the internal app. It causes a lot of stress and I am starting to get burned out in terms of development, to the point where I don't know if this is what I want to do as a career anymore.  
  
Would it hurt me in regards to future careers if I left this job to a less-demanding technical part-time? Or even a non-technical job?  
Of course, I still will be applying for relevant summer internships and working on side-projects. But will not having more of the real-world experience I am currently getting, hinder me a lot?

[Venting]",[deleted],getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/1z40c9/frustration_doubt_guilt_selfloathingmy_closest/,"I need to conversate with somebody about this shit. Only issue is, I already know I can't trust most of my friends with these conversations. I can count the people that would keep my secrets on one hand, and all but one would be hurt and offended by what I have to confide.

Where do I even begin?

My father is dying. He has had Hep-C for many years, and has already been through treatment for it. He was diagnosed with liver cancer a few years ago, chemo'd it to death, and now it's back. He's on a transplant list, and he's in good health now, but it's going to be an interesting year. His mother, my grandma, who I had grown up with and loved dearly, passed away from leukemia on new year's eve. He is not coping well with it.

Next comes the selfish bits. As much as the above torments me to think about, for some reason it's the things in my own life that have nothing to do with mortality that tears me apart each day. I have a girlfriend. She's fantastic, really, very kind, beautiful, caring...except, every time I look at her I feel nothing but guilt. You see, until last August, I had been dating a girl for four years and change, and I loved her with everything I had and then some. She cheated on me in the worst way, with one of my best friends, probably for months until I caught them. The day after I caught them, I fled to my parents' house to hide from my pain, and that fucking asshole spent that night with her in **my** bed. They are still together today. I went through a **very** dark time in the month or so after that.

Anyway, fast forward. It's been five months or so since then. I've been dating this wonderful girl for almost three of them. She was the first to say those three fucking words...and what do you do? How could I possibly have NOT said them back? I did. I still do. But I don't mean it.

I have lucid dreams. Almost every night. Every night I don't go to bed ridiculously stoned, at least. They are *always* about her. Not her, not the one I'm sleeping next to, the one I lost. The one who betrayed me. Sometimes I dream she's mine. Sometimes I dream of watching her and her boyfriend from afar. Sometimes I dream I'm begging her to take me back. But she is always there. I can't stand it. I wake up from these dreams sweating, or crying out, and my girlfriend always asks what's wrong, to which I can only say 'nothing' and wave her off. How could I possibly explain this to her? She would never understand. She would hate me. This is not an assumption; I know her well enough to know she would never forgive these feelings.

One more point of selfishness. I'm in school to become an electrical engineer. Junior college, on dying dad's dollar. I haven't had a job in three years or so. Internships and volunteer work, but no paid positions. He pays for my rent, tuition, bills, and books out of a fund he started some 30-odd years ago to pay for me to get a U.C. education. He still bugs me about going to a 'real' university and getting a bachelor's, and I always refuse him. Part of it is idealism, I really don't want to participate in the higher education system while it's gouging people for lifelong debt or massive amounts of family money. The other part is fear. I am so afraid that I am going to amount to nothing. I am afraid that this impossible frustration that lives inside of me is going to keep me from success. I think it likely that if I went and sat on somebody's couch long enough and talked all this out, I'd be prescribed anti-anxiety medication. I have panic attacks, and also something very much like them, but very much different, that I've taken to calling 'angst attacks', with the same shortness of breath and swimming vision and pulsating headache, except instead of a desire to cry I have a desire to do harm. I just want to destroy everything around me sometimes when I get like this. 'Manic' is an appropriate adjective. These bouts are always followed by a deep depression that will last a few days. I think the worst part about this is I've gotten *used to it.* I don't even see it as a problem anymore, just another part of me that I need to live with and get past.

I don't even know why I'm typing this. I don't know exactly how I got to this subreddit. I just know I need some help, but I don't want a professional, and I don't want any drugs, and I've lost all the friends I could truly confide in. TBH, I don't even care if no one sees this or responds. I just needed to type it out. I wish it made me feel better."

Currently I take care of preparing everything and I lead all of the classes while my mentor observes and provides feedback at the end of the lesson. The class I am having difficulty with is a Geometry Honors class. For what it's worth, I only have one Geometry period during the day.

The last few days have been slowly snowballing and I have been losing control of the class. I was never the most popular student in high school, so I have trouble when it comes to discipline because I value when the students are on my side and friendly. I do talk to students after class and threaten to call parents (and I will if it comes to it, but I have not needed to prove my threats are not hollow quite yet).

The last few days, students have been given an activity in groups with different parallelograms. There are five groups and each is using the vertices of their parallelogram to prove various properties (opposite sides congruent, etc I won't bore with the math). I have a hard time evaluating the students and getting a sense of if they are hearing what I am saying. This is also a concern that my mentor brought to my attention at the end of the day and to be honest, if she would not have done so I do not think I would have picked up on it. My mentor become a little frustrated during the lesson and admitted afterwards that she almost stepped in to corral and lead the class. This is something that I would like to avoid, because not only will I feel like absolute shit, I will lose authority in front of the students. This is a career path that I am taking very seriously, so I would like to improve on my adaptation skills.

The class itself loves to talk and joke around with friends (typical 10th grade boys -- did I mention its 100% male?) I am afraid that if I have a repeat tomorrow, that my fears will be realized.

Students have begun to share their findings when it comes to their parallelograms. We only got through one polygon, and even then the students were not paying attention and completing the guided assignment to go with the brief presentations. For tomorrow, not only do I want to effectively engage this group of students, I want to demonstrate to my mentor that I am capable of managing the class. For the long term, I will need to work on my own insecurities when it comes to friendship. But for now, I need advice on how to approach tomorrow's Geometry class.

My goals for the end of the 50 minute period is for each student to have written down the properties of each special quadrilateral, and to have experience working with these properties (through examples).

My first instinct is to have them work quietly for a day, but they won't stay quiet and if I do try to enforce a volume level, they will feel like they are being punished. My next idea is to do some sort of station activity, with different problems at the stations, but this is high risk high reward and can go either way. I definitely do not want to be at the front of the classroom lecturing tomorrow, because I have difficulties with recognizing when students are or aren't listening.

Please, any advice you have would be greatly appreciated. I love teaching and believe I can be successful at it, but I only have a few months left and at this rate, I don't think my mentor would consider me able to stand on my own two feet with this happening in Geometry, **especially** if it continues to snowball."
1z4nlv,2,2014-02-27,Which Job Should I Take?,mba7887,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1z4nlv/which_job_should_i_take/,"For the sake of this post, let us say my goal is to maximize the probability I get into the best (highest ranked) MBA program down the road. 

There are three jobs:

* Job A: College graduate rotational program at Fortune 10 company. The opportunity to stand out and visibility of the position are probably the lowest but the company has a ubiquitous global brand name. Program is selective.

* Job B: Entry-level position (analyst) at American subsidiary of global manufacturing company with revenue of approx. $7B. Opportunity to stand-out is high. Executive visibility and the ability to drive bottom-line results are high too. Opportunity for quick promotion is high.

* Job C: Business analyst role at boutique, industry-specific consulting firm (approx. 45 employees). Opportunity for quick promotion not high but executive visibility is. Role would be very technical and require learning some new skills.  Partners went to top 5 MBA program and 1 of whom thinks very highly of me.

In your opinion, how would you rank these jobs in terms of meeting my goal? Salaries are similar.

Other info:
Undergrad business degree from Big Ten business school (Think Penn St., OSU, Indiana, Wisconsin) with double major and 3.5 GPA

Three undergrad internships (2 at Fortune 500, 1 at non-profit)

Research experience, lots of volunteering, and lots of projects with companies in local area through college

Lacked undergrad leadership experience, my resume weakness

1z4ss0,1,2014-02-27,"Amazon internship offer last year, no interview this year?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1z4ss0/amazon_internship_offer_last_year_no_interview/,"Just a quick question --

I applied for an Amazon internship last year, passed their phone screen, and received an offer. I did not accept that offer at the time. This year, I applied for an internship with them back in January with the intention of interning there, but was declined an interview at all.

I understand there's some randomness in the hiring process, but I thought it was reasonable to assume that I would be interviewed again. Is there any way for me to find out what might have gone wrong, and what to do about it for next year or later full-time applications? Are there any particular reasons this might have occurred, or just bad luck?

I'm planning on moving next year from Vermont to Utah for an internship in Park City. I've started to look for places to live just to get the thought process rolling. Renting a place in Park City seems to be pretty expensive and I was wondering what the commute from SLC to PC is like. I'll most likely be interning at Canyons resort and figured i'd see what you locals think about the idea of driving from SLC to PC via I-80. I just want to keep my options open; I wouldn't mind living in SLC and commuting since SLC is a metropolitan area and I can find just about anything I would need there.

I've applied to loads of internships, followed up, but had no interviews or offers. This has me a bit nervous as it is almost March. So I was looking at possibly taking some summer classes so that I don't just waste away my summer.

Psych 1101

1z54cn,6,2014-02-27,Relationship Problems with Engineer Girlfriend,engineerblues,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1z54cn/relationship_problems_with_engineer_girlfriend/,"I know I may get a lot of hate from this, but it has just been something that was been troubling me somewhat.
My girlfriend and I have been going pretty steady for about 5 months now. We are both Freshman Mechanical Engineering students at a pretty decent size college. We get along great, have the same interests, and always have fun together. I love her, and she she loves me.

Now is where I am going to sound like a complete douche, so please bare with me.

I wouldn't call my girlfriend dumb at all, but she definitely does not seem to fit the Engineer stereotype, I see her as more a bio or med student. She is struggling with most of her math classes, and is a semester behind the curriculum. She even failed Calc 1 the first time she took it. I really try to help her whenever I can, and I honestly wish that she could understand this stuff better. I support her.

But recently, she is getting a whole bunch of opportunities that any engineer would love, thrown at her mainly because she is a girl. She was invited to join an all women stock car racing team and was promoted due to the lack of members, she has a female engineering 'mentor' who sends her resumes to a bunch of firms who are looking for female engineers.  She had three interviews for some very prestigious companies that would be a struggle for even a junior or senior to accomplish, she won a scholarship that is only available to female engineers, and she was selected to do research work with a women engineering society.

I am proud that she is getting all this great stuff, but I must admit I am pretty bitter that she is getting all of this while she is doing much worse in her classes than me. I’m not saying that I am a prodigy and she is a dunce, but I haven’t been able to get anything let alone people ask me if I want an internship. She even had to decline some! She tells me all of this while I am tutoring her in math! I don’t think she deserves all of it.
 I know I sound like a dick, but it is something that has been eating me up inside for a while now. How am I to deal with this? Will it change the further we go along with school (If she can maintain her degree)? I do care about her that is why I want some help with this issue. I am usually not a jealous guy, but with her being a constant reminder at how she gets all this stuff while I can’t, eventually gets to a guy. 

Thanks for any help, and try not to completely tear me a new one.

[Would you please give us your take on what actually happened during the 2008 Kanye fiasco?  Fingers have been pointed at Kanye, Bonnaroo, and Pearl Jam.  Is there one party that shoulders most of the blame or was it just a giant clusterfuck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqj2wy?context=5)|It was complicated and there's no reason to point fingers at anyone.  There are so many moving parts to the festival and, in this case, a bit of miscommunication and a sincere desire to come up with a solution simply didn't work out the way anyone wanted it to.  But we have all moved on. - AC.
[What do you do with all of the archived Bonnaroo footage of performances that is accumulated over the years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqi89c?context=5)|The stuff that we have not released sits in an archive. We hope we'll be able to release more and more of it over the years. In order for us to do so we have to have the cooperation of the artists and their labels / publishers. So it can be a challenge to get everybody on board. We've had success with partners like YouTube and this year, Xbox, to provide us with the resources to make it work for everybody. Fortunately, one of the benefits of producing the festival is that I do get copies of many of the recordings. I really wish it was easier for us to share all of this with you but you're welcome to come by my place any time and check out a set or two. - RF.
[Dinner party at rick's.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqkkfr?context=5)|First, who's bringing the guacamole? Second, who can help me with a pitch to my fiance that this is okay? - RF.
[As a big Kanye fan I'm pumped you're bringing him back but I'm curious, what made you guys want to bring him back? Did someone come in and say, ""Hey guys, let's bring Kanye back again"" and everyone was ready to go with it or was there a lot of skepticism? How did that whole process go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqio0t?context=5)|We started the discussion with Kanye well over a year ago. It was time to leave the past behind.  He's one of the major artists of our time..so there wasn't any skepticism from us and he was ready as well. We initially had some conversations about him doing something last year...a surprise show...totally out of the box. But it didn't quite work out.  The conversations continued however and now we're on for 2014.  But it wasn't forced.  It evolved pretty organically. - AC.
[Has anyone big every dropped out right before the lineup was released? And if so, what did you do about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqik1g?context=5)|Fortunately no. The closest thing to that was the Mumford &amp; Sons situation last year and we were really lucky Jack Johnson just happened to be coming to the festival to hang out. He stepped in last minute to save the day. It was one of the coolest things we've had an artist be willing to do for us. Jack is the man. - RF.
[I have never once seen a Comedy act at Bonnaroo due to not wanting to wait hours in line just for a ticket, only to have to come back and wait in line again to get in.  Are there any plans in the future to change the way the Comedy Tent is ticketed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqimr8?context=5)|I know it's not a perfect system but it's the best we've been able to come up with so far. The right environment for comedy is indoors and in a seated area and we're unable to make the tent any bigger.  Because of the demand of comedy at the festival and the space constraints we know that there's frequently going to be long lines to get into the tent. The system we developed was to help prevent people from having to wait in a long line without knowing if they were going to get in so we decided to give out tickets. We know one of the flaws is that people now line up earlier to get those tickets as they get released. We're totally open to suggestions and its one of the reasons we're doing this AMA tonight. - RF 
[Hey guys,  Thanks for giving me some of the best days/nights of my life!  With that out of the way, I was wondering how you go about setting up the superjams.  Do you have collaborations in mind or do you just contact whoever and let them run with it?  Also, any chance you can give us any hints on the ""?"" Superjam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqih4q?context=5)|The SuperJam is probably my favorite part of the festival but organizing it is one of the more challenging and stressful tasks. It does start with us thinking about what players we'd like to see perform together that never have. It usually starts with a core of one or two people like last year with Jim James and John Oates. Then we work with those artists to put the rest of the pieces together.  For the ""?"" SuperJam, it really is a question mark but we have a lot of interest from people that will at least hold par with what we've done in the past. It's frequent that some of them come together really late. Last year we didn't even know if the hip hop one was going to happen until about 2 weeks before the festival. It's a big commitment for the artist to make so it takes a lot of convincing. If you haven't seen the behind-the-scenes of last year's Rock and Soul SuperJam, it's pretty cool stuff: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtmuDXerkCWT5Jk3UtcYiZrhgj2eyVo) - RF.
[What's with the Julian Casablanca tease in BLAM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqj0ue?context=5)|Because Julian Casablancas is the coolest…  Plain and simple, we liked the joke.  With BLAM we're approaching the lineup announcement in a way that's never been done before. Part of that is experimentation.  We knew Taran had a funny take on Julian (whom we have nothing but respect for) and decided to give it a shot. We were well aware of the potential for confusion, we took the risk. We got a good laugh out of it, hopefully most of the community did as well. We see Bonnaroo as bigger than any year's single lineup - that's why you saw Ben Folds in the BLAM! SuperJam, though he's not booked for 2014.  Some will say the lineup announcement isn't the best place for that.  Maybe it isn't, maybe it is.  Regardless, we'll continue to take chances and experiment as we go. You're the coolest Casablancas!
[This year's Roo is the 13th Annual.  On Friday the 13th, during the 13th Annual Bonnaroo, there will be a full moon.  What I'm trying to get at is: Will Kanye turn into a werewolf?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqjyz9?context=5)|So you noticed?  It's also the birthday of North West.  The werewolf idea is a great one but one of our fellow co-founders may have beat him to it [Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/bonnaroo/photos/a.10151674287930906.1073741895.7891635905/10151674288285906/?type=1&amp;theater)
[Can you speak on how the artist selection process works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqiqzf?context=5)|Sure.  It can be a lot of fun.  There's a small group of us who get together at least once or twice a week and start brainstorming about who we would like to have perform at the festival.  We do research to see who's planning to tour, who has a new record or special project coming out...we have bands reaching out to us and we're making inquiries ourselves...we ask the fans what they would like to see...and we're very passionate music fans ourselves, so we have strong ideas of our own.  And we start to make decisions and gradually the line up starts to take shape. - AC.
[What has been the weirdest suggestion that the rest of the group just totally shot down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqkhzg?context=5)|I would love to answer this but I do not dare because it may ultimately happen!!! - AC.
[Thanks for doing this and for putting together the best festival in the country! What goodies are going to come with the tickets this year?  Also, what time is the Daft Punk secret set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqjxpi?context=5)|Daft Punk can play a secret set whenever they want...except during Kanye's set :)  There will be a nice surprise with your tickets but its a secret too! - AC.
[But wouldn't a secret Daft Punk show during Kanye be the best possible time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqn09s?context=5)|Hmmm... - AC.
[Who is your personal ""white whale"" of a musical act that you would love to book more than anything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqii4z?context=5)|Fortunately we've been able to get so many of our musical heroes to play. The first one we landed that was a ""I can't believe we're doing this"" kind of thing was Neil Young.  Having Phish was a huge deal personally because they were that transformative band for me. Some of the ones that come right to mind are Prince, U2, The Rolling Stones and… Beiber. More seriously though, there's some geeky jazz stuff like Gateway, anything with Jimmy Page, what else…? Lionel Richie is one that after seeing his show at Jazzfest in New Orleans a few years ago it became kind of a white whale get. - RF.
 |This is such a difficult question to answer.  Led Zeppelin still comes to mind...I haven't given up yet!  But also Prince and U2 are some of the big ones.  Bonnaroo has been an amazing ride in terms of opportunities to work with and present so many great artists that I love...from Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney to Ornette Coleman and Baaba Maal.  Some of my most unforgettable moments of Bonnaroo often take place on some of the smaller stages too and having the opportunity to introduce others to some wonderful surprises is a special pleasure for me.  And, yes, Daft Punk, too! - AC.
[Piggybacking off of this, will y'all have the same outdoors screen we enjoyed in 2010 for more World Cup action? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqjy3u?context=5)|You bet! - AC.
[Do you know (or care\) who ""Insider"" is?  Is it all part of your master plan to have her leak artists from the lineup beforehand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqjb17?context=5)|Who killed JFK? Where is Jimmy Hoffa buried? Did men really land on the moon? I am the walrus. - RF.
 |I have a sneaking suspicion it's CAPP DOGG but he's not admitting anything. - RF.
[Why do you all barely book any more jam bands at Bonnaroo? I feel as though the original crowd that enjoyed Bonnaroo has been pushed to the wayside. I saw Widespread Panic at Bonnaroo in 2002 and they absolutely melted my face off... same with Phish in 2009.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqiz2q?context=5)|We've always booked a diverse line up.Phish played in 2012 too.  This year we have Yonder Mountain, Umphrey's McGee, Tedeschi Trucks Band...off the top of my head. When we book our festival each year, our only goal is to keep it fresh and exciting. Music is continually transforming and reinventing itself - and the jam band scene has also evolved and transformed. It's one of the many things that makes music so powerful and exciting. We strive to ride the wave. - AC

The music business is very relationship based. You need to get out there, meet people, volunteer for street teams or festivals, introduce yourself, share your enthusiasm, not get easily discouraged, create opportunities, work hard, make yourself invaluable.  There's no clear path...you have to clear it yourself. But check out our internship program at [Link to welldunn.or](http://welldunn.or) too - AC.

[Hi there! What do you think of the scene now compared to the first few years?  Are you happy with the way it's progressed?  Do ever wish it was a little more of a Grateful Dead crowd?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqisuj?context=5)|We were definitely blessed at the beginning to have a instant community based on the jam scene that was part of the fabric of the first bunch of years. It's still really the core of the scene in many ways but of course like that scene ours has evolved over the years. I think over the last few years it's become even more positive and family-like.  Everything from the way people have embraced and live the Bonnaroovian Code to high fives at the arch to the missed connections stories that come out after the festival. Just like everything in the world, communities always evolve and change. I'm optimistic that Bonnaroo's culture will continue to be one of great positivity and inspiration. - RF.

[Good evening Guys,  I've been to every single bonnaroo, thank you for the lifetime of memories!  What can be done to ease the lines into centeroo?  I cursed your name several times while waiting for over an hour to get into centeroo, often times missing sets I was headed to.  A couple times last year, they simply let people walk through in mass because it was so backed up.  I understand that people would sneak in drinks, but considering the vehicle check when entering, it just seems that we are being held up for nothing.  All we want to do is see/hear the bands we paid to see, not wait in lines...  Maybe more entrances, or a more lax policy on checks?  Thank you, see you in June!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqkcma?context=5)|I don't blame you for being frustrated about this. I've been really disappointed in this myself, particularly the backup last year. It's something we can do better and we're working towards that. We assigned a team internally to focus on this. PArt of the problem is just sheer volume at those peak times when everyone wants to enter but we already have a few fixes we feel confident will improve the situation. - RF 
[How bad do you want Daft Punk and was it close at all this year? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqk6h1?context=5)|We would absolutely love to have Daft Punk play but since they aren't touring or doing any live shows yet I suppose it was really close this year.

[What's the biggest disaster or potential disaster you've ever faced with Bonnaroo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqijc0?context=5)|The main thing that comes to mind was when traffic was backed up 20 miles on the interstate the first year of the festival. We had major problems getting artists and equipment into the festival as a result. I remember a particular moment backstage where I though we completely messed up the whole thing and everyone was going to think it was a disaster. Luckily we had the best fans in the world. Everyone was patient. And it all ended up working out. It wasn't until Saturday night when Widespread Panic was playing and I ran into my brother who told me what an amazing time everyone was having that I realized it was going to be okay. Since then, luckily, we've been able to build the exit off the interstate and make tons of other traffic improvements that today result in very limited wait times. Probably no more than getting into the parking lot of an NFL game. - RF.
[Obviously the logistics of multiple stages can make balancing and mastering sound at each stage difficult.  Bearing that in mind, I think you guys largely do a great job.  However, for many years now, the general consensus has been that the audio at Which Stage tends to be too quiet, particularly for more acoustic-type shows.  Have you considered doing anything to combat this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqjnwr?context=5)|Thanks for recognizing the work we've done so far to make this the best it can be. It's one of the main challenges that festivals face and we put a lot of work into how we design the site to create the optimal sound conditions. We've gotten some of this feedback before. Personally, I've always experienced pretty good sound at the Which Stage. There have been some times when we've noticed the engineers that come with the bands have had challenges dialing in the best sound but the Which Stage sound system is more than adequate for that area. - RF.
[I've attended 10 bonnaroos, it is my only yearly vacation and my 10 year anniversary with the boyfriend. It is definitely the center of the universe and my soul craves it and Bonnaroo always delivers! I've noticed a huge difference in the crowd over the years. The vibe used to be way more positive, everyone picked up after themselves which was unbelievably clean after a show, etc... Thiis past year my cell phone got stolen out of my bag and the year before our cooking gear was stolen, this was never a threat before. It's becoming more of a spring break instead of how it used to be. Do you notice these same issues and will it ever be back to the way it was? Each year I feel less safe. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqkrz5?context=5)|Thanks for all your support. It's so awesome for us to hear about people who are as passionate about the festival as you are. Flattering to say the least. One of the reasons the Bonnaroovian Code was officially developed was to help instill in newcomers the ethos of the core scene that was there from the beginning. We hope you've seen some improvement in regards to the energy that many people bring to the event.  Hopefully over time and with the support of longtime festival-goers like yourself it will get better and better.  At the same time, Bonnaroo is, has been and always will be a big city and there are realities of big city life that even Bonnaroo can't escape. We encourage everyone to be mindful of their surroundings and belongings. If you see something that doesn't look right, say something to a Bonnaroo staff member. We've told them to be responsive to any tips that come their way. Like a good city manager, we are aware of the problems regarding theft and have been working with our security teams to do everything possible to at least limit them. We know that most of the thefts aren't actual Bonnaroo fans but usually opportunistic people from outside the community who prey on the festival. This is an area that local law enforcement has pledged to help us address and at least reduce these instances. - RF.

Thats why we're producing events instead of performing at them. We did some of this early on and continue to experiment with documentary-type content but a full look behind the curtain isn't something we're looking at right now. - RF

[Could you tell us more about the ""radius clause."" It's achieved near mythic proportions in forum talk.  Is it something that comes into play a lot for you guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1z4sjc/hey_reddit_its_ashley_capps_and_rick_farman/cfqm5wa?context=5)|Sure.  Radius clauses are common.  For festivals and also sometimes for stand alone concerts (although usually that isn't an issue).  A radius clause basically restricts when and where an artist can play in relation to a booking.  A promoter or a festival are usually guaranteeing an artist a certain fee and incurring a lot of expenses to produce their show.  They want to protect their investment.  Plus a festival hopes to have a unique character and draw from a wider geographic base.  So that's why radius clauses exist.  Beyond that, it's a negotiation. - AC.

Discussions with headliners sometimes span years before they actually play the festival.  We first met with Radiohead's team in 2003 but they didn't play until 2006 due to their schedule.  Our initial conversations with Paul McCartney's team were in 2007.  There's a lot of scheduling to coordinate sometimes.  We're already working on 2015 and beyond. - AC.

My three partners and I - Jon, Rich, Kerry - drove up from New Orleans where we were living at the time to check it out. Pretty instantly we knew this was the place. It's incredible for us to think about now because we had no idea what we were doing. We'd never put on a show beyond a 3,000 capacity theatre show and had no real idea of what a good festival site looked like. Then we had some of the staff we had hired to work on the event, guys who had worked on the big Phish festivals, come check it out, they confirmed it was a great place. It's home for us now. - RF

1z59a6,5,2014-02-27,Need to vent (warning: wall of text),nmom_throwaway,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1z59a6/need_to_vent_warning_wall_of_text/,"I have a huge test tomorrow, and I can't get out of my own head, so I just wanted to vent a little and maybe seek some advice. I apologize for the Great Wall of Text below, but I wanted to include the context for everything instead of just putting it all in a list. I also apologize if it's somewhat incoherent, this is probably the fastest I've ever typed in my life, and I've never been good at writing.

I'm a 20 year old male, and I have two younger sisters (19 and 14).

2009

My sophomore year in HS. Things were good (or at least stable). My dad had a high paying job, and my mother was able to stay home. In late 2009, my dad quit his job because it was stressing him out too much and he had major disagreements with his business partner on how to run the business. My dad's family had a history of heart problems, so it was good for him to not be in a stressful environment anymore. I trusted that he had planned for this and knew what he was doing. I was so relieved to see him lighten up a bit and be able to spend more time with my sisters and I. Regardless of the financial difficulties that followed, I was so glad to have my dad be a big part of my life, whereas before he wasn't.

Him quitting his job is really what my mother points to as the cause of this family turmoil, but she's the only one spewing hate and acting crazy. I think my dad, my sisters and I have handled the situation pretty well.

2011

Financially, things started to get pretty tight. My mother began to leave the house late at night without telling anyone where she was going. That in itself may not seem wierd, but before the financial issues she never did this. If we asked, she usually gave us bullshit answers; ""I'm going to get coffee with a friend"". Really? At 11:30 at night? This continued for months. Around the same time she blocked my dad on Facebook and began to publicly post blatant lies about him, trying to make him look like a monster. She claimed he was an addict, a narcissist, that he was having an affair, that he was a closet homosexual. You name it, she posted it, for me and my sisters, and all our family friends to see. As you can imagine, this alienated and angered my sisters and I very much.

One night she left, and posted on Facebook that she was going to jump off a bridge, and that her children don't love her anymore. My sisters and I tried calling her countless times, no answer. My dad called the police and left the house to go look for her. She finally returned hours later with no explanation. We have a big fight, and at the end of the night nothing is resolved.

Not too long after that, she totaled her car in a head on collision driving back from drinking at a bar. The tests showed there was alcohol in her system, just below the legal limit, so she was free to go. She admitted she had a drinking problem and apologized for her behavior, but I knew nothing was going to change. She continued to drink and run off late at night.

At this point I'd had enough of being lied to, and I felt I had to act to protect my dad and my sisters. I installed a keylogger on her computer, not knowing what I was going to find. I struggled with the guilt of this decision afterwards, but in the moment it felt like the only thing I could do to fight back. To put it bluntly, I discovered she was having affairs with several men, who were giving her money and flying her across the country to meet (she told us she was visiting her cousin). It didn't come as too much of a surprise, at that point I knew my parents marriage was a sham. I sat on this information for a while, then decided I should let my dad know. He handled it well, and told me he had talked to his lawyer and had divorce papers prepared, which I was relieved to hear.

When my dad confronted her about this, she accepted no responsibility, claiming it was him that pushed her to do these things.

As always, she doesn't hold herself accountable for anything she's done, and she is always the victim.

2012

My dad starts working in a warehouse to make ends meet. I'm still living at home, now going to engineering school full time. A year after the day she totaled her car, she was arrested for DUI. My dad bailed her out, but her license is suspended. A short time after she got her license back my youngest sister told my dad she found empty wine coolers in her car when she picked her up from school. My dad got a court order filed removing her from the house, and she went to live with her friend. When she left, I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I no longer felt like a prisoner in my own house.

Mother gets a job as a physical therapist, the same job she had before she had kids.

In the fall I moved into an apartment near campus, and all the drama seems to die down.

2013

Dad landed a job with an investment firm, just like his old job, which meant a little more income, but he was behind on mortgage payments and bills for repairs on the house. Mother got fired from her job for showing up to work drunk. Coworker kicked her out. My dad allowed her to move back in under the condition that she find another job and helps with bills. She moved back in and found another PT job. The drinking continued, and over time she slowly stopped helping with the bills. My parents declare bankruptcy.

I moved back in at the beginning of the fall semester, and started helping my dad with my meager income from my internship. I avoided contact with my mother, which usually meant staying in my room all day.

2014

Last week was my dads birthday, and my grandmother sent him a birthday card with some cash in it (to help with our bills). It either got lost in the mail, or someone else took it, because it never arrived. I can't prove it but I'm certain it was mother. This monday, my sister caught mother going through my dads office, rifling through his personal things, looking for god knows what. Yesterday, my dad met with a member of his church, who showed him a prayer request they recieved sunday. The prayer request (which is supposed to be anonymous), stated my dads full name, was from my mother, and was asking for prayers to ""soften my husbands heart"" and ""help him forgive himself for having an affair with another church member"".  It was pretty obvious this was not a genuine request, but just another attempt to make my father look like a monster.

To top it all off, our house goes to auction in two weeks. I'm not too concerned with that to be honest, I'm more concerned about my sisters and how mother is affecting them.

I'm just so tired of her playing these games. She acts like she's the only one suffering as a result of the financial issues. She's constantly texting me passive aggressive things that she would never say to my face. I could probably fill a book with all the malicious things she says and does. I'm pretty sure she talks badly about my dad to every person she knows. Just today she was talking to someone about the house and started listing everything that needed to be repaired and blaming my dad for not getting it fixed. It's like she's trying to retroactively justify her actions by making my dad look like a terrible husband. I have no idea how many people now think badly of my dad because of her.

It has become damn near impossible for me to empathize with her, because I've seen how she tries to manipulate my dad, and I can't shake the feeling she's doing it to me too. I can't take anything she says seriously, because she never stops lying. She tells different lies to me and each of my sisters, and it's pretty obvious she is just playing games with us. I can't relax around her.

All of this has had a pretty negative impact on me. I'm pretty shy and introverted, but in the last year I've found myself preferring to be alone more and more. I'm still going to school, but when I go to class I try to avoid talking to my classmates. I just can't seem to talk properly around people. My words just come out in a big jumbled mess (probably like this post), and I end up sounding like a fool, so I tend to just isolate myself. I didn't have this problem before all this, and it's so frustrating because I just want to be normal and have a social life. I can't for sure say she's the one that has caused this change. I've been told I exhibit some symptoms of autism, so that may be the underlying cause. If that's the case I can see how this experience might have made it worse.

I can't help but feel like I'm overreacting, but I really do wish I never had to see her again.

Right now I'm just trying to figure out what to do. I don't want her in my life anymore, but I don't know how to go about achieving that. If I'm upfront with her I'm afraid she'll just play the victim and deny everything. I don't think I can just cut off communication either, because she will use the same tactics she uses against my dad, i.e. telling everyone she knows that I'm a terrible person.

Oh and I guess I should ask... Does this sound like narcissistic behavior? I stumbled upon this sub a while ago and can relate to a lot of the posts, but I'm not 100% sure if this is the right place to post this.

I already feel a lot better having written all this down."
1z5bg2,1,2014-02-27,A few questions and advice requests for a freshman in community college for Computer Science,Evenger14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1z5bg2/a_few_questions_and_advice_requests_for_a/,"I'm currently in my first semester in a CC for a CS degree, after two years here I will transfer to a University, if I can ever figure out which one. I do have some questions regarding a future in CS and what I should do now to better prepare myself.


First of all a little summary about me: I'm 17 (18 this year) and for lack of a better phrase, I didn't have my shit together. I had no idea what I wanted to go to college for, and so I never really did anything to better prepare myself. I was homeschooled, and got my GED right after I turned 17 and didn't go straight to college, instead I worked for 6 months or so part time not really doing anything. I have no personal projects like people say you should have, such as a phone app or something. Something to put on your resume to show you have initiative, well my problem is that I'm just now learning programming through www.codeacademy.com I'm just now learning the basics of JS, but I'm working on it every day. 
    

I'm behind in math, mostly because I never applied myself, but I'm taking extra classes during this summer for it and I'm working as hard as I can to advance myself in it, though I've a ways to go.
    

I do currently have a 3.6GPA, though it's only been 8 weeks and it's on the rise.
    
    
**Now that you know that little bit about me, time for the questions:**
    

I've not yet met with a career counselor though I plan to sometime soon. After looking through some of the different job types available to someone with a CS degree (http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report-2013/computer-science-and-math-jobs) I feel a little overwhelmed. What are some of the job fields you guys are in, and what can you tell me about your personal experience with them?
    

I don't know what languages I should be focusing on learning, like I said right now I'm learning JS, about 25% through the Code Academy course, and I've piddled in the HTML course on CA. Am I on the right track? If not what languages should I focus on? 
    

What types of projects can you recommend I do?
    

Internships. What can you tell me about them, and what should I plan on doing to prepare for them? I live in a small town area where there aren't any opportunities for internships in this field, the few companies that have a requirement for CS people want experienced people, not interns. If I can find a good paying internship somewhere else over the summer, would it be worth renting an apartment for the time I'd be there? Is it even worth bothering with internships during the first two years of college?
    


TL;DR: Ultimately what can you suggest to me to better prepare myself for my future?"
1z5kcx,1,2014-02-27,The Journey Thus Far (Part 2),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1z5kcx/the_journey_thus_far_part_2/,"Alright, so if you were brave enough to wade through the entirety of [part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1z5exu/the_journey_thus_far_part_1/) of this post you know that my life is a bit crazy.  For part 2 I will carry on from where I left off.

Here we go. Remember we left of with Gary and I deciding to move back to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

We lived at his parent’s house for a bit, and I was quite uncomfortable with that.  Gary and I were drinking a lot after the move.  We were out every night it seemed, and I was getting no where in a job search. The fighting that we were famous for just got worse and worse.  I was tired of being with him.  The relationship started to go south.  I had heard that an old friend was in town, and had recently bought another go-go club.  He was looking for a manager to manage the place.  I needed out of the house so I took the opportunity.  He kind of took me under his wing a bit.  This was the start of a crazy friendship.  We will call him Vinny, he was a big Italian guy who like to dabble in men. He was a crude but somehow charming guy, he was loud, did not mind cursing whenever where ever, and he loved to throw his money around like it was no one’s business.  I and he had actually met while I was working in the go-go club with Aaron Tyler years back.  He was kind of an asshole to me then, and I had got into a fight or two with him while I was dating Dale.  Actually he really came to respect me the night we both got very wasted in the VIP area and we got into an all-out fist fight.  I suppose i was one of the few people that actually stood up to him.  I held my ground and he seemed to respect that a lot.  I began to work for him managing the night club.  I was also starting to become kind of his personal assistant.  He would fly me back and forth from Lauderdale to Cincinnati to help him bid on construction jobs.  His main business which was pulling in a solid million or so a year was a demolition company that specialized in department stores.  Anyway, we became close.  I was also in charge of hiring workers for the go-go bar, houseboys to clean the homes we were staying in, and workers for the demolition company.  Oh, and just to add to the crazy of the situation Vinny owned a pet chimp named Chloe.  She hated me and would often rush me.  She was very protective of Vinny, and I supposed she saw how well I and he got along.  (I really hated that monkey (she hated me calling her a monkey...lol))

All of this goes without saying that I was drifting further and further from Gary.  Any spark that was ever there was completely gone.  I was traveling a lot and I had no time.  One day I decided that enough was enough. I was going to break it off.  I called Gary from Cinci to talk.  He did not take it well, and I had to go get my stuff.  By this point I was a bit upset, break ups are never easy.  I hoped a plane to Lauderdale to pack up my things and call it done.  On the flight I thought long and hard about my life. What was I doing with myself? Why did I keep getting myself into crazy situations? At that moment I decided it was all enough.  That flight was the day that the poles reversed, everything was about to change. 

After the flight back to finalize the break up I flew back up to Cinci.  I was a bit emotional; I could feel the switch in my mind.  I was ready to go back, and say fuck it all.  That is exactly what I did I rented a car and drove back to Vinny’s house in Cinci.  I walked into his house and packed up my things.  I told him sorry, but it was my time to go.  So I left, kind of concluding that chapter in my life.

I moved back home with no real plan. This was about the end of 2010 by the way.  Almost four years since I had first left school and moved all around the east coast. I stayed at my mother’s house for a few weeks, went on a few real dates.  A few months pass and I met someone.  I met the person who I am still with today.  I’ll just call him Trevor.  We took things slow in the beginning, but eventually started back at my old university.  I was going to finish this time, but I was still dealing with that issue that stretched back through my time at college, what the hell was I doing there?  I was still registered as an Interior Design Major, and I now had no interest.  I tried to stick with the program for another year and a half.  In this time I had added an International Business Minor.  I was finally finding what I love, and that was business.  Over the next year or so I tacked on a Marketing Major, and eventually dropped the Interior Design program all together.  I had met someone who I now consider my closest friend. He helped me to further find my place in the business school, and was able to help me leave the Interior Design program in the past.  By this time I really loved business, I loved thinking about it, studying it, and applying it through a number of internships.  I eventually found a way to dual major in Marketing and Management with a concentration in Entrepreneurship.  

I will finally be graduating this coming summer.  I feel comfortable where I am today, but I am still very terrified about what comes next.  I have considered doing an MBA program for a few years, or going straight to work.  I suppose it is a big choice and it freaks me out.  Sometimes I feel like I still have trust issues from all of those guys in my past, and it’s hard for me to really know what the correct path that I should peruse is.  I have made a ton of mistakes, but looking back those mistakes gave me some of the most exciting experiences of my life...  

I so guess that is it and maybe one day there will be something exciting for part 3...

1z5myc,5,2014-02-28,How do I standout and score an internship as a mediocre Junior/3rd year petroleum engineering student?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1z5myc/how_do_i_standout_and_score_an_internship_as_a/,"Hey guys, I know we get a lot of posts about internships but since there's a lot of people in my situation it might be helpful for everyone to get a thread going on the subject.

So far in college/university I have not participated actively in any club/society or made any friendships with professors. My grade is about 68 but I know I can increase it to 70+ semester (we don't have a GPA system). Fortunately, a 75+average is pretty rare (top 10%ish) but unfortunately many people also have the same mark as me. This semester I've joined the formula SAE team to get some engineering related experience and will actively participate in that but some internship openings have already begun so I'm not sure if I should apply now or wait till I start getting things to write on my resume. Everyone says to apply early to get a chance. Another major sticking point is references: should I ask professors that I know will recognize me for references? Should I approach professors for subjects I got my highest grades in if I don't know them too well? I could also put in the formula SAE team leader as a reference but I don't really know him - but I am planning to develop a good relationship to get a good reference. The only thing is the timing - should I apply for internships now or wait to develop a solid relationship with referees and then apply with good references? Also how many references should I put down? As a side note I've had a job before I don't want to put any references with them because I wasn't particularly good at the job (I got fired).

I feel like having a good cover letter is particularly important (is it?) but as a Junior I don't exactly have any outstanding technical knowledge in the field to flaunt - how do I standout from other interns? All I can think of is listing a generic skill set like being a hard working guy. How do I convey my passion for petroleum engineering without being too unconventional? Should I be unconventional? Would anybody be willing to post cover letters they've written to help secure an internship?

Also, for my resume should I mention anything achieved in high school? I received a lot of awards academically back then. Also won a trophy for my sport 5 years back - is it worth putting that in? Should I put in computing languages I know - writing in HTML, Latex, basic CSS and Visual Basic?"

I am feeling so f-ing depressed right now, probably the worst I have ever felt. I am a 21 y/o university student and I was doing ok academically up until this semester. Now the depression is really bad and I am really struggling academically. I am either unmotivated to do classwork or when I do classwork I somehow mistakenly f--- up. It doesn't help either that I am anxious about my immediate and long-term future.

In terms of my immediate future I have been trying to find something to do in the summer. I have lined up a handful of things. The one interview I have gotten so far I placed out b/c I looked like a fool b/c of stammering speech impediment. I really don't think I'll hear back from the other places and I have been looking for alternatives but so far absolutely nothing I found appeals to me. Meanwhile, I watch as everyone else I know gets awesome paid internships as I am still stuck with my crappy minimum wage part time school job.

My longterm future I feel like I want to be a minister or theologian but I am so messed up IDK if I'll be good for it and my family would react badly if I told them. Also, what if that ideas falls through? I have no other ideas or career goals.

I honestly have almost no self-esteem or confidence b/c I watch everyone else around me excel while my whole life I have struggled to mediocrity. I have had to watch everyone be better at me at almost everything while I sit here, lonely, single, and unmotivated.

It probably also doesn't help that I will never get to be with the woman from my home state I am infatuated with as she got engaged and is getting married soon. I know she will never feel the same way about me.

Moreover my mom seem's to not understand how I feel and my best-friend seems to presume I will just get over it (and I get the impression he is annoyed by my constant sadness).

I think that is everything. Basically I feel like a lonely, incompetent fuck up."

I really need some advice right now, I have been struggling with various things for a while but I would like some advice on how I should continue school.

Right now im in a third year math major while minoring who chose to minor in computer science, and I can't seem to get great grades. My average is roughly in the c area, and I'm scared that my grades will hold me back in obtaining internships . 

I discovered that I really like computer science, and am fascinated with the idea that I can create something of my own, and share it with the rest of the world. However, I feel so behind compared with many students doing just computer science. It takes me a while to understand code, and I usually have to write it down on paper for it to make sense. I especially feel intimidated when in group projects, mainly because everyone is more knowledgable than me. This kills my confidence and makes me contribute less to my group because I don't want to say stupid things and be percieved as the one bringing the group down.

As for my math classes, I could be doing much better if I studied harder, but I feel less motivated to do well in those courses because I want to go into a software career.

So, if anyone has advice on how I can become a better computer scientist, and bring up my grades I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!

TLDR: suck at programming/ don't know enough. Confidence and grades hitting a new low."
1z6hi3,11,2014-02-28,"Beginner here, finished my first project! I want to know how experienced programmers think I did, and I'm looking for guidance on how to improve!",chrisvanr,learnjavascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1z6hi3/beginner_here_finished_my_first_project_i_want_to/,"Hi /r/learnjavascript! 

I started out an intern at a small design shop and over the last few years, the scope of my activities crept towards web development. I never had any real formal training in this but still I found myself making and adjusting themes for Wordpress, Magento and another custom-made CMS for clients as a full-time job. 

I picked up HTML/CSS as I went along quickly enough, but I never had the time or opportunity to properly learn a programming language as JS or PHP. Deadlines were always an issue and I heavily relied on Google, StackOverflow, and tons of scripts and plugins and retrofitting other people's code without knowing how it worked.

I had a big gap in my knowledge for the field I'm in and that had to change! So I decided to start with Javascript. I started out with codecademy, and worked through all the assignments. 

Then I decided it was time to build a little project for myself. I tried studying some JS books after finishing codecademy and there is a ton of material online, but I never felt like it 'clicked' and stuck in my head. I wanted to get my hands dirty and build something. 

It's a card game that is played in my family for as long as I can remember. Nobody on the internet seems to agree on the rules so here's our version of it. It started out as a few little prototypes, little ideas that sprung from codecademy lessons like, how would I build a card deck in JS, and how would I display the cards, and how would I shuffle the deck, etc. I used a little jQuery on the side as I had a little experience with that. 

[So here it is: Farmer's Bridge v0.1!](http://codepen.io/chrisvanr/pen/yKuHr)

So yeah its not an actual game as you're currently pretending to be all 4 players, but I that is the next step! I want to build this into a multiplayer game, and perhaps add the ability to add an AI player? Those would be formidable goals to work towards. 

I feel like I learned a great deal. It feels really good that I was able to set myself a goal, and complete it. I wondered if I could simulate the rules of this game in javascript, and I feel like I did an ok job! 

However, as I did this on my own I'm certain that there's a lot of beginner mistakes that you can catch! The downside of learning alone is there is no teacher that can point these out for me. So I hope that you guys can point me in the right direction. What can I improve? What best-practices should I adhere to more? What things did I make that I could've gone about in a better way? 

The next step for me is to completely refactor this code, and make more use of Objects and methods, and learn more Object Oriented Programming. I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around this, however. Codecademy introduces a few concepts, and before I started building this I decided I wanted to start this out as an OOP project but it didn't quite click for me yet, so I built it in a more straightforward way. Sometimes I get tired of reading and studying and I really wanted to build and finish something. So how do I start with OOP? How do I transform my imperative code into Object based code?

Meanwhile, I've made a github account and have decided to learn git alongside this. 

Eventually, I intend to use node.js &amp; sockets.io and transform this game into an actual multiplayer game! 
I've looked at nodeschool and learnyounode, however that made me feel kind of stupid. I had an extremely hard time figuring out the assignments and understanding what it even was that they wanted me to do! What do I need to learn first to be able to do node? "

I live in MA. The company I worked at in MA was purchased by this company in Florida and they hired me (seeing as I was one of the only two employees left). This company seems to think I am valuable enough to fly me back and forth. I have been doing this for 7 months now. It appears that the senior management appreciate me presences but my direct colleagues feel otherwise. I cannot pinpoint why my colleagues remain distant from me but it is enraging. I feel as if I have no hope of changing the situation.

I feel disrespected, ostracized, undervalued, and alone. I was hired on at the lowest possible title without my knowledge and they practically treat me like a fresh out of college half intern. (I have 10 years experience in my field and have taken senior roles before). Had I known these people cared so directly about titles I would not have allowed this, but let me tell you, every problem I am having is related to culture differences. Are all Floridians this self centered, belligerent, disrespectful, and most importantly close minded? I have felt more rage in the last 6 months that I have in the last 6 years. I often day dream about flipping tables and calling out to these shitholes just how bad they are at cleaning themselves. 

And the kicker is, I haven't come out to them yet (and still waiting on hormones :\). I keep trying to find where my breaking point is to say ""enough is enough"" and just leave. So far, I am so invested in the idea of ""succeeding"" before I leave that I can't do that yet. However I need to do something to get back at these people. I've tried many a thing to show them that I have all this experience, and skills, and valid opinions, but they refuse. So here is my idea:

I am going to come out, and just all of a sudden start presenting as poorly as I can. Just to fuck with them. To come in with half male half female clothing with a stuffed bra and use my poorest high pitched voice to make it as uncomfortable for them as possible. I don't care if that makes it worse for me, at least I am doing something to make them feel bad. If they do real shit to me, I might be able to get back at them legally. The important thing to recognize here is that I don't need this job, I could leave and find something else back in MA and be so much happier.

What do you think?

1z6li4,137,2014-02-28,[B/S] Sex in Europe,[deleted],incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/1z6li4/bs_sex_in_europe/,"I’ve been reading this sub a bit (throwaway account obviously) and decided to share an encounter between me and my sister, let’s call her Alex. I wanted to provide you guys with details, so sorry if it seems like I’m rambling at times.

Okay well, where to begin...

My sister Alex is about 2 years older than me. I recall when we were younger, my friends always wanted to come over and play video games when she was around. They would also joke about how hot she was, and ask me if they could come with me to watch her field hockey games (like really guys?). I took the hint. I always tried to act like I was pissed off at their comments and remain ignorant to the fact, but deep down inside it got the best of me. I saw my sister as attractive and when I became older I would occasionally masturbate to mental images of her, secretly hoping she would come in by accident and help me finish up (that obviously never happened).

Fast forward a couple of years, I graduated from college and wanted to take a year or two off to travel the world before heading back to school. At the time I was 21 and my sister was in France with an internship experience. I hadn’t see her for a few months so I decided it would be a good idea to pay visit her across the channel (I was in London at the time).

So we skyped and picked a date when she was free and agreed to meet up in Strasbourg. When I arrived to the city she met me at this restaurant with a couple of friends she knew and gave me a big hug. We chatted and I got to eat this regional dish called “baeckoff”.... I digress. 

My sister wasn’t actually residing in that city so we needed a place to crash for the night. Being two cash strapped young adults, I booked a bed for us at hostel because they’re very affordable.

The receptionist asked us if we wanted to reserve another bed, and she seemed concerned that my sister wasn’t going to sleep on the girl’s floor (they separated guests by gender). Unfortunately we didn’t have enough money to get a 2nd bed and buy train tickets back. I convinced her that one bed was fine. Up a flight of stairs we arrived to our room. When we got there 2 dudes were already making themselves at home. One was from Canada and told us he loved to travel, the other guy was from Germany and I could tell he was eying my sister down the whole time so I didn’t care for him as much. 

Nightfall came and we started bar hopping with the same friends as earlier. The first place had some quality beer (mainly from Germany). At the 2nd bar, I could tell my sister was visibly tipsy and trying to hit on her French friend. Yet, I wasn’t really helping her by joking that she was a lightweight (the sibling competition coaxed her to prove me wrong by ordering another pint). As the night dragged on her friends ditched us to go smoking, so the two of us went to another bar without them. The place was a small English-themed club in what appeared to be a cave. Despite being hammered I remembered a shot of whatever was 7 euros to which I protested (yet still purchased). The atmosphere was great, the music loud and almost everyone was on their feet dancing.

After a few more drinks, Alex and I began flirting with each other, we danced close and rubbed our bodies together. Overall, I was getting kind of horny being around her and all these foreign women. Despite all the alcohol, I noticed this one dude would keep going towards Alex and she would kind of scurry away from him and come back to me. He was persistent; clearly she wasn’t interested in dancing with him. She looked at me with that sad puppy dog face I would receive when she wanted me to do something. So I did something.

“Hey man, back off my sister,"" I said.

He ignored me (or probably didn’t speak English), so I said it in French.

“Nique ta mère,” he responded. (fuck your mom).

I exchanged some words with him and an argument ensued to the point where some employees had to kick us all out. I didn’t give a fuck; we left.

Yet, I remember in the wake of being extremely pissed off, Alex managed to cool me down. 

“Thanks for standing up for me,” she said. 

Alex sure knew how to make a shitty situation feel better. I put my arm around her and she let out a slight giggle which made me smile. At this time we were both pretty smashed so it was a unanimous decision to just head back to the hostel and call it a night rather than find her friends again.

Eventually we made it back to our room after stumbling through some long streets. Our Canadian roommate was still missing, but the German one was fast asleep.

Without disturbing him, we got ready for bed. I used the bathroom and started brushing my teeth, but Alex urgently knocked on the door and said she wanted to change so I hurried out. Probably because of extreme drunkenness, Alex didn’t completely close the bathroom door. From the bed, I got a glimpse of her boobs as she took off her bra and put on a tee shirt. It was the first time I could remember seeing her naked (I never accidentally walked in on her or anything).

She came out of bathroom only in her panties and a tee shirt. Her excuse was that she didn’t pack any pajamas. I didn’t mind.

“Oh I forgot to tell you, I sleep in the buff,” I joked.

“Ew! I hope you’re kidding.”

“Get in bed, you’ll find out,”

She laughed, turned out the remaining lights and slid under the covers after a bit of hesitation from my joke. As she got into the bed, I turned myself towards the wall and placed my back towards her. Seeing my sister in her underwear was getting me hard, but I didn’t want my cock to rub up against her and freak her out.

She started talking about how fun our night was and shit like that, and started playing with my hair. I turned away from the wall and faced her because isn’t that how people talk... face to face? She thanked me again for protecting her from that drunk dude.

“He really wanted your ass,” I said and I would never forget what she said next:

“Yeah, but guess who I’m in bed with at the end of the night.”

She then leaned forward to give me a hug however stopped dead in her tracks as her leg grazed my hard dick.

That following split second was a crescendo of “what the fuck just happened”, anxiety, and utter confusion. She pulled away from me.

“What was that?”

My mind raced to find an excuse.

“Sorry, my knee got in the way.”

1z76q4,7,2014-02-28,I [24 M] need a little advice on how to invite a crush to a coffee date. My social skills suck.,throwawaythegarbagem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1z76q4/i_24_m_need_a_little_advice_on_how_to_invite_a/,"TL;DR: Want to invite crush to coffee date, but I don't know how to go about doing it

Let me begin by saying that in most social groups, with my friends/co-workers, what have you, I'm actually pretty lively and talkative.

The moment I lay eyes on someone that I am potentially attracted to, I instantly transport myself all the way back to Junior High School where I had no social skills whatsoever.

My problem is, I went in to get Lasik done yesterday and I met a young intern there, who we'll call ""S"". She was there to observe the procedure and look at my eyes and whatnot. I couldn't help but want to get to know her better.
Problem is, I don't know how to do that. I was too shy to ask her in front of everyone else in the room to have some coffee/tea with me, and I don't know how else I should go about asking.

I've considered calling up the office asking one of the receptionist to ask her for me(since I don't have any more appointments there), but that just seems...desperate. 
The other part of my brain says just drop it, but I really want to see if there would be something there.

What do you think? Should I pursue asking her out on a coffee date? And if so, how?"
1z7elc,7,2014-02-28,At what point do I give up on this dream?,sadmagic,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1z7elc/at_what_point_do_i_give_up_on_this_dream/,"So here's the story:

I've been a musician for most of my life, and upon realizing that there was little to no money for most people in playing music, I decided doing the behind the scenes business for music was the safest bet.  So I went to college for it, and graduated.

Before I got out in my senior year internship I got hired on at a small agency in town doing a bit of everything but primarily radio promotion, social media marketing strategies, band management, and publishing.  Needless to say I was very excited to get this job.

Fast forward two years to now.  When I joined on I got $8 an hour (the person before me here was getting $10 an hour but had much more experience.)  Boss said when I graduate I would get a raise.  Now I can't tell you how many times he said I would get a raise, but I haven't gotten one.  Not one bonus, not one raise, in two years.  No vacation time, no benefits, I'm an independent contractor so my boss doesn't have to give me benefits or deal with my taxes.  I also get paid late just about every time.

This week I have a multitude of bills due, my boss is going out of town to Florida for two weeks with his family on vacation - he told me today (the day he's leaving) that he would have to pay me on Tuesday.  So I get to sit here and worry about making rent while he enjoys the beach.

So obviously I've been looking for other work, but there are absolutely no jobs in my field around here, and I've been looking nearly every day for more or less the entire time I've been here.  It's at the point (and has been for a while) that I need something else, I have two years of experience now and it's time to go.

Now I could get a decent job outside my field but here's the real kicker.  Back home (about 4 hours away) my dad is a small business owner.  He owns 6 of them.  I have a guaranteed spot on when/if I come back, and will end up owning these businesses if I choose to.

I don't want to get a job outside my field here because I can't figure out why I should stay here working a job I hate making only OK money when I could go home where my friends and family are and make a very comfortable living working for/with my dad.

My parents seem to think I should stick it out, they seem to think I would be giving up on my dreams too easily but doing PR work for a hospital is not my dream (job listing I saw yesterday, one of the only ones that even looked remotely interesting.)

So my question to you all is what should I do? What would you do?  The town the businesses are in is a very small sleepy town, but I love to get outdoors and there is are tons of activities to keep me occupied and I'm not really a let's go clubbing person anyway.

Thanks in advance for those of you who got through this wall of text."

Okay, I'm getting interviewed for an entry level SEO Specialist position in E-commerce. Keep in mind while reading this that I actually don't have much E-commerce seo experience. I had a variety of different types of fields I have done SEO for, but never e-commmerce. 

I have a ton of internship experience in the marketing field. The last two internships I had was predominantly SEO. I would say my knowledge of SEO is pretty high. I'm confident I can do a full site SEO audit, keyword research, some advanced seo strategies, competitive research and I know most of the best practices of onsite and off site SEO. ETC
- I probably have built thousands of backlinks from a variety of different websites. 
- Created changes to tons of content to make it SEO friendly. 
- Keyword optimized tons of meta descriptions, h1 tags, page titles, etc...
- Ranking reports, Analytic reports, on site reports, etc..

Some SEO tools that I am familiar with:

- Google Analytics
- Google Webmasters Tool
- SEO Powersuite
- Buzzfeed
- gshifts 
- PR Status bar
- Mozbar for DA/PA and links
- SEO quake for SERPS
- Open Site Explorer/ Ahrefs
- SEM Rush
- Scrapebox
- Screaming Frog
- GT Metrix
- Some blackhat tools I won't mention
- And probably some other tools I forgot about

I should probably also mention that I have other marketing skills such as :

- Social Media Marketing
- Lead Generation
- Some E-mail Marketing
- Some Adwords
- Some digital advertising
- Content Marketing
- Some other stuff

I also should mention that I'm able to create a brand new wordpress website with a theme, and fix and edit minor HTML/CSS issues. With the knowledge of knowing what plugins to also implement. 

Also, for the purposes of judging how much I'm worth please assume I don't have much experience in other marketing fields. Assume lower than what you perceive in the things I have experience with in the SEO field. 

Also, you can ask me any question you need if you can't give me a fair assessment. 

Thank you if you took the time to read all that, I would appreciate some feedback!
