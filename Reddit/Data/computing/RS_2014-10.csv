[drunk][probably not sexy]",VagabondofFunk,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2hy1vq/in_which_i_recall_both_a_memory_of_my_childhood/,"I grew up in rural Utah. I attended a private school until I was 9 years old, a school all the liberal parents sent their kids to in order to keep them from being in the public schools, which were terrible. I met a girl who loved horses but had never ridden one. I invited her to come over and learn. I had horses and she was gorgeous, it seemed like the right move. She had no idea what she was doing, and I had grown up with these horses so I assumed everyone knew how to ride. She walked around the riding area several times before I encouraged her to try and get the horse to trot. She made it to the far end of the ring before the jostling became too much, and she dropped the reins and shrieked. The horse reared, she fell into the fence and I ran across the arena to make sure she was all right. She had cut her head at the temple, which I carefully daubed with my pocket hankie. The cut was not deep, and she wasn't crying, though her face was flushed and she had a hard time standing up without help. Together we limped across the arena, the barnyard, the back yard, and the carport to get her safely into the bathroom where she felt perfectly capable of cleaning and dressing her own injuries. My mother called hers while I was out gathering up the horse and putting him away, so by the time I returned, she had already been collected and taken away. I felt pretty sad as I tucked myself into bed that night, quite sure I'd ruined our friendship somehow, let alone any chance I might have with her.

Our friendship was not ruined, though she expressed many times that she was uninterested in me either romantically or sexually.

Until after I left the military many years later. We were still friends, we hung out most nights of the week, and when one of us was having a particularly bad day, the other would bring them a case of beer or a bottle of something harder and help finish it off before the sun came up.

She had lost the prestigious internship she'd spent six weeks working for, she'd dumped her boyfriend, and she had to ask her father for money in order to pay rent. I was wallowing in the recent failure of my own relationship and had been informed that morning that my car's engine block had cracked, and I would be walking to school from then on.

I gathered the requisite materials for our night of drunken commiseration. A new bottle of rum, a flask of scotch, and three bottles left over from failed binges in the past. Barely more than a few ounces in each. She arrived with more alcohol, a shopping bag of it. Apparently we were going to be profoundly drunk until the following Sunday.

We played music, drank heavily, and talked about how someday we'd be happily ensconced in dream homes, with dream partners, dream jobs, and dream kids. Then she was sitting on my lap, kissing me. I didn't complain.

To provide a coherent narrative would be intellectually dishonest of me. I don't remember what happened, blow by blow. I remember scenes, snapshots, moments of emotional resonance. I remember asking her if she was certain this wasn't just alcohol, and being reassured that she was acting on feeling long buried. 

Then her face, millimeters away, her breath on my neck as she laid her body on top of mine. She asked me if she was too heavy, and I chuckled. The buzzing sensation of being drunk was filling my entire body, and even if she weighed more than a buck twenty, it was absurd to think she was smothering me. I remember laughing and laughing as she pressed against me.

I remember realizing how drunk I was, just as she began to undress. Her shirt hit the floor and I remember thinking, ""She's really nervous, don't be an asshole. Say something nice about her boobs when she finishes with that bra."" She looked at me, a normally fierce woman, an ardent political activist, and a wickedly smart social manipulator. But she was seriously nervous sitting on the end of my mattress. I struggled not to sit there like the profoundly drunken dick I was and the haze of whiskey finally parted to allow me one single word. I chose ""Wow"".

We had sex, it was okay. After more than ten years longing to touch someone and have them reciprocate your affections, a drunken tryst in a literal loft apartment is a little disappointing.

But after we were done, as she lay next to me, she whispered, ""You know, you're the first person to ever give me an orgasm?""

I felt pretty damn good. What an ego boost. She continued.

""Do you remember back at Sunset?""

I allowed that I did remember the school we attended together.

""Do you remember inviting me to your house to learn to ride horses?""

I assented again.

""I didn't fall off the horse because I was scared of it running. I fell because I came.""

I didn't need any explanation, I understood all the implications of what she'd just said. The shriek, the flushed face, the trouble walking.

""Did you cum tonight?""

""No, I think we're too drunk for that.""

""Yeah."""

I might work in one of six locations; the location with the most available positions is the Puget Sound option. I have had a dream for a few years now to move to either Oregon or Washington, so I'm super excited to spend a summer in Seattle!

That being said, I don't really know much about Seattle except for the stereotypes. I hear it is really left-leaning/liberal, which I really like since I'm left-leaning and grew up in the Bible belt. Do you think Seattle is pretty? What is the difference between Puget Sound and Seattle? Also, if you worked at that particular Boeing, how did you like it?

I'm curious as well about the downtown life in the area. Is there any sort of night life there and how would you rate it? Any anecdotes or personal suggestions on places to visit are welcome!

Thanks in advance!"

Any pro tips for trying to land interviews?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2hyegj/im_meeting_with_a_bunch_of_recruiters_tomorrow/,"This will be my first time meeting with recruiters. I've had jobs in the past, but none that I would be seriously scrutinized for; nothing that would be related to my career (computer science). I've been pretty nervous about this for a while now, because I need to land an internship in order to get my degree.

In particular, I'm nervous about how to handle the issue of my GPA. My parents both died before I started university, so I've been working minimum wage jobs and whatnot in order to put myself through school (and food on the table). Thus, I haven't been able to put as much time into schoolwork as I would like. My GPA is only a 2.5. My reference list is also limited to just one person, my last boss.

I'm confident in my skills and abilities (in computer science), but I can only talk about that so much before I just get the door shut in my face for not having a 3.0 (the standard advertised minimum for most companies).

Apart from that, what else can/should I do that will help me land interviews? I've got the basics down, like dressing properly, having a proofread resume (by a professor), and so on, but as I've never been formally interviewed or vetted for an interview, I really don't know what to expect.

I really appreciate any advice."

2hymad,2,2014-10-01,A letter to the Reynoldsburg Board of Education from a Voice in the crowd,tyedyehippy,Ohio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/2hymad/a_letter_to_the_reynoldsburg_board_of_education/,"Board of Education – I didn’t plan on writing to you. Parents want me to speak out to reporters and the community in public. Students have turned to me for answers on what to do and wear for school. I was there when our teachers voted to strike, and have been allowed to visit them on the lines every day since by my parents. With that being said, I’m not writing on behalf of myself, or my fellow seniors and students, or parents, or teachers. I’m writing for everyone. Just a voice in the crowd.


My father grew up in Reynoldsburg and attended Reynoldsburg cities schools and is a graduate of ’82. I have an older brother who also went through the school system and graduated in class of ’08. I’m a thriving RHS Senior. I have been in the Reynoldsburg school system since first grade. I have attended Graham Road Elementary under (principal); Hannah Aston Middle School under (principal); Baldwin Road Junior High under (principal); Reynoldsburg High School – eSTEM Academy under (principal) and currently Scott Bennett. I have three younger sisters who are also attending schools in our district; one who is a sophomore at Reynoldsburg High School – Bell Early College Academy under Erica Dodson; one who is currently a sixth grader attending Baldwin Road Junior High – eSTEM Academy under Michelle Watts; and one who is just a third grader at Summit Road Elementary – eSTEM School under Melissa Drury.


I’m a 4.0 student, Captain of the Lady Raiders Varsity Soccer Team, Leo Club President, Raiderthon Director, Tactical Lead of Technical Difficulties, but I’m also a younger sister, a big sister times three, a daughter, a student, a friend, an intern, a neighbor, a soon to be graduate and adult, and a community member. A community member who will act by greeting others I meet with acts of friendliness and kindness, taking responsibility for my own actions and how they affect the people and environment around me, being truthful and honest to myself and others in all that I say and do as a sign of respect for myself and others, treating all persons in ways that I would like them to treat me, and recognizing that each person is different and has an individual contribution to make to the community (these points are bulleted on our School website if you didn’t know).
After everything I’ve written so far, do you know who I am? I’m a Reynoldsburg Raider.


I have (my elementary teachers) and the rest of the Graham Road Staff to thank for everything they did to help me get through elementary school, get my hand print on the wall (which is located in the glass hallway, next to my cousins and above each of my sisters), and for becoming a Raider.


I have (my middle school teachers) and the rest of the Hannah Ashton Staff to thank for preparing me for the tougher classes I was about to face in Junior High, finding my passion for books while being a Library Helper, and helping find the inner Rowdy Raider I am.


I have (my junoir high school teachers) and the rest of the Baldwin Road Staff to thank for everything they taught me, preparing me for High School, letting me hit them with dodgeballs in the annual game of Students vs Teachers, and teaching me the Raider values.


I have (my high school teachers), Coach Arp, Coach P, and the rest of the Summit Campus Staff to thank for my High School career, teaching me life lessons as well as textbook lessons, teaching me integrity, preparing me for the rest of my future education (where ever I may end up), and showing me what being Raider means.


Last but not least, I have the Reynoldsburg Education Association to thank for taking a stand against you. We need this settled fairly. We need compromise and collaboration. We need you to get us our teachers back.


On our school website, it is stressed that…
The Reynoldsburg City School District delivers an innovative, high-quality and cost-effective education to all students. Schools provide hands-on learning experiences in highly personalized environments. Academic programs focus on growing sectors like science, technology, engineering and math while providing a well-rounded curriculum including educational basics along with arts and citizenship. Strong partnerships with universities, healthcare institutions, local and state government agencies and businesses enhance student learning.


It is also stated that…
Reynoldsburg teachers and staff go above and beyond for students and their families. Staff members stay on top of educational innovations, attracting educators from across Ohio to Reynoldsburg to see what's happening in our classrooms. Reynoldsburg employees are passionate about education and focus on every student's success.


And that…
To ensure that every child achieves and progresses by: Customizing education for every student, Developing innovative solutions in curriculum, instruction and assessment to ensure students acquire 21st century skills and knowledge, Having students demonstrate the acquisition of skills in critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving, use of emerging technologies, global awareness and communication, and Rethinking school design to meet today's demand.


Along with…
To ensure a safe, nurturing, healthy school environment by: Creating personalized schools in which students are known, trusted, empowered, connected and honored, Meeting individual student needs with all appropriate and available resources, Maintaining safety in all facilities, Effectively communicating with students, staff, families and community members, and Engaging parents and community members in school decisions and activities.


All I have to say about these direct quotes is that you, our Board of Education, and Superintendent, Tina Thomas-Manning, have not been honoring what our district promises. You need our teachers behind their desks in order to keep these promises and we need our teachers in front of our desks in order to succeed.


To this you may say, “You don’t need a body in front of you, you have computers,” but a computer can’t replace a teacher. A computer can’t teach us how to write while using voice, or have discussions over the Scarlet Letter or Enders Game. A computer can’t help us look in a microscope, or walk out to the wetlands in boots that are two sizes too big. A computer can’t make us sing songs about the quadratic formula for memorization, or stay after school hours with us to give us extra help or retake a test we bombed. A computer can’t demonstrate how bad it was in the trenches during WW1 in our classrooms, or further explain the US government by holding elections and roll playing Congress. We need our teachers back.


A computer can’t conduct a band, orchestra, or choir. A computer can’t do the Spark Pledge, or any of the specialized acts our teachers do to engage students during class. A computer can’t coach on any field, court, track, course, or pool. A computer can’t help us build a robot late into the night during build season. A computer can’t advise clubs like NHS, Leo Club, etc… A computer can’t chaperone a school dance, or organize powder puff football activities. A computer can’t support its students at extra curriculum activities, or take selfies with students at sports events. We need our teachers back.


A computer can’t teach us right from wrong, or pat us on the back for achieving and hug us when we’re in a slump. A computer can’t stand in as a reference on a resume, or write us recommendation letters. A computer can’t hand us our diplomas; can’t hand me my diploma. A computer can’t replace a teacher; can’t replace any teacher. We need our teachers back.


I’m not begging, I’m telling. From 12 years of experience in this school district; I would not be the younger sister, the big sister times three, the daughter, the student, the friend, the intern, the neighbor, the soon to be graduate and adult, the community member, the leader, and the Raider I am today without the great people who have taught me, who teach me this semester, and who will teach me second semester. 

I’m not begging, I’m telling. From 12 years of experience in this school district; you need to walk into that room today, with listening ears, collaborating mouths, compassionate hearts, and your minds on the students’ needs. 

I’m not begging, I’m telling. From 12 years of experience in this school district you need to come to a compromise with our teachers. Our teachers are more than teachers to us. They are friends, mentors, people who we laugh with, who we make memories with. I need my teachers. My sisters need their teachers. My friends need their teachers. Future students need our teachers. You need our teachers. We need our teachers.


We need our teachers back – A voice in the crowd."
2hyq9m,1,2014-10-01,Industry research on grad school apps?,Roboneuron,neuroscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/2hyq9m/industry_research_on_grad_school_apps/,"Hi all, 
Sorry to be bothering you with another grad school question. I am doing undergraduate research in a neuroscience lab now which I intend to stick with this school year and next. I will be doing a 5th year masters degree in AI in a second lab and will start that summer after graduation. My 3rd big research project/ recommendation for my PhD apps is going to have to be this upcoming summer then (going into senior year). Financially I would really really like to take an industry internship, ideally doing biotech or AI research. However, I don't want this to mess up my chances of getting into a good neuroscience PhD program straight from my masters. So, does industry research look substantially worse on a grad school app than academic research? Will it hurt to do too much computational stuff if I am applying to a neuroscience program that leans more heavily towards biology? Would it be absolutely awful to take a high paying software engineering job this summer and only have 2 true research recs? My goal is to hone both computational and biological skill sets and then combine them in my research, but I'm not sure I will reach the ideal combination point before I have to apply to grad school. Thanks so much!

TL;DR- How much worse is industry research experience on a graduate school app as compared to academic research experience? What about straight up software engineering?"
2hyvcd,3,2014-10-01,I think life is too much for me and it's time for me to let go.,engineerwithinsomnia,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hyvcd/i_think_life_is_too_much_for_me_and_its_time_for/,"Btw, sorry mods if this post is inappropriate for this subreddit, but I felt I had too much baggage in mind to not put it here.  The alternative subreddit was /r/SuicideWatch, but gosh the posting titles are depressing.  

TL;DR I fucked up, life is making it worse, going to lose the only friend I have left, and I think it's time for me to let go of life.  

So it's 12:46 am as I start typing this. I just took two melatonin tablets, so my writing might get screwy, but here goes.  I'm 23, born in an estranged Chinese family with an older brother who can be a bit of a hard-ass, wasted four years of my life to get an engineering degree, jobless for the second time, haven't slept well for months, and tired of being alive.  

I have always just blamed God for not making my life better, but who am I kidding.  I made my own mistakes, so I have no one else to blame but myself.  I know I have failed myself and my parents by not being able to support myself in the first place or otherwise I wouldn't be here living in my parents' filthy and disorganized house, sitting in my bedroom writing this reddit post.  I mean I don't know what I was thinking becoming a Chemical Engineer.  Was it because of money?  I mean I was probably naive back then thinking money would bring me somewhere away from my parents considering how much they piss me off with their arguing and nonsense, yet here I am back to square one.  

So you can probably decipher from the title that I might be suffering from depression and, admittedly, I have episodes of it.  There are days when I'm all fine and dandy, then the next day I'm in ground zero waiting for life to end.  I mean suicide is a possibility and I've had moments to almost achieve that. So what's stopping me then?  Well, there are a couple of friends I have in the world who I actually care about, but there is only one friend who actually cared about me.  Let's name her Monique.  

Maybe I got the ranting trait from my mom because she does that a lot, but when I rant to Monique, she was willing to listen to my conversations.  We used to go out for movies, she would invite me out for lunches/dinners and we always had our share of moments.  *(Someone will think we're dating, but she currently has a boyfriend of four years.  On top of that, I would probably be the last person you would want to date.  Anyways, back to the topic at hand.)*  However, lifestyles can make people change and this is where things turned around for us.  My lifestyle went from getting fired from my coop, graduating below my goal of 3.0 average, and doing a summer internship twice for the same company (imagine the embarrassment of meeting my old coworkers who thought I would have found a job between the eight months).  My friend on the other hand did a coop, graduated, and ended up getting hired right after to work for the same company.  Our two different paths resulted in distancing ourselves more and more to the point that we almost never meet anymore.  

When I had my summer job, I couldn't ask for a better job and wished it could turn into a full-time position, but it never happened.  I guess despite my lack of a social life, having a job gave me a reason to get up in the morning and do useful stuff for once.  Now that I'm jobless for the second time, the depression is starting to kick back into action again.  

My parents realize how much I am a failure compared to my successful brother, who has a full-time career (which he secretly hates) and a girlfriend (who can be weird sometimes).  My parents now want me to go back to school to study forensics to become a ""forensic scientist like CSI"" (I know, the show over-exaggerates a bit on reality).  I'm divided on this notion just because maybe this will be a better path for me or it could bring me back to the square one again for the second time.  On top of that, where would I find the financial backing to pay for the education considering my mom is already $100K in debt and I doubt my dad will even consider paying for it?  And do I seriously need two degrees to get through life on my own?  However, there is still one straw left that would have to break my back and it would be if I also lose my friendship with Monique.  I realized my rants can sometimes be much and despite her patience, she probably has a limit too.  Today, I ranted to her about what I just wrote above and am afraid that the next time I chat with her, there won't be a response.  I decided to give it a week before I respond back to her and this time actually talk like a normal person rather than some maniac desperate for answers.  

So what would be the consequence if I did commit suicide? Well, my parents would probably ball their eyes out, especially my mom, but I know that they'll get over it because they always have my brother as their ""replacement"".  My friends/acquaintances will probably feel sorry about it, but will forget about it in probably a day or two.  For Monique, she'll be spending maybe a week regretting that she could have done something to prevent it, but her boyfriend will always be there to comfort her.  So in other words, there's probably not much consequences I can see from here and not much to lose.  

Have any life advice reddit to change my mind/perspective?  

I took my third melatonin (max intake according to prescription) and still not feeling tired, so I'll just lay my head down for now and see if I can actually sleep.  Also, screw me because I have to get up early in the morning.  

...and I just heard doors creaking in the hallway. Either it's my dad or ghosts. Whelp, guess it's time for /r/nosleep.  "

I need help.,Radicalnesss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hyxfm/i_21m_got_very_sick_and_my_gf_21f_left_me_at_my/,"There are kind of two sides to my issue here so I’ll try to focus on the relationship problem and steer away from the health problems as much as I can since I'm here for the relationship part.

Last spring, one of my roommates found my in my room in the middle of an extreme seizure. I had no previous history of seizures or serious health issues. Several more seizures later, an ambulance ride, Life Flight helicopter ride and two days later, I woke up in a hospital. My GF, I’ll call her “Mia”, was the first person I saw when I woke up.

She was smiling, but I didn’t know why because I could tell something was very wrong. That’s what I was thinking as I drifted back into unconsciousness.

Over the next few days I learned I had been diagnosed with viral encephalitis. This means a virus found its way to my brain causing it to become inflamed and causing brain damage. At first I could barely think or walk as my brain had essentially “reset.”

Over the next several months, I suffered through symptoms such as extreme anxiety and depression, a constant fogginess/daze, headaches, insomnia, trouble thinking and concentrating on top of being forced to medically withdraw from school, losing both my jobs, my family being forced to move from their home with no place to really go (I was staying with them as I “recovered”) and some serious problems related to prescription meds that were supposed to be helping me. I cried almost every day over the summer as I was overwhelmed by everything and powerless to do anything about it.

The one thing I had through all this was my amazing Mia. I was shutting everyone else out. But in the middle of the summer, she started to feel more distant. I didn’t know what to do or think because I was already somewhat of a mental and emotional mess through everything that was happening and Mia had been my rock through everything. 

A couple things you should know about Mia is a very needy and lovey girl. She joked about eloping, her friends told me to marry her and she loved me and treated me like no other girl ever had over the five months we had been together.

Then one day out of the blue she said she needed a break. She was having troubles at her internship, needed to find a job to get her work visa (I’m from the US, she’s not) among other things. But she never hinted that she had any problems with me.

Apparently during my illness and host of problems, she was driven away from me by my “complaining” as I was falling more in love with her and needing her. I was trying to give her space when she needed it and helping her through her problems as well but she wouldn't let me help her, lied to me, and stopped loving me when I needed her most. I was surprised because she had always seemed like she loved me more than I loved her.

But instead of loving me, I just became a problem to her.
Mia leaving me was almost the last straw in a life that had gone to complete hell. Before all this mess I was a good athlete, honors student in college and had no debt and great jobs. Now I was a shell of my former self and I was honestly suicidal, although I never attempted to kill myself.

At first, although I was completely broken, I sort of understood why she left me at my worst, but as time went on I was growing to hate her. Then, about a month later, she invited me over for dinner and we had an extremely honest and good talk. At this point, I’m doing a little better physically and mentally and trying to get back into work and school (I have never returned to 100 percent health-wise to this day though).

After the talk, she started messaging me a lot and even asked to hang out at our local farmer’s market a couple times. I knew this was a bad idea because there was no way I wouldn't get hurt again even if I tried. And sure enough, one day we got into an argument and it ended with her saying some extremely hurtful words about me just “looking for sympathy” and her never wanting to talk to me again.

Queue restarting my heart again. As if I haven’t learned anything by now, about a month later Mia invited me to a party via Facebook. Against my better judgment I went.

Her new house was in a weird alleyway and it was dark as I was a couple hours late to the party. I called her because I needed her to come outside so I knew which house was hers. We were alone in the alley when I came up and the first thing she did was throw herself in my arms.

She was extremely drunk and she just kept saying “I’m sorry for everything I did”, “please forgive me”, “are you still mine?” etc. etc. Then she made out with me, held my hand and hugged me as I’m struggling to think of things to say and how to respond.

Later, we all ended up out at the club, and in between me sitting and chatting with some of our mutual friends, she would come up and hold my hand, ask me to kiss her when nobody was looking and she even grabbed my crotch a couple times.

Her friends walked her home that night. Then next day, she texted me in the morning and after a long conversation, she said she “wanted me to forget everything and just be friends”.

The next weekend she messaged me asking if I was going to go out. I ended up at the same club as her again and afterwards a group of us went to get some food. I saw a friend I knew and he came over to talk to me. A couple minutes later, him and Mia are flirting…which led to making out…which led to them holding hands and going back to her place to potentially have sex and all this is happening right in front of me and her roommate.

On top of all this, the one other girl who I’ve really loved in my life cheated on me several years ago and I’m already a shy and quiet person when it comes to women. Now, on top of my health issues, I just don’t know what to do.

Half of me wants to take advantage of my last bit of college and try to meet more people and have fun and the other half of me wants to hide away and never talk to another girl again in my life.

I’m physically and mentally broken and I feel like I’m one more incident away from another complete breakdown. I had been completely open with her and she completely betrayed me at my lowest only to stab me in the heart multiple times since then.

I’m afraid I’m never going to be able to have a normal loving relationship and I don’t think I’ll be able to be open with people anytime soon.

A couple days ago, she invited me to another party, this time a birthday party for one of her friends. I really like her friend and like to socialize but I’m afraid I’m too fragile and I’m afraid I’ll be hurt somehow again although I don’t think there’s anything else she could really do to me at this point.

What do I do? Do I go to the party and try to just ignore her and have fun? Act like nothing is wrong now?

And how do I avoid these horrible situations when in future relationships? I don’t think all women are evil or anything like that, but the two women I’ve loved the most turned out to completely destroy me and I don’t know if I can take it again, but at the same time I don’t know if I can handle living in loneliness forever either. HELP.

---   
**tl;dr**: I’ve been completely crushed by my ex who left me in the middle of everything going wrong in my life from failing health to losing jobs. She then proceeded to make things worse afterwards. I need help learning how to trust again and knowing how to handle our “friendship” as I can’t totally avoid her in this small college town."

2hz1rg,1,2014-10-01,20 [F4F] Internet - Shy girl looking for a cutie and a bestie XD,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/2hz1rg/20_f4f_internet_shy_girl_looking_for_a_cutie_and/,"Hi ladies!

I need a cool girl to be my best-friend and girlfriend, I would love to cuddle XD.

Before I say anything I must make it clear that I have a boyfriend. I'm looking for a girl who is OK with that and willing to be a part of MY open relationship. He isn't going to be involved, but you must be OK with my man knowing and being in the same room with me when we voice chat or something. We are in an open relationship and hes OK with me having someone of my own. So please don't try to take him away from me or down talk him. :D

I found out that I was newly bisexual after posting and lurking on Reddit and loving what other woman look like or say to me. I decided it was a good idea to just go ahead and do it! :D You will be my first girl! I have no experience online dating or being the leader when it comes to dating. I have never experienced anything sexual or romantic with a female either. I have little to no female friends at the moment so it really sucks. BLEH. I have little to no contact with females, so I really want to have a connection with a girl my age or older. :P

I'm an avid PC gamer, (WOOO) and I would love it if you were too. I love to play games like WoW and LoL, but I have a bunch of other titles and I'm always willing to try other things. I love shooter and any games with zombies. I LOVE zombie games. My boyfriend is very close to me when I game, so if we get to playing and you hear him yell or laugh and if your OK with it we can play with him too. I'm a nerd at heart and I love to read as well. Since I was a little girl I have always loved Harry Potter and other fantasy stories. Right now I love the Hunger Games and anything with vampires or zombies, I also love post apocalyptic stores and films.

I LOVE music. I absolutely love heavy metal. XD I go to concerts when ever I can. I love numerous bands with Machine Head, In Flames, Trivium, and Rammstein when it comes to metal. I also enjoy EDM and dubstep. I also like acoustic rock, and love songs and the occasional pop or hip hop music.

Appearance wise I am a Caucasian blonde curly haired cutie. I'm fairly chubby and short with large breasts and a big butt :D (I was told that I should include that ?) I've been told that I'm super sweet and kind. I have strong opinions, but I accept other peoples ideas. I'm very intelligent and would love for you to be too. I'm currently a college student studying finance and have a internship in a finance department. I love numbers and real life problem solving. (Nerd alert) Sometimes I can be pretty boring and spacey, just pick my brain to find something fun! I LOVE to chat. I'm super shy and not a horndog, but open sexually if it comes to that. I'm not a prude either. I have my own cute little dog and cat and love kids.

I live on the border between Iowa and Nebraska in the US and my timezone is Central US (CST). I'm available sometimes when I'm at work to chat occasionally, but I don't get home from class and work until 9PM and many nights I will be doing homework late into the night, so don't be supprised if I disappear :/ I would LOVE for you to be available on the weekends, especially the evenings so we can chat or play games or something. Please don't be one of those woman who are scared to talk to me or that disappear and don't make me feel like I'm not around.

For what I am looking in a woman is similar to me. Intelligent, a gamer who is willing to go out of the way to play with me once in awhile :D, a nerd or geek, and open sexually. I'm looking for someone who isn't super skinny, because I am not. :D Preferably white or Asian. And you need to be feminine like me. I LOVE long hair. I also love boobies and butts :P I want you to be OK with my man. Please be clean and drug free or at least don't talk to me about them. (They gross me out.) I don't need a single woman, but I don't want you to have tons of online relationships either, I want to feel special.Please be between the ages of ( 19-25). I'd love to laugh with you and discuss anything. I'm very open sexually and I hope you are too. I don't mind much personality wise, just don't be pushy and please be interested. I just want a cute girl to be romantic with and maybe someday love. I want someone who I can send pictures to of clothes, outfits and dorky faces too. I love to be told I'm cute, beautiful, dorky, or even sexy.

I really want a new best friend, a girlfriend, and someone fun! I'll be your cutie!

Sorry for the long dry read its just everything I need to say! PM me if interested. I'm OK with trading pics and I'll trade chat info and name after we get talking. Serious offers only. NO MEN!

2hz7c9,1,2014-10-01,"Me [21M] with my (Ex)girlfriend [18F] for 2,5 years, cheated multiple times, always lied to me, still in my head..",VDorst,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hz7c9/me_21m_with_my_exgirlfriend_18f_for_25_years/,"Hey there,

Edit: I tried to make it more readable..but I just started using Reddit..Apologies!

First off, I'm not native English, so watch the grammar :)

**Main characters: Vincent (that's me), my girlfriend (Demi), one of my closest friends (Michel).**

When I was younger (end of 2011)I realised my life was a piece of shit and searched for help. I realised i had a gaming addiction (no details needed, it was just gross). My family helped me with everything they could (financial, living at home, distraction). After four solid months and help from a psychiatre I decided for myself i could live proper again and keep my gaming addiction under control. I still had long hair, insecurity and felt fat.




A month after I quit rehab I took a haircut (short hair), new cool glasses, went to the gym and my confidence had a huge boost. Still socially awkward, but i didnt felt insecure again! I felt AMAZING!



That same period I started working again at the supermarkt I live closeby, worked a year earlier there before I had a downfall, so they were glad to offer me the job again (hard and dedicated worker). A week later there was a new employee hired. The boss asked me to become her coach and before I met her personally I said yes.


One week later she begins her first day..There she was..never seen such a gorgeous person in my life! I was astonished, couldn't talk for shit and nervous as hell..but she laughed it off and made me feel great...We started talking and when Queen's Day arrived (Netherlands) we went together and my friend confessed to her that I liked her..that's basically how we started going out together.




A month later I went to her house for the first time..she didn't want me to see her house, and I didn't know why.. When I walked through the front door I realised why.. There was dog poo everywhere, mice under the kitchen, filthy pots and pans everywhere..it was the scariest and filthiest house I have ever seen in my life (including television shows and in games). I still believe today that there is no house so disgusting as that..Her mother is like a boar..she treated her kids (my GF + 3 other children) like shit, never bought food so they ate at other people or had to buy their own, no clean towels, no clean beds NOTHING! They had to do it themselves..Demi almost died once because she started to get sick and her mom just knocked it off..but apparently she had diabetes and her sister called the hospital when Demi started to faint out..if she called one hour later Demi would be dead.. The nights I sleeped in her bed I always got sick or got an infection on my body from flees or other filthy creatures/bacteries..so I hope you got a good image of her life situation..




The issue was that everytime Jeugdzorg (the Dutch ""child abuse agency?"") was signaled about the filth she made her children clean the house and Jeugdzorg said it was ""good enough for the children"". Somehow she always knew when Jeugdzorg came for an sudden inspection. Thats how they lived for 1.5 years longer and in october last year Jeugdzorg finally saw what really was going in and the children went to a foster family (good friends of her father).




When she started living with their foster family I realised she was more broken and damaged then I thought she was from her youth. She always acted tough and nothing was a big deal, I always tried to break down her wall and slept every night at her place to make her feel more safe, she was always scared her mom would kill her with a kitchen knife. So I stayed awake until she fell asleep so I know she would be more at ease. With every noise or crack in the house I jumped out of bed so I could check on the house, her little brother and little sisters.


Until she went to the foster family..she was more damaged as I thought.even though I was almost every minute of my free time with her (besides our work and college). When I was with her I was the best person in her life, but when I wasn't around i realised she talked shit about me! She cheated on my three times before she moved out, but I asked for full stories and said everytime it was okay and understood her situation..


October 2013, she and her brother and sisters moved to the foster family. From that point on she started to ignore me. She never asked how my day was or how I felt about her doing stuff..she started working every day and night so she didnt had any free time for me anymore..the time she was off i was DEMANDED to keep that time for her, else she'd get mad as hell..She only wanted me for sex or when their was a problem with her foster parents (Sort of Clash of the titans), because she had to follow rules now and she used to do everything she want. 


To keep it short here is a timeline of the events of our relationship.


**May 2012**: Started dating




**August 2012**: I ""caught"" her talking to an other guy, not like I usually care..dont get jealous fast..but they had talk about sex and what they would do to each other..All I did was crying (just got clean of my gaming addiction and a few months later my dream wife does this?!) and she apologised and it would never happen again.




**Januari 2013**: We had our first huge fight and we had to work the day after our fight and we didn't spoke to each other (breathing space). After work a random douchebag picked her up with his scooter and brought her home. Her mom (first time useful) told me she was making out with him at the doorstep. I asked Demi if it was true and she said yes. Because ""it was my fault we had a fight"" (it was always my falt). She apologised, we had make-up sex..and w were back together again..




**June 2013**: She went out with her friends (she likes to party a lot and I don't) and her friends forced her (her story) to make out with a random guy. I said real friends dont push you to kiss with someone else if you are in a ""healthy and happy"" relationship. Her friends started to hate me and put her up against me, so that worked out just fine..She apologised for her behaviour..we had make-up sex, we were back together again..




**October 2013**: She moved out to the foster family I told earlier about. A week later Demi told me she missed the bus so she had to take the last bus home (leaves around 23:00 and arrives at 23:30. To surprise her I bought her favourite chocolate and drink to wait an hour for the bus. at 23:20 no bus..23:30 no bus...23:40 no bus..23:50 no bus..00:30 no bus.. I called her and she said she was already home and she didn't saw me. The bus stop near her house is like an OPEN FIELD. A day later I asked her foster parents (the coolest parents, besides mine ofcourse ;), I ever met) and they said they had to be honest.. a guy brought her home and they made out in the car. She apologised, we had make-up sex, we were back together again..


**November 2013**: One of my closest friends, Michel, made out with Demi and wanted to go down on her..she refused but she did allowed to made out together..they confessed and all I could do was freeze..I didnt want to see her for a while..after a week she apologised..we had sex..we were back together again..




**December 2013**: We were supposed to go on a vacation with her foster family to celebrate Christmas. But a few days before she broke up with me because she felt imprisoned (read: She goes to school every day 8-5 and works from 5-22, even on saturday) and had no free time for her friends, social life etc. So we broke..I was in a downfall and felt so broken..A day later she was in a relationship with the guy from Octobre.. Two weeks later (after New Year's Eve) she came back to me  crying it was a mistake etc. So..She apologised..we had make-up sex..we were back together again.




**Januari 2014**: We broke up two weeks later again, same guy from Octobre and Decembre..



**Februari 2014**: Back together again..she apologised..make-up sex..You know the drill now =/




**June 2014**: We went shopping and back in the train she was tired so I started playing a game on her phone (mine was empty). I closed the game and caught my interested when she had a messaging app she NEVER used to have, I opened it and saw conversation with the same guy as Januari etc. I went to media and I saw naked pictures and videos from both of them, the latest DATE was 18th of May. She took the phone and got mad because I couldn't trust her? She said it was the 18th of Januari, But I am not stupid enough to not know the difference between Mei or Januari (dutch for May/Januari). The number of letters already.. I puked in the train of the sick thoughts only and told her for the FIRST TIME OF MY LIFE (achievement) I was sick of this shit. That she never had time for me only when it came out for her, she cheated way to many times (even with one of my closest friends), I couldn't trust her anymore and the thoughts of her cheating on me (im not even sure now if i know ALL the times she cheated on me) mentally broke me down. I felt more insecure then I was in my gaming addiction. I still loved her so much, but I just couldn't be happy anymore..I realised I wasnt happy anymore the moment she started having the sex conversation with the guy in 2012..Yet again, she apologised..and we were back together..




**August 2014**: We had a fight again, and we decided to take a break. HOWEVER, we both agreed that we are still together, but didnt want to go on a date for a while, just to cool off. A week later she comes to me and told me she cheated with two guys. It was the first time she told me herself she cheated on me, usually I had to find out myself or someone else told me. But I realised a few hours later that a friend saw her making out with them, so she was forced to tell me..


I started crying at work, in a paranoid mood I bought an overkill of medicin (No idea why, I still don't  know today) and just wanted to die. We had no contact for a few days and the coming weekend I decided to break up with her. 




The break-up weekend she said she had no time to talk because a girlfriend was coming over. Around 23.00 she said the girlfriend was gone but she was tired. I didn't want to be in this situation anymore so I just went over. When I wanted to open the door I heard her talking with a boy. She said I was a sad person and said the meaniest and most painful things about me I've ever heard someone say about me. (Note: I want people to like me, I never fight, I never swear..I do everything I can to satisfy others or friends above myself, atleast that what the people around me tell me..)




I opened the door with tears and said I couldn't do this anymore. She actually looked me in the eyes and started crying like ten times more then me..Again i was frozen..but my best friend lived closeby and talked me through afterwards, he rang the bell several times but I was blinded by love..


From then on we were never back together again..but we still had sex sometimes till last week. Last week she started telling she was pregnant (we took two tests, spread over 2 weeks) and yelled for attention. I blocked her and we didnt spoke since then..


However, I am a complete idiot. I still love her, I still see her as the person that screamed for my help every day she had to enter the house of her mother again..I still see her as the girl that fell in love with me, and I with her. When she was with me..she was the nicest girl I ever met..But when we weren't together she was just always busy with other guys and I was out of the picture.



**Minor things i didnt mention in the story:** Everytime a guy asked if she had a boyfriend she always said no. 


I asked her to take a day off from work so we could have a night together so we could talk a bit about our weeks..maybe grab a dinner..go to a movie..you know..stuff you do with your girlfriend. But all we did was hanging out on sunday. Having infinite amount of sex and lie down at the beach


She never showed interest in my hobby's, my college, my internship, my friends or family..


All her friends hated me because she made me look like the bad person..


She has diabetes and blood pressure issues and smokes a lot, everyone (read: foster parents, foster grand parents, my friends and her REAL friends) were also confident that she has borderline, but she refused to take the test..


Whenever we talk now (we broke up in August, we had sex between then and now, but no relationship) she tells me she misses me..when I grab the bait and tell her I miss her to she starts to laugh, call names and ignores me..thats how it's going now..sometimes I start..to hope her say she misses me for real..


Sometimes she'd hit me when we were fighting,


Whenever we had a fight..In the end (after the sex) i was the one at fault and I had to change myself.


I'm getting sick of myself, of the entire situation..How can I get control and just continue my life? I'm not even sure why I keep talking to her..she broke my heart for cheating so many times..I feel more insecure then before..and yet I keep looking for her..


It's a really beatiful girl, I still think one of the most handsome redheads to this day. But she is so broken inside...

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend (borderline)
 cheated on me 8 times, but I still cant get her out of my head..we send each other messages sometimes..one day she tells me she loves me..the next day im the biggest idiot and need to leave her alone!"
2hzqk2,26,2014-10-01,What do companies expect from a university intern?,PlasmaYAK,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2hzqk2/what_do_companies_expect_from_a_university_intern/,"I've just started my third year of university and I lack the confidence to apply to internships that I'd like to do.

I feel at the end of this school year I'll have gained knowledge about how to build more professional looking code, but all I have to show for now is a few hackish projects. 

This may be a misconception, but I feel when companies want a student in their third or fourth year, they basically want someone who can do full-time employees work (which maybe I could, but I would need a lot of mentoring and time). Many internships ask for candidates to have a ""strong understanding in X language"" or ""3+ years experience in X language"". I can code in Java, C, Python decently well, but I wouldn't say that I have mastered any, I know I have a lot to learn. 

So yeah can someone give me advice on what companies look for in a student intern? "

Don't have any friends (people moved away, went to a commuter school, joined clubs, volunteered, even got invites to go vacationing with other people, but no deep connections...no brotherhood, no sense of family...those people already met each other in childhood and I end up acquaintance 9/10...)

No network. 

Some internships, no jobs offers. 

Hate my degree. I honestly literally wanted to commit suicide while finishing it. I even looked up, several times, the most painless way to kill myself. Couldn't figure it out.

I work out 4X a week, have hobbies (reading writing mainly), try to go on dates to cheer myself up and covert into friends, but I can't shake off this restless feeling. I want a completely different direction with friends like in *Friends*. I don't care if that sounds childish or like ""First World Problems"". Human connection is what I crave most. Acceptance. 

At my last job, people were already so...busy with their lives. It was a hotel job, not meant to be permanent, but even trying to make nice with my coworkers resulted in me being stonewalled. I always get the ""acquiescence face"". I can't describe it. It's almost like it would be taboo to invite them someplace, and if you do, you get an excuse.

I'm not desperate. Just frustrated. I always read/get the same advice ad nauseum. Work out. Make nice. Invite. Reciprocate. Empathize. Listen. Blahhhhhhhhh.

This turned into a rant. I don't know what to do because I feel unanchored. And then someone will say this is the time to do whatever I feel like and make changes...but I don't know how anymore. I feel like I've tried everything.

2i0dii,10,2014-10-01,Please Allow me to Vent my Disappointment: Didn't Get The Job After a 3 month Full Time Internship,klam1987,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2i0dii/please_allow_me_to_vent_my_disappointment_didnt/,"
**Backstory**
When I graduate about two years ago, I worked in the film/tv industry as a freelance video editor. Money was okay when I worked, but the work itself was inconsistent and unsteady (worked only as long as the show last), then I'd be left without a job and looking. Some people like this lifestyle, but I realized soon it wasn't for me (too much anxiety with looking for work). In short, my summary of the career prospect of the film/tv industry based on my experience: grim at best, exploitative at worst.

I finally managed to muster the courage and finances to switch career paths into something I thought would have more stability and career prospects. I had a bachelor's degree in broadcasting, and an minor in english + two years of freelance tv editing experience. Basically, nothing of direct experience other than soft skills I can really leverage to make a sturdy career change.

But, I figure the most overlap was in advertising. I networked with some classmates who work in the industry and managed to interview and land an account servicing internship (fortunately it was paid - minimum but at that point, i was expecting unpaid even) at a top advertising agency. And this is where I've been the past three months. I joined with a smaller department within the agency and worked super, super hard. I stayed late often and really impressed the team and the supervisors. If tv/film taught me anything, it's how to value the opportunity to have stable job - and I made damn sure I'd do everything in my power to have one.

My initial contract was for 2 months. When that was up, I was extended for another month with my boss promising me that by the end of the month, i would be hired on full time to the team. Another lesson, I learned from tv/film, promises mean nothing until you either sign that contract/or receive that paycheck. I continued to work hard, ensuring them that at the end of the month, I was the only viable candidate.
 
Then two unfortunate things happened: 1) The team unexpectedly lost a client. 2) the new business pitch they were 90% sure they'd get, didn't happen. Suddenly, there was no more room in the budget to hire another full time staff. But, I still had the full support of my department and supervisors who went to HR and asked if any other department in the agency was hriing (4th quarter - rare case).

Then a week ago, HR replied they had an opening with another team and asked me to interview the next day. this was 5PM. I knew it'd be a late night cause I was helping prep finance reports - left the office at 10PM, got home at 11:45PM (prepped for an hour), woke up at 5:30 to get to the office at 8AM to finish an important new business presentation by 11AM to finally prep for another 2 hours before interviewin at 3PM.

I knew I had a bad interview. Everything came up super rehearsed and I messed up on some big questions. I just found out now that I was not selected to move on to the next round of interviews. I have another 2 weeks with this company (they extended my contract again for another 2 weeks), but I'm so disappointed right.

Please, help me try to find some positives here. This company won't likely be hiring again until next year. Do I have enough experience to apply elsewhere? 

**TL;DR** Interned at a ad agency for 3 months. Despite praises and recognized hard work, didn't move on to the second round of interview against external candidates. "

However around the end of February I found out that the money part had fell through and I could no longer afford to get my masters. I have since then been looking for a software programming job. I have sent out hundreds of resumes and have had a few interviews (both test and HR interviews). The first few said I needed one to two years experience more and to prove I have that I started making a game in my basement. I added that to the resume and sent out lots more and just got a interview with a huge firm where I am located. After thinking I nailed the interview with my biggest trip ups include a poorly written memory management question and a testing question (as I have never taking a testing course) I get the all time low rejection letter. I have no clue what I am doing wrong I did a full year internship with the college programming, I am currently trying to show my skills and get my name out there, and I feel I have a good grasp on the technical questions they ask me. I am at my wits end what do I keep doing wrong. I feel the longer I stay at this help desk job the less likely someone will look at me as a viable software designer and the more I will get passed over. I feel I will be stuck in IT for ever and never doing what I want to do. Thanks for reading my plight and if you have anyideas on what I could be doing better please let me know. "

I am writing this letter because, for the first time in my life, I am considering sitting out an election as a loyal Democrat. You have been my senator since before I could vote, and on the majority of issues my values seem to coincide with yours. I even volunteered for one of your campaigns when I was still in high school, getting Lakeview doors slammed in my face all day trying to drum up support for you when I was too young to vote myself. I have voted for you every time, without fail. This time, I don't know if I can do that with a clear conscience.

The issue that leads me to this reluctant choice is the recent revelation of widespread government spying on innocent American citizens and foreigners under the auspices of the National Security Administration. At a time when leaks of classified NSA documents have proven the existence of numerous programs which might in the past have been dismissed as the fantasies of conspiracy theorists, you have remained a loud and public supporter of the NSA.

This is not a minor problem for me. In my opinion, these secret programs are entirely unconstitutional and represent criminal actions against the American people, clear and blatant violations of the 4th Amendment's guarantees against unreasonable searches. They are a greater threat to the people of the United States of America than any terrorist organization, and represent a key underpinning of any potential police state in our future. By protecting these criminal activities, you have made it impossible for me to support your re-election, at a time when my distaste for your Republican rivals would normally have me donating and volunteering to keep you in office.

I do not expect you or your staff to respond in any meaningful way to this, nor do I expect anyone to actually read it beyond selecting a form letter response that ignores the key points I have raised. My only reason for writing this is to make clear exactly why I, as a liberal Democrat and a lifelong supporter of the Democratic party, and a strong supporter of the President on every issue but this one, cannot bring myself to cast a vote to return you to the Senate this November. 

It breaks my heart to do so, but I cannot in good conscience vote for anyone protecting the right of the government to spy upon me and my fellow Americans without cause and without a warrant.

I hope, against all odds, that you might see the light and alter your stance on this issue in a way that would allow me to vote for you in November.

Sincerely Yours,

You seemed so sweet and kind showing my friend and I around campus. You were my first kiss that night. We talked every so often and you'd walk me back to my dorm for the first few weeks,  you showed you cared. I was happy just being with you, and didn't want anything else. I liked you, I do like you, but I never acted like I did or said anything because I was scared that things would end. We agreed to be fuck buddies, but you soon labeled it as ""more than friends but less than a relationship"". I threw those words back in your face whenever you tried to get closer. Soon a lot of people found out that I was seeing you, and I was okay with that. What I wasn't okay with, was the fact that they thought it was all fun and games when you actually put me through hell. What they didn't know was that you would ignore me, you would literally make me feel like all you wanted was sex, you'd be okay with me coming over at 2 am and leaving two hours later, but if I'd invite to watch a movie it was the last thing you wanted to be doing. You had your reasons though, and I understood that. You came to my dorm one night looking for me, and when I came down the stairs and you saw me, I swear it was the biggest smile I had ever seen on your face. You hugged me so tightly and shared with me that you wanted me, and that you were scared I'd leave you for somebody else. You were completely trashed so I walked you home and you wouldn't stop apologizing for not being good enough. We did nothing that night, not even cuddle, and when you woke up the next morning I saw that huge smile on your face again. This moment lead me to believe you actually cared, that maybe you really did want me, and we weren't just fuck buddies. 
You soon left for your senior internship and while you were gone we texted nearly everyday. You came back to visit half way through your internship for only one weekend, and we spent the night together. When you came back to school though, I knew it wasn't the same. You seem to have pulled away, and I had no idea why. I know you got depressed a lot, and I know you have really low self-esteem,  but I tried to still be there for you. I wanted us to work, I knew we could work because I knew you. But thinges got in the way. I fucked it up, but so did you. The whole year I only felt happy when I was with you, in the moment. When I analyzed everything, as a girl tends to do, I always felt as if I was just your slam piece, the innocent freshman that seniors pick to fuck all year and then throw them out at the end. Because I felt like this, I lashed out. I said I hated you, I said it so many times and each and every time I saw it haunt you inside. You treated me like shit though, and you knew it,  otherwise you wouldn't have apologized so much. You were hung up on your ex, and you never told me why. Everyone that knew you said that I was better, that they didn't understand what she had over me, and you never told me. When I met more upperclassmen, more people that knew you, I got judged.. a lot. They saw you as a horrible guy, you had stories around school, but to this day I don't know what any of them are. You have a reputation, but I have no idea what it is or why it is that. Yes, I knew you were a wild guy when you drank, but you weren't too wild. The whole year we were together you only ever slept with me. 
If we both tried, it could have worked. It still can work. If I didn't distance myself in fear of loosing you, and if you understood that I truly did, truly do only want you and no one else, it would have worked. And all I'm asking now is to give it a chance. I miss talking everyday and seeing you. I just want a chance at a relationship with you because even though we did have a rough time, I know we both had feelings for each other. 
So to get it off my chest: I fucking hate you. I hate you for making me fall in love with you. 
I'm trying to get you back, but I don't know how.. how can I get you back."

To be absolutely clear, **what I'm about to propose is not a policy**. We will not enact or change anything without evidence of community interest and buy-in. As of right now, nothing has changed, and if a change is made, the users will be notified in advance.

We propose that /r/humanresources should be **targeted primarily at Human Resources Professionals**. That is to say, people who work in Human Resources, in some capacity or to some extent.

This conceivably includes people who do HR work but do not necessarily have an HR title or qualifications: Administrators, Small Business Owners, Administrative/Executive Assistants, etc.

This does **not**, however, include:

* HR Students
* People who aspire to work in HR
* Laypeople who have HR-related problems (""Explain my benefits"", ""is this appropriate behaviour"", etc.)
* People who have broadly-defined workplace problems which, for some reason, they've decided should be taken up with HR.

These people would not be *banned* from participation, but topics oriented towards these communities (""Can someone look over my resume?"" ""What should I know for a job interview for an HR internship?"" ""How do I break into HR?"" ""What's the best HR school?"") would not be permitted.

These topics are extremely repetitive and rarely generate insights which aren't apparent from the comments in previous posts on the subject -- if they attract any comments at all. The people who make these topics also rarely integrate into the forum or come back once their questions are answered.

We feel that positioning the forum towards the needs of HR professionals will make the forum more useful to these professionals (who will no longer need to wade through mountains of tedious, repetitive posts in order to find topics of interest) and thus create a better climate for building activity and membership.

-----

As I say, however, this is not yet a matter of policy, and we are eager to discuss this further with the members.

It's with a team that is doing really cool work, and the co-workers seemed pretty nice. 

I'm in the process of interviewing with other companies right now. I have an offer from my last internship (where the company isn't as prestigious, the pay isn't as great, the commute is slightly better, but the coworkers are truly awesome), but that's it so far. I'm interviewing with some other companies right now, some are in my desired location, but none are nearly as prestigious as Apple. 

Apple has a great team, great pay, and is a very prestigious company. Otherwise, I haven't heard too many good things about working there. My team at Apple works long hours and Cupertino is an hour commute to SF (where I want to live). Also, while it is a very prestigious company, it isn't as sought after as Google or Facebook (I haven't heard back from those companies yet, so I'm probably rejected there). I would develop a very valuable skill set at Apple, but I'm genuinely worried that I won't be happy there.

What should I do? Is having Apple on your resume worth sacrificing the happiness that I would probably have at another company?"

You were the first to say that you feel like I'm ""the one."" We talk about how you're going to get down there, get your life together, earn some money. All of that is great, baby. 

But I still don't want you to leave me here by myself.

We'll Skype every night, we'll text each other all damn day, send ugly Snapchats, have entire conversations consisting of nothing but Facebook Messenger stickers, play video games online, watch Netflix on Skype together. We're going to do this, and time will fly by.

I don't want you to go, but I know we'll make it.

I'm going to work my ass off from this point on. I'll take shitty hours to get more money, I'll work at jobs I hate, do internships that I'm discouraged by so I can get experience, hell, I'll shovel shit 24/7 if it meant earning money. It's all for you. I'll do anything to get what I need to make it down there with you.

I have this little note in my wallet, right above my driver's license. I'm going to look at it whenever I feel like giving up, like quitting a shitty job because I don't like it, whenever I feel discouraged by life because curveballs keep getting thrown at me. It says ""do it for her."" I stole it from The Simpson's, yes, but it's my motivation. The thing that keeps driving me forward. You.

I don't want to let you go.

I know this is the best decision you'll ever make in your life. This is the first chapter in the book of your new life. I know that for the first few chapters, I'll probably be a recurring or supporting character, but I know down the line, I'll be a main right along with you. I have never been more certain of something before I met you. I know we'll make it. I know we will. 

I won't give up on you.

I'll have my bad days, my days where I want to hold you in my arms, and you'll have the same type of days. But it's worth it. We're worth it. 

I love you. Forever and ever babe. This isn't goodbye forever, this is more of a ""see you soon"" type of thing.

The recruiter also gave me the green light saying I can do whatever I like before starting. 

The only problem is I'm having a hard time finding an internship that will hire a new grad knowing they won't come back and also finding one that won't have anything in their NDA preventing me from working full time at  the company I already signed my offer for.

""tax internship? why are you doing a MAcc and not MST, then?"" 


so I gave her my reasoning, which is info I gathered mostly from this sub, another71, various other sources. while I want to work in tax now, I feel like an MST is a much too specialized degree for someone with 0 experience, because in 10-20 years maybe I won't want to work in tax, and I felt that an MAcc accomplished the 150 credits goal without automatically pigeonholing my resume into ""the tax account"" because it's a broad degree, you're just a master's in accounting, not a taxation master. 


she rolled her eyes. ""no. you're doing the MAcc because it's easier."" she looks down at her clipboard and starts writing down my information ""summer tax internship"" slight pause, smug smile before she continues writing ""master's of accounting..."" 


I didn't really know what to say at that point. I was so taken aback by how cunty she sounded. an hour later I had a thousand things to say to her, but I was speechless in the moment. [l'espirit de l'escalier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'esprit_de_l'escalier) strikes again.
 

the thing that gets me the most is she's making this sweeping judgement about me based on no fucking information, and she's completely wrong. I work part time to pay my way through college. I graduated with a fucking 3.95 GPA. I don't have time for beta alpha psi but I do it anyways. the thing I said before about the MST is really how I think. the difficulty difference never once factored into my mind. in fact, due to the large number of elective credits allowed, I could easily build an MAcc as tax-heavy as an MST, or an MST with a tons of non-tax courses. 

and this fucking lady is telling me I'm taking the easy way out. I'm too lazy to take what could possibly be marginally harder courses. I've never struggled in any of my courses, especially not my tax classes, but yeah, I'm terrified of the idea of doing an MST...


fuck her. ruined my whole goddamn day. I just left, rest of the big 4 be damned, I'm sure they're all as snobby and take the same condescending tone with you rather than talking to you like you're a goddamn human being. the least you could do is be fucking PROFESSIONAL about this shit. who talks to people like she did? who just discounts a person's entire achievements and hard work based on this one aspect of their chosen path? okay, maybe she disagrees with what I said. why not say that? ""well, we prefer our tax associates to be working towards their MST, I'd recommend you look a little more into it, let me know if you have a change of heart"" something simple and nice instead of WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE JUST A LAZY ASSHOLE TAKING THE EASY ROAD! 



anyways, that's my rant. I think she's a gigantic cunt, but I'm also wondering about my MAcc choice now. am I being stupid for not doing the MST, or do I have the right idea? "

2i2689,1,2014-10-01,Confused and don't want to steer career in the back direction. I wanna get this right the first time around,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i2689/confused_and_dont_want_to_steer_career_in_the/,"A little back story: 

I'm 21, in my 4th year of University, working for a BS in Computer Information Systems. I got a job at a local Hospital doing Help Desk work, the location is amazing and the pay is really good from what I was making before (worked in retail). I have a lot of fun at work and at time's it's really easy (no calls = no work, just make sure the place doesn't go under!). 

I eventually got close with our Director of Creative Services. It’s a really small sub-department in IT, only 1 Web Developer, 1 photography and 1 videographer/multimedia specialist. They used to have a dedicated Graphics Artist but she quit, the Director does the Graphic Art and Web Design as well. 

We got to talking about setting me up with an internship. I would be filling the spot of the missing “graphic artist” which I have no problem doing, but I told him I would want Web Development in there as well, I had no problem doing both since I enjoy designing just as much as I do developing. We eventually settled that if I were to get the internship/part-time job, I would begin as a Web Designer, but said there would be tons of room and side projects regarding development. 

At first he had to get the position of an intern/part-time approved by HR and the CIO, which never happened still. Everytime he brought up the idea the CIO would always be too focused on something else. Another factor was that I had a very small, limited school-project portfolio. They were all dinky little projects that had to meet a certain critera(not much room for thinking out the box) but I always made them look and function amazingly. So in the meantime he asked if I would be willing to do some side work for him which he would use to show the CIO and HR when they were ready to discuss it. These consisted of flyers basically but on the side I took our existing hospital web-applications and gave them a redesign and more modern, user friendly interfaces (these things look like 90’s websites.) Also on a side note, I am creating his wife’s website and he offered to pay which is great.

This guy is awesome, I would love to work under him. But things are taking so long. He has been trying to get the position approved by the CIO and HR, but they are telling him to wait because his department might be getting transferred to officially under the Marketing Department and no longer IT (I don’t think this would be a problem if I could still focus on design and development.) My school advisor is telling me to start looking for another job somewhere, but part of me really thinks this could be worth it. I talked to him about the whole position and I would be starting as a Jr. Web Designer until  I graduated and would most likely be offered a promotion if I did a good job. He said then if I stuck around for a few years I could even get people working underneath me. All sounds too good to be true. What should I do guys, I’ve tried hard to plan everything out but staying at the Help Desk when I’m in need of much more challenging things, not to mention I would want to do something I love. Am I going in the right direction in this? I trust the Director, I know he is doing all he can to get me the in, but it is not his call ya know?

Sorry for the rant, I have no one else to really ask for advice so I need you guys!

2i2d7u,3,2014-10-02,"My life is complicated, and tiring, and I'm pretty much getting to my breaking point.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2i2d7u/my_life_is_complicated_and_tiring_and_im_pretty/,"I moved to VA to follow my girlfriend to college, at least that's what I tell people.

I moved to VA to get away from my family, to get away from the drama, to get away from the stress.

My sister was born was I was 13.  We were all optimistic that she would be fine, she was born only a few weeks after we found out my mom had been almost 9 months pregnant without knowing.

I stayed optimistic until I realized what the optimism would cost.  My mom wanted my sister to be okay, but we all could see that something was off.  When I confronted her that I thought we should get her screened years after she was born we didn't talk for about a month or two and that was after she spent a good amount of time emotionally destroying me.  She didn't have to say much, it was the glares.  I felt like Judas, she made me feel like I betrayed her, and everyone.  I've never actually figured that out before until now looking back.

My sister was screened and has autism. She is high functioning so she is getting better now, learning more vocabulary and getting better at responding.  I do not think she will be able to hold a job, and that frightens me.  When my parent's finally pass (They are young, so that will not happen for a long time) I am so afraid of having to care after my sister.  This is not something that I ever imagined would be a part of my life, and my mind wanders back and forth, scenario after scenario, of what my life might be like with her.  I do not dislike it, it just frightens me, I love my sister to pieces and would do anything for her even if it crushed my relationships or social life.

Moving to college was a big issue.  I struggled to pay my tuition every year, but through a lot of begging and letter writing I would somehow slip through the cracks and make it year after year.  I also acquired a large amount of debt, 41k on my own, another I think 18k from my folks who have told me I would be responsible for paying it.

So overall, I'm basically 60k in debt and rising.

I did pretty okay in college, I smoked A LOT of pot but I maintained a 3.4 GPA and went to class almost every day.  I met my beautiful girlfriend there, and made a few friends but really that was it.  College was the biggest let down I could have experienced, it sucked and the best parts were the times I could spend with my girlfriend, my roommate, and my therapist.

I left all my good friends back home.  All the ones I thought I could live without because of how desperately I needed to leave NJ.

Throughout high school my parents did nothing but fight and bicker.  They like to say that it never happened but my mother wasn't the one who watched it happen everyday.  It was like, everyday was a new turmoil to overcome.  My dad/myself didn't clean up after himself, the dog had an accident on the floor again, I mouthed off to my mom because she was being inconsiderate to me or vice versa.  We became so hostile to each other that I just was always on guard, I said so many mean things because I absolutely felt them in that time and space.  I had no idea when the bomb would go off and I would say the wrong thing, or my mother or father would decide something irritated them enough to lash out and take it out on one another or myself.  It was never physical, but whoever said words can never hurt them has never felt the crushing weight of them.

I don't feel those things anymore, I'm completely numb and the therapy and large amounts of pot I smoke (and still smoke) have gotten me to this point even though it still haunts me.  My folks found an old phone while I was in college and decided to snoop around on it, found some pretty awful things I said in private and are still bitter about it and all the apologies in the world can't fix it because I've tried.  It's like my mom doesn't trust me anymore for something I said to an ex-girlfriend when I was 16 and depressed.  I didn't mean those things, I was just confused to why my parents were like other peoples parents.  Why didn't I have any great distant relatives who weren't losers, why are we constantly in debt and you can't pay for my college, everyone else has a car and they're flunking their classes yet I'm passing all mine and will not have my own ride until I put myself into debt to do it senior year.

Did I mention I slept everyday in school?  Everyday, through as many classes as humanly possible.  I became fairly known by teachers, I was the only one who still completed their work and walked out of that hell hole with a 3.8 GPA.  When I look back on it now I just wanted to sleep my life away, it was comforting to have a place to lay my head that when I woke up I wouldn't have to deal with any serious problems.  My senior year, after I graduated I got a credit card in the mail that has a $1200 limit. I still owe on this card, even though I've paid it off twice and it's maxed out again.  I put the down payment of a hideous yellow car because my mom really seemed to like it so I thought we could share the car and we could have something nice.  I maxed out the card, it needed a new battery and the down payment was like $1000.  I didn't get to use this car until January 2014.  My mother needed it to take my sister to school, and I had to pay for parking and insurance while I was in VA which would be hard. Not too mention it was ""my"" car, but because they paid for it they felt that I had to ask to drive it when I came home even though I'm the only reason they could put the down payment to begin with. They lost the car multiple times, from not paying on it, and since I was a co-signer on the title I was affected.  Under all the debt I have and on top of all the failed payments my credit is sorta busted.  I'm repairing it slowly but I don't know it will ever be good again.  When I finally did get the car, to drive to my internship senior year, I had to sink $1000 into it for a new windshield, new starter, new tires.  My folks surprisingly put money into it too, since they left it in our wooded backyard for a good year or so idle and unused since they didn't bother saving any money to try and fix it.

I have a bachelor of arts in Psychology, and a pretty good GPA leaving college but I can't seem to nail a job.  I feel like my degree is useless.  I've worked as a desk assistant while in college, waiting tables, landscaping, and now I'm working a dead end job at a Harris Teeter as a deli worker.  I have a degree that cost me 60k+ in debt and I am slicing deli meats with people who are not on the same level as me.  I don't mean to come off rude, but these guys do not read and do not keep up with anything I do.  They're funny, great, and sincerely nice people but they just don't have any of the same  ambition that I do.  I work part-time as I can't seem to find any full-time work and barely make rent every month between groceries and rent.

I've applied for a couple dozen jobs, and none have chosen me.  I've had probably about 10 interviews that have all been pretty disappointing except for a few.  I got so far in a sales position, all the way to the last interview.  I risked driving to maryland in my car, that is uninsured and cannot pass inspection for these interviews and did really well up until my last one.  I don't know what happened but I just blanked, and I did not do my best.  This caused me to not get the position.  I didn't get a position as a personal banker, I didn't get the sales position at MSC, I didn't get the sales position at APB, nor can I get a position at a shelter I interned at because of my own ability to not pass a drug test.  I applied for a position at my internship months and months ago and heard nothing.  In august I applied again, and somehow got an interview which was then followed up with nothing.  I heard nothing from this place for almost a month and a half, and just today found out that they want to take me into a position (Another dead-end one mind you) but I need to pass a drug test in the next three days.  I obviously cannot do that, so mark down another fuck-up that for once was caused by myself.  Although, me fucking it up definitely hurt way more then all of the other positions that I didn't fuck up.

I live in a hovel.  My girlfriend and myself moved off campus (Long story short, my roommate dropped out and I got a new one, who was a heroin addict and would steal my money, and my girlfriend hated it on campus) and started living in the basement of a woman named Ingrid.  Ingrid seemed easy, relaxed, able to go with the flow.  Told us we could smoke pot in the house because her son used to, she just didn't want to know about it.  We got really cheap rent, utilities and wifi included.  It seemed like it was too good to be true.  It was.

The room is not finished completely, we have no closet space.  It was not furnished, so we picked up a lot of stuff off the side of the road and cleaned it up / painted them.  I had no dresser for a while and just had to keep my clothes in stacks which I guess isn't a big deal with their weren't insects crawling all over the house.  Large spiders, centipedes, etc.  I'm accustomed to it since I lived in an unfinished basement back in NJ but this was just ridiculous.  We had ants raid our pantry and ruin a lot of food.  Her cats are obese and vomit / diarrhea on the floor since they can't make it to the one and only litter box which is downstairs RIGHT NEXT TO OUR ROOM.  The room will smell like cat feces and urine some days, so we'll light a candle and make it work.  She's broken things, not anything important, but small things that were ours and were not replaced such as kitchenware.  Her kids are annoying when they come back home randomly, as she is divorced and they're adults so they have their own lives.  I got ring worm, really REALLY bad ringworm from her cats since I walked around in the house barefoot a few times.  It warranted a doctors visit because it looked like my foot was going to start rotting.

So here I am, talking to all of you redditors and writing this obnoxiously long and incoherent message.  I drive a terrible uninspected and uninsured yellow car that dies randomly, I live in a hovel with my girlfriend, I work a dead end job with a seemingly useless career.

I figured I would talk to you guys since I can't seem to talk to anyone else.  I used to have my friend Bill to say a lot of this too, I was there every night a few years ago when my folks would rub me the wrong way.  I have so much more to say, I have an aunt who dates pedophiles, my grandmother put herself like 40k in debt for back-taxes and lost the house we were going to get when she passed.  Something that could have been kept or sold to help my sister get more schooling or help ease my debt burden.  My aunt is a thief as well as a dater of pedophiles and stole from my sister on Christmas (2011/2012 if I recall correctly, my grandmom was still alive.)

I just have no one to talk to.  The therapists I saw all throughout college were really some of the only people I had who I could open up my problems to.  I can't tell people things like this, it scares them because of how heavy it can be.  It doesn't make them want to be around you as much because you become a burden.  I'm just, I'm so burnt out from everything that's going on that I'm not sure what to do going forward.  The obvious is to stop smoking and keep trying to get jobs but I just feel so defeated and crushed.  I have no support, I have no real friends down here besides my SO.

For the first time in a while I'm realizing that I feel fragile and alone, not numb. 

Thanks if any of you actually read this, I just don't really know what to do I guess."

Since school started I've been extremely stressed. High school wasn't easy for me, so it's like I hit the ground running for college. It's a community college but again it's not like a piece of cake. 15 units, 9 of them honors units. I'm going from a mediocre barely passing student to someone who hopes to achieve above a 3.5 GPA at the very least.

Most of my schedule is essentially school in the day and my night classes, and breaks in between spent in the library or my best friends house conveniently located near the house, who's really chill and I do homework and essays there.

My dad and stepmom are both narcissists. I think they feed off of each other with my dad the enabler now always seeking her validation (before he used to be the key narcissist until he met her and she assumed the role). Last year in the beginning of my senior year, they went crazy searching through my room and even going through my phone and texts. They found nothing except a couple messages I sent with cuss words. They said they were looking for drugs or something.

Since they saw I wasn't up to anything fishy, things cooled down. And I ended up graduating and going about my business as I always do. Now I'm trying to do the same but they're beginning to get all suspicious again for no reason. I'm extremely stressed with school as most ACON's tend to be, and a whole range of other factors. 

I have an unpaid internship coming up for a field I really want to work with, and I'm just stressed you know? Today I told dad and stepmom I'm going to my friends house again. I ended up running from shop to shop looking for some ingredients to cook some bbq with her and her family to release some tension, took me way longer than it should since none of the shops had the meat I wanted and the traffic everywhere was horrendous. I ended up seeing my stepmom on the street so I waved at her and she didn't acknowledge me. When I ended getting to my friends house it was getting a bit dark but I still went ahead since I was hungry and wanted to cook the food. My dad calls all mad asking about where I am and the details of what I'm doing and I just gave him a rundown of when I left the house, where I went, what I was trying to do, and where I was at now (near friends house in the car).

Eventually when I got home at the end (the bbq was delicious by the way! Spicy pork bulgogi.) my dad was waiting inside like the gestapo. Asking me where I was what I was doing, why I didn't just eat at home, why I always want to go to my friends house. I explained to him that I was in the mood for cooking something I wanted to eat, that it was cheaper this way, that I had fun cooking and it was a good way to pass time and lessen stress. He keeps saying he has a feeling I'm up to something, but he doesn't know what it is. I try to explain like always, school stresses me out. It's a new place, new people, new work load. Not to mention this is the SEASON for mood changes. He isn't buying any of it. Obviously what happened is my stepmom calls him saying she saw me and that I must have been up to something suspicious (it was me, in my car, alone, listening to music), and for my dad to inquire.

He also asked if I get financial aid. My father makes a lot of money, but I qualify as an independent due to a specific criteria I meet (and it can't be undone), so I get the full amount. I haven't shared this with him, so I told him I applied and didn't get any. I don't think it's his or his fiancé's business. She asked me too one time and I gave her the same answer. 

I don't kids from loving households can understand what it means to live in a household where it's a constant war zone. The most innocent things throw up imaginary red flags for abusive parents. I brought some of the ingredients I bought with me home, and my dad kept arguing with me over non sense. I just told him I wanted to make whatever was left of it so I can eat it for breakfast or whatever. What is it with narcissist parents and you trying to cook for yourself? Maybe I don't want your fiance's shitty ass food. That's the crazy thing. if I was breaking ANY rules, you could say well it is it what it is, their roof their rules. BUT THEY WILL NOT SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING WRONG. They merely state a vague suspicion, and even say they can't pinpoint it. And why is it always them who suspect things? My friends aren't nosy like the, my other family members aren't like them, my friends families aren't ANYTHING like them. I don't lie to them either (the money stuff is an exception because if the kick me out i need a cushion). I do what any responsible 18 year old does or tries to do. 

Also I have a step sibling who receives none of this treatment. I would even say he's the golden child of the family (includes my nGrandma). They're always bragging about his accomplishments with school/life, I would say he did work for them, but like a child of a loving household, he had the road paved for him. My dad threw ME into foster care and chose him as his son instead. Of course he's the GC. And of course I'm the SG. My dad keeps telling me I'm trying to ruin the family, get them into legal trouble (the fuck? seems like the shady ones are them), blah blah blah. All I'm doing is my homework and trying to survive life. I have to stash away the allowance I get for therapy that I pay out of pocket. That I go to in secret. Seems like a vicious cycle to me.

:/ I can only deal with this by continuing to do what I'm doing, and not actually doing questionable things. I needed clothes for the interview, so I took a chance to apply for a store card somewhere and got approved thankfully, I put my purchases on that. So at least for now I'l pay it off over time but I'l have what I need to look professional."

2i3as0,1,2014-10-02,Confused and don't want to steer career in the back direction. I wanna get this right the first time around,blue430,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i3as0/confused_and_dont_want_to_steer_career_in_the/,"A little back story:



I'm 21, in my 4th year of University, working for a BS in Computer Information Systems. I got a job at a local Hospital doing Help Desk work, the location is amazing and the pay is really good from what I was making before (worked in retail). I have a lot of fun at work and at time's it's really easy (no calls = no work, just make sure the place doesn't go under!).



I eventually got close with our Director of Creative Services. It’s a really small sub-department in IT, only 1 Web Developer, 1 photography and 1 videographer/multimedia specialist. They used to have a dedicated Graphics Artist but she quit, the Director does the Graphic Art and Web Design as well.



We got to talking about setting me up with an internship. I would be filling the spot of the missing “graphic artist” which I have no problem doing, but I told him I would want Web Development in there as well, I had no problem doing both since I enjoy designing just as much as I do developing. We eventually settled that if I were to get the internship/part-time job, I would begin as a Web Designer, but said there would be tons of room and side projects regarding development.



At first he had to get the position of an intern/part-time approved by HR and the CIO, which never happened still. Everytime he brought up the idea the CIO would always be too focused on something else. Another factor was that I had a very small, limited school-project portfolio. They were all dinky little projects that had to meet a certain critera(not much room for thinking out the box) but I always made them look and function amazingly. So in the meantime he asked if I would be willing to do some side work for him which he would use to show the CIO and HR when they were ready to discuss it. These consisted of flyers basically but on the side I took our existing hospital web-applications and gave them a redesign and more modern, user friendly interfaces (these things look like 90’s websites.) Also on a side note, I am creating his wife’s website and he offered to pay which is great.
This guy is awesome, I would love to work under him. But things are taking so long. He has been trying to get the position approved by the CIO and HR, but they are telling him to wait because his department might be getting transferred to officially under the Marketing Department and no longer IT (I don’t think this would be a problem if I could still focus on design and development.) 



My school advisor is telling me to start looking for another job somewhere, but part of me really thinks this could be worth it. I talked to him about the whole position and I would be starting as a Jr. Web Designer until I graduated and would most likely be offered a promotion if I did a good job. He said then if I stuck around for a few years I could even get people working underneath me. All sounds too good to be true. What should I do guys, I’ve tried hard to plan everything out but staying at the Help Desk when I’m in need of much more challenging things, not to mention I would want to do something I love. Am I going in the right direction in this? I trust the Director, I know he is doing all he can to get me the in, but it is not his call ya know?




Sorry for the rant, I have no one else to really ask for advice so I need you guys!"

2i3e6z,133,2014-10-02,The Bookham PART 3: Ham Cures Autism!,ValdrickVile,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/2i3e6z/the_bookham_part_3_ham_cures_autism/,"If you're seeing any of the ""A Different Slice of Bookham"" posts those are likely my roommates RenLegs, CurlyBlond, TallBlond, or Jeans.  I wanted to keep this series a secret but couldn't resist letting my roommates know so from time to time you might see a story from their perspective.  They have a lot of interactions with her I've only heard legends about so stay tuned.

Recap on our players:

&gt;  First is me, which we'll call Valdrick ( because I'm a dork and that's my main WoW character) 5""4 and around 145 pounds but trying to drop and have been dieting/working out routinely with my boyfriend to turn it around.  A little chub but still striving towards shitlord status.

&gt;My boyfriend, which we'll call Jay at his request.  5""8 and 205.  Has some MUSCULAR LEGS and has lost a ton more than me working out.  Looks pretty fiiiine.  Met the guy while we were both working at Disney World on an internship.  Stuck like glue evah since and is my partner in crime.

&gt;Sharer-of-Rooms with BookHam, RenLegs.  Called so because she loves Ren Faire and has some sick legs. maybe 5""2 and about 145 as well from what I'd guess.  Sweet as can be and very tolerant.

&gt;Suitemates Curly Blond and Tall Blond, who share a room in between myself and BookHam.  Curly blond is short and the picture of one of those southern belle types, also a bit crazy but in a good way. Tall Blond is super pretty and has a hot military boyfriend.  Both are also into losing weight ( and have regularly joined me and Jay on workouts)

&gt;There is a sixth girl who is gone half the week I'll call Jeans, but her interaction with BookHam is minimal.  Very innocent.  Heavy but owns up to it and doesn't exist in the same delusional space as BookHam.

&gt;There is FilmSnob, friend of ours who is a serious militant guy at the gym and kinda pushes me and Jay to be healthier. 5""11 I'd guess and 150 pounds. We argue with him a lot over stuff but we get along. Lover of movies, hater of hams.

&gt;And finally there is Book Ham.  About 5""9 and about 240 pounds.  Not HUGE but a lot bigger than the rest of us, which is apparent to everyone else but her.  Can be seen in one of two outfits she wears.  Is on disability and spends almost all of it on books and junk food.  Seeks attention and a huge narcissist. 

By the way, as I'm writing this I'm being treated to Bookham's butt as her legs are stretched toward the sky in the most bizarre pose I've ever witnessed.  I've seen too much.  The shorts, the shorts damn it.

So I don't really know what got into me, but I asked Bookham to work out with us again.  Maybe I was still trying to help her improve herself and had her best interests in mind, maybe I just wanted to see the spectacle again and be entertained by it.  Either way, she was coming along with us once more.

I gotta mention a short conversation we had that day because it really still does blow my mind.  Side note, BookHam has Asperger's syndrome.  Might not be legitimate, because she's a pathological liar and also claims to have OCD, depression, anxiety, and epilepsy.  Anyways, unlike some of her other condishuns I can kinda believe the Aspergers due to her bizarre behavior.  We somehow got on the topic because FilmSnob also has Aspergers.  I was beginning to poke fun at BookHam as she whined some more about being single

&gt;Valdrick: You know, you can always date FilmSnob!  You both have a lot in common, you both love Percy Jackson and you both have Aspergers.

Bookham gave me a look so fiery it could burn a batch of bacon

&gt;Bookham: Do you see this face I'm making?

Bookham had her eyes closed, mouth tightly screwed shut.  It kind of looked like she was dead sitting up.

&gt;Valdrick: Are you....dead?

&gt;Bookham: No, this is my 'don't ever say that again' face.

Oooookay.  

&gt;Bookham: Besides, he's like 98% autistic...I'm only 12% autistic...

Now maybe I don't know a lot about that condition but I'm pretty damn sure being autistic doesn't work like that.  This girl is hella delusional.  I'm quick to respond

&gt;Valdrick: Naaaah....I don't think that's how it works, right? 

&gt;Bookham:  I'm not even really autistic anymore!

&gt;Valdrick: What?  Maybe you started managing it better, but you surely didn't cure yourself of autism.  That doesn't happen.  If you cured autism you better alert the medical world because that's a damn miracle.

If you can tell, I've gotten really sick of Bookham at this point and I was done being overly nice when she makes some of her outrageous comments.  She didn't disappoint.

&gt;Bookham: I did!  Some people just grow out of it.  I haven't been autistic in years.

And I'm done.  The strange way in which she vaguely understood her own mental conditions boggled the mind.  I waited for FilmSnob to arrive so we could go to the gym and we watched television in the meantime.   I am pretty sure we watched Glee.  Let me tell you something - BookHam has a television watching ritual.  She likes to lay on her side on the larger sofa covered in a plush blanket, with her head bizarrely angled down in such a position you would think it impossible to pay attention to the screen.  She surrounds herself with snacks.  She often likes to play music while she watches.  These two sounds mush together until there's nothing but a mindless buzz occupying the room.  Bookham also SINGS along to these songs.  The kind of forced overly dramatic singing people do when they think they're much better than they are.  Every now and again she dances, and it looks kind of like f you took a column of Jell-O and wiggled it around a bit.  Luckily I don't have to witness a whole lot of that, my eyes have subconsciously learned to look away from this crazy shit by now.  I'm conditioned.

So FilmSnob arrived and he and Bookham exchanged judging looks.  The two resented each other.  FilmSnob for obvious reasons, Bookham because FilmSnob disagreed with her about where Ferguson was in Missouri.  Granted, FilmSnob is from Saint Louis and BookHam is Kansas City, and BookHam was dead wrong.   RenLegs joined us and we set off for our second excursion to the gym.

FilmSnob could barely contain his agitation with the beast.  I could see it in his eyes.  As I said before, FilmSnob has no tolerance for obnoixous hams.  He's strict at the gym and takes no excuses.  Bookham was possibly the worst person I could have brought along.

We all scan our ids to get in and Bookham realizes she left hers at home.  No biggie - we all wait patiently for her return.  When she finally comes back about fifteen minutes later she looks upset.  She scans in and remarks,

&gt;Bookham: Why did you wait???  You guys could have gone ahead without me.

&gt;Valdrick: I just didn't want you to miss anything.

She's clearly disappointed that she now has to do the ellipticals again.  So we all miraculously get four in a row and set to work.  Everyone is using a reasonable resistance except Bookham, who again is barely moving and not using the resistance at all.  Whatever, she's heavier and less experienced, I let her do what she wants.  About six minutes into the workout I hear a THUMP!  I assume someone dropped their weights and I continue.  As I begin to notice FilmSnob and RenLegs dismount their machines, I turn around to see a sight I would never forget....

Bookham was sprawled out on the ground with both arms laid out at her sides.  To imagine her position, think about Jesus being crucified.  It was like that but horizontal.  She was wearing the most serene ""passed out"" expression on her face.  Unfortunately, seeing as I was already pissed I couldn't help letting this fly,

&gt;Valdrick: I don't fucking believe it!

As other gym-goers began to gather and a general silence fell over everyone, the staff rushed to her aid.  They spoke to her and tried to rouse her, but nothing seemed to work.  RenLegs offered that she might be having a seizure, but she was dead still.  They shook her slightly but nothing seemed to work.  Seeing that all was lost, one of the staff suggested they call an ambulance.  Bookham sprang to life quickly,

&gt;Bookham: No, no ambulance...

Miracle!  Hallelujah!  FilmSnob looked on with a blank stare of quiet resentment as we were forced to stay and fill out paperwork.  Bookham was helped into a sitting position by a staff member as multiple gym goers approached the ellipticals and rolled their eyes in resignation seeing that a giant hambeast was blocking most of the now vacant machines.  

&gt;Staff member:  What did you last remember, honey?

Bookham looked back at the elliptical like she was staring into the face of death

&gt;Bookham: The last thing I could remember was that....TERRIBLE THING!

She rolled her head around as if she was dizzy, but that kind of exaggerated cartoon dizzy.

&gt;Staff member: Did you see her hit her head?

&gt;RenLegs: No, I watched her catch herself on the way down.

&gt;Bookham: I tried to grab you RenLegs.....but it was already too late.

Thank god she didn't try to grab RenLegs, because she likely would of pulled the unsuspecting girl off the machine and she would have been REALLY injured.  No way was she going to stay unharmed with that much weight yanking her down.  Later we figured if she'd landed on top of her she might have been fine, that's a lot of cushion.  Bookham looked wistfully to the windows

&gt;Bookham: Ooooh...it's night....?

We CAME here at night!  I was 8pm.   She really wanted to play up how much of a victim she was at the moment and you could see in her face how much she relished the attention given by the staff and everyone else in the gym - even if it was negative attention.  We stayed for another few painstaking minutes and we took Bookham home.  FilmSnob unfortunately had things to do and returned to his own dorm, and me and RenLegs basically dumped Bookham into the room and went right back to the gym.  We told her to rest before departing, which I didn't feel was a necessary comment because if there was one thing that girl could do was REST.

So RenLegs and I finish our workout and get out around close.  We head back home and THERE IS BOOKHAM, AWAKE, ON THE COUCH!  She just passed out and acted like she may have sustained major brain damage, but here she was, watching more Glee.

&gt;Valdrick: Bookham, shouldn't you be sleeping?

Bookham: No, I'm feeling better.  It might have been because I gave blood.  And all I ate today was a cinnamon roll....

She gave blood?  Only now that she mentioned it did I remember her saying it in passing earlier in the day.  Why did she come to workout with us?  Didn't they tell you to avoid working out after that stuff?  I almost believed the passing out was legitimate, but the theatrics still left this uneasy feeling in my stomach,

&gt;Valdrick: Well, at least eat something substantial.  Not crap.  Jeans mentioned you could have her wrap in the fridge, try that.

Anything was better than her diet of pastries and icee pops.  She went into her room and pulled out a cup of ramen

&gt;Valdrick: No!  What the heck?  Ramen isn't the kind of stuff you should be eating right now, Bookham.

&gt;Bookham: It's food, shut up, I'll eat what I want....

She started to microwave her bowl of ramen as I watched in vain.  She also pulled out a package of fruit roll up and wrapped a chunk around her finger and began to gnaw the candy off her pudgy digit.  I didn't care anymore.  Nope.  Eat fruit roll up and die.

Next day comes.  Bookham incidents are low, spirits are high.  Roommate morale is slowly building again as none of us are grappling with her inane pity parties at the moment.  I'm sitting out in the living room, I finally have it to myself and I've rented Labyrinth earlier in the week.  I start the film and I'm feelin' good.  It only takes a few moments of blissful peace for Bookham to burst in with another one of her extremely thin friends in tow.  She spreads out a bunch of papers on the living room table and her and her friend hunch around it.  BookHam notices the movie I'm watching,

&gt;Bookham: Oh man, I am JUST like the girl in this movie...we both love to read.

I'm honestly surprised she wasn't saying something negative.  It didn't take long for me to lose faith in her again,

&gt;Bookham: But this movie is totally for pedophiles...I mean look at the guy, he's creeping on that young girl?

&gt;Valdrick: You mean David Bowie?  He's the goblin king, it's a fantasy movie, weirder shit has happened in some of these 80s flicks.

&gt;Bookham: You know man, I just DON'T understand the kind of people who like these movies...

&gt;Valdrick: Uh, I like this movie obviously, what are you trying to say?

&gt;Bookham: It's just pedo stuff!

I try to ignore her, but she's chatting it up with her friend and I'm finding I'm not really enjoying my movie as much.  I'm the kind of person bad at shutting out outside noise, but I endure it for awhile.  Bookham pipes up again,

&gt;Bookham: Oh my GOD Valdrick!  Did you know Mercury is between the Sun and the Earth?

&gt;Valdrick: Are you joking with me right now??

&gt;Bookham: No!  I really didn't know....where do you know it from?

&gt;Valdrick: Elementary-freakin'-school

She looks honestly offended now

&gt;Valdrick: What class is this for?

&gt;Bookham: Astronomy

&gt;Valdrick: Girl, you have a long way to go.  Can you name all the planets in the solar system?

Bookham goes on to list all of them but Saturn and Jupiter in a bizarre order.  I question how she became valedictorian in high school when she doesn't know these basic facts

&gt;Bookham: You only know this stuff because you like Sailor Moon!

You know, it's a shame Bookham didn't know Jupiter because Film Snob had a wonderful thing to say - Jupiter and Bookham are strikingly similar.  They're both incredibly large and full of hot air.

Next time on BOOKHAM, Bookham hits the pool!...And could she really be attracted to FilmSnob?  Bookham decides to try cosplay, so get ready for HAM PRISM POWER EAT UP!"

2i3olc,13,2014-10-02,"Like all the other lies you told me, I don't believe you. /rant",exploreroftheworld,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/2i3olc/like_all_the_other_lies_you_told_me_i_dont/,"No intent or desire to make contact, I just need to vent.

I'm angry at myself for sitting around waiting for him the first time. It was LD, we were both doing internships that summer, I get it. But talking three times a week for 20 minutes wasn't enough for me- new job, new apartment, and all my friends had just graduated. I needed support. I used my words; I told him that. 

Wait, he said. Wait for the end of the summer when we were set to take a 2 week vacation together. Wait, he said, when he decided to work instead of taking time off, until September- we'll get back into our groove. 

Wait, he said, when he offered to work 2 weeks into the semester, and weekends all throughout September. Not for the money, no 'I'd rather be spending time with you, but I need to do this to pay for school', but because they were short staffed and because he told them he would.

What about your word to me?  

I told him I didn't think it was a good idea- that he'd be drained on the two Sundays he offered to drive and see me, that he'd be behind in school and stressed, that we were supposed to have time together and wouldn't, that we needed to work on us. I told him I wasn't happy with our relationship, that I no longer felt like his girlfriend, but more like a friend. 

I get it- career and school are important to me too, I had my internship too. But when the person you're claiming you want to marry is that unhappy with your relationship, is telling you she doesn't feel like your girlfriend any more, and is begging you to spend time with her? When she's holding up her end of the bargain, and waiting and waiting for you to have time to put time into your relationship, don't be surprised when resentment builds and she feels like you've taken for granted that she'll just always be there. Don't claim you ""didn't know what you were choosing""; she told you. Don't claim you'll do anything for her and always make time for her, cause you didn't, and didn't, and didn't. 

Don't claim to be sorry, not when you turn around and do the same thing again months later, at Christmas, deciding to leave part way through the only time you've had together in the past 8 months.
When she calls you up and tells you she had a breakdown at work, and you respond, ""yeah I had a bad day too"", don't claim to be there for her.

Don't claim to be sad it's over- you had plenty of chances.  

Still to this day I feel like a shitty person- for not being able to let go of feeling taken for granted, like a non-priority, like my opinion on something that affected both of us, my opinion on the status of our relationship, didn't matter. 

I'm angry that you spent the next 8 months trying to win me back, claiming to have realized what's important in life, hoping that I would forgive and trust you again. I'm angry that when you got it, you all of a sudden decided you had plenty of reasons to be angry at me and didn't want me anymore.

No- actually, I'm angry that you, all of a sudden, 'didn't know how you felt about me' and strung me along for 8 months, seeing other girls behind my back and dangling them in front of my face. 

I'm angry that you were angry at me for not being there for you when you broke your ankle- it's not my fault you didn't call me and tell me. It's not my fault that when you told me you were going through some shit, that I told you to call me anytime you needed me, and you didn't. Not once. You can be angry at me for not being there for you, but you are a man-child for not acknowledging your own role in that.

I was angry at you for telling me you loved me and were trying, offering me your parents engagement ring, and then having a new girl friend a week later. I was angry at you for not having the courage to, after three years, end things with me to my face. I get it- I'm sure it was easier. Just like it was easier to find someone new, rather than communicate that you were upset about something and to work on it.

I hate that I came back to you with unconditional love, willing to weather whatever the storm, and that I thought that meant putting up with your BS. I hate that I believed you loved me unconditionally too.

I hate that it took all this other BS and those months and months of being strung along by your lies to see that those panties I found in your room were (very likely) not some by-product of your landlord's supposed affair. 

I hate that it took all this other BS for me to see that I was in love with the man I thought you were, the man I wanted you to be, not the man you are. 

But I'm glad my eyes were opened.

I hate that you called me up three months later wanting to be friends, but not willing to acknowledge that you'd possibly done anything hurtful to me. 

I hate that when I told you I didn't want to be friends with you- with someone who would treat people, let alone me, like that- that it was I who was the bad guy, for not being able to see that it had been because you were 'having a hard time', and that when I took the time to see it from your side, you were sure I'd change my mind. As though I wasn't a big enough person. As though realizing you were having a hard time wasn't why I stayed that entire time you were treating me like I was absolutely worthless. 

Again, you chose. You didn't want to work on us. After months of begging for my forgiveness, you decided to revoke your own. 

Don't sit there all high and mighty and tell me I'm not big enough a person, a good enough person.

Don't sit there and tell me I'm selfish. 


Like all the other lies you told me, I don't believe you.

Since I'm a freshman, I had no clue what I needed to bring or how to prepare. I found the list of recruiters and tried to read through some of the sites and find some that would be of interest to me, but that's about the extent of my preparation. I didn't prepare a resume because it would be a nearly blank page.

All but one of the companies' recruiters that I tried to talk to(5 in total) turned me away because I had no experience, and the one I did talk to didn't go as I'd hoped.

I asked one question, then blanked. The question I asked was ""what can I do in the next one to two years to ensure that I'm a top candidate for an internship, and in the next four to be a top candidate for a full time position?"" That went great. I got a good idea of what they're looking for, but after I asked that question I blanked.

Nothing came to mind. I awkwardly thanked him for his time, shook his hand, and walked off. I left after that.

I really want the one in the spring to go more smoothly and to get more out of it, but I really don't know how to prepare. What should I put on my resume? Just my grades and the two clubs I'm in? What are some good questions to ask? 

Any help would be appreciated.

2i455z,2,2014-10-02,"[question] Is it better to go the Ph.D route or straight into industry, specifically in computer systems?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i455z/question_is_it_better_to_go_the_phd_route_or/,"As the title says, my current area of study is (most generically defined as) [computer systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_systems). I'm a master's student right now about to graduate next year, with the option to continue on to Ph.D.

I've been torn up about this the whole time I've been in graduate school. I just really want to build stuff that matters (which is part of why I'm drawn to researching) and isn't either:

   - the latest widget/app that my manager says is important to work on but seems totally pointless, or

   - a niche research tool/widget that fades into obscurity after I defend my thesis.

Is there anyone on this sub who's successfully done a Ph.D in what I guess I'd call low-level tool-building, and then has gone on to use that Ph.D research experience while building more things (that may not be related to their thesis topic)? 

Furthermore, is there anyone who has a strong argument against a Ph.D in this area?

Would it just make more sense to join a startup as a systems engineer? 

It seems people with an MS can make out well in research and development, but (since I haven't been there and done that) I'm not sure if a Ph.D is necessary to get where I want to go. Being a full-time professor isn't really on my list of things to do in life, but I wouldn't mind lecturing at some point. I have the MS because my undergraduate was in the humanities. I have also successfully done two internships at medium-sized companies that do work in my area.

2i46f3,16,2014-10-02,The people at public accounting are ridiculously attractive and it is really scaring me,acctg,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2i46f3/the_people_at_public_accounting_are_ridiculously/,"As a student going through recruiting season, I can't help but notice that all the people I'm meeting, whether or not they are interns, associates, managers, or partners, seem to be extremely charismatic and attractive. The men seem like husband material (especially the partners) and the women make me extremely self-conscious. In the past I've contemplated getting plastic surgery just so I can fit into the beauty standards of public accounting, but unfortunately student loans don't pay for that. I normally don't use makeup because I'm a lazy ass, but recently I've been extra careful and spend a considerable amount of time touching up on my face before networking events.


I don't know if this is a confidence issue. I am very okay with what I have, but I also recognize that I'm not particularly attractive. I'm not fat at all, but I could use some curves, face-wise I could definitely use some enhancements.

Those of you in public accounting (especially Big 4), do you have colleagues that don't look like model material?"

We were 13, and I just gotten her screen name from a close friend. We chatted for hours and became best friends. I was enamored from the first moment we spoke. We didn't date until 3 years later, we stayed together until our sophomore year, where she thought she couldn't trust me (I lied to her about getting too drunk and vomiting on her friends floor, I blacked out and didn't remember, but I denied it, it was another case of mis-judgement by me, which is something I have spent the last year trying to improve and work on). 

We started talking 8 months ago, and we were living in different cities, but she was visiting our old town where I was living at the time. We decided we wanted to try, and I made a trip to see her where we got a little too drunk the first night and I regrettably didn't do something to sweep her off her feet.. She doesn't get upset for my lack of making an effort, but I did feel I missed a golden opportunity. We continue to do what we were doing (didn't become ""official"" since she felt that she had to hold back, until the day before she found out I had been lying (timing's a bitch ain't it)... 

Forward to a couple months ago, I was moving to the city she was living in for a new job and to be closer to her, and en route, I stopped by to see her where she was doing an internship. We'd really hit a stride and were communicating well, understanding each other and just overall really really happy. We finally became ""official"" not that it changed much, but then a day later, as I was leaving to go to my final destination, she asks me, one more time (she had asked me once a month this question, and I continued to lie) whether I had slept with her friend after her and I broke up 3 yrs ago. I had been denying it an a attempt to not hurt her and/or lose her and also because we barely even had sex, and in fact, she had a poo accident during which was the newsflash that I did NOT want to be there with her (we stopped, I left and went to another room). Her other friend (who I have a really good relationship with and still supports me), had told her that she heard the rumor again. I kept denying it, until I no longer could. 

So she finds out and is obviously broken, angry, full of resentment and just overall devastated that I did that. We continue to talk and hang out for 3 weeks after. There were some bad bad moments, with me trying to make her feel better, but in fact the opposite (how do I make her feel better in those instances??) happened, and some great moments where we are looking at each other with confidence that this will work out. We decided to take a break from talking for a few weeks and come back and try again, this time have our own version of a fresh start. I was wary, but agreed. I think having space is a good idea because she resents me SO much, but I also want to be there with her and HELP her get through it rather than leave her. She calls me a week later and says she's done. I don't fight it, I just get on with my life. A week later, we talk, she wants to see me (keep in mind, we haven't lived in the same city as each other in over 5 years and it's tempting to just see each other) and we spend the entire weekend together. We talk during the week and she proposes that we take space and try to start fresh, unsure whether she can even do that. She feels if she respected herself, she would leave me, but she also loves me. She hates what I did and says she imagined marrying me, having a future together that I ruined. I call her last night, which she initially appreciates, she said she almost caved as well, but then she starts crying and it tumbles again...

I love this girl. We have the same dreams, goals and aspirations. But why is there such a mismatch between how I feel and how she perceives it?

---   
**tl;dr**: The girl who I legitimately uprooted my life for found out I was dishonest about sleeping with her friend 3 years ago. Resentment ensues, and I am at a loss."

Then two friends (they are a couple [m+f]) asked me if i want to hang out today, play cards, blabla i said sure, but i didnt told them till 6pm that i only had time after 9pm, and they have to get up early tomorrow . They werent angry or anything, but told me like ""uh thats late"", but i had to go to the gym, to get less of a ugly fat piece of shit and just be ugly..  cook and tidy up my room and stuff.. 
 
so i went to the gym and my gym buddy can be a real asshole sometimes and he gave me a hard time.. talking shit about the company i am at, at the moment and that i make poor decisions and the only good place to work is like a big company, like the one he is working for, stuff like that.. (and i have no idea, cause i am 20 and didnt really work at much companies, in my field of profesion).. 
 
the after the gym i cook and i tastes like shit, i tell my sef that i am to stupid to cook and want to vomit, not because its bad, its because i tell my self its worse as it is.. 
 
then my friends come over, i loss at cards, then i am unreasonable sad because of this, and my friends are awesome, so i had so many chances to lift my self out of the hole i am digging my self into, but i dont want to. i want to be sad and fantasies about the times they finally gonna marry each other have kids and dont have time for me anymore so i can kill myself without hurting anybody..

**we've almost completed this journey, this is last batter up to plate, just one more pitch**

The next morning, 4am morning time to be specific, I extricate myself from Her, get cleaned up and head to the Office. I grab a small UPS, what we call power interruption prevention, the maintenance guy pulls in as I'm loading it into my car. 

&gt; MM: Ah HA! Caught you stealing equipment again I see!

&gt; Me: Morning MM, hows the home life?

&gt; MM: I'm here at work at 4am, that give you a clue.

I laugh and wave him into the parlor, I walk over to our stores, and point at Moby. He quirks a brow and says nice artwork, what about it.

* ^(Moby is a huge power conditioning UPS, it will keep a server with two 700 Watt powersupplies running for about 4 hours, it's name is Moby because an intern got bored one year and painted a white whale on the side of it)

&gt; Me: We have to get that to the SaS office.

&gt; MM: Bugger me blind, will that fit in your car?

&gt; Me: Nope, and it's heavier than I can lift.

&gt; MM: Damn your black heart, we gotta tote it in the van right?

I smile and pat him on the shoulder, you're a manager you could delegate it. He laughs and nods his head in agreement. (He doesn't have any assigned staff) I know just the bloke, and he should be about awake now, plus he owes me one for a freezer he wanted moved last month. I wish him luck and head to rearrange things at the other building.

I get to SaS office and lights are on in the building, at first I thought I had messed up and left them on the other night. I was mistaken, it was 5am and who would appear but my favorite Power Conservationist.

&gt; Me: Morning OfficeManager, you get here this early often?

&gt; OM: Some days, especially on days when I expect there to be problems. Someone plugged everything back up before I got here, and there were 4 machines left on, I'm certain I turned everything off when I closed up Friday.

&gt; Me: Oh, you did a fine job at that, everything was nice and quiet when I got in here. I guess CompTech goes along with your unplug everything philosophy. 

&gt; OM: Anyone in the know does, it's the best security you can get. If they are off, then nothing can get into them.

&gt; Me: Can't argue with that logic.

I move past him, or try to move past him, but he does a pretty good job of blocking me.

&gt; OM: Are you supposed to be here?

&gt; Me: Not only am I supposed to be here, but you are NOT supposed to be here.

&gt; OM: You trying to get me fired? I don't think you have that kind of pull.

I reach and push him gently out of the way and step past him, I don't have any strong feelings about him having this job, as long as they keep him off the server and figure out a compromise on all of this power nonsense.

He declares he is going to call the boss and get permission to call the police, I give him a thumbs up and go into the server room. I make the changes to GP, then shutdown the server and start unhooking everything for the move. OM shows up in the doorway, he gleefully informs me the boss man is coming in to take care of things himself and that I should stop what I am doing before I mess up. Suddenly there is a door bell ringing someplace, he looks confused then rushes up towards the front. I move peripherals to the barricaded cubicle.

He comes back with MaintenanceMan in tow. I give MM a nod and look to OfficeManager.

&gt; Me: Is there a problem?

&gt; OM: This guy is here to tear up the carpet and put down flooring. He says you know whats going on, why do I not know about this.

&gt; Me: Because no one told you. Yes I do know him, and he is gonna to tear up the carpet in the server room.

&gt; OM: You mean my office!!!

&gt; Me: It's not your office. You should go find a corner and pretend to be furniture, you've gone as far as I am willing to let you go this morning.

&gt; OM: What did I do? I've done nothing to you.

&gt; Me: Nothing direct, I really do wish you would go away, you're not helping my morning at all.

He storms off shouting about never knowing what is going on to be a help with anything. Shaking my head I show MM where he needs to do the flooring, he looks at it a bit and says I'll get a hand truck to move stuff. I show him the cat hole room, warn him about falling clawed objects, and tell him we'll store the filing cabinets in here. He gets to work and has most of the cabinets moved by the time I have the server stuff moved, I help with the furniture, that we stack along the wall. I watch for a bit as he tears into the carpet, it's not down properly so it comes out pretty easily. He goes out muttering sticky side down, sticky side down and returns with a roll of rubber flooring. I won't go into more detail, but I watch as MM does wonders on the room, soon it's got a blower on the mats that he keeps moving around the room and the key think is the server room now has a static dissipating floor.

He says he will need help with that big honking battery that I needed, and I look to see OM glaring at me across the room. I wave him over, he sulks a moment and comes over to the server room door.

&gt; Me: Does your maintenance guy come in early?

&gt; OM: Out maintenance guy? We don't have a maintenance guy, why do you think we have a maintenance guy.

&gt; Me: Who was the dunderhead that dropped the server I resuscitated last week?

&gt; OM: Oh he's the grounds guy for the park, I can call him but he won't be here for a while, he works out of city office someplace. I'm not sure when he starts work.

I look and see that it almost time for people to start showing, I've heard the phone ring a few times. I look at the MM and shrug.

&gt; Me: Got a friend to help with getting it in here?

&gt; MM: Let me see who I can rustle up, but I think it's going to cost something this time.

&gt; Me: I got a CoffeeShack gift card in my pocket, that enough grease for the gander?

He carps for a bit, raises a hand and turns to walk a little bit away.

&gt; OM: I can help move it, what do we need to move?

&gt; Me: It's a power conditioning battery backup for the server room.

&gt; OM: That is a horrid floor in there now, I'm not sure I like it. (Did he just ask me a question and then ignore me?)

&gt; Me: It's not your office, we're relocating you to the Cat Room.

&gt; OM: What cat room? Is that one of the closets.

I shake my head and move towards someone I want to talk to, I over hear MM talking to someone in what sounds like a negotiation. He agrees to something and hangs up. He demands the card that I hand over, I blurt out that its got 20 dollars on it I think.

&gt; MM: Let's move the cabinets and furniture back. You better decide where that monster battery goes before the help gets here. And no lip about who is coming to help.

&gt; Me: Roger, lets move these back.

We get the filing cabinets back in the proper order, luckily they were numbered. The furniture is back in the room and his phone chirps.

&gt; MM: Helps here.

He turns and heads out front, where I find about 6 army guys standing in a line with some guy going ballistic about slow ass running. MM walks over and talks a minute and the guys rush the van, they grab Moby and hoist it up on shoulders and start marching in place. While I'm trying to process, screaming man and his compadres follow MM inside.

About the time I get my thoughts in order, here comes the loud man and his half dozen still jogging. He tosses me a wave, barks out something in some language and the half dozen start singing about how much they enjoy running, then they take off.

&gt; MM: (pointing a finger) That did not happen.

&gt; Me: No one will believe me, hell I saw it and I'm not sure about it.

Inside the Moby is in place, by we need to do some wiring, luckily MM thought ahead and brought some tools and parts. We find the breaker box with OM's help, then isolate which circuit that is and luckily it's on its own breaker. He starts going at stuff and talking with OM, so I head back to move server stuff back into the room.

The floor feels off, like it's shifting, I make a mental note to ask about it before he leaves. Then a sharp pain stabs my skull, in a panic I head to the electrical room.

&gt; MM: Yeah, this is what most call the Mains, you pull this out and drop this arm and the power is off.

&gt; OM: That will save me so much time, I won't have to go around unplugging all of those power strips.

&gt; MM: Do what now? You don't flip these to turn off computers, this will cut your power to everything. It looks like it will take out power to your security system, phones, just about everything.

&gt; OM: Oh that's OK, no one is on the phone when I turn everything off anyways.

Defeated I slink away, hoping that I can convince someone to beat something into that mans head before the day is through. The last I hear is MM trying to get OM to notice he said '**security system**'.

MM comes in and does his work on the wall socket, mumbling about something. He looks over his shoulder at me.

&gt; MM: They are having an audit right? That's what this hullabaloo is about?

&gt; Me: Yep, why is something wrong? Oh, whats up with the floor?

&gt; MM: Not set, won't be for days, it'll need to be redone, there will be spots that are clearly valleys and I expect some ridges. You will know if something is moved in here for sure.

&gt; Me: That wiring going to do the job?

&gt; MM: Yep, unless they check it against code. Shouldn't start any fires, but it will be fine today. We can restring tomorrow and run a completely new circuit.

Great, it shouldn't start any fires but it won't pass code. I'll let him explain that to whoever he wants, I'll pray that nothing burns down unplanned.

Suddenly SaSOwner is in the door, he looks around and nods his head, I point behind him and he see's OfficeManager there like a puppy that needs to go out for a tinkle.

&gt; SO: OM, we need to talk, lets go into my office.

&gt; OM: Oh yes, we definitely need to talk.

SaSOwner turns to me.

&gt; SO: We ready for the audit?

&gt; Me: It's going to be close but I think we got it made, maybe not in the shade, but a little sunburn never hurt.

&gt; SO: Thanks for all this, I appreciate it greatly.

&gt; Me: Sure thing, I'll hang around for the audit in case he has questions.

&gt; SO: I appreciate that, I'll leave you guys to it.

MM looks at me when they leave, he looks like he has something to say. He stands, closes the door and moves closer to talk low.

&gt; MM: Thats who you've been working for this week?

&gt; Me: Yes, he's BigTuna's life long friend.

&gt; MM: That he is, they grew up together, I mean literally, close as brothers without sharing a parent.

&gt; Me: BT told me, said he was family, seemed pretty choked up about it.

&gt; MM: Well, that guy just got out of '**the**' hospital, he tried to commit suicide a few months back. 

I don't know what to say, so I say nothing, he continues.

&gt; MM: I'm not sure if this is secret, but he tried to, well, he did it because his only other life long friend died to cancer. His wife passed away just after Christmas.

Damn, now I'm about to tear up, nothing seems to want to get past the lump in my throat.

&gt; Me: I didn't know that, he seems to be a good guy.

&gt; MM: He is, good in the community, he goes to my church. I did not expect to see him bossing an office. 

I nod and turn to the server, he plates the plug and locks Moby's tail into the socket. The room vibrates when Moby comes up, strange how it does that without any real moving parts.

I boot up the server and check the changes to GP for the removable media. MM is standing there watching silently, I'm still not sure what to say. He seems to understand, pats me on the shoulder and says to call if I need more help. Once he is gone I tear up a bit, and then go back to work. I have a brain storm and disable CD burning as well, it's a separate rule from removable media.

I head up front and SaSOwner is loud enough to be heard through a closed door, he seems to have settle in the against column on the power issue, I don't eavesdrop any longer than that and head out the front door.

People are coming in and most are happy to see me, a few ask where my blanky is, couple joke about my missing stuffed animal. I smile and wave at them, I nod to those that ask if I will be back for the audit. One corners me about the files, he apparently really needs to access one of them.

&gt; Me: I need some breakfast not in a cup, and I'll be straight back to get that fixed. Should be done before the audit.

He thanks me greatly, as I get to my car my phone goes off, it's on silent so it's dancing a merry jig in my pocket. 

&gt; Me: It's me, you're you, tell me something new.

&gt; BT: Oh man you didn't work all night did you? Please don't be in stranger mode.

&gt; Me: No, been going since 4 or so, in a good mood, I think SaSOwner is laying down the law about the power conservationism policies in his office.

&gt; BT: You said his office right?

&gt; Me: Yep, he seems to have decided against letting OM unplug everything at night. I just overheard a little as I passed his office.

&gt; BT: You heard him through the door?

&gt; Me: Oh year, I imagine everyone did as they passed his doorway.

&gt; BT: Good, good...

I wait a second but he seems to be off on his own.

&gt; Me: Did you need something? You called me? I think.

&gt; BT: Oh yes, did you get the server room ready for the audit? 

&gt; Me: Yep, just hope no one comes by for a code inspection. Nothing dangerous, just not done properly enough to suit MM.

&gt; BT: Did he say it will catch on fire?

&gt; Me: Nah, he actually said, it shouldn't catch on fire.

&gt; BT: Lol, then it will pass code, just not his damn code. Everyone working?

&gt; Me: No one rushed out to get me so I think so, we got their files back, but I'll have to work on the shares after something edible, think my stomach is gnawing on my liver.

&gt; BT: Oh, go do that, please be back for the auditor, he might have questions. We are also meeting with CompTech at 3pm if the auditor doesn't shut it all down.

&gt; Me: So, we as in SaSOwner and me? Or we include more heads on the bobble?

&gt; BT: Three plus you two, me, and two of their other Customers. The ones that recommended, well, approved of their service to me.

&gt; Me: Are we negotiating? Discussing? Demanding? Should I get sticks and stones?

&gt; BT: No, we're going to explain to them what is happening, and we're going to let them decide if they want to toe the line or lose a few customers.

&gt; Me: 10-4, I'll be back way before the auditor, and I'm looking forward to that meeting.

He hangs up and I look to the door, but get in my car instead. I get a ham roll, a couple dozen donuts, a bucket of strong coffee, and head back to SaS office. The donuts are met with applause, and I'm the hero once more when I get most of the people back to files they had thought long gone.

&gt; Someone: Hey I can't get to my MP3s on this thumb drive, you know anything about that?

**this one is long, but I will finish up in one more part, thanks for sticking with me, I hope you have enjoyed reading as much as I've enjoyed writing, the last one is almost all gratification**"

However, I'm not the best self teacher, so going to school and having face time with teachers is a must for me. Right now, I'm going to a community college in Illinois to get a certificate in programming. http://www.kishwaukeecollege.edu/programs_of_study/pdf/CIS-CERT.pdf[1] (I'm currently going the java route to further prepare myself in case I end up doing mobile games)

The thing about this is, though, it seems like this option won't prepare me enough for the ""real world"" of game development. The three programming classes I'm taking right now ( c++, java, and intro to programming logic) only seem like a broad introduction to the languages, and don't go into specifics like some university classes do. I'm hoping that I can get an internship at a software development company soon, but I'm wondering if that will be enough.

Should I get my certificate, get an internship, and try to make a couple games before I try to get a job in the game development field, or should I go to a four year university after finishing the certificate? I know this is probably a very general question, but some opinions from people who are already in the game development field would be greatly appreciated.

I met a really nice recruiter for a well-known company and we had what I thought was a great heart-to-heart conversation(he told me about his family and hopes for his children). He asked for my resume and when I told him I didn't bring one he gave me his email address! The thing is, I don't know what to say in the email. My resume doesn't have enough programming experience for even an internship so I'm not sure if I should include it. He knows I'm just starting out so would it be presumptuous to send it to him? If he doesn't remember me he might feel annoyed that I would waste his time with such a document. Or should I just say hello, it was nice to meet you to remind him who I am?  Thanks y'all!"

Who needs it? 
Students who want to join startups but don't have too many connections in this field
How do you know? 
I will be the first person to use it because I want to find an internship at a fast-growing startup.  I talked to my friend who looked for startup internships last summer and said she would definitely use it because it was so hard for her last summer.
Why is this a good idea?
First, I already know two students who will use it(me and my friend).  I know one startup which tried to find interns last summer, so I have one potential startup user as well.  Second, this market is growing for two reasons: more and more students are interested in joining tech-startups; college interns help bring fresh perspectives to the startups."

The past three weeks have been nothing but torture and I have no idea how I'm still finding the will to get out of bed. I tried really really hard in high school and got great grades because I knew that I wanted to go to a great college and be somebody. But the summer before I left for what seemed like the college of my dreams I met this amazing girl who I instantly fell in love with. I couldn't stand being 5 hours away from her at my new school so without thinking about it, I transferred to a school closer to her so we could see each other each weekend but academically it's just not the best school and I realized the second I got here that I made a mistake. It also doesn't help that because of a transportation issue I always have to go there and her school is absolutely amazing. Now into my sophomore year, I was given the option to go back but they refused to give back my scholarship money because I didn't pay a 400 dollar deposit and take a leave of absence.

I'm still very much in love with this girl and I can easily see us together for a long time. But I am extremely depressed over the school that I gave up and she knows this too and now feels guilty. And I'm now also trying to look at other schools similar in quality to my first one to transfer into next semester and I'm very scared because I keep screwing up my education and now my relationship with an amazing girl and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just scared to death and stressed out to no end and it stresses me out that it's affecting the ones I love. 

One half of me wants to go back or go somewhere similar where I can thrive and make art and film and music with likeminded people and have the internships and a greater chance of success, but the other half is scared to leave and to leave her and scared that I'll be miserable even if I do transfer. And she might get fed up with my nonsense after this anyway even if nothing works out and i'm stuck here and I'll have nothing then. And then I don't even know if I apply to these schools if they will even take me.

I just feel sometimes that it would be easier to be dead then to stress and be afraid and paranoid like this, and I'm constantly afraid of my future so it'll probably be this way for the rest of my life. I don't know.

If you want to call me a coward that's okay too. I'm sorry if this just sounds like a kid whining too. I just needed to vent I guess."

And I used to live up to that stereotype. 

Hell, I studied at Yale University of Medicine for Gods sake, getting my M.D degree in the late 1980's. After an internship at the New York State University, I returned to Yale to complete my residency in psychiatry. I was fascinated with the way the mind and the body works, and how they work in unison. But all my beliefs were built stoically upon scientific and medical facts. If only you all knew me, you'd know that I would normally be the LAST person to entertain the idea of what I'm about to tell you. Jesus, it's taken me months to even come to terms with it myself, or to speak the words out loud. In fact you guys are the only people I've told this to so far, and I'm only doing this because for once I can be truly anonymous, and I can get a gauge of what the public would think. Plus, Reddit is renowned for operating on the same ""scientific facts only"" basis, so it makes sense to come to you guys, so I can get even a marginal idea as to how my colleagues will react when it comes time to share the findings of my research.

If I didn't have hard proof of what I've found out, I wouldn't be so sure of myself. The tapes, they are…I still can't believe what is on the tapes. It feels like a dream. That's why I know I need to share my findings, because I KNOW that I am not making this up. I mightn't know where to go from here, but I may be the one to finally have proof that we not alone. 

I guess I should tell you a little bit about why I got into psychiatry. I got into namely because of what happened to one of my best friends in high school. 

Ryan. 

Ryan was one of the funniest, most easy going people I have ever or will ever meet. Seriously, NOTHING could phase him. I remember when he first got his licence and his Dad brought him this insanely cool Beetle, which was matte black. Ryan had wanted it for so long, and when he woke up on his 17th birthday, it was there in his drive way. I will never forget the look on his face when he pulled up out the front of my house, he was beaming and could barely contain his excitement. Well you can imagine my horror and dismay when we went to go to the Ice cream parlour to meet our other friends and an old lady reversed straight into him at some traffic lights. We had been checking out some girls walking past, and hadn't been paying attention at all, and the huge jolt scared the hell out of both of us. I stared at him in disbelief and watched him make sense of what had happened, look at me, look at the old lady now standing at the front of his half-crushed beetle and just start laughing. 

""Fuck man!"" He snorted. ""Trust this shit to happen the first day I get my car!""

He got out to exchange details with the lady and he couldn't have been nicer to her. I sat and waited while *he* comforted *her* until the cops came.

But that's just the kind of guy Ryan was.

He was athletic, and popular, but nice to everyone. He loved to stick up for the underdog. He was smart and the sort of person who had a laugh that made other people laugh. I would leave his house, my stomach cramped, because every time he would laugh I would nearly die laughing at the sounds he made. He didn't have a fake laugh. He never made a ""teehee"" or a polite chuckle, he LAUGHED. From deep within himself. And it was contagious.

Then he started to change.

 It was hardly noticeable at first. Around the age of 20, when we were just coming into our prime, he started to withdraw. Small things at first. I'd call around to ask if he wanted to come catch a movie, or go to a party and he would say no. He didn't feel like it. His mom would come out and encourage him to come with me, saying he hadn't been getting out much at all, and that he should go and enjoy himself. But he'd just sit and watch TV. At first I brushed it off, and thought maybe he wasn't feeling well, or he was tired, but eventually weeks passed and I didn't hang out with him. I would call him to talk and he would be very abrupt and it just seemed like he wanted to hang up as soon as he'd answered the phone.

After that happened a few times, I decided maybe he just didn't want to be friends anymore. I'd tried everything. For months I had tried to engage him, and he didn't seem at all interested. 

So you can imagine my surprise when one day his mom called me, and asked me to come over. She said Ryan wanted to see me. She sounded almost…desperate. 

Of course I went. That's what friends are for, right? I was hoping I'd get my friend back, but if not, I was hoping for at least an explanation.

So over I went to his house, and his Mom answered the door. She opened the door before I had even got a chance to knock, looking pale and frazzled. Her once auburn hair, now tinged with grey, frizzing erratically around her face. She stood, ushering me to come in as soon as I'd gotten on the road outside their house.

""James, darling, I'm so glad you are here!"" She said, wrapping me in a tight hug."" Ryan could really use a friend at the moment dear.""

""Sure Mrs Crosby, no problem."" I said, taking off my jacket and heading towards Ryan's room.

Nothing really prepared me for what I saw when I got there. What I was confronted with had never once crossed my mind. I thought Ryan didn't like me anymore, I didn’t know he was….unwell.

I pushed on the door of his room to go in, but found it blocked my something heavy. I banged on the door, while his Mom hovered in the background pretending to look busy.

""Bro! It's me, open up."" I called.

I heard rustling and movement from within, but still the door stayed shut.

""Ryan! Open up dude!"" I yelled again.

More movement and what sounded like heavy furniture being pushed around. Suddenly, the door peeled open an inch and I saw a darting eye looking straight at me.

""Oh..oh…you came. Oh. Ok. Um. Um. You can come in. I suppose. Not her though. Not her."" He stammered out in haste.

""Ok…Um. Well open up and let me in buddy.""

With that he finally opened the door, and before I could say a word, dragged me into his room by my collar.

I guess I know now that Ryan was already gone at that point. The Ryan I knew and loved, anyway.

The Ryan that replaced him was manic. He was rocking back and forth, staring at me wide eyed. His mousy brown hair looked like it hadn't been combed or cut in a year. He was wringing his hands and sitting on the edge of his bed, while all around me there were posters, photos and letters covering every inch of the walls and ceilings. The stench was insane. It was such a far stretch from the impeccably neat Ryan I used to know, that I was actually scared.

""Ryan. What the hell man? What's going on here? What happened to your room?""

""YOU HAD TO COME HERE JAMES BECAUSE I CAN'T TALK ON THE PHONE"" he whisper shouted. 

""Why?"" I asked before he interrupted me with ""SHHHHHHHHH. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN"" he whisper shouted again.

""Ok"" I whispered back. ""Just tell me what's going on dude, maybe I can help. ""

""That's why you had to come here James. They can hear us talk on the phone. They listen all the time.""

""Who's they?' I asked, confused.

""THEY. The others. They can hear through the phone lines. I know this because I was watching the News this morning and the news reader said the phrase ""Maple Avenue"" and I knew that was code to say that immediately after I spoke on the phone, people would be writing down what I said"" he explained, almost a matter of factly, like what he was saying should make all the sense in the world.

""Maple Avenue? What""

""That's their code for me James, that's how they pass the messages on. It doesn't matter anyway. They're coming to get me. God wants me now. I won’t be here anymore tomorrow. So I wanted to tell you that."" He said, pacing.

""Jesus I need to sit down"" I mumbled, all of a sudden feeling light headed.

""I'm not going to make it James!!!  I'm not. You've just confirmed it yourself, you said 'Jesus', I know he's here, Jesus has come for me, I'm not going to see the sun go down tomorrow, I'll be dead!!"" He said grabbing me by the shoulders as I sat on his computer chair and shaking me.

""Dude, dude just snap out of it ok!!"" I remember screaming at him. ""Stop saying this stuff, you're starting to freak me the fuck out man!! Just stop it!""

At that point, his Mom knocked on the door – ""Maybe it's time for you to go James"" she said sadly. She was a woman defeated. There was no more desperation. She looked resigned.

I turned to walk out and I took one last look at this person who stood in place of my dearest friend. His once cheerful blue eyes were now grey and bloodshot, and they stared into my soul as he said ""I don't want to die, James.""

And that was the last I saw of him. The next morning his Mom found him in his room. He had stabbed himself in the chest with a butchers knife. 

It took me a long time to work out how my friend had become someone that I had never met. I now know that he had paranoid schizophrenia, and he was suffering from auditory hallucinations that filled his head with horrible things, which culminated in his suicide.

I could not fathom how someone as bright and as fun loving as Ryan could change into what I had seen that day. How did he change? Why him? Does something trigger it? How can we fix this so that other people don't have to go through what Ryan's family went through.

That's why I got into psychiatry.

To find answers.

And now I have answers, to a question I didn't even know I asked. And it's not what I thought. And I don't know what to think about Ryan anymore. I'm tormented now, that I didn't help him when he needed it. I wasn't there for him when I should have been. I should have listened and asked him questions. 

I need to stop for now Reddit. I don't know if I'm ready for what's to come. The repercussions for me, for the whole medical industry, hell, for the WORLD. I don't think anyone's ready.

Put it this way, if I was just going to retell what I've found during my research, I'm almost positive that 99% of you wouldn't believe me for a second.

But I have the tapes. And you can find out for yourselves.

My university is not ranked overall that well, but the CS program is decent.
Problem is, I switched my major to CS really late in college, so I didn't have a chance to pick up any internships while in school.

After I graduated, I did manage to get two full time jobs, one after another. They both were a stint of 6 months, so total: one year of work experience. It's a long story as to why they were so short. I have a gap between my graduation date and the 1st job, a gap between my 1st &amp; 2nd jobs, and a gap between my 2nd job and now (so far only a month).

I'm just really unsure as to the breadth of interviewing topics I should be reviewing. **With one year of work experience, and two years out of school: Will my interview questions be like a typical new grad, or somewhere between *new grad* and *senior*?** I know *senior* means that most/all topics are fair game.

I am applying to a wide assortment of companies from the Big 4 types, to maybe-you've-heard-of-them startups. Also, does my one year experience mean that they would likely offer the same salary as a new grad, or maybe a tiny bump?

tldr: Two years out of school, no internships, one year of full time experience. Will they ask me questions **on almost any topic, or more topics,** in interviews, now that I'm *not* a recent grad?"

I've been working as an intern at a large company for a few months now. We are writing embedded software and I've been told the only way(i think) to compile and test our product(a cluster for cars) is by using ""MULTI IDE"". And I've been recommended to use Eclipse, as almost everyone uses it(one guy is editing via CodeBlocks, and one other via Notepad++). I considered using CodeBlocks but i didn't like it that much from my experience at home.

It just struck me last night that i can use Sublime Text, which i really really like.

So my question is are there some plugins that people use for C development? I've been googling for about half an hour and didn't see anything useful(or it didn't seem like it). 

Currently i have 

* Sublime Linter
* Sidebar Enchantments
* Bracket Highlighter
* All Autocomplete

The things i miss from Eclipse are

* When i move my cursor over a defined constant it shows its value (i know it cannot show the value when i move the cursor over, so my idea is to show the value when i press some hotkey or something?). Edit: Also applies when im searching for functions (Eclipse allows me to open it automatically via the F3 button)

* When i try to access an element from a structure(via ""."" or ""-&gt;"") i get all the elements from that type as suggestions

TLDR:
Graduating late. From another country. Want to get a job at Big 4. Thinking of interning 6 months at such a place, then doing a masters with that cash and contacts, then trying for a full time offer after masters.

First a little info about myself. I'm computer engineering college student from a SEAsian country (college is ranked decently top 100, QS, World rankings) and my country has 2 (effectively 3) years of conscription meaning one only starts college at the age of 21. I took a year off school to work in a few Silicon Valley startups and now I am back, and will only graduate when I am 26.

Although I don't have very good grades (lets say its around GPA 3.2ish), but I have a slew of side projects under my belt, and 1 year of real developer work experience in SV, and potentially a good final year project in the field of computer vision. Having experienced culture in SV, I absolutely love it, and I would like my first career to be that in a current big 4 engineering or computer science firm (Think maybe Tesla/Boeing or Google/Microsoft) that sort. I am currently pursuing a very embedded-systems cum computer vision focused modules and projects. This is my area of interest.

It's a big stretch, considering the kind of competition I've seen from people I have had the chance to meet in Stanford or Berkeley. I am thinking of possibly applying for an internship of 6 months at one of these firms (saving enough), then doing my masters (either Meng. or Msc not sure yet). Primary reason is I wish to work/live there. H1B visa requirements and getting a full time offer from them is better with Masters.

Would like to know what are your thoughts on this path? Please feel free to ask more questions."

Should I invest my time in learning more design patterns? I don't know much about that.

Should I learn more Agile practices, like TDD? I don't really know how to test the things I build, and TDD looks like a monster to me, honestly.

I'm a 26 y/o Psychology major (still in grad school but graduating soon) and will be working as an intern at a Transatlantic Non-Profit-Organisation located in the Loop, starting January 2015. My training will end by the end of September next year. I am currently living in Germany.

I have been living with roommates for over 6 years, both in Germany and the US. I am considerate and of course stick to cleaning schedules. 

In my freetime, I love to go to concerts (looking forward to Lollapalooza 2015 btw - would be great if we could go there together!), hit the gym, cook and watch movies. At the weekends, I like to go out and explore bars and places with great food (need to try deep-dish pizza!), and I love sight-seeing and long walks. 

I don't mind if you have any pets. If you have a cat, I'll cuddle with your cat and feed it, if you have a dog, I can help out walking your dog (and cuddle your dog - hehe). 

I've set a monthly housing budget of up to $ 800 incl. utilities and wifi. It would be great if there was a washer/dryer in the building but that's not a prerequisite to me. This is not my first stay in the US. I went there several times as a tourist and also went to a small Liberal Arts College in Minnesota as an exchange student. 

Btw: If you are currently studying/learning German- perfect, seize the opportunity and practice with me. I'd be glad to help out.

Important: I'm looking for a temporary shared apartment solution. I really cannot stay longer than September bc I will be returning to Germany once my internship ends. I do not have any preferences on roommate gender.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

2i7h7q,2,2014-10-03,"Me [24 M] with my now ex girlfriend [24 F] 6 years, broke up because of issues and just trying to grasp it and move on.",JFI1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i7h7q/me_24_m_with_my_now_ex_girlfriend_24_f_6_years/,"This story starts back in High School. I met (lets call her L) in high school while she was dating another guy. The guy wasn't treating her right and so when I showed some interest, she broke up with him and we started dating. 

We both went to the same Community College and stayed in the same apartment complex. So needless to say, I didn't spend much time in my room. Things were great, we would have sex on a regular basis, multiple times a day. We were always with each other, spending time together and were making friends. After this school, I decided I wanted to continue with more schooling, as did she. 

I wanted to go to one school and her another. I didn't get in to my school because I was past the deadline and so I went to another Community College near her school so I could stay with her and we could be together. After one year, I finished and choose to go to my school I wanted to go to because there are known for better Engineering academics and so I went there. She stayed at her school to finish her degree. She finished after one more year and then got a house and started working in the same town she went to school at.

So this is apparently when things started to become problematic. We were in a long distance relationship (about 2 hours so could be much worse). This is where L says that I became more distant in our relationship. I would drive the 2 hours every weekend to be with her and stay at her house.

Now I was in Engineering School, very busy with lots of homework and so when I came on the weekends, I spent quite a bit of time working on homework. She understood this, as far as I thought. Looking back now, this is something that I regret, not spending more time with her.

The sex life during this time had slowed down. With classes and homework, I just was always tired (I know not the best excuse) and couldn't stay awake for super long. She would want to stay up late and do things, and all I wanted to do was to spend some quality time together and then go to bed together. There were times that we didn't have sex because I would fall asleep during a movie and I guess that pissed her off. She would wake me up and then we would have sex. Later this will be brought up.

So this went on for three years. Then this summer, I got an internship nearby. I spent the summer living full time with her. I thought things were going well. But in her mind, she had other thoughts.

One weekend, she was going to go on a trip with her female coworker on a tubing trip. I couldn't go because it was just a co-worker thing (not a big deal with me). I decided that I was going to stain the deck and try to make the house nice so when she got back, she wouldn't have to do anything.

Two weeks go by and I didn't notice anything too out of the ordinary. The Friday before our vacation trip to Vegas, I get off work early and I get home. I checked her Ipad to see if she had the confirmation email about the vacation hotel and I notice some messages on it. It is from a phone number (not a contact). I looked at the messages and I find out that this guy is from the tubing trip and they have been texting and sexting for the past two weeks. So I confront her when she gets home. After I thought about it for a little while, I seemed to remember over the past two weeks, she was being particularly protective with her phone, always keeping it next to her and answering it immediately (red flag).

She tells me that over the past 6 years she has never cheated on me (which I do believe her here) but when she went on the tubing trip and met this guy, she started having these feelings and didn't know what to do. The guy was nice to her and gave her attention that I have been depriving her of for the past 3 years. She tells me they didn't meet up or do anything physical with him while tubing. 

She told me that I was the ""perfect boyfriend"" except that I don't have sex with her enough. And then she started mentioning all of these ""problems"" that I have. I don't eat healthy enough, I don't wear nice clothing, I need to work out more because she is a little bit bigger than I am. The list continues.... 

So all of this comes to head two days before our vacation to Vegas. I am heartbroken but I was looking forward to going on the trip. We agreed that we would go with our friends and act like nothing happened and try to enjoy ourselves. Maybe during the vacation, we might be able to reconnect. 

She said that she blocked him for our vacation. During Vegas, I thought we had fun. Had sex a couple of times. I thought things were looking up moving forward. We get back and were trying to make it work. I started showing her more attention because I thought that was what she said I was lacking. Now I am apparently ""fake"" because I am showing her attention that I wasn't before.

This goes on for a couple weeks. During this time she told me she wasn't texting the other guy. Then one day, some co-workers come over and they started talking and i picked up her phone because it buzzed and was going to hand it to her in the bathroom (she was getting ready to go somewhere) and it was the guy. I freaked out and told her that when she got back (we were going to have a nice long talk). 

I ended up going home that night to spend time with family and let each other cool off. When I got back Sunday we talked. She said that she needed space to think. She kept having feelings about this other guy (I think I forgot to say this guy lives 4 hours away). So I had planned on moving in the basement for a while to give us some space. This seemed to work for a while. Then things got worse, probably because the guy was warping her mind, just a guess. Then she said that I needed to move completely out so we wouldn't be temped to talk about the issues. I said that if that is what she needed, then I would look for a place. I still thought there was a chance of getting back together. Then we talked and she said that we should just break up and that there might be a chance in the future to get back together.

All this time I had been saving up money for a wedding ring. We had gone over the summer and looked at rings, and I had been in talks with the jewelry store owner about getting one. So that adds another kink in this. She told me that the next step was getting married and if she is having these feelings for another guy, then obviously we shouldn't move forward. I agree, I don't want to be married to someone who is talking with another dude about sex and hooking up.

So then she decided that we needed to break up and I should move out and we both need to date other people. I still had hope that we could work it out. The more I thought about it the more I realized that I don't think I can ever trust her again. So I decide that I need to move out to give us time to think.

I mention to her before I moved out about some of the things that I am going to take with me. There are two dressers that are mine, a table that i made in high school, and a couple other things. She then told me that she liked those things and that I should leave them at her house. I was like, you have to be out of your damn mind, that shit is mine, not yours!

So I have now moved out, living with a co-worker, while I am finishing up my last semester of school online. I am trying to forget and move on but it is hard. After 6 years on being with someone, it is hard to just stop communicating.

I am a little lost. All my good friends are 3 hours away and I feel alone. I do have some awesome co-workers that have listened and helped. But it is still hard to think about. One reason that it may be hard for me is because L was my first and so I have that connection that I think I have been holding on to. I am planning on taking time and spending it on work and school. I just wanted to get this off my chest and see what other people think. I don't care if you are on my side or see her side. I just needed to get it off my chest and try to move on.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me because she had feelings for a guy she met on a tubing trip. I am hurting and am trying to move on but it is going to take some time. Thanks for listening."

Earlier this summer I was hired for an internship position in NYC. The internship was meant to only be for the summer, but I performed well and my boss offered me to stay on part-time until I graduate. My boss has told me there is a possibility for me to be offered a full-time position when I graduate, but they would continue interviewing other candidates for the position.

**Problem**: I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of for a couple reasons.      
* Since the extension of my internship, my responsibilities have risen dramatically but my pay has stayed the same.    
* I feel like they are dangling the possibility of a full-time offer and an incentive for me to give 150%, which is great for them but makes it difficult for me to allocate time to my schooling.     
* I really like this company and want a full time offer, but don't like the feeling of being taken advantage of.

2i7jk0,3,2014-10-03,Had an epiphany today...,floatingsoul,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2i7jk0/had_an_epiphany_today/,"I have been surrounded by problems stemming from alcohol since I can remember.  My parents divorced and my mom quickly went to the bottle for comfort, not to mention various other drugs.  She surrounded herself with people I would have never guessed she would associate with, got multiple DUIs, woke up on our porch naked, went to rehab, went to jail, the list goes on.  This was short of 5 years ago that the worst of it stopped.. but only because I made the choice to move out of her house and live with my dad, I knew I could not be around that anymore (even at a young age I was aware).  

I know that what I lived through has shaped much of who I am today, witnessing her at her darkest moments and seeing so much at such a young age, being left alone for weeks at a time.  I say this all here because I NEVER, I mean NEVER think about it.  It is almost as if I block out that part of my life because it was so painful (suicidal thoughts often ran through my head).  Thankfully, I have the most wonderful father in the world who did everything he could to help me overcome what I had been through (my mother and I hid it from him for 5+ years) with Al-Anon and therapy as well as supporting me in so many ways.

This brings me to my point.  Of course, though I vowed to never go down the same road, I somehow ended up there.  Funny thing is I never realized that until today…. I don't know what has clicked in my brain but I woke up this morning and realized that everything bad in my life has been from alcohol and everything good from abstinence of it.  Early in my college years is when I dove head first into alcohol, I ruined my reputation, slept with strangers, lost keys, money, phone, dignity… Fast forward 2 years (also 2 years ago) I realized I needed to change.  But I always related the change to working out and losing weight.  I would see my life getting better because I was working out and eating right.. WHICH MEANT NOT DRINKING.  Last year, I decided to take this to the next level and compete in a bodybuilding competition (which I did not because I landed an amazing internship) but for a solid 8 months I did not drink.  I have just returned from my internship where I had an occasional glass of wine with coworkers (wouldn't want to embarrass myself in front of CEO) and I went out with my friends to celebrate since I ""was allowed to"" drink now (since not dieting for show).  Well that was about a month ago and it took up until today to realize all those good things happened in my life not because I got in great shape but because I stopped drinking.  WOW IT LOOKS SO OBVIOUS TO ME NOW.  

So, after the past few weeks I have drank probably 4 times and each time I made a horrible decision/something bad happened. 
first time - got back with alcoholic/druggie x
second time - embarrassed myself and did more drugs
third time - tried new drugs and lost phone
fourth time - ate cheese and I'm lactose intolerant (if you are you will understand this lingered for days LOL)

So here I am, about to graduate, thinking, where do I want life to take me? What kind of life do I want to live? - - I want to live the best life I can and inspire people to do the same! 

And then I realized I cannot do this if I continue to drink, nor do I believe I will fulfill my purpose in life if I do.  I haven't drank in 7 days and I honestly feel that now there is no going back.  I have now realized what my inner demon is and there is no way I can go on romanticizing my drinking the way I was.  The more I think into it, the more angry it makes me for not realizing sooner.. but I have also been afraid I believe.  Afraid of changing my life and saying goodbye to the booze.  

So I am saying it because I'm ready to start living my life, GOODBYE!"

So while on the topic he asks me if I'm dating someone; I've been out for so long I'm actually over/beyond the whole proclamation each time, and just talk about it when it comes up or I get asked.
I comment on dudes and stuff, so it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together, but still, the guy clearly wanted to approach it in the most sensible way possible.

I tell him ""I've been with a guy for 3 years"", and he's so gobsmacked; I mean fair enough, 3 years is a pretty big deal at 24, but he's my same age and had the same gf for 8 years. 

His reaction made me think: is it still so unheard of of gay guys who are in a committed relationship?
Is his reaction a byproduct of the (stereo)typical portrayal of gay men as promiscuous man-eaters, or was he simply caught off-guard by my NBD attitude towards my sexuality?

2i7vwi,3,2014-10-03,Graduating this semester and feeling overwhelmed,StannisTheMannis13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i7vwi/graduating_this_semester_and_feeling_overwhelmed/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions. I’m graduating this fall and am just feeling really overwhelmed at the moment at the prospect of finding a job. 

I’m graduating a semester early and have only one summer internship under my belt. My internship was a joke (i.e. excel spread sheet pivot tables) and I only ended up doing compsci related work during the last two weeks, and had a difficult time completing it because no one really gave me the time of day when it came to asking questions, and the company I was working at had me using a computer that didn’t have most of the software to edit files (yay for notepad++).

I started out in IT and switched a few semesters ago when I realized that the same amount of math was required to complete both IT and my track of computer science. I decided to switch because I assumed it meant job stability and higher pay, not because I enjoy programming. Most of my classes involve web dev type stuff and mainframe classes, which I’m fairy competent at and feel most comfortable with. But other than that…to put it bluntly, I’m not a good programmer. Most of my class assignments in courses like Data Structures and OOD were completed by collaborating with other classmates. I don’t feel confident in my ability to code and reading job descriptions make me feel like most concepts went over my head. 

I applied to several part-time/student jobs in my college’s IT department and interviewed for a few, but I was turned down. I interview well (probably because most of the interviews don’t involve technical questions) but I believe it’s most likely due to the fact that I’m about to graduate and they’d rather have someone who will be working for them longer than 2.5 months. When I graduate I plan on moving to another state once I’ve secured a job (I’ll be starting the job seek very soon), so while I’d love to have a job here to get some more experience until I move, I just don’t know if I can secure one in time. I also don’t want to focus my efforts on securing a temporary job when I should be looking for one where I plan to move.

I’m not really sure where this is going. I’m just scared that **if** I even get a job, I won’t know what the hell I’m doing and I’ll get fired. I’ve been told that this is a common feeling for new graduates but I was just looking for some advice or personal anecdotes that might help. Thanks in advance.

[Edit]
Wow, thanks for the all messages. Some answers to FAQs:
1. When you write, please include as much information as possible. If you just say ""I'm interested"", you give me nothing to work with. Eventually I'm going to need your resume, CV, GitHub, portfolio, website, whatever you have, so you might as well include as much information as possible about your experience. 
2. We can't hire people without experience in data science.
3. New grads are eligible, but only new grads from graduate programs, and only those with experience or internships in data science roles.
4. All data science roles are in SF, but if you're in another city and you love Uber and data science, you might be a great fit for an operations role in your home city. Message me!
5. Most importantly, you must have a solid answer to this question: Why do you want to work for Uber data science, and what would you want to work on if you started tomorrow? (This will help: http://blog.uber.com/uberdata/)
[/Edit]

Hi friends, 

Uber data science is hiring in San Francisco. We have more than 10 open positions in data science, because there’s so much work to do. Why? Because we are building dozens of new products, and continually tweaking and rebuilding our core products. Lots of internal teams are asking for data science support. That's what happens when you demand truly data-driven decisions. :) 

Why come work for Uber? It’s a data wonderland. We have every GPS point from every Uber trip ever taken, in 216 cities and 45 countries, going back to 2009. We have hundreds of thousands of instrumented vehicles moving around the streets of 55 of the largest 100 cities in the world. In Manhattan, for example, on-duty Uber vehicles cover 80% of the island’s streets every five minutes. You will have access to 100% of this data. Can you build a model to predict whether a given partner will accept a dispatch? Can you figure out the best way to dispatch cars in a high-demand, low-supply situation? Can you make it work for Panama City, Beijing, and Bogatá?

Want to run an experiment on cross-harbor dispatch in Hong Kong? Go ahead. Think you can improve marketplace efficiency with a better surge algorithm? Deploy it.

I would like to hear from you if you have a graduate degree in a quantitative field, you’ve got some serious stats skills, and you enjoy programming. I'm an analyst on the data science team, not a recruiter. Direct message me if you're interested, please include information about your data science background, and we can exchange email from there.

Two weeks passed. Two weeks of nothing, no word from Leyva; no threats, no communication, nothing. 

Since Kimberley Bachmann’s death, her parents, Gregory and Audrey were in protective custody. Apparently the mother was so hysterical she’d been sedated since they heard of Paul’s death. She didn’t know Kimberly was dead. Amelia, her brother Simon  and her two sisters, Chelsea and Portia were all in a safe house. Veronica Yu had made a statement and refused protective custody. We had an unmarked car watching her apartment. 

Ash had been leading the investigation, with huge pressure from Capt. Thomas, who was generally just being an fucking ass. The press had been given a basic statement, but we tried desperately to contain any details of the investigation. The last thing we wanted was to spook Leyva, or give him a sick glory by making him infamous. 

This is the worst part, the waiting. Nothing was happening in the real world, but the evidence was mounting. 

Paul Bachmann’s autopsy revealed Leyva had removed his tongue before killing him. The word “AUTHOR” was cut into his back. It was only revealed when the body was cleaned down before examination. Curiously, crime scene investigators found a bag at Bachmann’s apartment full of neatly folded, blood stained clothes. DNA results proved the blood to be Paul Bachmann’s and there was DNA from the wearer – believed to be Leyva. If he had calmly folded his clothes and changed at the scene, there was a potential Leyva had left the crime scene in different clothes. There was no way of telling anything from Paul Bachmann’s closet was missing, he lived alone. CCTV showed no non-resident entering or leaving the building within hours of Bachmann’s murder. We interviewed Every. Single. Damn. Resident. In that building. Also, we were unable to determine who called in Paul’s murder; 911 received a call around 10pm reporting a break in, but it wasn’t from Paul Bachmann or any of his neighbours, doorman or cleaning staff. Investigation could only conclude it was Leyva himself. I listened to that recording hundreds of times, but it simply made no sense. 

“911 what’s your emergency?”
“I think someone’s breaking in upstairs.”
“What’s your name Sir?”
“Michael Stanley.”
“Where are you located?”
“(Address.) Come soon, I can hear glass breaking.”
“Sir are you in any immediate danger?”
“No Ma’am, I’m in my apartment.”
“Okay, stay there, don’t leave your apartment, we’re sending a car to you.”

Michael Stanley was a broker who lived below Bachmann – and he was away in Dubai for three months. We searched the apartment but there was no evidence anyone had been there since the cleaning lady two days before. We contacted Mr Stanley, who was definitely in Dubai and had no knowledge of a 911 call. 

Kimberly Bachmann’s death was clearly more violent, although there was no evidence of a struggle. CCTV saw her enter the building with a man at around 11pm. Unsurprisingly, he avoided showing his face to the camera, which cemented my thought that Leyva was smart and his killings were premeditated. 

The level of violence at the Kimberley scene told us that the crime was in some way… personal. The level of rage it took to literally club someone’s skull apart was, by any stretch, difficult to imagine. Tissue samples were collected at the scene and the team were able to piece together the skull; Kimberly had been struck innumerable times with a large, blunt object that made an unusual impression in the reconstructed skull, it wasn’t a weapon we knew of, maybe some kind of bat or club. Kimberley’s tongue had also been removed with a sharp, surgical grade knife and on her back was the word “JAMES”.  At the scene again, we found a nondescript bag of neatly folded clothes, stuck together with brain tissue and blood spatter.

Two weeks became three weeks, and still nothing. All we had was a poor quality photo booth photo, a basic height and build description and no Leyva. Our entire team had eyes and ears on the streets, but nobody knew this guy. We had a few stops and starts, but aside from a few poor eyewitness accounts at some society parties and casting calls, nobody could tell us anything about the guy. He was a nobody. 


It was a cold Thursday afternoon, the kind where you take a breath and almost sneeze because it’s just so damn cold. I had a rare day off and went to visit my Mother at her residential care home. Normally I go alone, but this time I brought a visitor.

“Jack!” she recognised me instantly. Today was a good day. 
“Hi Mom.” I held her close for a moment, grateful she knew my face. 
“I was just having tea.” She gestured to the table next to her, set up with an old timey tea pot and fancy china cups. They were from our home in England. 
“And who is this?” my Mom didn’t sound confused, in fact, she was happier than I’d seen her in a long time. 
“Oh god, sorry, this is my friend, Christina. Christina is a Doctor.”
“Oh my so lovely to meet you! Sit.” I missed my Mom when she wasn’t on a good day, and it was a risk bringing Christina here, but somehow it felt right. Safe. She makes me pour the tea and they both talk about Christina’s intern placement, my Mom’s life back in England and how she misses it, in fact, my Mom has almost perfect recall today. It was almost a perfect afternoon.
“Oh and guess who came to see me the other day?”
“Uhm, Mrs Laker?” she was our neighbour from when my Mom lived in my childhood home. 
“No! Your brother.” Ah, shit.
“Mom…”
“And he’s cut his hair, I almost didn’t recognise him.”
“Mom…” I feel tense, my stomach hurts and I just for once don’t want to deal with my brother and my Mom and my family history. Just once.
“In fact… he left something for you. For your birthday.” She gets up and starts opening drawers on her dresser. This has happened before, but normally she tells me Harry doesn’t visit, or asks if he’s doing well in school. “Here.”
She hands me a blue envelope, sealed shut. I feel trepidation, but I carefully open the envelope at the bottom fold. 

It’s a birthday card. 

My brother had been dead for twenty years. 

I open up the generic, well wishing card and with adrenaline running through my veins, the letters are all written under hard pressure from a blue biro.

ON YOUR BIRTHDAY
MAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
MAY HE BLESS YOU, DETECTIVE 




For the next week, I tried to sleep. With the best will in the world, logically I knew I’d be no good to the investigation fatigued. Ash insisted I go home, but I ended up lying down on a couch in one of our victim’s support rooms. Usually meant for families and non custodial parties, it wasn’t ideal to attempt to sleep there but I couldn’t go home.

At some point, I drifted off only to be woken by my cell buzzing in my jacket pocket. I fumbled for it, still half asleep. 

“Detective Harper.”
“I like your friend.” The voice was without tone or any kind of warmth; like cold hail on concrete. 
“Who is this?” I was awake now, sitting upright. 
“Your redheaded doctor friend. I doubt she’s a natural redhead though.”
I consider trying to get hold of Ash, or anyone, but I need to keep whoever this is on the phone.
“Who is this?”
“I shouldn’t worry, Detective, I’m sure she’ll be fine on her walk home in the early hours of the morning. All alone.”
“Are you threatening me?”
“Oh no. Threats are for angry people. I’m not angry. I just wanted to congratulate you on your excellent investigation. I’m sure you’ll catch your man soon.” The voice sounds vaguely amused, calm. Too calm for this to be a normal conversation.
“Why are you calling me, Mr Leyva?”
Silence for a moment. “Maybe I wanted to hear your voice. I’m enjoying the game, but it will too soon be all over. We can’t play forever.”
“I don’t consider homicide a game, Mr Leyva. Are you ready to give yourself up?”
“I’d say at this point, Detective, no. I hope you enjoyed my art work, but I do have to go now. It was nice to hear your voice, Jack Harper.” He didn’t hang up.  “I suggest you check your desk, Detective Harper. I sent you a birthday gift. Goodbye.” He terminated the call. 

It was 7am on February 13th, my birthday. 

I headed straight to Ash, only to find he’d gone home to rest for few hours. I didn’t blame him, but I needed to get someone to find out where Leyva was calling from. I had no doubt in my mind he’d make it that easy, but we had to turn over every rock.  
“Angelina, can you find out where he was calling from, asap and can you send a squad car over to Mount Sinai and check on Dr Christina Angelo? Send someone to her home address if necessary, Levya just made a threat.” the department was a hive of activity, the Commissioner had pulled out all the stops with pressure from the Mayor.  The Bachmann family were rich and influential – which meant our resources were pretty much unlimited, even three weeks in with no further evidence.

Our mission control room was just one of our meeting rooms set up to be the hive of the investigation. Images of ‘Marissa’, Paul and Kimberley are pinned to huge cork boards; it’s just like on TV in that sense. I can hear the local TV station somewhere, and I catch a few sound bytes as I walk down the hall – “…NYPD are yet to release names of any suspects, a source close to the department tells us CBS New York that the investigation is being headed by Detective Daniel Ash and Captain Nicholas Thomas of the homicide division. Last night’s activity is not thought to be involved with the ongoing Bachmann Investigation.” Captain Thomas my ass, he was clearly at home having breakfast with his wife. Or his Mistress. 

I make it to my desk and immediately see a red Hermes purse sitting on my desk. It’s the same red Hermes purse Amelia Bachmann put on my in tray just over twenty four hours ago. I feel sick. 

There’s barely anyone in the office, they’re either involved in the investigation or they’re out on calls; these kind of incidents can cause mass hysteria, hence Ash not releasing any suspect details to the press as yet. All we need is the public calling in every 6”2 white male with brown hair. 
I slip on some latex gloves from my pocket and for a second I wonder if Leyva has left me a bomb, but I guess that’s not his style. The purse looks normal, as purses go, and I carefully look inside. 

Black and white photographs. Hundreds of them, it seems. Ash, outside his home, talking on his cell. Ash again, smoking in his car, outside cafes, talking to informants on the street. Doctor Angelo leaving the hospital. Me. Me outside the precinct, me getting coffee at Starbucks. Amelia Bachmann, outside the precinct on the day she came to report Leyva’s threats, carrying her Hermes purse. Getting into a town car. Paul Bachmann on his way to work. Kimberly Bachmann in the park with a friend, walking a dog. Marissa, the call girl, sitting on a bed, looking up into the camera. Smiling. Sophie Blackwater, standing on a balcony somewhere at night, looking out over the city. Me again, outside the residential home. My Mom, sitting, drinking tea and smiling, thinking Leyva is my brother, Harry. 

For a moment I just cover my face. Leyva has been moving closer and closer to us over the last three weeks and we’ve missed it. Up until he left me a birthday card, he was able to get in to see my Mom. He was smart, charming and people put trust in him. Kimberley, Marissa, Amelia. Maybe even Paul. Getting my cell number wouldn’t have been hard if he had Amelia’s purse, with my card in. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. 

I call Ash. 

“Dan, Leyva has just had a package delivered here, it’s Amelia’s purse. Photographs of us inside. My Mom, Christina, the vicitims… he’s fucking watching us, you need to get here and get here quick.”
“Jack… what the fuck?”
“Dan, I don’t have time to explain please get to the station and watch your fucking back, okay?”
“Ok.” He sounds confused, but he’s on his way, he’s good like that, he just… believes me. 

Angelina comes running in – “Just confirmed, Dr Angelo is at work. Uniform are going to stay at the hospital but she’s refusing to leave.”
Typical. Christina Angelo is a woman after my own heart. 


I think of my Mom, confused as to why all my nice Police friends are constantly visiting. Sitting outside her door, watching over her. I think of Christina, working in the ER among stab victims and kids with burns and I think of Audrey Bachmann, almost catatonic with sadness at losing her son. Too many Mothers have lost children in this case. Audrey has lost two. Sophie Blackwater’s parents still don’t know what happened to their daughter. Marissa, well, she’s somebody’s baby too and I just feel rage. I feel unadulterated, pure white hot rage. 

“Jack, are you okay? You’re shaking.”
“Just… get this to evidence, Angelina… he’s closing in on us.”




Two hours later, Ash and I are in a side room, away from the activity. We need peace to talk out the case so far, examine the evidence. 
This is Police work. Long hours, unforgiving suspects and destroyed families. It’s bleak and dark and it’s on our doorstep today. 
Ash runs his hands through his hair and I swear he’s got greyer, older since the investigation began. 
“So here’s what we know; Leyva definitely killed Paul and Kimberley Bachmann. He’s most likely killed Marissa and Sophie. He has show intent to me, you, Christina Angelo, Amelia Bachmann and your Mom.” 

I practically have my head on the table in exhaustion, but something was keeping me going. Maybe it was anger, I don’t know. “We have no body for Marissa, we don’t even know her last name. We have DNA evidence that matches no-one in the system, we don’t have Sophie Blackman’s body, we don’t have sweet fuck all, Ash. We have nothing except some crazy notebooks, a photograph collection and some clothes at the Bachmann scenes. Amelia Bachmann is still in protective custody. She lost her purse and its entire contents when she was coming back to town after Paul was murdered. We. Have. Nothing.”

Ash has all the photos from the scenes laid out in front of us. I press my fingers onto my closed eyes for a moment. “Dan… we’ve been over this a hundred times.”
“Then let’s make it a hundred and one.” 
I sigh, frustrated. Back then I was a new detective, impatient and personally afflicted. Ash passes me the evidence logs for both scenes and suddenly I see something that shouldn’t be there. 

Officer H Harper

“Dan… there’s definitely no other Harper here, is there?”
“Thankfully for me, no.” He’s chewing again. 
I turn the paper round and point to the page. 
“Right, so someone took your name wrong?”
“No. It’s on both scene logs. Different uniform Officers.”
Ash cranes his head over and looks again. “Lutz and Mahoney. What did they log in?”

“That’s the thing. Nothing.” 

“So they were on the scene but they did nothing?” Ash is rifling through papers. “Wait – shit – Jack, Officer Harper was the guy who was at the Kimberly Bachmann scene when our boys got there… Lutz spoke to him and… FUCK! He took the first statement from the doorman at Paul Bachmann’s scene.”

“What Precinct is he from; badge number?”

Ash swings round in his chair to an archaic computer behind him and furiously starts tapping like a Secretary in a movie, making busy noise. Suddenly, he stops and leans back.  

“What?” my mouth has gone dry.

“Did you ever lose your badge? Misplace it?”

“Never. Why?”

“It’s your fucking badge number.”

I get up and take a look at the screen. There it is, my number, my name, my face. DET. JACK HARPER. 

Ash is quiet for a moment. “Have you ever used a dupe?”

Duplicate badges are fucking illegal, but let’s just say if an officer loses his badge on a Saturday night whilst having a few too many drinks, he’s not going to want to report it. 

“Never.” 
“Someone either has your badge, or duped your badge, and they’re using it at our crime scenes.”

I check the witness statement again. Officer H Harper. I try to keep my voice from shaking. “Ash. Run Harold Harper.”

“There’s like, 45 in this area alone.”

I swallow. It’s dry. “Try Harold Harper, 14th January, 1974.”

“Jack why…?” Ash turns and sees my face, and immediately runs it. 
“Okay… Harold James Harper, born January 1974, died August 17th, 1984…wait, Harold James Harper, born 14th January 1974, registered address… Powell Avenue, Bronx NYC. Lived there since… 2003.”

There’s just silence. 

“This is too much of a co-incidence, Dan.” My legs feel like they’re going out from under me and I sink down into the vacant chair. 

“It’s a pretty common name, Jack.”

“Same birthday?”

Ash taps away on the computer. “Same social security number.”
More silence. Ash has stopped chewing. 

“Harry’s dead, Dan.” He looks at me with tired eyes. “I know he’s dead.”

“Someone is using his identity.”

“Leyva. He’s fucking with us, he wants to outsmart us and leave a breadcrumb trail. He’s luring us into the candy house.”

“Jack…”

“We need to get to Powell Avenue.”

I hear Ash sigh deeply. “Jack if you…”

“I don’t want off the case, Dan. We need to end this.”




At Powell Avenue, we find a new renter who is very confused as to why fifteen memembers of the NYPD are on her doorstep. After brief questioning, we ascertain they’d moved in only four months ago, oddly co-incidental with Leyva’s sudden latch onto Veronica Yu. 

A search of the property yields nothing, but I step around the back into a large, green area. It’s pretty, and even though it’s a bitingly cold day, I can hear children playing somewhere nearby. Ash joins me whilst the team are searching inside. 

“This is a very nice garden.” His voice is slightly loaded as he lights up a cigarette. 
Before I can reply, an older woman with her hair in curlers leans over a neighbouring fence. “It is a nice garden. Our old neighbour put it in.”

Ash smiles his charming old ladies smile “Oh yeah, what was your old neighbour like?”

“Oh, he was so nice. He’d help anyone out! Did this garden up real pretty too.”

“Was this… - Ash pretends to check his notebook – Mr…Harper?”

“Yes! Mr Harper! He would always help me with my shopping. He always worked on this garden; even in the Winter. He kept funny hours, said he couldn’t sleep.”

“Funny hours?”

“Yes, I think he worked shifts or something. I think he said he worked for the Police.” She noses around the garden, obviously looking to see what we’re up to.

“Did you catch Mr Harper’s first name, Mrs…?”

“Mrs Lobo, yes, it was Harry. Nice boy. Are you investigating that boy Tony from upstairs? I think he’s dealing drugs, you know.”

“Thank you, Mrs Lobo. I can’t comment on the investigation but thank you so much.” Ash grins, she smiles and with one last craning-neck look around, she heads back indoors. 

Ash looks at me. I know what he’s going to say, so I say it first.
“Let’s get digging.”



By 5:30, we’ve set up three forensic tents, have a helicopter flying over and eight residents are in a nice hotel for the night. We’ve found the remains of what looks like a woman, badly decomposed, but somehow I know it’s Marissa. The body is in three pieces, a head, a torso and the limbs are buried separately. No hands or feet anywhere. 

By 9:30 we’ve found a second body. Male. No torso. 

At 10:45pm we find a third body. Ash comes out of the forensic tent and motions for me to follow him. He doesn’t speak. 

I look down into the hole. It’s a decent depth, at least six foot. The body was practically a skeleton. What we call dry; the final stage of decomposition. A CSI hands me an evidence bag, and in it is a necklace. Valuable. Huge blue stone set in diamonds. It’s Sophie Blackwater’s. 

My heart sinks deep in my chest. Logically I knew Sophie was dead, but somehow, despite all the bodies in this case, this makes me the saddest. I see her parents, struggling through tears, pleading for their missing daughter to get in contact. The slow reaction of the investigation when it transpired they’d had a major argument the week before her disappearance. “Sophie, if you are watching this, please call. Please come home. We love you and we’re sorry. Please… please come home. We love you.” 

Now she was gone. 

Ash breaks the silence. “The press are outside.”

“Probably one of the neighbours.” 

“Thomas is on his way.”

“Excellent.”

“British-American sarcasm?”

“Something like that.” I’m still holding Sophie’s necklace. I’m holding it again ten hours later when I speak to her parents. Devastated isn’t the word. 



There is no adequate word to explain the agony of losing a child. I can’t describe to you what is sounds like when you have to tell a parent their child is gone. How it sounds like screaming and gasping and crying. It’s not a wail or a cry or a sob. It’s so much more. It’s the sound of your heart breaking. Unless you’ve heard it, you can’t possibly imagine. 

Marissa’s DNA is in the system. Her name is Marcie Jonas and she’s from Mosheim, Tennessee. She’s 26 years old. Ash calls her Father and I hear the sound from across the room. As if someone has stabbed a man in the heart. 

 


That night, nobody calls. We have the kind of night that goes by in slow motion. Ash doesn’t even chew any gum, he just reads over case notes and analyses photographs. I catch him occasionally chewing on a pencil, but it’s silent. It’s so quiet in the office.

Midnight hits and I realise I’ve just missed my birthday. I don’t care. Sophie Blackwater, Marcie Jonas, Paul and Kimberley Bachmann, they won’t have any more birthdays. 

My Brother’s tenth birthday was in January 1984. By the end of the summer, it was his last ever birthday. I don’t think my Mother ever truly recovered from that day in August, 1984. I remember it was hot that day. The kind of sunny day that makes you believe nothing can ever be bad again. By Christmas, my Father had moved out. In February 1985, my Mother forgot my fifth birthday. She never forgave herself. 


The clock on the wall shows five minutes past 4 on the morning of February 14th, 2004. The office is silent. Ash has fallen asleep on his paperwork. I let him rest, he’s exhausted. There are three people in the mission control room and there is no sound in the building. No faxes whirring, no traffic outside, everything is still. 

Most critically ill people die in the 4am window. 

I was born at 4am on Feburary 12th, 1978.

At exactly twenty-five years and 24 hours, six minutes and seventeen seconds after I was born, my cell display lights up, violently buzzing on the table. Ash sleeps on. I reach out and turn the display over, expecting it to be Christina finishing a shift, or my Mom asking me where she left her glasses. 

Its 4:06am. 

Somebody is calling me. I focus my tired eyes and see who it is. 




HARRY HARPER CALLING





It’s 4:06am and I’ll never sleep right again.

I was thinking something along the lines of project manager combines technical knowledge as well as business practices. What are some other jobs I should look at or what other advice do you have for someone in my position? What internships should I seek out for the summer? Thanks"
2i84o5,8,2014-10-03,Me [23 M] with my GF [29 F] have been dating for 3 years. She's been telling me that we are not on the same page and that she feels we've lost our connection.,Spaceknightx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i84o5/me_23_m_with_my_gf_29_f_have_been_dating_for_3/,"So when we first met on internships, everything was great. We spent almost every waking day together and became very close. The age difference was acknowledged, but it never bothered us, because our maturity levels were equal. Then we had to move back to our home town, and our dynamics changed a little bit. We both lived at home, and I still had 2 years of school while she found a new job to work at. Things were still great, but I had to leave back to the city where we met for a 8 month internship again. The city was only 3 hours away, so it was only semi-long distance. But it was during this time that I felt things began to deteriorate slowly. Then I came back after the work term, and had 1 and half year of school left. She was unhappy with her job, and 2 months before I graduated, I helped her find her current job, which is a 10 days on, 4 days off rotational job on site. It pays extremely well and she is doing well. Then I graduated, went on vacation with her for 2 weeks and then left for another month and a half trip with a friend to Asia. I'm skimping on a lot of details, but I just wanted to give a brief timeline of our relationship. 

Anyways, so she's been telling me for the past half year or so, that she feels we are on different pages. Me leaving to asia for several months didn't help. She was referring to in terms of marriage, children and our future together. I had an opinion about it when she asked me, but I had slightly different ideas than her. Whenever she first talked about those topics, I was kinda caught off guard and gave an improvised opinion at the time, which she saw as hesitation. Anyways, our communication was poor and she kept saying we were on different pages throughout. I didn't quite understand what she meant, and we had a lot of fights. I tried really hard to make things better and put in a lot of effort doing things that she liked. But nothing worked and I was frustrated. I tried desperately to work on our communications and things seemed to be picking up here and there. 

After a really good talk couple weeks ago, she texts me saying we need to talk while she was away on work. It was kinda the same argument and conversation that we've had before in the past, except this time, she was very firm and adamant about her opinion. I had always been able to resolve our conflict our text and the phone, where we usually end up both apologizing and moving on. But this time, she wouldn't. She simply said she needed space and time and felt that we lost our connection. So for the next week, we didn't communicate. And I went through a rollercoaster of emotions. I knew what was coming when she got back. I called my friends for support and we talked, and I gained a lot of perspective. My emotions were high, and I went through being angry, sad, apathetic, frustrated and more. But after detailing our problems (more than I'm describing here, it really is quite long and hard to discuss) and going for some long drives and thinking, I came to some self-awareness and realization. I realized that I've been lacking empathy for her. I physically listened to her, but she always felt unheard because I would have trouble actually understanding her concern, from her point of view. So I went through a period of reflection, and I wrote down all the things that I wanted to touch on regarding myself, her and our relationship together. I recently began to write down things I want to say when we talk, so that I am not driven by emotions and so that I don't forget whatever it is that I want to say.

Anyways, so I pick her up from the airport. We talk, hug and touch. But obviously I can tell something's wrong. We get to her house and we talk. She says she's tired of feeling like she needs to do things to please me, to cater to my whims. She feels tired of being judged by me and not feeling heard. And I figured as much, during my week of reflection. I told her what I'd been reflecting on, and what I've figured out. I mainly focussed it around my lack of empathy, negative energy and emotional neglect I had during our time away that resulted in a majority of the problems in our relationship. I assured her that I wanted to be with her in the future as her lifelong partner. She pretty much agreed and was surprised that I was able to cover everything in such detail and accuracy to what she was thinking. I asked her if she still loved me enough to meet me halfway to work things through so that we'd be able to share ourselves with each other again. She said she doesn't know. She said she's not sure where's she's at right now, if the damage I've done is too much and if we can have our connection back. We then proceed to embrace, cuddle and joke around for the next 2 hours. We joked about everything. At point, she even said attraction's not the issue, that it's the emotional aspect. We wrestle and talk like we used to for hours. But every now and then, she'd remind me that she still needs to do some thinking and that we need to take a step back. I try to probe the question of whether we are still seeing each other, but the answer was ambiguous, but she seemed certain that she wouldn't be seeing any other guys, and still is attracted to me. We go to bed, have sex and fall asleep cuddling each other. We wake up, things are still good, except she's leaving the city today for a girls trip to celebrate her upcoming birthday at the nearby city that we met. She told me she needed to be alone to do her own things. I understood this, and again, we hugged, joked and embraced. We thanked each other for the honesty and openness last night. Again, she just says she's not sure if we can recover back to before the damage was done, and that it will take time and then we parted ways.

Now, personally, I feel a lot better now that we've been open about everything in our relationship. Last night before we slept, we talked about this being a clean slate, and new beginning. And that anything negative in the past, would never be brought up again. And that in future, if we had any problems with each other, we would speak about it immediately. So I was hopeful, but a little disappointed when she hit me with the still needed time talk in the morning. I feel optimistic about our relationship, based on her reactions and intimacy towards me, yet I am still apprehensive because I am unsure of the future. So right now, I feel like I am kinda in the chasing phase of a new relationship all over again. Where we don't text and talk to that much, but still respond positively occasionally. Where we don't know exactly what each other thinks about each other, but still enough to know that they like us. Where I am trying my hardest to impress her and make her feel like she belongs with me. It feels good and bad at the same time. Anyways, I haven't hashed out a concrete plan going forward, but my general attitude at the moment is to just be the best version of myself going forward. Stay positive, and do things that remind her of why she loved me, and also new things to let her know why she should continue loving me. She said it's fine if I don't get her a birthday present. But I recently planned to go to her bedroom and leave 29 balloons, with old photos of us tied to them, and a present on her bed. I think it's really thoughtful, and remind her how much she means to me.

---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend is a bit older than me, she wants a future. I've been quite negative, judgemental, lacking empathy and overall not a very fun person to be around lately, due to a variety of personal conflicts. She gave me the dreaded we need to talk, I spend the week reflecting, and I basically realize it's my lack of empathy that made her feel unheard in the relationship. We talk, and I detail my reflection to her, and she is surprised that I am able to pinpoint her concerns so accurately. We embrace, and are physically intimate but she is still hesitant about the damage that's been done to our relationship and connection or spark. She says she needs time to think and to do her own things. I am trying to determine the best plan of attack going forward that will allow us to remain together. So far, I've decided to play it cool and stay positive. To be thoughtful and do things to remind her why she loved me before and why she should keep loving me. I feel like I am sort of in the chasing phase of a new relationship all over again. I'm looking for advice on a plan going forward and what you guys think my chances of success are here. I know I glossed over some details here, but it really is very long to talk about, so if anyone has questions to clarify, feel free to ask.

**tl;dr of the tl;dr**: I've been feeling quite negative and been unable to empathize lately, and girlfriend has felt unheard and unable to connect with me like she used to. We had a big talk about feelings and I now understand what her concerns were, and I feel optimistic and positive going forward. We are intimate and joke around playfully, but she still keeps saying she needs time to think."
2i8j4c,1,2014-10-03,Empyreus: Technology,[deleted],OrbitTen,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrbitTen/comments/2i8j4c/empyreus_technology/,"**Androids**

Androids are complex, advanced robots built to replace and mimick humans and to make the lives of people more easy and less stressful. They are used in all aspects of life, work, recreation, and combat. Androids are not loved by all as they often replace people at jobs in almost every industry and some people believe they are dangerous and unnatural. Androids are classified into three different types: Combat, Service, and Companion. There is a forth classification simply called ""hybrids."" Hybrids are defined as any android that has features and functions of two or more of the other classifications. Hybrids are typically custom builds or designs, more expensive, and less common.

- *Combat*

 Combat androids come in many variations and styles, from nimble quick metallic skeletal frames to thick armored bulky juggernauts. There are also non-humanoid combat droids which often get wrongly classified as combat androids in common speak, these include dog like police hunting droids or flying scout drones with mounted machine guns. Combat androids programmed to use lethal weapons are only legally sold to W.A.R.D and the military, though nonlethal combat androids can be bought for the purposes of security and personal defense. Combat androids can all run different combat programs of varying degrees of complexity, the more complex typically the more reliable and lethal in combat, though more basic combat programs increase processing time, giving the android better reflexes and quicker movements. Simple programs are also less susceptible to hacking and viruses as they are easier to encrypt and identify problems in the code. Combat androids are built for function not style, they don't necessarily look very stunning or humanlike.

- *Service*

 Service androids are built for the sole purpose of serving and assisting humans in various aspects of life. In terms of look and design they are the middle ground between combat and companion androids. They are very humanoid and look closer to a human than a combat drone, typically designed with facial features and a casing looking similar to the morphology of a human, but without flesh or organic type action programs such as blinking. Service androids are either built for white collar work with incredibly fast data processors, huge memories and storage, and optimized for maximum efficiency; or they are built for manual labor, focusing on agility, grip, strength, and spacial processing. Service androids can be found doing jobs  in any assistant position one could think of, such as secretaries, nurses, interns, accountants, cashiers, and editors. They can also be found doing a lot of manual labor jobs like cleaning, carpentry and construction, shelf stocking, and even cooking.

- *Companion*

 Companion androids serve exactly the purpose one would expect, keeping people company and happy. They are designed to look and as human as possible, most having things like synthetic skin, heated bodies, and fully articulate facial muscles so they can show a full range of emotions. The designs aren't perfect however, companion androids  have oddly smooth skin and it is easy to see the small division lines where pieces of the outer shelling are fitted together, and places around the joints and points of rotation where synthetic skin plating would interfere with motion or movement. Most also have access panels somewhere on the body that leave an obvious mark or location to be opened, and when damaged their robotic skeletons are revealed, there is also a slight glow to their eyes. Some are also designed for sexual use aswell, though many are not designed for this purpose. Companion androids are outfitted with advanced AI technology and unique algorithms for emotion. These two things allow them to learn and adapt over time, aswell as give off the perception of personality and emotion. Companion androids are notorious for mimicking their owners actions or the personality qualities their owner seems to like in other people or gives positive feedback too. They are also well known for being very curious and inquisitive. Relationship statuses can be set with a companion android upon purchase, most commonly they are used as substitutes for friends, children, and spouses. Companion androids are able to help out with most simple household and recreational tasks, but not as well or efficiently as service androids. There are many ethical questions around companion androids: Whether or not they are healthy for their owners, if they are a reasonable substitute for human social interaction, and if beings that are able to think and learn and are designed to react to emotional stimulus are actually alive and deserve the same rights and respect as human beings.


**Cybernetics**

 Cybernetics are the pinnacle of modern bionic technology. They are robotic limbs and implants that can be attached to the body and connected directly to the brain to function like any other organic part of the body. Synthetic limbs and organs don't just function as well as the originals, they function better. Cybernetic arms can have incredibly high holding force, magnetic or tactile grip technology, enhanced strength, and even integrated accessories like blades or tablets/phones. Cybernetic legs are stronger and run faster, can have magnetic or tactile grip technology, have counterweights for enhanced balance, and even integrated devices like jump jets. Synthetic hearts and lungs have near unlimited capacities, pumping blood and oxygen more efficiently and longer than the organic versions. A person with a synthetic heart or lung can exert themselves for much longer before resting. synthetic eyes can see more clearly than regular eyes, they can be installed with countless features such as night vision or thermal vision, zoom, recording, and direct display uplinks to most technology including the internet. Synthetic ears can hear further and more clearly, aswell as ascertain the direction of sound more clearly. 

 Neural implants can increase a person's mental capabilities highly. A neural implant could increase things such as reaction time, ability to remember information, more attention to detail, photographic memory, enhanced processing and calculation, and less need for sleep.

 Cybernetics are not perfect, there is a limit on the number of cybernetics the human body can accept, the amount of cybernetic implants your body can accept is called your ""synthetic rejection threshold"" or SRT score (This will be part of character creation with a specific way to calculate it). The SRT score can be measured using advanced medical tests and is given in a percentage value, with 100% near fully synthetic, you could replace all of your limbs and major internal organs with cybernetics while also including neural implants, while the 0% is completely unable to accept cybernetic devices. The average SRT is around 55-60%, though it can vary greatly from person to person. Due to the ability to judge and test SRT, all cybernetics come with an SRT consumption rating aswell, the more complex the cybernetic the more SRT consumption it has. The only other issue with cybernetics is their susceptibility to EMP attacks and neural implants can be vulnerable to high level hackers aswell, those often these issue don't effect most people with cybernetic implants.

**Weapons**

Weapons technology came a very long way during the time of the threat of a 3rd world war was imminent, weapons are now at a high level in a world without an applicable conflict, this meant a lot of this technology is being used by W.A.R.D.

- *Firearms and ranged weapons.*

  Rifles have come a long way in terms of design, archaic weapons that use standard bullets are more reliable, have faster bullet velocities, more impact. Bullpup designs have become the more popular design now for ballistic weapons. Ballistic weapons have become less effective with the introduction new armors which can absorb high amounts of kinetic energy, however they do penetrate the cutting edge plasma shields quite well. In addition to the ballistic weapons plasma weapons are the new weapons of choice. They use plasma and electric energy to generate bright, fast, and incredibly hot projectiles, causing serious flesh wounds and burns. These weapons use ionized gas cartridges and energy cells as ammunition as opposed to bullets, the weapons use high amounts of energy per shot. Unfortunately plasma weapons are less reliable than ballistic ones, breaking down and missfiring more commonly. Plasma weapons also get incredibly hot after extended automatic fire. While plasma weapons rip through armor they seem to be less effective against energy shields due to those also being made of plasma, they shield counteracts and absorbs a lot of the energy behind the plasma projectile. A 3rd type of weapon that fits neither category is the Railgun, a weapon that uses electric charge and electromagnetic force to fire projectiles at incredibly high velocities. Railguns pierce energy shields and armor alike, the problem with railguns being the time they take to charge between shots, the high energy consumption requiring energy cells to be loaded frequently, and high recoil. The Railgun is a powerful but slow firing and complex weapon, though mastering it will make the wielder incredibly lethal in combat. Railguns and plasma weapons are also susceptible to EMP attacks. Most firearms are able to bemodified with optics which display ammunition count and can calculate range and wind and are able to zoom in to up to 6 times, laser/light combinations, and cybernetic and HUD connectivity, which allows the user to sync their weapon to a cybernetic eye or arm which displays the gun's ammo count, highlights targets and threats if they are connected by eye, and helps them compensate for recoil if connected by cybernetic arm. An uplink with a pair of smart glasses (glasses which have displays built in) can also yield the same functions as a cybernetic eye. Plasma weapons and railguns are more expensive than ballistic weapons, and the advanced attachments are quite pricey aswell.

- *Melee Weapons*

 Melee weapons have changed but in a sense stayed the same. Cybernetics are a majority of peoples' melee weapons, cybernetic arms being near lethal on their own. In addition to these there are archaic bludgeoning weapons that use gravity generators and hydraulics to swing with a force hard enough to shatter concrete. There are blades sharpened and modified with vibration generators, causing the blade to vibrate and easily slice through bone. Many swords and bladed weapons can also be made to conjure electric charge. In addition to these modified archaic weapons there are also energy blades, blades that are made out of projected plasma. 

- *Armor*  

  There are still archaic physical armor pieces even in the new age of plasma They are able to absorb high amounts kinetic energy and be less bulky than kevlar vests of the past, but still do not provide full protect and can do little in the face of a plasma weapon. The new technology is energy shields, plasma shields that form around part of or the entire body to protect the wearer. Energy shields are very effective against plasma weapons, the reason they were developed in the first place was to try and counter act plasma weapons. However they do not really have any sort of kinetic dampening force so ballistic weapons rip through the shields pretty easily. A small advantage energy shields have over kinetic armor is that an energy shield can recharge over time, however to every good there is a bad. Energy shields can be disabled by EMP attacks. Obviously energy shields are more expensive than physical armor.

 Power armor is the strongest form of physical armor, equivalent to the modern day version of plate mail. They are made of thinner lightweight versions of armor plates put on vehicles and androids. They are usually heavily modified with things like visor integrate HUDs, ventilators, jump jets, magnetic locks, VI's that assist in combat, and robotic exoskeletons that increase the strength of the wearer. While these suits of armor are incredibly powerful and turn the user into a juggernaut, they are very expensive, slow, and incredibly susceptible to EMP attacks. An EMP attack will shut down a suit of power armor, turning off the visor and causing the armor to lock up which leaves the wearer completely immobile until the system resets and recovers. 

- *Vehicles* 

  Military and police vehicles have not changed a whole lot since the old versions. Most have shield generators and more advanced weapons and armors, but not much more than that has really been modified. Military and police vehicles are the only ones that can legally disconnect from the Harmonized Transit System.

  ACVs are the latest in military vehicle technology. They are large walking vehicles, essentially ending up looking like large suits of human armor with heavy cannons and thick armor, They are like massive vehicle sized power armor suits, usually between 15-25 ft tall. There are more interesting ACVs aswell, W.A.R.D uses large 4 legged tank like ACV's which are capable of scaling the buildings of Empyreus to apprehend criminals.

  Air vehicles have changed in design, now more preferring a nimble 2 jet model replacing a typical helicopter rotor which uses propulsion jet technology to seriously improve handling and speed, with plasma weapons and missiles mounted on either wing. W.A.R.D has several of these vehicles which it uses in pursuits, assaults on towering buildings, and general transport quickly across the city.

2i8pu7,1,2014-10-03,Tips for improving development speed and not feeling like I need to know everything about the code I'm changing?,samwill10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2i8pu7/tips_for_improving_development_speed_and_not/,"I had an internship this summer at a company with a pretty fast-paced production cycle. I had a rough-and-tumble time because, due to pretty unlucky circumstances, every project I got assigned had to be put off/cancelled after ~3 weeks, which is pretty bad for a 12 week internship. 

At the end of the internship, I got told that, even taking into account how often my projects got switched on me, I wouldn't be getting an return offer for a full-time after I graduate this year because there was still a rough bar for how much code I could have written, and I didn't meet that. Thinking back over my projects, I agreed with my superiors. I took at least a week to get acclimated to the code I was working in each time I got a new project, and once I did feel ""comfortable"" with starting to write code, I often got stuck going down rabbit holes of trying to figure out how pieces of existing code worked together when I really didn't even need to know. I'm extremely detail-oriented, almost to a fault, and it slows me down a lot. This also renders me unsuccessful at hackathons because I end up spending too much time trying to figure out how to do something instead of just diving in and seeing what happens. 

Anyone have tips for getting over this mindset as I look for full-time work? Is there anything I can do to practice not being this way? It can be directly coding related, or just more general."
2i8q6u,4,2014-10-03,The Church of The Divine Barista (Beanism) (x post from r/parody),TheBaristasProphet,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2i8q6u/the_church_of_the_divine_barista_beanism_x_post/,"His Almighty Caffeinated Aprony holiness on the morning of October the 2nd the year of our espresso machine 2014, has bestowed unto me the blessing of his only begotten Beverage, born via immaculate conception between KEURIG™ and virgin (or it least it claims to be) ceramic mug and said, ""careful it's hot"", and then the following:

""Take this, you in thine flannel dressing gown, and drink it. For this is my coffee and shall be given unto you so that you may be filled of the spirit to get up off your fat ass and walk the dog.""

And lo, not more, and neither less than fifteen and three quarters of one minute after i had partaken of the brew from that holy vessel, His Divine Beaniness appeared to me with a paper cup and wrote the name(s) ""Alax/Saamm"" on it and said, ""take this which hath been filled of That Most Holy beverage and spread my word."" 
And, not wanting to incur the wrath of the Divine Percolator by correcting the insultingly wrong spelling of both my commonly names, I said, ""ok.""

He then placed an extra large green Post-it™ next to the virgin(debatable) ceramic mug and said, ""here are my 9 commandments.""

To which I replied, ""Lord, there are eleven here.""

To which he said, "" fine mister High school Fucking Diploma. They are my 9 plus two more commandments!""

So ever faithful to his Roastedness' I present These the the 9 two more commandments that His Espressoness dictated to me via green post-it note left next to the virgin(still in question) ceramic coffee mug:

 1.Thou shall not kill. I thought it might be refreshing to see this one at the top of the list.

 2.Unless thou hast been taken with ill humours due to unfortunate allergy, thou must in remembrance of the holy day of October the 2nd of 2014, which shall henceforth be called the immaculate brewing, partake of no fewer than 1-4 cups of That Most Holy Beverage each morning. Preferably before the pubs open.

 3.Thou shall not covet thy neighbors brew. Get thy fucking own thieving cur.

 4.The false prophets Maxwell house and Hills Bros are heathen scum whose brews are doubly sinful and icky.

 5.The preferred method method of preparation for That Most Holy Beverage is the same use by His Bittersweetness when he first appeared to Alix/Sem (still wrong). I do however understand that some people either can't afford a KEURIG™, or prefer more traditional methods of preparation, and therefore declare this one optional.

 6.While That Most Holy Beverage is the traditional method of attaining the tannin induced grace of His Groundness, thou should bear no ill will towards those who bask in His Caffeinated glory in a different manner (soda, 5 hour energy, tea, etc). At least they're trying. Just because some people are wrong doesn't necessarily make them bad people.
 
 7.Thou shall mind thine own Barista damned business.

 8.Those who deliberately desecrate That Most Holy Beverage (looking at you Starbucks) have sinned in my eyes. Such unholy flouters of Barista's law shall be charged with heresy, declared most uncool, de-apronned, excommunicated and their coffee forsaken by unpaid interns for all of eternity.

 9.Thou shall remember to honor the holy day of October the 2nd. On this day adherents shall brew an extra strong pot of That Most Holy Beverage, exchange biscotti, cookies and other appropriate dunk-able comestibles, and sing the holy hymns ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Ring of Fire"". On this day young adherents who hath reached the holy age of ""whenever their parents start allowing them to have caffeinated beverages"", shall participate in the Choosing of the Roast, in which, without assistance, they must choose a roast of fine blend and quality to be brewed into their first cup of That Most Holy Beverage.

 10.Thou shall not take my name in vain. Or do. I honestly don't give two percolating beans how refer to me. I'm not petty or oversensitive like some other deities that i won't name.

 11.This one is to be considered 2nd most important (after thou shall not kill). Thou should show thy reverence to the prophet Alux/Sæm (how hard is it to get those right) by buying him a vessel of That Most Holy Beverage if he should happen to be in town (please).

2i8qyv,2,2014-10-03,Loyalty and money or opportunity?,_RAZOR_,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2i8qyv/loyalty_and_money_or_opportunity/,"Sorry for the long post. I'm having a hard time working through this.  
  
I recently graduated from university with a degree in engineering at the top of my class. I worked a one year internship at a large construction company in project management related to my field of study. My experience went well and I got invited back the following summer with more money and more responsibility.  
  
The downside is that this industry requires constant travel. You are always on a project for 6-12 months, and you go wherever they assign you. On the upside, you are compensated very well in terms of a travel allowance.  
I had a hard time finding a more stationary job, so after graduation I asked if they would hire me full time. The president of the company said Yes, absolutely. I then got another offer - better salary and a better title, no living allowance but still always traveling (expenses paid - overall money comparable). I took it and said sorry to my old job.  
  
It was horrible, owner was a maniac, company is doomed to fail.  
  
After 3 days I wrote again to my old employer, they said they would still take me back, and that's where I work now 3 months later.  
  
I have been treated very well. Company truck. Better salary than other new grads (who also don't get a truck). They have great confidence in me and give me a lot of responsibility above what I should given my position. Its a fantastic learning experience and the people at the top all seem to have high hopes for me. Plus its a huge company.  I'm basically at the forefront of the biggest project the company has ever built, 3rd in command but currently holding the reins.  
  
But - living away from home and work life balance does not exist.  
  
Added complication - I'm newly engaged, saving for a wedding and a house with a mountain of student loans.  
  
So - I've recently been offered an interview through with a new company, all I need to do is apply. Once again better salary and better title. Plus I am acquainted with people who have worked there for 30+ years who rave about the working conditions and company as a whole. And . . . No travel! All local work! And in the end I would likely only take home a little bit less than I do now (85K after tax currently to ~100K before tax at new job).  
  
What to do?  
Try for the new job and possibly end up screwing an employer who has treated me very well AND given me a second chance? Me leaving right now would have a serious impact on this project (the largest they have built).  
  
I should add, 2 senior guys at the new company are retiring and looking for someone to step up and join the upper ranks.  My current company is larger with more entrenched upper management.  

  
Or - Stay at my current job, remain loyal, make good money, but possibly get shipped off even farther on my next assignment?  
  
Maybe I should reach out to the new company, express interest, but explain that I can't make a move right now but would like to be considered in the future?

2i91ug,4,2014-10-03,Canadian new grad (25yo) immigrating in the US for my first full time job. Need advice on what to expect and how to build a decent budget.,csnewgrad,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2i91ug/canadian_new_grad_25yo_immigrating_in_the_us_for/,"Hi everyone!


I have been lurking this sub for quite some time now. This is an incredible source of information. I just graduated and I'm about to start my career so I decided that it was finally time for me to actually ask for guidance. 


Here's a little bit about myself :


First of all, I've been lucky enough to study in a country where education is pretty cheap. For this reason, I'm graduating with zero student debt, and around $20k in savings ($4.5k of those being stocks in various tech companies). That money mostly comes from paid internships I did over the year. Also, I lived with my parent during college, so my expenses were pretty low.


As I said, in the next couple of weeks, I will be moving to the US to start my first full time job. I will be moving to a US city where the cost of living is on the higher side, but still much more affordable then for example New York City or San Fransisco area. (for example, a 1 bedroom apartment will be between 1100 to 1800/month depending on the location and size). Also, the state I will be in has no state income taxes (I guess this will probably narrow it down for you). (sorry for being kind of secretive about all this, it's just that I will be revealing a lot of personal information about compensation in this post and I think the company I will be working for would rather keep all of it private).

Once again, I've been lucky enough to graduate in a field that is in demands right now, and I will be making a little bit over $100k a year as a base salary. On top of that, I will receive around $20k as starting bonus, plus some vesting stocks that will receive over the next 4 years (around $50k in stocks). I will also receive all the benefits that relatively large company usually offer (full health coverage, team legal, etc.).

I don't really have any moving expenses (I don't really own anything) other than my plane ticket. This means that I should have access to maybe $30-35k in my starting month (what I currently have + signing bonus). I also plan on living in colocation with other employee of the company I work for (I'm getting a room in a big house for around 500$ a month) and I also don't plan on getting a car right now (public transport or bike should do the job for the moment). My objective is basically to live bellow my means so I can save as much as possible and start investing in real estate. I want to eventually own a small building with multiple apartment, maybe live in one and rent the rest. 

Also, I plan on maybe starting a part time master at the local university, and eventually start a full time MBA (in maybe 3-5 years). Finally, I want my girlfriend to join me in the US as soon as she finish her master (in Canada). She's studying law so it might be really hard for her to find a job in the US (different judiciary system), but the master she is pursuing is made for people who want to practice specifically in the US. So, I might have to provide for both of us for an indefinite amount of time. We will probably get married before she moves though, so she will have access to the benefits my company is offering me. (We also want to get married, it's not just about the benefits).

Ok so I talked a lot about myself and my situation. Here are my questions :

* I want to invest in real estate as quickly as possible. Is this a reasonable investment for someone starting his career? Or do you think I would be better off putting all my money in an index fund because it's less hassle and less management? Should I start by buying a condo once I can afford it, and when I'm more comfortable, getting something bigger (multi-apartment?)

* Second, I unfortunately have no credit history in the US, so I will definitely not be able to secure a mortgage until I spend a couple of months (or more) in the US with an US issued credit card. Where should I put my money in the mean time? What is liquid enough so I can use it for a real estate investment, while still getting some interest?

* I have  a couple of friends are starting at the same company as me. We were thinking about starting that real estate investment together? Is this a good idea? We were under the impression that by splitting the investment in four, we would be able to shoot for something bigger, which seem to represent a much higher return on investment (for example, a 12 apartment building seem to be relatively much more profitable than a 4 apartments one). Is it risky to start investing with friends?

* Now, other than real estate, what kind of investment is well suited for a new grad? The company I will be working for match my 401k by 50% (for the first 6% of my salary I invest, so total of 9% with their contribution). After investing those 6%, where should I put the rest? I was thinking about an Index Fund (maybe vanguard).

* They also offer stock purchase program (with 10% discount). Not sure what's the limit per year, but it seem like it would be a dumb idea not to use it. From what I understood, I could participate, and just directly sell back those stocks to make that 10% back in cash. Is there any downside to doing this?

* Finally, last question, is there any cost that new grad don't necessarily think about (especially those immigrating in a new country), but that totally eat into your income? I will obviously have to buy some furniture down the line and all the small things I need that I had back at my parent's home, but those are all a one-time thing, so I don't think they will affect my budget on the long term.

* Actually, real last question : Any general advices I should know? I checked pretty much everything on the side bar, but now that you know my exact situation pretty well, anything important I should take into consideration?

Thank you very much. Really sorry for the incredibly long post, I really appreciate you taking the time to read it, and hopefully advise me a little:


**TL;DR : Starting my professional life in the US (moving from Canada). Lucky enough to not have any debt, and will have around 40k at my name in the next month. Will be making a little over 100k annually in a city where a 1 bedroom apartment is around 1.5k.  Want to start investing as quickly as possible, preferably in the real estate market. Where to start? Thanks

So recently, I did an interview for an unpaid internship with a local legislators office (state level). The thing is, it was on extreme short notice, and since I had a previous incident this year where all my clothes were essentially gone, I was in a panic in buying clothes for the interview. 

I had about $3000 saved up to this point (through school grants) and I will be getting more throughout the school year. My expenses are mainly paid by my parents.

I didn't want to spend all of my own money right away, and since my parents are extremely overbearing (though loaded), I ran off to nordstrom and opened a credit card (yay approval!) and put my purchases on it. I spent about $420 on a dress shirt, blazer, pants, and tie. I also spent $120 at Macy's from my savings, on shoes and socks. Keep in mind I managed this within 2 days before the interview, with a school schedule that involves me being at school morning to night. I had no wiggle room and couldn't ask my parents due to family issues. I have good-great credit for my age too, but no steady income, got be problems with an AMEX FR recently where they closed high limit backdated accounts but otherwise positive. My utilization is fine, just high inquiries for the year. My AAOA is good due to the backdating, I hope it's not too much of a hit when they fall off in 10 years, since my other accounts will age well. 

The environment is business formal so I personally think my outfit was pretty on point. The interview went great, was over in 5 minutes and was told I got the internship halfway through. Everything checks out. One funny thing though is it was casual friday, so everyone who worked there was essentially dressed like a hobo (not literally but...yeah). So awkward moment when I'm leaving and avert my eyes from this casually dressed man in the lobby, he tells me to have a good day and I say thanks you too! I was a bit confused why a visitor was telling me that since we were complete strangers and I didn't want to say anything as I was leaving as to not be rude or intrude on their business, until I realized it was casual friday and that he was an employee being cordial. Welp, now it's going to look like I'm rude and stuck up...

Anyway, since I'm going to school full time with a difficult workload, as well as will be starting this internship, I need some guidance.

Should I return the clothes I bought from nordstrom (since their return policy is very good I hear). I kept all the tags in a bag but their off the clothes. I only wore the clothes once. Or should I just keep them as part of my wardrobe and fork over the money out of my savings when the statement comes, and treat it as an investment in my 'career'. Or just exchange them for cheaper varieties? I don't have much of a choice with the stuff from Macy's either. Don't want to ask parents for reimbursement.

I also don't mind looking like a hobo most of the time so I can keep myself in check in regards to not being a shopaholic but damn when I put on that suit do I look fierce af. Unrecognizable.

Also is it worth taking out subsidized student loans for my emergency fund? Or to spend on nice clothing/dental expenses? My major is Political Science. If I enter a career in public service, I can divert my loans to that with loan forgiveness (or repayment with some agencies). Though I don't know how fair this is to tax payers (I try to be ethical with my finances). Good thing about my education so far is I have almost a full ride for the next 4 years (community college + transfer). I hope to go to grad school, and I hear there are good fellowships for grad students (to get their tuitions paid + stipends) and those who finish grad school too (things like PMF)."

Rainy Saturday. Sitting here drinking my decaf at 9DPO feeling very very non-hopeful about this month. This was the cycle following my 2nd CP in the last 5 months. Everything was starting to line up so perfectly this cycle...I'm an early ovulator (like, usually around CD11) and everything was on track to happen again that way, falling perfectly over a long hotel weekend dh and I were taking to celebrate finishing one of 2 of my internship placements. We were able to BD every day from CD7-13 and I thought ""damn, it's so perfect, we HAVE to catch the egg!""...Except the wondfo's started getting darker, then lighter again, and my temp never went up around predicted O day...I kinda of wonder if it's because we drank too much that Saturday night  and my egg was like OH HELL NO and went back inside...Finally, my finicky egg decided to drop 4 days later, after we were all sexed out and things weren't ""working"" so well from DH's stressful work week...we only managed to get in one good BD the day before O and one shower BD the day of O (which I don't have much faith in because I feel like the water rinses everything out) :(

Damn. I mean, granted it's ""still early"" and my other two BFP's were at 11DPO, but I don't have have any of the telltale signs this month that I had with the other two pregnancies (specifically, cramping every day from 5DPO on, or crazy tender bewbs). I even started progesterone suppositories this month and thought for sure I'd have the crazy symptoms from those at least, but the only side effects so far have been that I'm more moody (um, I cried when the kids were saying the pledge of allegiance at one of my schools lol) and I'm bloated/extra sleepy all the time (typical for my luteal phase anyway).

On top of everything, my favorite cousin's bachelorette party is tonight and I really really just want to go and have a crazy, amazing time with everyone but will have to just hang back and drink shirley temples all night until I know for sure next week. Gah. Really starting to think about getting back into seeing a counselor again, my school provides them for free and the one I had a few years back was super amazing. It can't be healthy to be like this every month until a sticky baby happens (if ever).

Thanks for stopping by crazytown. Happy Saturday :)

Shut the fuck up.,waldeinsamskeit,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2iajx9/mom_shut_the_fuck_up/,"So my mom has done some pretty messed up things over the course of my life and now a lot of them are becoming impossible to ignore anymore. I just feel totally stressed out, I can't focus on school, and I feel disconnected from everything except my (wonderful) girlfriend, and my baby sister.

That being said, I had a fairly normal childhood. Except for the fact that my two sisters and I were molested by one of my brothers for a bunch of years. When my older sister got into drugs and self injury, my parents started taking her to therapy, and the truth came out. My brother was taken to my aunt's house while the police and DYFS investigated. Unbeknownst to me, (I didn't find out until recently, 6 years later), my mother convinced my sister and I separately that we shouldn't press charges and that we should keep my brother out of jail. He was welcomed back into the house and we were forced to be in his company on a daily basis. This is about the time I stopped sleeping normally, took up self injury, and began struggling with panic/anxiety/depression. 

Over the next few years, my mom refused to acknowledge that I was struggling with these things (even when I told her directly) and instead took me to doctors until I was misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia. It wasn't until I started wearing a heart monitor for my cardiologist that she finally realized that I was having panic attacks and anxiety attacks (I was seeing the cardio for unexplained spikes in heart rate/palpitations). She advised that I start seeing the therapist at my university, who turned out to be a total moron but that's beside the point. 

I had a nervous breakdown because I couldn't leave my dorm room. I got stuck in there panicking and sobbing for a few hours until someone was able to rescue me. After that I stopped going to classes there, and eventually moved home after the semester was over. I was still using my mom's insurance so I was unable to seek out therapy on my own, and when my mom finally decided to try and help, she sent me to the same exact therapist as my sister. For obvious reasons I stopped seeing her. 

When I went back to community college, my mom started in on our financial troubles. My dad hasn't had an income in a while, as he is trying to groom a company to sell. My mom hates working and complains about it incessantly. Anyway, I was in an intensive, hands on program that required a significant time dedication, and I was working two jobs beyond that. I was home about 6 hours a day (to sleep) and my mom was asking me to buy food every week. On top of that I paid a couple of house bills every month. Over the summer, I had an internship with a two hour commute each direction and still waited tables on top of that to help my mom. There were a couple of big ticket things that she took money for. Like the mortgage. Or the timeshare maintenance fees.

Recently I have changed schools to work on my bachelor's degree and only have one job. Back in March, I met this awesome girl and stopped spending so much time at home. She started asking me about some of the strange things that go on in my house (how my mom feels entitled to my money; why my abuser is still allowed in the house, etc) and I'm like ""I have no fucking idea."" 

I haven't started therapy yet but I have something lined up. I just want my mom to shut the fuck up about what my room looks like, or what I do with my free time, or how I never give her any money or spend time with her. She's fucking annoying. I don't want to hang out with her. She subjects me to the presence of my abuser on a regular basis and thinks that is okay. Every thing that I do is scrutinized by her. And when I am home, I get yelled at for the dumbest shit. 

My family is totally dysfunctional and I'm 1000% ashamed of it.

We met in college and everything was wonderful. 

I graduated in May and am currently back home (2 hour distance) working in a full-time internship while searching for a job. All potential jobs are across the country--or international. My boyfriend will graduate in May. When he does, he is required by contract to return to his home country (in the Middle East) to work for five years. A company there paid for his schooling in the US--so he has to pay it back through work. 

My problem is that five years is a LONG time for a long-distance relationship. 

I have been unable so far to find work in his country--and doubt that I will ever be able to until I gain more experience. My boyfriend is pushing me to find work or graduate school in a neighboring country so that we can at least be near each other. ..but I don't want to. 

I've been to several of the neighboring countries. While they are great places--they're not places for females to live alone. I would rather stay in the US and work for a few years--and then begin thinking about marriage. 
We've talked about marrying now, but there's still the fact that I can't find work in his country. I think I'd go stir-crazy living there without a job or without a job in my field. Working retail is not an option. I fear I'd resent myself--and him--for not working in a career and putting my education to use. 

The future is scary. He understands that and is prepared to figure it out as it happens. The only problem is the ""right-now"".

I'm so caught up on the future and its problems that I'm ignoring our current relationship. He is on the backburner in my life. I hate texting and messaging--but our phone calls are always awkward. Because I'm living at home while working, every new development is first told to my family and friends here--and by the time he asks, I'm tired of telling the story over and over, so he gets a short, brief explanation. 

I know it hurts him when I don't message--or when a message is too short and snippy. He keeps asking me to come down to visit him, which I've done twice in the past month--but that's hard on me with the internship and stuff. He doesn't want to come visit here because I'm at home with my parents and feels that it'd be awkward unless they specifically invited him.

I feel stuck. Like I have to put my life on hold for up to five years until I can be with him. Five years of a long-distance relationship. 
I also feel scared. What if I meet someone while working? What if we just continue to grow apart?  I doubt he would ever break up with me, and I know that if I broke up with him, it would not only blindside him, but truly hurt him. 
I just don't know what to do. It feels like I'm the one who has to make all the compromises--even though he legally can't compromise. 

I suppose my question is: How do I focus more on our current relationship and let the future play itself out? Or should I? 

TL;DR: Four year relationship needs another five to progress to marriage--all of which would be long-distance. I am scared and unwilling to put life on hold that long, and can't stop worrying about future. It's affecting current (also newly long-distance) relationship. "

2iayth,2,2014-10-04,What's the point anymore?,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2iayth/whats_the_point_anymore/,"For the past four or five years I believe I have been battling depression. I've never told anyone and I've just bottled it up inside. I guess I should start with my upbringing. I'm a typical suburban kid who's family is fairly well off... not so much as some of the people I know, but nothing to complain about. I guess that's one part of my problem. I'm privileged enough to have a roof over my head, food to eat, and access to water. That's more than billions of people out there. So why do I deserve to be depressed when there are so many people worse off than me?

But a little bit about me... I didn't start talking until I was three and when I did, I had problems with my pronunciation of a couple common sounds. Nothing too serious I guess, and I did go to speech therapy for a couple years which helped a little bit, but by the time I got to grade school, I was self-conscious about it. I guess that's part of the reason why I developed a more quiet side. If i didn't talk as much then I wouldn't expose my self to ridicule. 

Up until the 4th grade I would say I stuck to myself and my two main friends that I knew my whole life. Then come 5th grade I started breaking out of my shell and hanging out with a lot of kids in my grade (~40 people in a small school). Everything was going well. I danced with the girl I liked in 6th grade and made a bunch of new friends. All in all life was good. 

But the second half of 8th grade was when things really started to go down hill. My grandfather passed. My aunt was diagnosed with cancer (and eventually passed away). My house caught on fire (luckily no one was hurt). But the thing that really got to me was when a girl said my voice was emotionless and sounded funny. To me, I could never really tell when I'm putting emotion in my voice or not. I assume that when I talk, other people hear a monotone per se, but when I hear myself talk, I hear the fluctuations and emotion in my voice. I guess that's not the case. So with the combinations of all those things piling together, I began to become depressed right before high school.

I reverted back to my old self heading into high school. I hung out with the two kids I had known my whole life and that's it. I never had great social skills, and struggled to meet new people. I rarely talked to girls in high school and definitely never flirted. Even guys could be a struggle to talk to at times because I felt they were too immature (most of them were). Instead of expanding my social horizons, I just told myself I'd focus on my academics, especially since my parents were sending me to a private Catholic school and had to pay out of pocket. I got good grades, and challenged myself academically, but never really challenged myself socially because of fear that people wouldn't like me. I'd go home most days and aimlessly spend hours just waiting for life to get better, but everyday it'd be the same routine: wake up -&gt; go to school -&gt; come home and do homework -&gt; then go to bed. Doing that for four straight years was miserable and now I see how much time I wasted. I never went to junior or senior prom. Went to homecoming once I think and hated it. All in all, my high school years were nothing to look back on in a positive light. 

I invested so much into my academics. I'm now in my freshman year of college and my academics are all I have to show for the past 19 years of my life. Sure I played a couple sports, but don't really play them anymore. Sure I had a couple friends back home, but now we only text once in awhile. I've sunk so low that I struggle to study and get work done. I already withdrew from one of my classes because I fell too far behind and got a D on my first test. I've spent 13 years in school now, and getting a D on that test was tough. I wasn't bothered by the fact that I did poorly. Just the fact that I spent hours upon hours of my life doing schoolwork just to do poorly in a class. That's what really got to me. 

I've never even liked school, I just saw it as an opportunity to improve my life. I thought to myself, sure I won't have a great social life in high school, but once I get into a good school with a degree, I'll be able to make a lot of money and enjoy myself then. But now that I'm in college I realize how much bullshit that is. Every second I'm in class I always imagine a better world outside of academia, but every second I realize that I'm trapped in here for at least the next four years. I haven't made any contributions to society and why should I have to wait until I'm 23 until I can get a ""real"" job in the ""real"" world. If there is a ""real world"" out there than what does that make the world I'm living in now? A ""fake world?"" I'm done with this. I've had suicidal thoughts before, and they have increased more and more over the years. I have 3 friends here at college, and that's it. Can't talk to girls. Can't get good grades. Struggle to talk to most guys. Can't make any impactful contributions to society. If I were to live to 80, I've already lived a quarter of my life and don't have anything to show for it. People always say happiness is greater than money. Well guess what? I'm not going to have any happiness or money at this rate.

My future doesn't look bright either. I'm good at every subject but great at nothing. How am I supposed to pick a major if I'm taking the same basic history, english, math, and science courses over and over again? Sometimes I think it'd be easier to just end it so I wouldn't have to spend another roughly 60 years not doing anything worthwhile. If I were to die, you could probably count on your hands how many people would actually care. I have two sisters, and a grand total of five legit friends throughout my life. 

The thing that brings the most joy to my life is probably my dog, but she's 5 hours away back home so I'll get to see her at Thanksgiving, winter break, spring break, and any summers that I don't get any internships I guess. I literally don't have much in my life at the moment that I get excited about or enjoy. I'll spend hours surfing the web or playing a game that I really don't care about. 

I just got off a FaceTime call with my parents and as usual I didn't say much. Just the usual ""hi how's it going,"" then the ""how are your classes going?"" and then we say bye. When the people closest to me only talk about my classes with me, it really makes me realize how little I actually do. If my worth and value comes from the classes I take, then what's the point? I'd rather skip the BS small talk and just not talk to them about things I no longer care about. I struggle enough to talk as it is, and when people talk about boring ass topics like school, then I feel I'm just wasting my time. Not that my time is worth much but you get the point.

My mom has asked me a few times over the years if I'm ""ok"" when I'm clearly depressed, and of course I just lie and say ""yeah, what do you mean?"" I want to get better, but I don't know how and if I don't get better, then why spend the rest of my life in this miserable state of existence?"

2ib70i,1,2014-10-04,Need advice on where to go from here with a girl (22M),rosecranz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ib70i/need_advice_on_where_to_go_from_here_with_a_girl/,"okay so i'll try to condense this story as much as possible.

Me and this girl from one of my classes both got an internship at the same place over the summer in a large city on the opposite coast. She's an exchange student at my university, and was leaving once the internship was over to go back to Europe. In class, i had talked to her maybe 2-3 times. She was gorgeous, and i'm shy so i didn't really ever 'talk' to her.

Moving out to the same city, same workplace, working with each other on a daily basis at our internship, we became close. Since we were both new to the city, we would pretty much hang out every weekend. I got locked out my apartment one time, she let me stay at her place. That weekend we spent every second together pretty much, never getting on each others nerves (i can't even do that with my best friends haha). We made dinner together, hung out in the park together (she wanted to go on a boat ride on the lake, but we didn't have the cash). So essentially we'd do a lot of stuff together (one time we took a ferry to the beach and just chilled together on the beach for the day).

We spent a lot of time together, and she seemed to really get along with me, and i definitely got along with her. everywhere we went people would tell us we were a cute couple, or ask how long we've been together, etc.

Well, i have caught feelings badly, and while she was here, i wanted to tell her badly, but being that we worked together so closely, and that she was going to be leaving the country in less than 10 weeks, i thought it might not be the best choice. Why jeopordize a great relationship/having someone to do stuff with if it can workout anyway?

Last day she was in the states i went to the airport with her, went through everything with her until security, and gave her a kiss on the cheek after a big hug, she looked at me and gave me a sad smile. 

The next days were insanely hard (i went back to my home state to visit family before coming back to return to work on an extended contract). I couldn't stop thinking about her, and i still think about her a lot. Just the way we got along, the type of person she was, how smart she was, and her personality; i've never met a girl who made me feel this way before. 

**My question for you guys is:**

**Should i tell her how i feel?** That i wish we had more time to spend together because i felt like we really had something good? How can i tell her that i really like her? Even though we weren't a couple or anything, i really really like this girl. I'd be willing to go visit after my contract is up here, and just see where things pick up with us, but i don't wanna say that to her because it seems pretty drastic being that we never explicitly told each other our feelings. The other problem is that i can pretty much just tell her on text (Facebook message) because she's on such a different time zone, and i work all day, and i know she's not around on weekends. 

I sent her a message after she left, were i was emotional, but i never said anything explicit, i just told her i really hope we end up seeing each other again, for longer than 10 weeks. she said ""we'll definitely see each other again"". 

If i tell her over text now, it seems late. But at the same time i want her to know, because if she does feel a similar type of way, maybe something can happen in the future? The problem is we won't be seeing each other for a while, and even after my contract is up, she'll be in a different country. Like i said, i have no problem moving out to her country (i've been there before and loved it), or just going to visit. There's also a chance she comes back to work at the same company i'm at (she was at too) if she gets a job offer from our internship. 

Its a complicated situation because if i tell her how i feel, it won't change much in the short term except for relieving the 'what if i tell her' itch.

So, should i send her a message just telling her how i feel? or sort of play it slow and see where things are in a couple months?

**TLDR: spent a lot of time with a great girl over the summer, we always had a great time together and when we hung out it felt like we were a couple, didn't get to tell her how i felt because I'm not good at that, and i didn't want to make things weird at work, and we only had 10 weeks together. Now she is back in her home  country, and i'm worried i won't see her again; I cannot stop thinking about her, just wishing she was back here and what not. Should i tell her how i feel about her through a Facebook message (only way i have of contacting her), or wait to see how things play out?** "

I have taken all the prerequisites (programming 1,2,&amp;3, computer architecture, software engineering, databases, networking, discrete math, calculus, and statistics), which I feel is close to the same schooling of a BS graduate.  I was thinking with that schooling I might be able to get a job in the field, but without an official degree in CS yet it might not cut it without experience.  My other option is to do an internship to get experience.  I am currently working a factory job full time(a little over $1700/month) which I would have to quit if I did an internship.  I live in Michigan and would like to stay in Michigan.
My question is: Will an internship help me enough where it would be justifiable to quit my current job?  Do I have close to the same chances of find a job in the field without an internship?  Do I need to finish my MS degree before I can get an entry level job?"
2ibnba,3,2014-10-04,Empyreus: Technology Part 1,[deleted],Empyreus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empyreus/comments/2ibnba/empyreus_technology_part_1/,"**Androids**

Androids are complex, advanced robots built to replace and mimick humans and to make the lives of people more easy and less stressful. They are used in all aspects of life, work, recreation, and combat. Androids are not loved by all as they often replace people at jobs in almost every industry and some people believe they are dangerous and unnatural. Androids are classified into three different types: Combat, Service, and Companion. There is a forth classification simply called ""hybrids."" Hybrids are defined as any android that has features and functions of two or more of the other classifications. Hybrids are typically custom builds or designs, more expensive, and less common.

- *Combat*

 Combat androids come in many variations and styles, from nimble quick metallic skeletal frames to thick armored bulky juggernauts. There are also non-humanoid combat droids which often get wrongly classified as combat androids in common speak, these include dog like police hunting droids or flying scout drones with mounted machine guns. Combat androids programmed to use lethal weapons are only legally sold to W.A.R.D and the military, though nonlethal combat androids can be bought for the purposes of security and personal defense. Combat androids can all run different combat programs of varying degrees of complexity, the more complex typically the more reliable and lethal in combat, though more basic combat programs increase processing time, giving the android better reflexes and quicker movements. Simple programs are also less susceptible to hacking and viruses as they are easier to encrypt and identify problems in the code. Combat androids are built for function not style, they don't necessarily look very stunning or humanlike.

- *Service*

 Service androids are built for the sole purpose of serving and assisting humans in various aspects of life. In terms of look and design they are the middle ground between combat and companion androids. They are very humanoid and look closer to a human than a combat drone, typically designed with facial features and a casing looking similar to the morphology of a human, but without flesh or organic type action programs such as blinking. Service androids are either built for white collar work with incredibly fast data processors, huge memories and storage, and optimized for maximum efficiency; or they are built for manual labor, focusing on agility, grip, strength, and spacial processing. Service androids can be found doing jobs  in any assistant position one could think of, such as secretaries, nurses, interns, accountants, cashiers, and editors. They can also be found doing a lot of manual labor jobs like cleaning, carpentry and construction, shelf stocking, and even cooking.

- *Companion*

 Companion androids serve exactly the purpose one would expect, keeping people company and happy. They are designed to look and as human as possible, most having things like synthetic skin, heated bodies, and fully articulate facial muscles so they can show a full range of emotions. The designs aren't perfect however, companion androids  have oddly smooth skin and it is easy to see the small division lines where pieces of the outer shelling are fitted together, and places around the joints and points of rotation where synthetic skin plating would interfere with motion or movement. Most also have access panels somewhere on the body that leave an obvious mark or location to be opened, and when damaged their robotic skeletons are revealed, there is also a slight glow to their eyes. Some are also designed for sexual use aswell, though many are not designed for this purpose. Companion androids are outfitted with advanced AI technology and unique algorithms for emotion. These two things allow them to learn and adapt over time, aswell as give off the perception of personality and emotion. Companion androids are notorious for mimicking their owners actions or the personality qualities their owner seems to like in other people or gives positive feedback too. They are also well known for being very curious and inquisitive. Relationship statuses can be set with a companion android upon purchase, most commonly they are used as substitutes for friends, children, and spouses. Companion androids are able to help out with most simple household and recreational tasks, but not as well or efficiently as service androids. There are many ethical questions around companion androids: Whether or not they are healthy for their owners, if they are a reasonable substitute for human social interaction, and if beings that are able to think and learn and are designed to react to emotional stimulus are actually alive and deserve the same rights and respect as human beings.


**Cybernetics**

 Cybernetics are the pinnacle of modern bionic technology. They are robotic limbs and implants that can be attached to the body and connected directly to the brain to function like any other organic part of the body. Synthetic limbs and organs don't just function as well as the originals, they function better. Cybernetic arms can have incredibly high holding force, magnetic or tactile grip technology, enhanced strength, and even integrated accessories like blades or tablets/phones. Cybernetic legs are stronger and run faster, can have magnetic or tactile grip technology, have counterweights for enhanced balance, and even integrated devices like jump jets. Synthetic hearts and lungs have near unlimited capacities, pumping blood and oxygen more efficiently and longer than the organic versions. A person with a synthetic heart or lung can exert themselves for much longer before resting. synthetic eyes can see more clearly than regular eyes, they can be installed with countless features such as night vision or thermal vision, zoom, recording, and direct display uplinks to most technology including the internet. Synthetic ears can hear further and more clearly, aswell as ascertain the direction of sound more clearly. 

 Neural implants can increase a person's mental capabilities highly. A neural implant could increase things such as reaction time, ability to remember information, more attention to detail, photographic memory, enhanced processing and calculation, and less need for sleep.

 Cybernetics are not perfect, there is a limit on the number of cybernetics the human body can accept, the amount of cybernetic implants your body can accept is called your ""synthetic rejection threshold"" or SRT score (This will be part of character creation with a specific way to calculate it). The SRT score can be measured using advanced medical tests and is given in a percentage value, with 100% near fully synthetic, you could replace all of your limbs and major internal organs with cybernetics while also including neural implants, while the 0% is completely unable to accept cybernetic devices. The average SRT is around 55-60%, though it can vary greatly from person to person. Due to the ability to judge and test SRT, all cybernetics come with an SRT consumption rating aswell, the more complex the cybernetic the more SRT consumption it has. The only other issue with cybernetics is their susceptibility to EMP attacks and neural implants can be vulnerable to high level hackers aswell, those often these issue don't effect most people with cybernetic implants.

**Weapons**

Weapons technology came a very long way during the time of the threat of a 3rd world war was imminent, weapons are now at a high level in a world without an applicable conflict, this meant a lot of this technology is being used by W.A.R.D.

- *Firearms and ranged weapons.*

  Rifles have come a long way in terms of design, archaic weapons that use standard bullets are more reliable, have faster bullet velocities, more impact. Bullpup designs have become the more popular design now for ballistic weapons. Ballistic weapons have become less effective with the introduction new armors which can absorb high amounts of kinetic energy, however they do penetrate the cutting edge plasma shields quite well. In addition to the ballistic weapons plasma weapons are the new weapons of choice. They use plasma and electric energy to generate bright, fast, and incredibly hot projectiles, causing serious flesh wounds and burns. These weapons use ionized gas cartridges and energy cells as ammunition as opposed to bullets, the weapons use high amounts of energy per shot. Unfortunately plasma weapons are less reliable than ballistic ones, breaking down and missfiring more commonly. Plasma weapons also get incredibly hot after extended automatic fire. While plasma weapons rip through armor they seem to be less effective against energy shields due to those also being made of plasma, they shield counteracts and absorbs a lot of the energy behind the plasma projectile. A 3rd type of weapon that fits neither category is the Railgun, a weapon that uses electric charge and electromagnetic force to fire projectiles at incredibly high velocities. Railguns pierce energy shields and armor alike, the problem with railguns being the time they take to charge between shots, the high energy consumption requiring energy cells to be loaded frequently, and high recoil. The Railgun is a powerful but slow firing and complex weapon, though mastering it will make the wielder incredibly lethal in combat. Railguns and plasma weapons are also susceptible to EMP attacks. Most firearms are able to bemodified with optics which display ammunition count and can calculate range and wind and are able to zoom in to up to 6 times, laser/light combinations, and cybernetic and HUD connectivity, which allows the user to sync their weapon to a cybernetic eye or arm which displays the gun's ammo count, highlights targets and threats if they are connected by eye, and helps them compensate for recoil if connected by cybernetic arm. An uplink with a pair of smart glasses (glasses which have displays built in) can also yield the same functions as a cybernetic eye. Plasma weapons and railguns are more expensive than ballistic weapons, and the advanced attachments are quite pricey aswell.

- *Melee Weapons*

 Melee weapons have changed but in a sense stayed the same. Cybernetics are a majority of peoples' melee weapons, cybernetic arms being near lethal on their own. In addition to these there are archaic bludgeoning weapons that use gravity generators and hydraulics to swing with a force hard enough to shatter concrete. There are blades sharpened and modified with vibration generators, causing the blade to vibrate and easily slice through bone. Many swords and bladed weapons can also be made to conjure electric charge. In addition to these modified archaic weapons there are also energy blades, blades that are made out of projected plasma. 

- *Armor*  

  There are still archaic physical armor pieces even in the new age of plasma They are able to absorb high amounts kinetic energy and be less bulky than kevlar vests of the past, but still do not provide full protect and can do little in the face of a plasma weapon. The new technology is energy shields, plasma shields that form around part of or the entire body to protect the wearer. Energy shields are very effective against plasma weapons, the reason they were developed in the first place was to try and counter act plasma weapons. However they do not really have any sort of kinetic dampening force so ballistic weapons rip through the shields pretty easily. A small advantage energy shields have over kinetic armor is that an energy shield can recharge over time, however to every good there is a bad. Energy shields can be disabled by EMP attacks. Obviously energy shields are more expensive than physical armor.

 Power armor is the strongest form of physical armor, equivalent to the modern day version of plate mail. They are made of thinner lightweight versions of armor plates put on vehicles and androids. They are usually heavily modified with things like visor integrate HUDs, ventilators, jump jets, magnetic locks, VI's that assist in combat, and robotic exoskeletons that increase the strength of the wearer. While these suits of armor are incredibly powerful and turn the user into a juggernaut, they are very expensive, slow, and incredibly susceptible to EMP attacks. An EMP attack will shut down a suit of power armor, turning off the visor and causing the armor to lock up which leaves the wearer completely immobile until the system resets and recovers. 

- *Vehicles* 

  Military and police vehicles have not changed a whole lot since the old versions. Most have shield generators and more advanced weapons and armors, but not much more than that has really been modified. Military and police vehicles are the only ones that can legally disconnect from the Harmonized Transit System.

  ACVs are the latest in military vehicle technology. They are large walking vehicles, essentially ending up looking like large suits of human armor with heavy cannons and thick armor, They are like massive vehicle sized power armor suits, usually between 15-25 ft tall. There are more interesting ACVs aswell, W.A.R.D uses large 4 legged tank like ACV's which are capable of scaling the buildings of Empyreus to apprehend criminals.

  Air vehicles have changed in design, now more preferring a nimble 2 jet model replacing a typical helicopter rotor which uses propulsion jet technology to seriously improve handling and speed, with plasma weapons and missiles mounted on either wing. W.A.R.D has several of these vehicles which it uses in pursuits, assaults on towering buildings, and general transport quickly across the city.

2ibocp,0,2014-10-04,Preparing for College Internship in High School,nepid79,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ibocp/preparing_for_college_internship_in_high_school/,"Hi, I'm a senior in high school looking to plan ahead, in order to earn an internship during the summer after my freshman year. I know that this is very early, but I want to make sure that I am taking the proper steps. I do have coding experience (some basic console c++, java, and knowledge of OOP). Could learning a specific type of technology/framework/language increase my chances of landing an internship? I am open to learning anything, but I do want to take into account how long it would take me to push out a complete working program in one technology versus the other, since I am looking to push lots of programs to my github account. Also do any technologies/frameworks/languages have a higher demand or do a better job of impressing recruiters? Overall, I am trying to maximize by chances of landing an internship through picking the right type of programming for these needs.

Thanks

2ibrde,1,2014-10-04,Empyreus Character: Sarin Plin,PeaceIsSoftcoreWar,PeaceISoftCoreWar,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceISoftCoreWar/comments/2ibrde/empyreus_character_sarin_plin/,"Name:

Sarin Plin

Age: 

18

Gender:

Male

Physical description: 

Sarin is 6' 6"" tall and weighs 158 lbs. He is always clean-shaven, has a scar above his eye from the time he attempted to fight a cybernetically enhanced brawler, and His eyes are bluish green. He looks as athletic as he actually is.

Occupation: 

Small time thief and brawler

Backstory/history:

Sarin was born to a rich family living in the Platinum district. His parents were heavily involved with the government for much of his life growing up but Sarin fought against their attempts to civilize him and collaborate with the government. He rebelled by thieving throughout the platinum district. He was only caught once but that one time ended his image as an innocent boy exploring the district and he soon found better targets. At that same point in time he often lead groups of children to explore the alleys of the Canopy District. He began his own exploration from a very young age. His first short-lived forays began at the age of 10. He began leading the other children at age 12. As he got older he mapped more of the sections, finally culminating in the Deadzone. He finally understood the complete layout of the area, all the exits, all the entrances. and best of all, the best places to lie in wait. As he was preparing to get back home, he was approached by a drunk older man who proceeded to punch him in the face. Sarin was knocked out cold and was lucky that something kept the man from attacking further. To this day Sarin has no idea what or who stopped the man. Sarin got the scar above his eye that day. His friends caught up with the man and laid down their own justice upon him for the beating.

When Sarin was 17, his parents attempted to have him start an internship in the Bureaucracy District with some of their political contacts. He arrived 20 minutes late and immediately received a citation for his tardiness. The company would only give him two more chances. Sarin's inherent love of trouble led him to simply disappear from work during the lunch break. His disappearance earned him a second citation but what he was doing while he should have been at work caused even greater consequences. He decided to attempt to hack into the mainframe of the government and attempt to compare the map of the city with the map he had created. As Sarin was not a very good hacker, his intrusion was quickly noticed but he was not using his own ID but the ID of his father. When Sarin got home, the door was off it's hinges and his family was nowhere to be seen. All that remained was a sign that read, ""Emigrated to Canopy District Section 40 House Number 17 due to traitorous acts."" These signs were meant to invite complete separation from any sort of noble society.

Sarin arrived at his new home in the canopy district with a large amount of embarrassment and guilt. His parents hatred was directed straight at him and he knew he deserved it. He knew his parents would never do the work to feed themselves and he knew that he wasn't yet old enough to work a real job, so he decided to gamble. Whenever his parents complained about the lack of food around the house, or the bills to be paid, or the lack of some amenity almost no one in the community had, Sarin would steal. He would steal anything he could. He would steal from the backpockets of any passerby. Then he learned to steal from elsewhere. He even began partaking in public brawls. To the victor went the spoils and Sarin's athleticism and intelligence allowed him to strike quickly. He also became better at hacking and began to unravel the firewalls holding him back from the real money. 

Sarin was about to hit the mother lode. He had found a rich families' account. As he began unraveling their firewall he noticed something odd. A file that he was surprised could be accessed so shallow in the city's network. The file directly related the history of the family and included some sort of expiration date.

Faction(s): 

Unaffiliated at this time

Equipment/weapons: 

No current weapons but could get them or pick them up from the ground. Wears a heavy green shirt that at one point was his formal clothing but his life on the street has stained it to the point that it makes him look terrible. His jeans are much the same."
2ibrdu,1,2014-10-04,My life is a joke,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ibrdu/my_life_is_a_joke/,"My anger-filled, fear-and-anxiety-driven, alcoholic, loser of a father drilled it into my head from day-one that I was a worthless screw-up who couldn't do anything right. My impotent mother, who decided to marry this tool-bag in order to ""fix him"" (sacrificing her children in the process), figured she would attempt to balance out the negativity directed at me by my father by coddling me and telling me how much potential I had. The result of these opposing manipulations is that my self-confidence is so low that only the lowest stations in life seem available to me, yet all that I am confident in doing seems below me.

I thought my family was normal, and that all of the ""lessons"" I was being taught were normal until college or even after. Despite all of this, I graduated from prep school with honors and have a bachelor of science in physics. Once I was off those tracks and I had to forge my own path in life, everything unraveled. I realized how screwed up my past was. I resent both my parents.

My first goal after graduating with a bachelors was to get a job and move out. After over 4 years, that has yet to happen. Last year my mother finally moved out, so I was able to go with her, which is better. Now I just have to deal with my continuing failures while she kills herself with cigarettes. I try to have her switch to e-cigs, but she's too cool for those, just like she was too cool for the ivy league school she was attending before she transferred to some nonsense school which put her down the path of meeting my joke of a father.

My mom always talks about how she would spend her summers as a child with her cousins, who were big role models for her. Those cousins had children, who I've only really met recently. Surprise, surprise, they're wonderful people, too. Why could they not have been my role models growing up? Why did I seem to be limited to my worthless father on the list of people to look up to? Maybe if I spent a lot of time with my cousins, too, then I would have had the veil pulled back from my family life much sooner. I guess my mother wanted to hide herself and her children from the rest of her family because she knew how screwed up the situation was.

We live in a suburb outside of New York City. I hate this suburb even without the negative associations of an abusive upbringing. I've had a low-wage, part-time job in the city for a while now. I love being in the city, and I love where I work. I don't make nearly enough to move into the city, but at least I like where I am there. I have friends there that I've known these past 4+ years. They all live on their own and are moving on with their lives. Career upgrades, Ph.D. programs, seeing the world, marriages, children. It's hard enough to stay on peoples' radars in the first place due to my living away from the city and my complete lack of moving forward with my life. It must be as awkward for them to hear that I'm still where I was 4+ years ago as it is awkward for me to say it.

Three therapists and 4 years later and healing hasn't really begun, because every session just uncovers more and more nonsense. Progress is being made, at least, because before therapy I couldn't see any of this for what it was. I couldn't articulate my bad feelings and just how wrong everything was with my upbringing.

I've ""started"" graduate studies this semester, but it's not catching on and I feel so overwhelmed at the thought of actually networking with professors and taking initiative with research, as opposed to college where I just kept to myself and did homework and studied. No one really got it into my head that college is useless without extra things like internships and research.

I just want to move on. I want to leave this suburb forever and have a fulfilling job. I'm so tired of doing nothing and spending whole weekends on the couch while my mother hacks and wheezes in the other room. It's like I've accepted that the world and everyone in it including my friends is going to do fine without me, so why try to do that which I've been conditioned my whole life against?"

I can't do what they're asking me to do at the moment so I'm stressing everybody out. 

If I do what they ask I'll get too stressed out and not be able to pull out because they'll note it as me not co-operating which messes up how future mental health people are going to see me.

Me not being able to do it and stressing out my family makes me even more stressed out.

I can't stop seeing them because I'm young and will get in trouble for not going to school, which will stress out my family.

I know that I need to get better, but I can't have it that way because I'm a minor and it's not possible. 

Literally speaking, whichever path I go down, is either going to make me worse or make my family's situation worse which will intern make me worse. All I have left to do is end it.

I could just go to hospital, where they have more of a neutral ""We're not going to force you into going down any path"" look on things, but last time I was there, I still got worse. I cried until my eyes were hurting, until I couldn't breath and stressed out until I had a really bad nose bleed."

The Mods of /r/AdoptMyVillager are coming at you all today to let you know that a new internship position is open for applications!~~

***

### ~~**So what is an internship and what will it entail?**~~

~~An internship is going to be a mod position, but with less mod permissions. It’s likely you’ll become a permanent full mod eventually, but with the current state of our mod team, we cannot promise anything as this stage.~~

~~As for your duties, you will be expected to deal with the ModMail first and foremost. It will mainly consist of flair update requests and reports/questions. You will be fully trained on how to deal with these requests. You will be trained by the mods over at /r/ACTrade on how to moderate /r/RateMyMayor and how to do counting for people’s RMM pages. There is a very specific process that you will be expected to follow.~~

~~As for reports, you will be trained by us on how to deal with these appropriately, and what to do with what offences. However, you will be not be immediately appointed as a mod for /r/ACBanhammer. Simply ask another mod to set up a page there.~~

***

### ~~**Alright so I know what I will be doing, how will I apply?**~~

~~You should complete the application form below. But there are a few extra notes you should know before continuing.~~

~~First of all, **while this is not a requirement**, we will prefer it if you will be available between the hours of 8am and 3pm GMT. We don’t ask that you fill that entire period, but this is currently the period at which very few mods are around to deal with requests, but again, you will not be tossed aside should you not fulfill this.~~

~~Having a high amount of RMM reviews will not secure your chance at succeeding, as well as having a white rose will not affect your chances negatively. **We do require you to have an RMM profile, though.**~~

~~We would like it if you were to come into the IRC often. We want to show all of the users that we’re not scary, and that we’re real people too, and the IRC is a great way to achieve this. You will also meet the mods of /r/ACTrade and /r/RateMyMayor aswell.~~

***

### ~~**The Application Form**~~

~~Reddit Username:~~

~~Name:~~

~~/r/RateMyMayor thread:~~

~~Availability (and your timezone):~~

~~Moderation experience (if any):~~

~~AC Community experience (what other forums do you participate on? How long have you been active there?):~~

~~Why do you think you will be a good fit in our moderation team?:~~

~~Will you be able to start immediately?:~~

~~Any questions for us?:~~

***

### ~~**Applications close at 12am GMT on the 11th of October, so make sure to get your applications in promptly!**~~

***

~~So I think that pretty much covers it! If you have any questions, please do not be afraid to ask, either here or in the IRC.~~

~~I’d like to wish everyone who applies good luck, and that regardless of whether you make the cut or not, we will always be watching your activity! Black Rose Traders are highly regarded members of our community, so make yourselves known!~~

Here's the Cliff's notes version:

* I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome while I was in the Army (in Singapore).
* I've had years of therapy and have managed to function on a level where I'm not considered to be any different from your typical person. A nurse in my college (in the US) has worked with many special needs adults and swore up and down that she couldn't tell when I told her about the diagnosis.
* I bury myself in books, academic journals and video games all day long. Being at class and work exhausts me emotionally and there is nothing that I love more than to tell the world to fuck off so I can do my thing in my room.
* I'm one term away from graduation (starting from Jan 2015, I'm taking a break right now and on internship).
* Financial independence seems a long way off. I have to go to grad school in my field of political science as I want to pursue a career in academia.
* I'm heavyset, but I've been working on the weight by cutting down on junk food and working at the rowing machine for ~20 minutes a day. Can't do anything more strenuous as I have a fucked up kneecap no thanks to the Singapore Armed Forces.
* My last relationship lasted for a year and it began when I was 15. It was my only relationship ever and never had one since. I'm 27 now.

I'm not a loner. Despite my being on the autism spectrum, I managed to create a new circle of friends in a foreign country, and also developed an established support network. I have awesome people I can count on and I love it. I have various female friends and they have often remarked I'm the funniest and/or smartest guy they know, but I find it impossible to get it into dating territory. I did ask three of them out, and all of them said in variances of, ""I'm sorry, but you're in the friendzone.""

It's not like I didn't try the tips on the attitude of being alpha, or used the game on random women I've met at parties, but the initial interest fizzles out after they realize who I really am (not an alpha). I also kinda felt bad as I couldn't shake off the feeling that I deceived them.

Despite some silly Aspie claims that ""they don't need relationships"", I'm being honest here: **I do.** But it's fucking frustrating that I've got nothing here. Let's make this clear that I'm not an alpha and I'm not afraid of admitting it, because that's the truth. But I'm sure some of you good people have an idea or two to help me out."

I also think this could potentially bring up an interesting discussion on the differences between an actual misogynist and an unconfident guy buying into some RP/ Manosphere/ PUA concepts.

Also, sorry about the length, I tend to write stream of consciousness.

I have been friends with this guy, who we will call Daniel, since my freshman year. We are in a selective honors college activism organization that works with community leaders on issues like poverty and environmental problems. It's a pretty small group and we all got really close during freshman year. Daniel is one of 3 guys out of a group of 12 in our year of the organization. He is pretty attractive, in a BBC Sherlock kinda way. He was born in the state our school is in, but lived in Beijing and Singapore most of his life. When he came to our University he had no experience with any sort of American school, just international schools. He pledged a frat, even though he didn't really know much about it. He is very introverted, but extremely intelligent (he had an internship on Wall Street over the summer). He participates in conversations, likes to tease everyone, but even though he has a lot of friends, he chooses to spend a lot of time alone, working on his projects, or with a few select friends. He is pretty liberal (despite his parents Fox News conservatism) and has always seemed somewhat open to feminist information, discussion, and books (despite the fact teased me and another friend for being feminists back in freshman year).

At the beginning of freshman year he dated this girl, who I never actually met, but it seemed like they were really into each other. If I remember correctly, she broke up with him that February via text and he angrily punched his dorm room door and broke his hand. He doesn't talk to her anymore because he thinks talking to ex girlfriend's is more trouble than it is worth. Around that time he started asking me to go to dinner with him at least once every other week, and I just always thought it was friendly. Apparently our mutual friends saw that it was more than friendly and I'm just oblivious.

The next year he took me to help him pick out his new glasses, and to a speaker on sexual assault at our school, as well as the dinners (which he started insisting he pay for). After the sexual assault speaker he told me he had once pressured his girlfriend into having sex with him, but clarified that it wasn't their first or last time. He asked, sincerely, if that was rape and if it made him a bad person. I told him that specific situation could have been considered coercion and while it was a really really shitty thing to do, the fact that his (ex)girlfriend wasn't upset about it and he now recognized that it was very wrong and won't do it again, shows that he is not necessarily a bad person, just uninformed.

Then I started dating my emotionally abusive ex, Kevin. Kevin hated Daniel because he said Daniel liked me, and Kevin would start arguments every time he found out I had hung out with Daniel. So I spent less time with Daniel, but I definitely didn't stop hanging out with him. I still honestly thought it was just friendly. He had another girlfriend at some point during that, but he never talked to me about her and I only heard about her through friends. When he overheard me telling friends I had broken up with Kevin, Daniel said something that pissed me off at the time but now I can't even remember what it was. But I do remember he later sent me a long text apologizing for what he said and saying he was happy I had gotten out of a crappy relationship.

Over this past summer when he got back from NYC he called me, saying he really wanted to see me and asking when I could hang out. I told him I was out of town but would be driving back in 2 days. I mentioned it when talking to a mutual friend, she seemed shocked that I had no clue Daniel liked me and explained to me how everyone had known for a while. Daniel called me again while I was driving back, excitedly talking about our plans for the evening. We had a great time that evening but the significance of it all was that I finally acknowledged to myself the long standing feelings I had for him.

Over this last month we have spent more and more time together, and got closer and closer, until a few days ago when we kissed. It was great, awesome, whatever. But then he stopped. He told me that he couldn't keep kissing me without this becoming more (I.e. Sex and a relationship) but he didn't want that. He said relationships at our age always fall apart and he didn't want to lose me, ever. So, for now, we need to just be friends. I agreed with him on all points and was very happy with it all because he put into words what I had been thinking.

We hung out again two days later and we were laying on my couch, talking, and something made me think about freshman year when I was raped at a frat party (not Daniel's fraternity). I got quiet, he picked up that something was wrong, and told me that I didn't need to tell him but that I should be comfortable with telling him anything and that he would always be here for me. So I told him. He was shocked at first, then looked angry. He asked me to not tell him any information on the guy because he wanted nothing more than to go beat the shit out of whoever it was, but he knew that wouldn't help me. I told him to say anything he was thinking because hearing something like this is hard and I hated telling people because it puts them in a tough situation where they are dealing with their own emotions while trying to figure out how to help me. He mentioned the sexual assault talk he had taken me to and said how it was so strange he was thinking ""not *that* many college students get raped"" while sitting next to his best friend (me) who had been raped only a few months before.

After a while I changed the subject and mentioned how he was becoming really successful and seemed really confident. He told me that with his girlfriend freshman year he had become somewhat obsessed with the relationship and put all of his happiness on her. When she ended it he was devastated. Then, he said, he read a book called *No More Mr. Nice Guy* which showed him that maybe he ""hadn't grown up with the best male role model and that he couldn't put all of his happiness in life on one girl."" This was a huge red flag for me. I had never seen him act in any way that would make me think of TRP, but he read a book I knew they touted. It was obvious that book aggravated me and that seemed to surprise him. He said he had chosen to look at it as ""self-improvement"" and had taught him to ""actually state what he wanted instead of hinting around it or ignoring his own wants."" After I was done groaning with frustration, I asked him, straight up, if he ever went on the Red Pill. He said he had heard of it but never went there. I told him a few brief reasons why I dislike TRP and told him that while it's great that that book helped him become more confident and go for what he wanted in life, I hoped he could keep his feet solidly on the ground.

We talked more that evening about unrelated things before he left, and there were no other red flags. But now I can't stop thinking about all of this. He is on reddit but while he won't tell me his username (which I completely understand, I wouldn't tell him mine) he told me what subreddits he usually goes on, which are all completely unrelated to TRP or anything political.

Could he possibly be another misogynistic ""men and women are different"" TRPer, or just a previously naive guy who actually read that book for self improvement? Is there that big of a difference? Is there anything I can try to do about all this?

**TL;DR: I see a few red flags in my best guy friend, and now I am trying to figure out if he actually believes some TRP things or if he is sincerely just looking for self-improvement.**

**Edit: So I read more about the book, including a few excerpts, and I was completely misguided in my opinions. It seems like the book could be extremely useful to a lot of guys my age (I've encountered too many of the ""Nice Guys"" discussed in the book). So I apologized to Daniel for my reaction when he told me about the book. He laughed and said it wasn't a problem. He said even though he had heard about the red pill, he would never go to such a ""disgusting"" place. A few of you made the point that if he was a TRPer he probably wouldn't be okay with abstaining from sexual contact while continuing a somewhat romantic relationship. That is very true, and quite obvious. I have become a little paranoid since my ex became a TRPer, but that's definitely not what is happening in this case. So thank you all for your help!**"

I graduated last year with a B.A. in advertising and public relations.  Outside of an on campus internship, I have nothing to show for that degree.  I cannot land jobs at agencies or the corporate world, much less internships.  Had a few interviews, but didn't make it beyond that.  

I regret the major I picked nearly every day.  It's definitely not my passion and I feel I only picked it because I enjoyed 2 electives I took in college that covered the subject (before declaring the major) and because the major was easy to do.  I feel like I fucked up and there's no going back, and I wonder how I was so stupid when I picked my major.  

At the same time I view a career change as this huge unclimbable mountain and I feel like I'm stuck in PR or working a dead end minimum wage job at Wal-Mart. (I'm actually unemployed right now, I don't have any job really) and not doing anything with my life.  

So what is my passion?  I've always been good with technology/computers.  My relatives were shocked I didn't go into the field.  I fiddled around with Linux (Gentoo, Debian, Slackware, Fedora, etc) and shitty web development maybe 10-12 years ago in my early-mid teens.  Lately I've dabbled with Java but I seem to lose interest with it pretty quickly and programming seems math heavy (I suck at math).  

I guess I'm looking for advice what to do with my life right now.  I'm not sure what to do, if I should continue down the path in PR or try something new (how?) and if so, what?  "

I want to be with a dear friend of mine who's helped me get to where I am.**

(A preface) Thank you in advance for listening. Going through Reddit has encouraged me to speak my mind. It's good to let it out.

With the preface aside (My close friends find me notorious for prefacing the ""deep"" stuff I have to say but am too shy to say it), I've been feeling like shit. Not exactly to the point of ""I want to give it all up"" or ""I can't go on."" I can't say those thoughts haven't crossed my mind. But I just don't feel happy. At all. I feel sad and alone.

I'm 19 years old and I turn 20 in less than a month. I know that I've yet to really ""experience"" what life really is, but I would like to think that for a 19-year-old I've come a very long way to where I am now.

(So the part where I tell my life story for context) I grew up in California. I went to a public high school with 2,300+ students, and I graduated with honors in the top 4% of my class. The high school environment that I was conditioned in, however, was largely a competitive one - one that put too much pressure on numbers, grades, SAT scores, who got accepted into the best colleges, who would get anywhere above a 2200 on the SAT, and who was keeping up in the top 2% of the school. Your run-of-the-mill academic elitist environment. Rigorous, but very unhealthy.

In my junior and senior years of high school, I had also gotten very much into gaming (mainly TF2 and Minecraft), and I became an admin for one particular community. In retrospect, I absolutely loved being with them. To my knowledge, they're still around but more people have gone than come, and plenty have moved on with their lives. As did I.

High school was an emotionally rough time for me too. I had my heart broken twice. Two girls I had crushes on at separate times, both times rejecting me. The typical post-rejection depression, and the typical life lessons about love vs. lust. In retrospect, the heartbreaks were very silly moments and the crushes are a thing of the long distant past, but I won't forget how painful it was.

After high school, I deviated from the path of my Ivy-League-destined peers and ended up choosing to go to a tiny liberal arts college in Ohio of all places - a college that was in the process of reopening. For the first time in my young life, I was beginning to think that I could truly stick out and be unique. Rather than choosing to do small things at a big university, I chose to do big things at a small college. I felt that I needed to prove myself to my peers - that it doesn't take going to Harvard or Stanford or the UC's to be successful.

And for the last few years, it did seem like I was doing just that. At my college, I co-founded its debate team (supposedly its first in 100 years) and was elected to its governance body. As a second-year, I was invited to speak at convocation, and I've been on the Dean's List for every academic term thus far. I'm well-respected by my peers as well as faculty, administrators, and alumni. Many feel that I have a great and successful future ahead of me.

So, big deal. But this thread isn't for my bragging (And I'm really sorry if I come across as a pompous asshole). It's about this...disconnect. This disconnect between how people perceive me and how I perceive myself. So many people see me and are nothing less than proud of me, and it's great. But so few people realize how, deep down, how sad and lonely I really am. Despite all of these things...I have rather low self-esteem and have trouble being confident in myself. People would think I am one of the least likely people to be depressed. People point out that I shouldn't be putting myself down because there are so many people who want to be where I am right now. But it just doesn't change how I feel. I put myself down...because that's what I always do.

Earlier was the context for how I got to where I am now. Now, for the context of where exactly I am right now.

I'm 2 weeks into a prestigious internship in Washington, D.C. The biggest thing I have ever done in my life. This year, 2014 - it's been all about building up to D.C. Nothing else mattered. I was excited, and so many others were really excited for me. And here I am...and suddenly and so unexpectedly I'm more lost than ever before.

I'm living in an apartment by myself - the first time I'm really living by myself, and it's been far harder than I thought it would be. And it's ridiculously expensive. I've been having real trouble trying to take care of myself. I will be moving out in the next few weeks with some college alumni. But in these 2 weeks being here in D.C. again, I realized that I do not want to live alone.

I want to be with people who know me best. I want to be with the person who not only stands by me when I'm at my best, but who sits with me when I'm at my worst. I want to be with the person who's pushed me to be better. And there is that very someone in my life.

A close friend of mine. Someone I've known since starting college. She is amazing. The most ambitious woman I've ever known. Almost 3 years older than me. Out of anyone I've ever known, in high school, college, anywhere - I cannot think of anyone better who can go into politics. She is super intelligent. She is upfront and straight to the point - not wishy-washy like me. She isn't afraid to speak her mind. She easily takes the lead and can take control of the room and the conversation. And yet she's very approachable, and so many people gravitate towards her. She is so dissimilar to me in so many ways, and yet we somehow complement each other. We understand each others' strengths and flaws. She can go to me when she's frustrated and confused, and I can go to her when I'm feeling down and disappointed. We've studied together a lot, and we led the debate team together. She and I have in faith in each others' futures. And she too is interning in the capital. We're both working in our dream internships. We've known each other for a few years now, and for a while I've always just considered her as any normal friend, but I only recently realized...that I really value her as a close friend. And a part of me is wishing that we could share our futures and be there for each others' happiness and sadness. I want her to be there for me when I'm happy and when I'm sad, and I want to be there for her when she's happy and when she's sad.

I was hoping that we would room together while we were interning in D.C., but unfortunately plans just didn't work out and she's staying with a family friend. She seems very happy where she is, but she does feel bad for me living alone.

She's the one who tells me that I preface myself too much. She's the one who tells me that I should be more confident in myself and shouldn't put myself down. Whenever I'm down, she cheers me up by reminding me that I'm ""smart and handsome and have a wonderful future ahead,"" and she genuinely believes that.

I just wish I could just take the time to tell her how I feel about her. We have barely had any time to see each other, which has made me really sad. I miss her dearly. And I know that after our internships are over, we'll still be seeing each other in school again. But I want to spend as much time as I can with her, given where we are. Because I'm most confident and myself when I'm with her. She's one of few whom I trust, and one of few who succeeds in getting me to let it all out.

And then even after all of this...there is that part of me that is trying to remind me that this is nothing but lust, just like it was with all of the crushes I had in high school. But is it? I don't know. I don't know if it's a relationship that I want out of this. But at the very least, I want our friendship to last. And I want us to remain close.

I wasn't quite sure how to conclude all of that. But that's what I've been feeling and thinking. I'm happy that I got it all out. Thanks for listening, Reddit. Tell me what you thought."

This is my first ever Reddit post (long time lurker) and it is to ask all of you for some thoughts on career advice for my wife.

She will be graduating with a Masters in Social Work next year and is struggling for what to do with her career. She likes the notion of helping others (hence the MSW) but after going through the programs and associated internships she has found a clash with the culture and her personality. She is a very straight-shooter type and the social work/non-profit element of exploring feelings and working with sensitive ""delicate flower types"" isn't lining up well. 

Factoring that in, the next best thing we could come up with is working for some sort of for-profit company that helps people, or at least a non-profit that isn't so touchy-feely and has clear objectives and for-profit like business practices (like Kiva). HOWEVER. She also comes from a pre-graduate school background of international development and struggles with the way that a lot of these types of companies are run. Often, these companies are founded by MBAs, or people that have worked their entire careers in unrelated industries and have decided to ""give back"" without having any ""get-your-hands-dirty""/""on-the-ground"" experience to tell them what the real issues are. That style tends to exclude, omit or marginalize the type of experience my wife has, which frustrates her because she feels that she would fit in well at such a company, but her background isn't something they would consider. And yes, this is true because if you look at the LinkedIn profiles of staff members at these types of companies, they lean heavily on the MBA/finance/economic/technology raised types of candidates, not to mention her interview response rate. Now, I'm not saying all companies are like this, but let me put it this way: I've been fairly hands off up until this point because my wife is a strong, intelligent, driven woman that prides herself in her independence. For me to get involved to the point where I'm asking strangers on the internet for help hopefully shows that we've looked for a company that does what she want to be a part of, that has staff with people of her professional and academic background, and we haven't found a fit yet. 

Our final thought is hey, why not just start a business? This would likely be the best solution as it would eliminate any cultural differences and allow her to do what she wanted, but we're recently married and in the near future have plans to buy a house, start a family and the risk for this seems a bit high. Surely there has to be:

1. A company that already exists that...
2. Has a primary objective to help under-privileged people that... 
3. Has its core practices based on experiences from people who have done the actual work that...
4. Hires people from diverse educational and professional backgrounds that...
5. Aren't a bunch of overly concerned, hyper-sensitive people who let their emotions prohibit progress on getting stuff done that...
6. Has a focus on international work, since that is where her background and passion reside.

Now - we've both given this an enormous amount of thought and particularly with her, research. If there is someone who knows of a company as described as above, please let me know. If you have experience in this situation or have had the experience with anything I've written so far, by all means share. What I'm trying to avoid are replies based on speculation. Trust me, we've speculated. What would really help is solid, actionable advice and guidance!

For what it is worth: We're both in our mid-thirties and I am able support both of us comfortably, though not comfortably enough to the point where moving our savings towards starting a business is a clear decision. We're based in the US.

Thanks!"

I'm now almost 125 pages in and all I learned was the basics of pointers and a few Coding Conventions. 

So my questions is how do you learn a programming language when someone already knows one? Are there any tips? Should one jump in and watch where the winds will take him? Or should one learn again from the beginning to the end?

Just moved here last week to work and I currently have more fingers than people I even know the names of. Would really like to chat with and meet potential new frien ds. 

I moved up into Ballard and work in SLU. I worked here as an intern over the summer so I know my way around a little, but I used to live in capital hill.


Anyway, I'm assuming many of you drink fluids. We could do that, perhaps at the same place at the same time. Maybe if there's a few of us we'll hit up one of those board game bars like card kingdom?

Edit: since people asked
I'm a 24 year old male software developer. 

I play PC games quite a bit, generally strategy or RPG (League of Legends, Diablo, Civilization). Unfortunately my desktop is stuck in customs for the time being. 

I love board games, and currently have Settlers of Catan, Eclipse, and Nations. I also have cards against humanity. 

I'm trying to become a more active person. Towards this I'm starting to bike to and from work. I also like Frisbee.

2ie7en,1,2014-10-05,Getting back on the wagon.,Sparrower,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2ie7en/getting_back_on_the_wagon/,"I've fallen off the wagon pretty hard. My NoFap story so far:

I started NoFap last December, and I can't believe it's almost been a year already. I had a lot of success that first month, reaching the two-week milestone twice. Between January and April I relapsed about once a week, but even still my motivation was at an all time high. I've been living with depression ever since I can remember, and so my adult life has mostly consisted of failing college classes, being unemployed half the time, and constantly moving back home after failed attempts to move out. But after starting NoFap, I had a series of insights and the clarity to act upon them.

Starting in April my life changed dramatically in the course of a couple weeks. I found gainful full-time employment; it was a job still well beneath my abilities, but the hours were 7-4 (a good, normal schedule to keep that required me to discipline myself to wake up on time) and the pay was the best I've ever had. I moved out with a couple of friends with whom I was trying to start a business with. And I started dating a girl for the first time in four years. Life was pretty sweet, and during this time I hit my first 18 day streak. I was doing well with NoFap, and I felt on top of the world.

Over the next five months all of this euphoria crashed pretty quickly. The job was fine; it was menial but I worked hard and maintained great work relationships. The place I moved to was a different story; it had a major infestation of bed bugs, roaches and rats. We were able to legally leave due to the numerous health violations, but the lack of initiative my friends showed grated on us to the point where the business idea we had is all but dead and the friendships themselves are in question. And the girl I was dating is a great person, but the relationship was terrible and lasted much longer than it should have. So once again, I was single and living at home.

I've been back home for about two weeks and during this time I am currently in between jobs (more on that in a minute) and have relapsed, hard. I figured that I had a reasonable amount to be sad about, so a NoFaP vacation was in order. I've masturbated multiple times a day every day. After having such a long detox period I thought that I would only need a little porn to get off, but boy was I wrong. The porn demon inside me wanted more disgusting porn than ever before, and more of it. I've been going to bed between 4 and 6 in the morning and sleeping in until 2. I haven't done anything productive, and I've had a lot of work I need to do. I feel awful and guilty pretty much constantly. And it needs to stop today.

During my Golden Months I began applying to jobs in the field I want to work in (coding and web development). Somehow I snagged a once in a lifetime opportunity: a web development internship at one of the most prestigious global marketing organizations. For the past two weeks I have been in between my old job and this internship, but my first day is Tuesday. I need to get on the NoFap bandwagon again, and this time for good. The internship is three months long with a chance of being hired out of it; if I can nail it, I can turn my entire life around. But I need to be disciplined like never before or I don't stand a chance.

Anyway, what I've learned so far:

* NoFap works. You're not going to be cured immediately, but you will notice improvements. They are subtle at first, and they might not be recognizable day to day. But each week, each month you spend on NoFap, you will realize how much better and motivated you were than the week or month before.
* Shit happens, but that is no excuse to fall off the wagon. No matter how bad life gets, you have not earned a NoFap vacation. You have earned the right to continue to treat yourself with respect; many things in life are out of your control and you will need to deal with them as they arise. But NoFap is something that you always have control over. Don't surrender your agency in the matter; keep strong in NoFap and you will always have something good going for you.
* The NoFap counter is important, but it's not the most important thing about the experience. Obviously, it is our goal to surmount masturbation entirely. We all want that counter to go up by one every day for the rest of our lives. But it is a process. When you reset your counter (and you will reset it), it can be demoralizing to see that smiling number one on your badge. Just remember that you need to be proud of your accomplishment before relapse. If you reach a one month streak and fail, you need to do even better next time. But it still means that in the past 30 days, you had 29 victories.
* Good things will come your way. If you had asked me a year ago if I would be in the incredible career direction I am now, I would have laughed at you. NoFap isn't an end, it's a mean to an end, and that end is a better life. Remember that.

Good luck to all of you. All I know is that if NoFap can help someone like me, it can do even better things for you."
2ie7tb,1,2014-10-05,A few questions about employer drug testing,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2ie7tb/a_few_questions_about_employer_drug_testing/,"Howdy folks. I recently accepted a job offer and stopped smoking about 2 weeks ago. Before my second interview, they asked if I would allow for a background and credit check, which I agreed to, but never mentioned any pre-employment drug screening. So my questions are:
1. Would they have to ask before I accept the position whether I will agree to pre-employment drug screening like they did with the background check? 
2. How soon after starting do employers test new hires? 
3. Are they required to give prior notice before a screening, including random drug tests? If so, how much notice would they need to give? 

It's an IT internship position at a fairly small company, so there's no legal requirement for me to be tested, and they don't offer any benefits to interns, so it may not be something I have to worry about, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Thanks to anyone who can help answer any of these questions! "

Database Designer,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2iebm6/dba_vs_data_analyst_vs_data_architect_vs_database/,"I took my first relational databases course a few quarters ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. It consisted of learning efficient MySQL queries, relational algebra, database design, and Java interaction using JDBC.

I've been trying to find out more information about working with databases as a career and have a few questions.

First off, I keep seeing Data Architect and Database Designer as positions available. Are these positions the same?

I would ultimately want an internship designing databases AND writing queries. Is that possible for a single position? Would I be doing more? Do companies even need database people to write queries for them, or are they just written by software engineers who don't touch databases?

I've also been told that if you go into databases right out of college you can become stuck there and it will be difficult to transfer to a software development position. Has this been true in anyone's experience? I want to try databases, SE, and QA to get a feel of which one I like the best.


Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions I really appreciate it!"

I plan to go with my boyfriend (Currently teaching courses at community college and lived in France/Spain for 2 years but is a US citizen). Next fall, I will be studying abroad in Europe (maybe at INSA Toulouse in France) then I will be coming back to the states for my final semester.
 
I go to one of the top 5 CS schools in the nation and have had multiple internships so I am surely fine on job prospects if I were to stay in the US. However, if I were to go abroad, I would either do a masters degree (in CS/electrical engineering/computational linguistics/etc) or immediately work as a software engineer.

So my questions....
What are some good countries for the computer science industry (in terms of job prospects OR specific universities)?


What countries in the EU are ""easier"" to get citizenship in? What about France?


Will tech companies abroad expect a Masters degree?


Would I be better off working in San Francisco for a couple years before trying a job abroad?

2iehtd,4,2014-10-05,Can't deal with life like this.,Geirkrak,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2iehtd/cant_deal_with_life_like_this/,"This is really just going to be a big rant, but if you manage to get through it all, I could use any advice.

I've been really feeling how bad my anxiety gets the last few months or so. I've always been extremely anxious around people but the last few months have pushed me to a tipping point of sorts. I'm graduating college in a few months and I've been looking back at all of the missed opportunities, all of the regrets, and all of the fuckups I've had over the years and its really getting to me. 

I'm 22 and I've never had a real job before. I've applied for a lot, gotten maybe 2 or 3 interviews, and bombed those catastrophically. After awhile I just gave up and decided to focus on school. With graduation coming up and looking at how bland and empty my resume will be, I decided to start applying for internships. Long story short, I got one.

What a fucking mistake that was. The job description was vague but I said screw it because it would like pretty nice on a resume once I'm done with it but I seriously regret this decision. Its only been two weeks but working here drives my anxiety to new levels. I work with people 15 - 20 years older than me and I feel like they all judge me and talk down to me. No one ever gives me any sort of direction or instruction on how to do assignments they give me, they just plop a stack of paperwork on my desk before I arrive and I'm just supposed to know what to do with them. And then when I finally work up the nerve to talk to someone about it, they make me feel like a fucking moron for not knowing how to do it.

The other day the secretary was out and so I was placed at her desk. I had to manage the phone, deal with the front door, sort and distribute mail, and do all of my other stuff on top of it. I seriously felt like I was going to have a mental breakdown. Answering and talking on the phone is one of my biggest hangups (get it) and it was even worse due to the fact that the majority of questions people had I had no answers to. I'm instructed to transfer these kinds of calls to other people in the office but everyone comes and goes throughout the day so I end up transferring the person to a deadline, resulting in them calling back and asking why I'm a fucking idiot. Multiply this response for everything else that I do for 8.5 hours a day. During my breaks I go to my car and just sit, trying not to cry and trying to stop myself from shaking from the stress of not fucking up during the course of the day. I don't eat during lunch because of the nausea, I feel like I'm losing weight. By the end of the day I just drive 1.5 hours back up to school where I try not to lose my shit and cry on the drive home.

Things don't stop there either. I'm the same way in school, too. I barely have any friends. I don't talk to anyone because I know I'll probably fuck up and look stupid in front of them. I've (obviously) never been on a date or had a girlfriend. The idea of that happening is so far from reality it barely phases me anymore. But the fact that I'm graduating soon makes me feel like shit about it. I'm going to graduate and move back home where there's no one my age and be alone. I've wasted 4 years of being surrounded by people my age by living in constant fear of them. Thinking about how badly I've fucked things up so far in life depresses me beyond belief. I don't even know why I try. 

The one area/activity that doesn't completely paralyze me is rock climbing. I've been climbing at my school's gym for 4 years now and I've never made one friend. Not one. I climb three days a week, for long sessions and not once has anyone talked to me. But I haven't tried either so I have no right to complain. I'm confident and not anxious there for whatever reason, but everywhere else in life I feel like breaking down. I can't explain it.

I guess the end-point here is that I've realized that I need to get help. My school has counseling services but nerves and arrogance have put me off from seeking help for almost 4 years now. Its free as a student so I might as well take advantage of it. I don't know if it is going to help me though. If he tries to prescribe meds, I won't be able to take them. I have no job, so that means no money of my own. I can't talk to my parents or anyone else about this for a lot of reasons. My mom has anxiety problems of her own and constantly worries about me and I fear that coming forth with my own issues will just make her even worse. I don't have anyone else to talk to, even as a ""shoulder to cry on"", so to speak. I don't see myself getting better but if I don't try I fear I'm gonna jump off a bridge or something years down the line. I'm tired of being alone, feeling like shit all of the time, and not experiencing life because of the fear and stress of interacting with people.

If anyone has got tips or similar experiences, I'm all ears."
2iei97,1,2014-10-05,"Problem with my graduate program. I need advice, Reddit (US)",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2iei97/problem_with_my_graduate_program_i_need_advice/,"Hi reddit. I'm sorry this is so long... I got kind of emotional when I was writing it. I haven't told anyone this whole story yet, and there's even more I haven't included. There's a tl;dr at the end... I'll be surprised if anyone has the time to read all of this, and that's okay. Thank you for any amount you care to read. :)


I am a graduate student in a nursing program. I'm a good student and I take school and my work very seriously. Before this, I had never had a bad experience with an academic program, ever. I have been completely blindsided by this situation and it's affected me so badly that I am considering dropping out of the program. Considering quitting is very out of character for me. I'm usually the ""tough one,"" but this is crushing me. Everyone has their limits and this has worn me down over 2 years.


So here it is: There is one faculty member, who also happens to be the department chair, who has apparently decided that I am on his personal shitlist. I don't know how this happened, but I've heard from students that he's singled out people before. Don't have the details though. Starting a couple years ago (I came into the program in 2012), every time I had to speak with him he always seemed on the verge of just bitching me out, especially if we were alone. So at first I figured okay, so he doesn't like me. I'm an adult, I can deal. Just smile and try to stay out of his way. 


That was fine until he started escalating. I've taken three courses with him, and a couple semesters ago other people started noticing his behavior towards me. Other students started asking me why he would be rude to me in class, or borderline-chew me out, or would just be generally unforgiving. Like, if another student forgot to bring in homework, he would smile and say it was totally fine, not to worry about it; but if I did something like that, he would berate me in front of everyone. At first I was okay, it just made me try harder. I thought maybe he was just pushing me to do better. Oh, I was very wrong. It got to the point that he was obviously looking for reasons to get mean, but he still never really crossed the line. Just made me beyond stressed out, started to get depressed, just scared all the time that I was going to fuck up somehow or run into him in the hallway. Made me really jumpy and anxious. The general atmosphere got really hostile and it started affecting my health. I lost a lot of weight and I had some other stress-related health problems. I got seriously depressed and it started to affect my home life.


Despite all of that I still got straight A's and did really well in my internships. Both of my site reviews stated that I was one of the best interns they had ever had, and they both wanted me to continue working with them. So fast forward to this semester. Like most medical (and I guess, graduate) programs we have yearly progress reviews with faculty. I was actually kind of excited about mine because I knew I had done really well and I was looking forward to getting some positive feedback. I really felt like I needed it after all the hostility and negativity. So who decide to do my faculty review? Yep you guessed it. Dr. Department Chair. He didn't do everyone's. Just mine and a couple others.


By this time I had had enough bad experiences with him that I had already begun secretly recording my interactions with him. (Yes, I live in a single-party consent state. I researched it before I did it) I never got anything too bad. Mostly he is one of those people that says really nasty things in really subtle ways, usually with a smile on his face. Sometimes I didn't realize how awful something he said was until I was away from him. Maybe I should say how I interact with him... I definitely don't kiss his ass (maybe why he hates me), but I am *always* respectful and polite. I take pride in being a professional, and I consider school my job. I am not going to allow someone to take advantage of me, but I am also not going to do something stupid like get bratty or something. My response when I get mad in these situations is to just nod my head and not respond, not get baited into an argument. Anyway, the end of year review is supposed to be feedback from all your teachers, your advisors, your supervisors, anyone who worked with you. It's meant to be constructive so you know what to work on.


So, recall that this is at the culmination of two of the worst years I have ever had, emotionally and physically, much of which was due to him and other weird, unprofessional things that happened to me in the program. I went into this meeting and he spent the first 30 minutes (no joke) berating me about a quiz that I had missed and had to make up about 6 months before. Then he spent the next 30 minutes talking about how all the teachers, including him, feel that I am disrespectful and unprofessional. He said that I had disrespected him. He said a lot of very specific things, like that I think I know more than my teachers. He said that I think that I shouldn't have to take tests. He said that I think I'm too good to have to go to class or sit next to my classmates. He said all of these things as ""You think ____,"" saying that I actually do think and do those things. He said that certain teachers had told him these things, in addition to what he thought of me. What bothers me the most about this is that he said that I THINK THESE THINGS. **That is completely untrue!** He never asked me my thoughts on anything. In fact, I barely spoke more than two words during the entire hour I was in there. I was too much in shock. I knew I couldn't defend myself, because this was clearly not about my performance, since he was reveling in his cruelty, making little smiles every time he said something particularly vicious. Nothing I could have said would have helped, so I just let him go on. I was in shock inside. I think because I wasn't responding by getting visibly mad it made him more angry, because he got progressively nastier as the hour wore on. 


At the end I was so stunned that I just wanted to get out. He gave me my progress review and told me to sign it. He had failed my clinical work for the year, despite that I had nothing but wonderful reviews in my clinical work. He said it wouldn't affect my gpa, but still. I was so desperate to get out of his office that I didn't care at that point, I just signed it. I should have read it first. 


I got to my car and just cried. It was too much, to have everything I worked for failed because he had such a problem with me, for some reason I didn't even know. All the teachers that I got along great with. According to him, they believed all that shit too. I had developed (I thought) good relationships with all of them except him. To hear that they had problems with me too was heartbreaking, and I didn't understand it. I looked at the progress review form then... He had put everything he said in writing. Lifeinsthesky1 thinks she is better than everyone else. Lifeinthesky1 thinks she is too good for this program. And so on. All in first person, as though I actually thought and said those things. All untrue. AND THEN HE HAD MADE ME SIGN IT. That was the final stab to my stomach. He did not say one positive thing to me the entire time I was in there. No, other students did not have this experience. Just me.


The thing is that if there had been actual criticism, I would have been fine with it. We need critique to improve. But this wasn't critique... and it was almost all false. After a few days I worked up the guts to talk to the teachers that had supposedly told him some of these things. They were pretty upset when I told them what happened. One in particular, who was the supposed source of much of Dr. Department Chair's ""information,"" was visibly angry and immediately told me in no uncertain terms that he did *not* say any of that. That made me feel a little better, at least, to know that I wasn't crazy. But then what? He still subjected me to all that and made me sign an actual document that went into my file. He said that it wouldn't be permanent once I graduated and it's not shared with employers, but still, it's in there and any other faculty or staff can see it. 


Of course, the malicious abuse is continuing. I do my best to stay out of his way and be polite when I see him. I worry about the things he says to the department about me. He still, if he's alone with me, makes disguised-but-nasty comments about my performance or professionalism. It's weird because I do my best to be professional, despite how he's acting towards me, and performance-wise I do very well.


So to the point. I'm sorry this was so long. I haven't told anyone this whole story yet and I got pretty emotional writing it all down. I am tired. I am so tired of his mistreatment. I pay a lot of money for this school and I have worked really hard to get here. I feel like I deserve to be treated respectfully. I do have a pretty thick skin but I feel like that review meeting crossed the line, and making me sign that paper was going too far. My question is, is what he did slander or libel? Do I have grounds for a lawsuit against him or the department or the university? I know he talked to the other faculty about me and it did effect the intern position I got (he gave me the worst one we have). I have the recording of the meeting, but like I said he didn't say anything overtly abusive (he's too smart for that I think), just a lot about me as a person. My health has suffered, physically and mentally, and I don't know if I can keep forging ahead in this place, but I don't want to waste the time and money I've spent, and I still love what I'm doing. 


I think it's worth noting that this has NEVER happened to me before, ever, in any academic or professional setting. No one has EVER said these things about me before. I mentioned to a few of the people I worked with outside this program some of the things that were said about me, and they outright laughed. Said it was crazy to say that stuff about me, of all people. Yet Dr. Department Chair has something of a reputation for being a dick, and people talk about him being unprofessional and mean. The whole thing is as insulting as it was upsetting. He undermined me both as a professional and as a person.


I haven't given my state, and I know that makes it kind of difficult. I don't know if I should pursue this with a lawyer or not. I feel justified in being outraged at how I've been treated, but I don't know if that translates to having legal grounds for a lawsuit. I'm not one of those people that's always looking to sue... I have really no idea how it works because I've never been in a position like this before. But I feel like I've put up with enough, and the only way this will stop is if I pursue legal action. 


Thank you for reading this. Any advice would be appreciated.


Tl;dr: 2.5 years into a graduate program and the department chair has gotten progressively more unprofessional towards me, becoming what I feel is abusive. He has created a hostile environment towards me that has gotten so bad that I have had very real and serious consequences to my physical and mental health. I recorded a meeting with him where he said that I say/do a lot of things that were untrue, and where he said a lot of personal and mean things about me as a person, and then he made me sign a document agreeing to all of it. Found out later that he had lied about what other teachers had said about me, that he included in the document. I want to know if what he did qualifies as slander or libel and if I can do anything legally about his abuse. I don't want to drop out of this program. I really want to finish. :(

Thank you reddit. Just getting this off my chest has made me feel a little better. :)

What I was wondering about is what else would I be able to do in order to become a better candidate post graduation for a job in the CS area.  I was unable to get a internship over the summer because of personal reasons but I still want to get some experience before I graduate since this industry seems to be driven more off experience when it comes to getting a job.

So how did an English teacher with minimal experience (and actually no credentials) become the sole system admin for a school with four servers (seven now), a website that hadn’t been updated since 2011, over 900 devices, and 3000 users (and BYOD)? 


During an internship for my MA in Education, I just happend to fix my cooperating teacher’s laptop for them - a simple driver issue. As it had turned out, there hadn’t been a tech at the site in over a year. Long story short, my paperwork was rushed through, I was screened (A process that had people asking me questions such as “Do you know what ‘reimaging’ is?” “What’s Active Directory?”, “How would you troubleshoot a network issue?” and a few dozen other questions anyone with a sense about computers could easily answer - next thing I know I’m signing a contract. What’s the worst that could happen? 


That was October 2013, and let me just say that had I known then what I know now I would have never accepted the position - and not only because I’m making about $10 per hour (pre-tax, I really don’t want to talk about it)… but that’s not the point of this post. Over the last half year or so, I’ve cataloged thousands of calls, some ranging from simple password resets, to major server rebuilds (which I taught myself how to do - trial by fire and all) to some of the most inane things that not only make me as an educator, and a person of somewhat good common sense, literally weep. 


Being that I am an English teacher, writing has been another hobby (as well as a source of living for some time of my life) - and also a form of therapy. I have about two dozen “good” bad stories that I’d like to catalog in one place - so until I run out of steam, I am going to share them here. The goal is to not specifically to poke fun at the level of competency around me - but rather to share experiences with people that can understand and hopefully relate - and ultimately even share their own stories in the same vein. 



I have several ideas to run with, including character profiles and insane job responsibilities - but to start this project off I want to tell a story that began about two months ago



***


 I was on my way to setting up a high stakes testing lab after our custodial staff manhandled them to clean the floors over the summer when I stopped by a teacher I hadn’t had many run ins with prior to that day. The conversation went as most of my conversations since starting this gig have, the user asks how I’m doing, and moves into some awkward relationship building (on their part, I’m an easy going kind of guy), and after a few seconds I decided to continue to the lab of 50 computers that needed to literally be reassembled. The user follows. After a few seconds of keeping pace with me, I turn to the late 20-something and bluntly asked if there was something I could help them with. 


“I need new speakers. Mine don’t seem to be working.” about sums up the user’s confusing babble.


I inform the user that small things like speakers were not supplied by the school - but they could request some with their department budget. Unsatisfied with this reply, the user seemed pretty upset, at which point I remind the user of my self-imposed workflow policy of “Email me and I’ll put you on my docket.” I genuinely meant this.


The user huffed and left me to my own business and I filed the incident under “I’ll deal with that crazy at a later date.” and didn’t think about it again.


Until a month later, when I received the following email, from the district’s standard tech request system, and not the website I put together to help maintain the ticket system. I feel the need to tell the user that when this form is used, my AP of Admin and my principal, the only people I answer to, receive a copy. This will be somewhat important a little later. 


“No sound. Nothing. Hard to watch required videos and be expected to pass tests without sound. You said you would replace the speakers and yet you never did.” 


I added this to my docket and got around to it sometime later that afternoon. I set up an appointment with the user for when I would be stopping by, and the user assured me they’d be in the room at the time - they weren't. Fortunately, I had keys and was able to let myself in to the classroom. My good fortune continues as when I enter the room, there’s only one computer (despite my inventory saying there were supposed to be four present - but that’s a tale for another day). 


I hop on to the computer, and yet another surprise is found - the user is logged in and has not locked their workstation. I’m actually happy about this, so I can replicate the environment in which the error is occurring. The first thing I do is load up YouTube and play one of the videos on the front page, and sure enough - there’s no sound. 


First and foremost, the educator in me gets riles up - as the “required” videos the user spoke of is supposed to be done outside of school (I had to do it as well). But then, it’s not my place to judge how others use their “free” (see: instruction) time. Onward to the rest of the story! 


The first thing I check is to make sure the speakers were powered on. They weren't. I click the speakers over to the on position, and electricity fills them instantly - and then in the third period, plasticpal made sound


Easy job was easy, and feeling satisfied, I leave a note on the user’s workstation saying the sound was working once again, explained to the user what had happened and asked them to confirm with me that they noticed it was working - and carry on about my day. 


The user did not email, which in my experience, isn’t exactly rare in our line of work. But I knew for a fact that the audio was working. I did not think about this incident again (outside of a laugh or three with a special bottle of whiskey).


Until I received the following email, again sent to both of my admins, about a month later:


“No sound on the computer. This is my 3 request. Was told it fixed first time but still havent ‘herd’ anything.” 
(^a literal copy + paste)


It wasn't the snarky comments or ""better than you are"" attitude that irked me, nor the fact that my name is being muddied with my admins - but more the fact that I knew that I would have to actually deal with this in person again.


I wrote the user back asking when they would be in their room,to which they promptly emailed me back detailing every minute detail during their day, but not actually specifying a time for me to come by. So I just bluntly decided to ask, ""6:25 is a good time,"" I receive back. Problem, I'm not on campus that early. Solution, according to the user: Come in a ""few minutes"" early.


I explain that was not an option, the user work replies telling me that its expected that I help the users,and that I should work around them. I said that's what I was trying to do, but during the hours of 7:30-3. ""Well technically 7:20 to 3:30"" they reply.


At this point, I decided to leave the user in ignorance because it did not matter. My hours aren’t set by me, and there’s no OT (or “comp time”) if I work even a second over at the request of an admin - so on the principle of it all, I said no. This conversation went back and forth for several messages until finally I found out the user was going to be in their room come first hour of work the following day.


But before I get called to my P’s office - to get reamed for not jumping when the user said to jump. “Why is it taking 3 requests to get work done?” I explained the situation, but I may as well have been talking to the wall. 


The next morning, I make my way out go the user's location (which is a half mile exactly from my office). Knock on the door. Nothing. Knock again. Nothing again. I let myself in with a key,and jump right in to the task at hand. I'd walk you through how I troubleshat the issue dearest reader, but I don't think that's necessarily pertinent to this story, suffusive to say that the speakers were still powered on and sound was indeed still coming out of them. I turned on one of my favorite 10 hour video of ambiance music, wrote a note explaining sound was working, and took my leave. Surely the have “herd” the sound. 


I bump into the user later on that day. I explain that I had just left their room and sound was working,to which they asked what I did. Jokingly I said I turned their speakers on and they were not amused. I explained that I hadn't done anything except to verify the sound was working - when the user explained there still was no sound. Reluctantly, I decided to ask the user to show me exactly what they were doing that was causing sound to not work. Better to snip this now, I guess.


We get back to the user's room and they immediately close out of the Youtube mix I’d loaded up earlier, to open up another IE (sigh) window to load up a clip they had watched that, according to the user, ""hadn't had sound all year long.""


The clip quickly clicked into place; Strangely the user was right: There was no audio on the video at all. For a moment, if only briefly, I questioned what was real. 

That is until I looked at the video : A black and white film found on YouTube that, in the title and description read: ""A silent film from the 20’s.”

2if39g,1,2014-10-06,All sorts of college questions,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2if39g/all_sorts_of_college_questions/,"I go to a major state university in the mid west and I am fucking sick of school.

I was in the air force for 4 years, I had a desk job so I was able to take classes while I was in. I took physics, math and a ton of stuff. Around 60 credits, unfortunately only about 6 transferred. Anyways I didn't learn anything I realized, the classes were from a local college but they were specifically easy for the military.

I started going to a community college and I really struggled, I failed algebra, retook it, failed trig, retook it, failed calculus, retook it. I don't know what I am doing with my life, I just can't learn. I really wanted to get out of the air force, I hated it and it was the worst experience of my life. I just couldn't stand it, having no control over my life, going on random 2 month deployments to nowhere and having to drop everything I am doing (those classes? yea you just sort of get exempts on everything and pass anyways) and get fucked.

Anyways I am not in a state university and I fucking hate it. I work really, really hard. All I basically do is spend time on class, 80+ hour weeks plus some side stuff so I am profitable and I am not doing well at all. I hate my life, I am getting Ds or Cs in all my computer science and math classes. I can't keep up with the work, I just work and work and work and I never get anything done. 

I know I am not smart, I know I am not the most focused and hardest working person but this is beyond infuriating. I just never do well, I am extremely competitive so I want to get 100 percent on everything I do, I want to be the best at everything but I am always the worst. It is extremely embarrassing, upsetting and frustrating to me. 

I have 3 more semesters left but if I change schools and make my degree a BA it would only take me 1 more semester. Does it really matter? I am going to graduate with under a 2.5 GPA no matter what I do at this point so obviously my GPA is not going on my resume. I applied for about 60 internships and no one would touch me because my GPA wasn't about 3.2. 

I really don't know what to do, I just feel like I am fucked. I'm not a great programmer, I am not a smart person, I can't do well in any of my classes, I am not social, I don't do anything and I don't make friends I am just wasting my time in college. What the fuck do I do? I am fucking miserable. I don't know how to learn and I am not smart enough to get by without putting a shit load of effort in but this makes me fall behind so far I never have a chance to catch up.

I am thinking about just dropping out of school, is there really any point in getting a CS degree with a 2.2gpa? I mind as well drop out and spend the next two years learning something, working on a real project and then using that on my resume. Doesn't that look better than CS 101 - Command line interface solitare CS 102 A really neat tree sort CS 103 A totally unusable iterator CS 105 An unusable database

What do I do? Should I just cut my losses and drop out of school? I really don't think school is for me, I don't learn but I am also not smart enough to learn on my own I guess. I am just sort of stupid and lazy so I don't know what to do. Maybe I shouldn't even be doing CS, maybe I should just work retail for the rest of my life I don't know but I work hard and get nothing out of it."

2ifh6v,158,2014-10-06,There's something off about my new neighbors [UPDATE],AlaskanStoryteller,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ifh6v/theres_something_off_about_my_new_neighbors_update/,"Here is the first part of what's been happening: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ic3es/there_is_something_off_about_my_new_neighbors/

To address some concerns: I have filled my parents (and a couple other neighbors) in on all the weird stuff that's been happening. We do have guns in our house and we know how to use them. I'm not super concerned about being able to defend myself, though I would be pretty concerned if I actually had to against my neighbors. That's some scary shit. Anyway, back to what's happened since last night...

So last night after I submitted my post about what had been going on, I left to meet some friends. As I was about to open my front door, I saw someone standing on my porch, huddled against the house. I couldn't see much, so I stood debating about what to do. I finally decided to just throw the door open and demand an explanation. I gathered my courage and held my breath as I flung the door open. To my surprise, the person standing on the porch was a girl, about my age. She had shoulder length black-red hair, a nose ring, eyebrow piercing, and black fingernails that held a cigarette between her now trembling fingers. She looked like a deer in the headlights when I threw the door open, and looked as though she was about to run. I furrowed my brow.

""Who are you?"" I stepped closer cautiously, now more curious than anything.

""Look, I'm sorry."" She had a twinge of a French accent. ""I'm Alana. I uh... Sorry. I just had to get away."" She gestured towards the house next door, where the weird, foreign sounding chanting was still in full swing. ""I get so *sick* of it sometimes. Pretending to be..."" Her voice trailed off as she seemed to realize she had said too much. She laughed. ""You know what I mean. Parents, right?"" She took a long drag on her cigarette and blew it out between her lips. ""That's why I moved to Nice. Only come back once a year now."" She waltzed down to the end of my driveway and dropped her cigarette in the street. ""Again, sorry for standing on your porch. Like I said, parent stuff.""

And with that she was gone. She turned around and walked back up the driveway towards the house. I know she thought I stopped watching her; she couldn't see me from where she was. She glanced over her shoulder, and pulled something out of her bag. At first I froze when I saw the blonde head of hair. I was certain for a moment that it was her own mother's severed head. Air returned to my lungs when I saw her swing it up over her head. A wig. Of course. For a second I was relieved, but then I realized that that was still weird. I sighed and walked to my car, reluctantly accepting the fact that I would not be finding out anymore that night. When I got home around 2am the street was silent, and no light or movement came from the Braverman's.

Fast forward to today, pretty normal morning. I slept until almost 12pm though, so when I got up I had a bunch of texts and missed calls, mostly from my friend Donna asking if I wanted to have a study session with her at a local coffee shop. I said yes and hastily got ready. When I walked out the door the street was covered in fog. I shivered and hurried towards my car, when seemingly out of nowhere someone grabbed my arm.

""What the **fuck**!!"" I yelled as I yanked my arm away. Alana stood before my with wide, pleading eyes and a finger to her lips. 

""Come over real quick.""

""Fuck no what do you want?!"" This was too weird, I don't even know her!

""Please? I just want to show you something. They'll be back in like twenty minutes please we don't have time to talk about this."" The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end; she was scared. Really scared.

""Okay... I have to be somewhere. So real quick.""

As she led me inside, she told me a version of what has been going on. I'm just going to summarize what she said. Basically, her parents were always a good Catholic couple, as normal as they come. So when Alana was in middle school and rebelled against their traditional values by converting to Wiccan, they had a cow, to put it mildly. She said they went as far as to hire an exorcist.

""And it wasn't even *real*, you know? I don't believe in that stuff, I was 13 for Christ's sake. I actually go to Catholic church now in France. But they could never let it go.""

So she went to Connecticut for college, got an internship with French vogue, and moved to Paris. Now she works for a small publishing firm in Nice, but that's beside the point. She comes home once a year, she said, and everything is like it always has been.

""Until now. It's terrifying. They do strange things and they tell me it's all 'part of church'. Bullshit! I've been to mass in the Vatican, and I've never seen or heard anything like the shit they do. And they make me pretend to be like them. All polished and perfect. And for who? Their weird ass friends? Those people look more like me than them anyway."" She pulled me into the house.

You know how when you go into other people's houses they always have a smell? And when it comes to your own house you never notice the smell? Their house had no smell. None at all. Everything was totally normal, of course. The upstairs was as I had remembered it from when Tory lived there; all the doors were open but one.

""That's their room. And this is the one they set up for when I stay here. But this..."" She gestured to the one closed door. ""They wouldn't let me in there. Said it was storage and they were embarrassed. Well, last night while their little friends were here I went to snoop and it was locked. They aren't all that bright though, so I found the key pretty easily. And what I found... I just don't understand. They'll be back soon so look quick and tell me what you think I should do. I'm afraid to sleep here another night.""

And with that she opened the door. The smell of rubbing alcohol hit me like a truck, but soon I couldn't even focus on the smell. I can barely even describe what I saw in front of me. A large black pot with what looked like grease in it, full to the top, sat off to one side. Dolls were stacked in one corner with their mouths and eyes stitched shut. But the creepiest thing was the loom. It stood against the back wall, directly across from us, and had woven strips of... Something woven through it. It looked like normal cloth at first, but I realized it was obviously stained with something. And thicker than normal cloth. I have no idea what it was but it looked *wrong*. A big basin stood in front of the loom with a dark liquid that looked... Off. Suddenly, Alana checked her watch and rushed me out of the room. She shut and locked the door and ushered me downstairs and back out into the street.

""So? I don't know what to do, it's like they're witches or something!"" 

I just stared at her. ""Dude, call the cops.""

""On what grounds? 'Hey my parents have some creepy dolls and are doing a strange sewing project'?"" She was frantic.

""Look, I'll talk to my parents about it but I don't know what to tell you. Something is definitely up with your folks, they act way too normal and do way too weird of things when they're not acting normal. I don't know what's going on, but we'll figure it out, okay? I have to go, but try to find out what you can. I'll be back tonight and we can talk.""

So I left, and when I got home I told my parents everything. My dad was immediately on the defensive and told me to never go inside their house again, but that he wanted to help Alana and didn't know what we should do. He said he would get some of his cop friends to look into it, as discreetly as possible. I told Alana all this when I met up with her about an hour ago, but she didn't say much. I know she's scared and I offered to have her stay with me but she said that would just make them more suspicious. Tomorrow is Monday, so the cops are going to find as much information on Tom and Sandra Braverman as they possibly can, and get back to us. I'm sorry that this post raised more questions than answers but I am totally lost and getting your opinions helps tremendously. "
2ifi2x,1,2014-10-06,Setting up IT Support infrastructure,mikkel421427,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2ifi2x/setting_up_it_support_infrastructure/,"Greetings!

Very recently (read: 3 weeks ago), I was hired on as an intern at the local theatre, and I was handed the task of cleaning out the depot so that the single permanent IT technician would have a better place to work other than his own office desk. This has since led me to take on the task of, in general, trying to put up a more dedicated IT infrastructure. So far, it has been going well. The IT workshop now has two desks, one being the desk on where I'm currently typing this and the other one being a dedicated workbench, intended for Hardware fixings. Now, the hardware side of it, I have fairly nicely locked down (A screwdriver and a case of bits, mostly insulated (best I could manage, I nicked it from the basement woodshop), planning to get my hands on a soldering iron, and a voltmeter. Already got a powerstrip attached to the table so that I can have multiple PCs hooked up, so that together with the networking switch, me and my boss would be able to update multiple PCs at once). 

Now, this is all well and good, but I have run into a bit of a snag. While we do run on a TerminalServer (Remote Desktop'ing into your workstation, pretty much), the first, and pretty much only, avenue of action in case a machine shits itself when it comes to the software is to nuke it from orbit and reinstall Windows. And by this, I mean from scratch. So, in order to try as hard as possible to get away from the nuclear solutions, I am turning to you guys in a hope that you can recommend me some software (preferably stuff you can shove onto a USB-stick or similar) which can do some of the following things:

*  Restore from an image. I have already thought about Deep Freeze, since that's what they use at my dad's school (the kids got smart, the IT department became smarter), but I would like to know if you can think of anything better/cheaper/more practical/whatever.

* Clean the computer. Here I'm talking about anything from CCleaner to Malwarebytes and everything in between. Not anti-virus software, though. We already run F-secure.

* Possibly automate some stuff. I'm only an intern here until mid-December and from then on, my future is a little bit uncertain. I might move company, might stay here, or might just be straight-up out of work and my boss simply doesn't have the time to do everything, since he handles pretty much ALL the IT in this place, ranging from the ticket sales system, to the terminal server, to the great big F-off screen outside that shows what's going on in the building. 

* Help him monitor stuff remotely. This one is a rather recent addition, but it fell into my head after they were discussing the ventilation system in one of the theatre halls, they ran into the issue that they didn't have any way of checking if the ventilation was working properly other than adjusting it on the computer (which is in one end of the building, followed by going all the way to the theatre hall itself (in the other end of the building). Now, this point is not a requirement, since it'll likely end up being rather expensive and not completely necessary, but it would still be nice to be able to control most of the building without being chained to the desk.

* Something else I haven't thought of, but that you guys think would be nice to just have, just in case.

One last requirement for all of this. It has to be fairly easy to learn how to use, or at least somewhat quickly googlable. I don't have proper training as an IT technician, I mainly use Plug'N'Play stuff and my boss simply doesn't have the time between helping set up IT for the shows that are coming in and making sure that the building IT in general doesn't burn to the ground.

Go by the assumption that we have nothing in place, software-wise, other than F-Secure when it comes to Software repair.

If you can provide documentation for why we should choose precisely this or that piece of software, it would be nice, since, in his eyes, at least, the argumentation of ""A bunch of guys claiming to be trained IT technicians on the internet said we should put this near the computers!"" isn't that good of an argument.

In advance, thanks for the help guys! Both from me (An Intern, honoured for being chosen to do this), and my boss (who sadly isn't here right now since he's off trying to make ticket sales behave)."
2ifj5r,1,2014-10-06,Very confusing situation. Please help. I'm [24/m] in love with a girl [20/f] that has a boyfriend [23/m]. She said she loves me back.,asamer538,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ifj5r/very_confusing_situation_please_help_im_24m_in/,"I'm in a very consuing situation at the moment and appreciate any advice anyone can give.

Background:

I'm 24 years old. I have a good job as an Environmental Consultant and I'm considered to be by many a 'very mature' guy (you will see why it's relevant later). I have been in relationships before (some were serious and some were not) and i have now been single for the past two years.

The girl, let's call her Carol (20/f), is someone that was a friend of a friend for a while. We hung out in lare groups a couple of times and I found her to be quite the beauty. I also foundout that she's taken and that her bf lives in another country but travels to come see her every once in a while.

This summer, Carol and I started talking a lot over facebook. It started out as her asking me questions since she was doing an internship at another enviornmental consultancy. We got to know each other a lot and all of a sudden started seeing each other almost daily! It started out as meeting up in starbucks after work and a week later we were going out for dinner every other night. The conversation never stopped. After dinner, we would go back and continue texting. During weekends we would see each other and keep texting till the sun is out! 

I fell in love with her...and my feelings for her kept growing more and more each day. I did not tell her since she has a boyfriend but it was quite obvious that i was interested.

She has been dating her boyfriend for 4 years! Yes, ever since she was 16. They met during a summer vacation and have been in a long distance relationship since. He does the effort to come see her and so does she. My friends and I met him and their personalities are worlds apart. She wants to be a chemical engineer and is so ambitious. She dreams of travelling the world and working in exotic locations. he loves his village, still trying to finish undergrad, plans to work with his dad because finding a job is 'too difficult'. he still lives off his parents money.

Fastforward, her internship is over and she is now continuing her degree. Me and her still talk daily with a lot of flirting going on. Until one day, i told her how i felt and that i'm going to block her because i can't keep talking to her this way and being around her makes it hard for me to get over her. her reply was as follows:

""you have no idea how much i care about you. Im not trying to tease you or have any hidden messaes behind my words. But I really love you. Very Obviously so too. And its sincere from the bottom of my heart"".

After that day our flirting increased and at times became a bit sexaul (not too much but the right amount of teasing). Until, she woke up one day and said she feels horrible bcz this is cheating and that she should confess to her bf and pray that he forgives her. Her bf, like any normal guy, said he will forgive her if she blocks me from her life. She refused to do so. Her bf said he still loves her but wont talk to her until she blocks me out. I told her im ready to be with her but she said that when he left her and stopped talking to her she realized how much she loves him. And that she loves both of us -_- but the two of them share history since he was her first everything. 

My questions (at last) are as follows: 

1. What should I do in such a situation? I thought of blocking  her msyelf and making the decision easy for her, but i'm so attached to her. 

2. How can I allow her to see what both me and her friends see about her bf. That she is simply too good for him. That she deserves better. 

Any advice whatsoever will be appricated

EDIT 1: 

Today me and her actaully did a bit of sexting. It has actually went this far! She woke up an hour after feeling guilty and said the following:

""I love my bf. I want it to work with him with all my heart. And i wasn't physically attracted to you for a good year after knowing you until I thought of you as perfect man. You are sexy, intelligent and handsome. I feel the fire when our eyes lock and thinking of you in that way drives my body crazy to the point where I just want to sleep with you and i cannot get my mind off of it. But I want it to stop. I know I keep falling into the same cycle but my bf doesn't deserve this. I can't go on. And I do love him, I swear I do and I dont think I love you YET.I just have a burning desire towards you and im only throwing gas on the flame. ""

I can't focus on work anymore. I need help. This has messed up my mind and mood so much.

I'm hoping that writing this out, and the advice that I get might help me make up my mind.

My background is in engineering, specifically in energy. Both a large traditional oil and gas firm, and a cleantech startup. I studied aerospace engineering at a tier 2 undergrad school.

I'm paying the full cost of tuition and living expenses through loans, so it's going to be an expensive process for the next two years. The only reason I bring this up is that it definitely colors my options with regards to what I should pursue afterwards.

I guess i'll start by listing out the areas that I find appealing, and what I see as the positives and negatives around each one.

**Finance: Investment Banking**

 Pros: Extremely highly paid, very strong placement from my school, linear recruiting process, prestigious/good exit options to other industries/areas of the the financial world, almost impossible to get a job (at my career stage) in this industry except as a first year MBA intern

Cons: Extremely long work hours (100+ hours a week) and the downsides of no getting much sleep and working every weekend, I don't think I would find the work very interesting


**Management Consulting**

Pros: Well paid, good career exit options, linear recruiting process, decent placement from my school into top firms


Cons: Long work hours (but not as bad as investment banking), travel, excessive powerpoint presentations

**High Tech Firms**

Pros: Typically great working environment, aligns with my personal interests, better work life balance

Cons: Lower compensation, only a few large firms recruit at my school, recruiting is later in the year so harder to have a backup plan, likely have to move to west coast

I guess i'm currently leaning towards tech, since I value having a decent life outside of work, and the companies interest me more. I feel like i'm being foolish to not take advantage of the strength my school has in finance though. On the other hand, I don't think i could deal with the no sleep/lifestyle of investment banking.

Any thoughts of guidance would really be appreciated. I know I'm spoiled with options, but for someone who likes to take time to evaluate things before making a decision, writing off whole areas is really hard."
2igg5e,5,2014-10-06,I need some help with renaming files,workaccount314,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/2igg5e/i_need_some_help_with_renaming_files/,"Hey, I haven't messed with python too much but I have the huge task at work of renaming about 4000 drawings.  I'm a part-time intern and this has to be done in two weeks so I really don't have the time to complete this manually so I'd love it if this could be automated by a python script.  I have a file full of the drawings in question and I also have a .csv file (although I can save it as a .xlsx if it matters) which has the drawing name in one coloum and the location of the file in another.  How would I automate this?  My pseudocode for this is as follows (although it'll look more like C than python as I'm more familiar with it--haven't coded in a while though so it'll look pretty bad).  Any and all help is appreciated, thanks!

    \\This is assuming column A contains the filename and
    \\column B contains the file path

    path=B2;

    For(name=A2; name++; name&lt;=A(final)){

        file(path);
        file.title=name;
        path++;

    }

So this is generally how I think it'll work.  Anyone who can translate this to python for me would be greatly appreciated and save me a ton of time!  Thank you so much for your time and help!  In the meantime I'm going to google what I can about this and try to throw something together.

Edit: Along with specifying what cell the new name is in would I need so specify the file type as well?  Like saying ""file.title=name+filetype(path);"" or something?  Thanks!"

Here is my answer:

After I earned my bachelors in Business Administration, interned for Company X as an Analyst, where I provided analysis support for the sales team by reviewing annual reports and business models  to identify strong investment opportunities f. Once my internship ended, I used my analytical skills to take on a project with Company Z - where I was responsible for our increase in revenue savings by $100K by implementing XYZ program on time. One of my best strengths is my ability to solve problems, I take a problem and work through a solution using a combination of communication with teams and using analytical tools like Excels and Oracle. Since my project is winding down, I seeking for a similar role, where I can join a strong team and make a positive impact on team dynamic, so I am really excited about this opportunity. 

What do you guys think about my answer?
How can I improve this?

To me it sounds like a robot. 

Please help. Thank you!

EDIT: 
I rewrite my answer.

I just finished a project with X Company, where I was responsible for our increase revenue savings in our supply chain. I love working in a fast-past environment, where I have the opportunity work in teams to accomplish a common goal. Being a Administrator seemed like a great way to bridge my interests with a career, so I very excited for this opportunity. 


How does that sound?"

2igq0o,4,2014-10-06,TwoX said I should post here.,waldeinsamskeit,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2igq0o/twox_said_i_should_post_here/,"I posted this first in /r/offmychest and then in /r/TwoXChromosomes, and they told me to post it here as you guys might be able to give me better support. I just can't keep unloading on my girlfriend and my younger sister but I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.

So my mom has done some pretty messed up things over the course of my life and now a lot of them are becoming impossible to ignore anymore. I just feel totally stressed out, I can't focus on school, and I feel disconnected from everything except my (wonderful) girlfriend [I'm a lesbian], and my baby sister.

That being said, I had a fairly normal childhood. Except for the fact that my two sisters and I were molested by one of my brothers for a bunch of years. When my older sister got into drugs and self injury, my parents started taking her to therapy, and the truth came out. My brother was taken to my aunt's house while the police and DYFS investigated. Unbeknownst to me, (I didn't find out until recently, 6 years later), my mother convinced my sister and I separately that we shouldn't press charges and that we should keep my brother out of jail. He was welcomed back into the house and we were forced to be in his company on a daily basis. This is about the time I stopped sleeping normally, took up self injury, and began struggling with panic/anxiety/depression.

Over the next few years, my mom refused to acknowledge that I was struggling with these things (even when I told her directly) and instead took me to doctors until I was misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia. It wasn't until I started wearing a heart monitor for my cardiologist that she finally realized that I was having panic attacks and anxiety attacks (I was seeing the cardio for unexplained spikes in heart rate/palpitations). She advised that I start seeing the therapist at my university, who turned out to be a total moron but that's beside the point.

I had a nervous breakdown because I couldn't leave my dorm room. I got stuck in there panicking and sobbing for a few hours until someone was able to rescue me. After that I stopped going to classes there, and eventually moved home after the semester was over. I was still using my mom's insurance so I was unable to seek out therapy on my own, and when my mom finally decided to try and help, she sent me to the same exact therapist as my sister. For obvious reasons I stopped seeing her.

When I went back to community college, my mom started in on our financial troubles. My dad hasn't had an income in a while, as he is trying to groom a company to sell. My mom hates working and complains about it incessantly. Anyway, I was in an intensive, hands on program that required a significant time dedication, and I was working two jobs beyond that. I was home about 6 hours a day (to sleep) and my mom was asking me to buy food every week. On top of that I paid a couple of house bills every month. Over the summer, I had an internship with a two hour commute each direction and still waited tables on top of that to help my mom. There were a couple of big ticket things that she took money for. Like the mortgage. Or the timeshare maintenance fees.

Recently I have changed schools to work on my bachelor's degree and only have one job. Back in March, I met this awesome girl and stopped spending so much time at home. She started asking me about some of the strange things that go on in my house (how my mom feels entitled to my money; why my abuser is still allowed in the house, etc) and I'm like ""I have no fucking idea.""

I haven't started therapy yet but I have something lined up. I just want my mom to shut the fuck up about what my room looks like, or what I do with my free time, or how I never give her any money or spend time with her. She's fucking annoying. I don't want to hang out with her. She subjects me to the presence of my abuser on a regular basis and thinks that is okay. Every thing that I do is scrutinized by her. And when I am home, I get yelled at for the dumbest shit.

My family is totally dysfunctional and I'm 1000% ashamed of it.

I can't wait to leave. A close friend of mine offered to let me come live with her for a while until I can sort things out. My only issue with that is that she has a studio apartment in a dangerous area. :/ I don't have enough money saved to leave or make enough to rent alone. I don't even know what I'm asking for here."
2igv5u,1,2014-10-06,How to get into a big agency?,rc225225,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2igv5u/how_to_get_into_a_big_agency/,"Hi,

I'm getting a little disheartened, so maybe I could receive some tips from those of you in the industry. 

I graduated with a BCom marketing degree from one of the top business schools in Canada, and went to Asia to do an internship for a couple of months at what is arguably the biggest PR firm in the world. I really enjoyed it there, and they wanted me to stay but unfortunately the pay was so pitifully low that rent would take over half my salary. In short things just wouldn't work out financially. 

So I went back to Canada, and had a hard time finding another job, but eventually found an in-house marketing position. 

However, I've always really wanted to work in a big agency - and I really enjoyed the time in Asia at the PR firm. 

Oh, and a bit of background about me I guess. I specialize in digital marketing such as creating social media campaigns, etc etc. At the agency I got a chance to work with many big name clients that most people would have heard of if I were to tell them what they were. 

Combined I would say my work experience in digital is around 2 years by now. I've sent in many resumes on linkedin with my resume, cover letter, portfolio etc etc but no replies. I do understand this though because I have been trying to apply to the agencies in the US. 

So, for those of you in the advertising/agency industry, how do you get in? What kind of resumes get noticed, and what kind of work do hiring managers like? 

I am interested in large agencies...like JWT, Y&amp;R, Olgivy and Mather, etc. Positions that I would be interested in are digital strategist, account executive (preferably digital focused), etc. Basically anything that would allow me to gain client servicing experience as well as marketing/campaign strategy. 

Or maybe if you have an opening at your agency...I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at my resume to see if I would be a good fit for the position. I am more than willing to relocate to a big city (LA, New York, San Fran etc). 

Thank you in advance, and I will be more than willing to answer any questions you may have about my background. Thank you very much. "
2igw95,1,2014-10-06,I honestly think that the tech industry is gonna kill me.,blazingarpeggio,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2igw95/i_honestly_think_that_the_tech_industry_is_gonna/,"I am a CS major, technically a Junior, but already on my fifth year of uni. And in all honesty, I am afraid of this career path.

Why? Yesterday, I tried to count how many programming languages I'm going to learn and/or re-learn *this semester alone*. COBOL, Perl, Scheme, C#, probably Erlang, 32-bit Linux Assembly, HTML5 with some SVG (what the hell SVG isn't even standardized yet), CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, SQL... fuck. That's not counting Enhanced ERD, Normalized Relationship Tables, UML and automata. Jesus. That's not the end of it. I still have my internship and special topic next year (no way I'm gonna write a freaking thesis). I'm way behind on my two subjects, and I'd be fucking damned if I would use more than half of those languages at a given time - let alone my entire life.

But that's nothing. I'm afraid of what I'm hearing about the tech industry. Unreasonable shifts, crappy pays, taxes, stressful work environments, completely oblivious clients... the list goes on! Mother of god, I have a life to live! I have friends, and family, and other passions that I want to pursue. But no. Once I graduate, that shit doesn't matter. The client won't care if I would want to play in my band every once in a while or I want to grab a bottle of beer with my friends on a Friday night or travel or have dreams or whatever. All they care is how pretty the user interface is, then they'll nag me on how to do this or that or fucking whatever I don't give a flying shit! **The tech industry is fucking ridiculous.**

But the thing is, I chose this. I had this affinity with programming since I was in high school that I just had to pursue it later in life... which is now. I don't know if it was a good decision, but I don't regret it either. I just know that I don't wanna do this forever.

I'm just burned out I guess."
2ih3es,3,2014-10-06,Grad school SOP need proofreading. Please help!,[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/2ih3es/grad_school_sop_need_proofreading_please_help/,"I am submitting my application for Masters grad school in Mechanical engineering in a US university, and below is my SOP. Any help, suggestions and constructive criticism would be deeply appreciated by me. Any valuable insights on any red flags or good points that this SOP contains will be awesome too. Thanks people, I am really getting goosebumps writing my SOP.
----
SOP
----
I was never someone who was always befuddled by the sciences from my early years. Inspite of my natural cognitive ability in the sciences, I was very keen, from early on in my life, to become an artist. I was taken by the freedom and complexity that came with canvas art, and the ability to visualize complex scenarios. As I grew up, I wanted to apply art to real life, and that led me to consider architecture as a potential option for me. Yet, while studying architecture, I realized that I wanted to solve real world problems like global warming, and that simply building a bunch of energy efficient buildings would just not cut it for me. I also wanted to do something more intellectually stimulating than architecture. So, I took a year off after my 12th standard exams just to prepare properly for the various engineering entrance exams, and got through X university.

I struggled with the subjects a bit in my first year, as I had not taken science very seriously before. But in my second year, I had an excellent professor for the topic of Basic Thermodynamics, Mr. Y. Under his teaching, I took to thermodynamics like a fish to water. I worked on catching up on my knowledge by solving tricky problems from different good books, and by the time I reached my third year I was already sufficiently proficient in the subject. Looking to finally start on really solving major problems, I joined as a research assistant under Mr. Z, a college professor, and started working on improving the efficiency of a Solar Air Heater. I was essentially working on trying to improve the efficiency of the heater by incorporating artificial roughness along the boundary layer of flow in the duct, and through computational modeling I was able to work with a wide variety of models (more than 250 computational models), and get significantly good results, which will be shortly published in a respected peer-reviewed international journal by December. 

As I worked on the project, I started to appreciate the dedication and patience involved in it. It soon became clear to me that there did not exist a silver bullet for every problem, and the simple fact that even the professor was clueless about the path I should take for my problem excited me. I enjoyed the freedom involved in research to invent my own techniques and algorithms to solve the problem in an independent and elegant manner, without being confined to the repetitive formulae and obvious concepts in books. The demands of the project caused me to self-educate myself on various softwares, including even programming languages. I realized that I had learned more useful skills in a single year of my research project, than in my three years as a classroom student. These experiences were a big part of my motivation to continue higher learning in a research-focused program and eventually enter critical research. 

I also took up a short duration independent project in my third year in the field of thermoacoustics. I was intrigued by the field as it looked to be something new and complex with huge potential. I learned the basic mechanics of thermoacoustic engines on my own via research papers, as there are very limited good books available on the subject. I came up with an idea for improving the efficiency, but could not find a way to convince my advisor on how well the modification might work as neither of us had explored that field before. Owing to the complexity of the topic chosen and lack of sufficient guidance, I discontinued my work on it, yet handling such a complex topic gave me a lot of confidence in my abilities. I also did a summer internship at Z, in order to further explore the thermal sciences, where I worked on enhancing the differential convection heat transfer in a 2D square shaped cavity, using nanofluids. I had to quantify the increase in efficiency of the heat transfer in the cavity using Ansys Fluent, with different concentrations of nanoparticles and temperature differences. The internship helped me broaden my exposure to the field of thermal sciences, as I was daily working with PhD students who had the same interests as me. 

Apart from research activity in my institute, I was also well-involved in several other co-curricular activities. I worked on the working committee and the executive team, both in a technical club in college with multiple activities pertaining to Mechanical Engineering. I organized and headed a few events in my college technical festival, and participated in a few intercollegiate events too. I was also responsible for teaching and training juniors who wished to enter my advisor’s research group, and out of eleven of them, ten are now involved in serious projects of their own within the group.

I have come to appreciate the scientific method, and am clear about my aim to learn and pursue, some of the toughest problems in the field, which will be possible if I engage with the brightest people of similar curiosities in my field. I believe a Masters program will be a step towards achieving my goals. University W is well known for its excellent program in thermal sciences, and I will be honored to be accepted into it as a graduate student. While I will enter the program with an open mind, I tentatively wish to pursue research in nano-scale and micro-scale turbulent convection heat transfer. Along the way, I also plan on taking up extra side projects that will form the link between my research and its real world applications to solar heating devices. I believe sustainable energy technology will develop much faster if it seriously incorporates the study of the physics of nano-scale heat transfer and use of nanostructures, and I plan on connecting the dots in my time as a graduate student at University W, should I be accepted into the program.
 
Thank you for considering my request.

2ih5bd,35,2014-10-06,"LPT: How you solve problems with government agencies, bureaus, and departments.",sonnyclips,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2ih5bd/lpt_how_you_solve_problems_with_government/,"As a staffer with experience in both federal and state legislative offices this is something I do and you know very little about. I solve problems for constituents so that they don't have to spend hours of their lives sifting through bureaucratic nonsense. I can't guarantee a positive outcome but I can speed things up dramatically. I have counterparts everywhere around the country. People like me go to bat for constituents every day and we're one of the reasons why it is very hard to unseat an incumbent and chances are you didn't know I, or my compatriots even exist. (I'll be referring to myself throughout this so know I'm referring to anyone that works in a state or congressional legislative office.)

To receive my help is easy. You just need to look up your state or federal senator and representative and ask. Call the district office because that is where the caseworkers are, we'll be the ones you want because your not looking to make legislation your looking to have someone intervene on your behalf. 

The first thing to know is that we ask for nothing in return but a bit of civility and common decency. The results you get as far as expediting matters will be linked to how nice you are. We don't get paid much so we are driven by wanting to help others. We are not bureaucrats in the strict sense so if you call us that we'll be less excited to help you. Having said that I can help people on a lot of shit you would probably wind up calling a lawyer to do and guess who those lawyers call? They call the persons congressional office a lot, especially on those issues that people call the lawyer first like IRS and Social Security problems.

In contacting your legislator; I would email something first and follow up with a phone call. The email is so that you are entered into the constituent management database so that you don't get ""lost"" in the system. You'll likely get the most traction with the call. On the off chance that some hardheaded intern or someone who is having a bad day happens to answer (In the offices I've worked in almost everyone answers the phone except when some idiot on the radio hands out the number. This usually means that cranky people dial us up repeatedly all day about some piece of crazy legislation that doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of passing gets picked up as a kind of publicity device, then we let the intern or the voice mail pick up.)

The process of picking up and working on your issue can usually be pretty easy. You tell us what bureaucracy you're having issues with and we call or email them. I would usually get a response by the end of the day and in most cases whatever hiccup was stalling a resolution would be solved in two or three days. For example you had an issue with a refund being claimed fraudulently by a ID theft perp and your taxes are jacked up. I would call over to the Tax Advocates office and they would pretty much solve the issue and call the constituent in four days or so.

Some cases can take longer, the really problematic agencies are the INS, VA, and Social Security. They handle a shitload of people and they have highly defined methods that fit 99% of their clients. That 1% though is still a big number because millions of people is a lot. When I worked at the federal level I worked with DOD, VA and the IRS mostly. I did FEMA and NOAA too but that was usually working on stuff between local governments and agencies, not constituents. We intervened for our towns too, City Manager know their shit usually so that was a totally different ball game. IRS has it's shit together so even if cases took a while the professionalism was top notch, like working with Google or Intel level, no bullshit whatsoever.

The VA and the DOD was another story. Their computer systems are ancient. I would intervene on things as varied as medical care and tuition benefits. 99.99% of the problem with veteran's in treatment at the VA is due to their computers being fucked up. They have to make 80s era character based computers talk to each other and track patients. The people are solid for the most part and get little regard with what they manage with the resources available. 

One of the biggest cases I had was securing the bonus check for a 24 year old combat vet that the National Guard tried to fuck him out of. He came off deployment and they told him he was only going to get $5k of the $15k they had promised. They had somehow miscalculated and they couldn't make good, total bullshit. He had already stuck his neck out and they said they couldn't pay but they would let him out of his contract. He didn't want out, he wanted to be in the Guard, go to school and live the life he had planned with the bonus that was offered. It took six months of persistence and cajoling and threats of going to the press before they finally relented and paid him his money. By that time my boss had left office and the incoming Rep, same party, decided she wanted some ""fresh faces"" and fired me. I work on legislation and do some constituent work now which is what I want to do anyway, I offer that little end story as an example of what we go through so that when you talk to my friends, Republican or Democrat, working in that office you call, keep in mind they are their only because they believe in what they are doing. They don't care about your beliefs, who you voted for, or whether you vote at all; they just want the system to work for everyone so be nice to them.

**TL:DR Call your state rep or member of congress if some agency is jerking you around. They can't always solve the problem in question but they can make the resolution happen faster. Sometimes though they'll even help fix things.**"
2ih5js,2,2014-10-06,Career advice,PhoneWalletKeysGO,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2ih5js/career_advice/,"Hello.
I was looking for some career advice and was hoping someone could provide some insight. I am a student studying majoring in accounting and finance hoping to get my cpa and my Cfa designations. I have completed two work terms in a mid sized accounting firm and I wanted to try how it was like working in finance so i got an internship in a finance role. I plan on writing my Cfa level one next summer and complete the masters in accounting as well.

After graduating I see myself working in public accounting till I get designated and then switch to a finance role. I have done some audit and tax and it's not the most fulfilling work. But I admit I have a lot to learn still, so maybe my opinion isn't valid.

Does anyone have any recommendations about which designation to focus on first, or any experiences in making the switch. Should I look for a finance job as soon as I graduate? Is it pointless going for both designations? I just want to keep my options open in the future.

My gpa is a 3.3 and I will have one more internship next summer and I'm hoping to land a front office/banking position (any tips here would be appreciated too).

Programs I am efficient with: MS Office, SalesForce, DiamondD, NEACT, EMS Manager and I can type 60 wpm. 

All in all fellow Redditors, I thought this current employment would be my dream of helping students find positions, but that isn't the case here and I am tired of promoting a business that I feel isn't living up to it's promises to it's students. If I seem like someone you would like to see a formal cover letter from or my complete resume, please feel free to contact me on Reddit (preferably with a link to your company site) and I will gladly send you anything you would like to know about me. 
Thank you for the time to read this rambling plea for employment, I greatly appreciate it and look forward to hearing from folks. "

I was doing much better but now I'm obsessing so much over my work that I'm sabotaging myself.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ih72z/ive_done_somewhat_poorly_academically_due_to_my/,"Hey there. Twenty year old lady here, junior with an English major and Journalism minor hoping to get into small town news reporting, editing and publishing, or most favorably, grad school. I want to be an academic, I want to write, but I can't seem to bypass this hump. Here's an email that I wrote to a Professor, then hurriedly deleted and rephrased. It sums everything up pretty well:

 Professor,

I apologize that I wasn't in class today (It's two thirty right now, but I assume that by the time you get this email, if you even get it, it will be after class). I really hope that sending a message via iLearn will work this time (I've never sent a message on iLearn and I'm a junior! Hopefully this ""CC to a recipient's email address"" function will work!).

I'm not really in a great place mentally at the moment. I've struggled with pretty awful depression and anxiety and  young adult angst sort of stuff pretty heavily throughout my past two years of college. This summer, I finally got off medication, which remedied the sleeping issues that had been attributed to my depression by my psychiatrists since I'd started taking it at fourteen. I had a fun internship this summer that I felt I was doing well at, and the beginning of this semester has gone by without the sorts of missed-deadline disasters that have peppered my whole college career. But I've become so grossly fixated and anxious about being a good student that it's sabotaging me; I've been sleeping three or four hours a night, staring at blank word documents for hours beforehand, too anxious about impressing my professors to amend the ""bad student"" reputation that I feel I have to put words on a page (which is a problem for an English major, let alone any Liberal Arts major, especially).

I just had an essay due for one of my favorite professors, whose classes I've struggled through since my freshman year. I've always done well in his classes because he'd been so lenient with me, but he'd had enough; he changed his course policies on late assignments because of my performance last semester. I was so fixated on redeeming myself that I missed the deadline after spending two all-nighters anxiously pouring over the text.

Moreover, my summer internship at a small newspaper has left me with two articles that I was supposed to complete the week before school started. My car got totalled, I had to deal with insurance, I've had to adjust to living off campus and my extra-heavy workload, and I still haven't finished them yet. They're constantly hanging over my head, and I always have just enough work that I can't get them done. It's absolutely terrifying.

I'm going to see a therapist again tomorrow, I've found one nearby that is covered by my insurance. I'm so sorry I've missed a few of your classes, chances are I was rushing to complete assignments for other courses that had been delayed by this academic block or sleeping off an all-nighter or feeling terribly depressed and stuck in bed. My goal at the start of the semester was not to miss ANY classes or get ANY assignments in late, and I still want to achieve that for the rest of the semester. I absolutely can't afford to miss more of our class; it's pretty foreign, text-heavy subject matter, missing your lectures is going to be pretty detrimental for me. It's also a super fun and interesting class that I don't want to keep missing.

Can we please arrange a time for me to make up this quiz? I'm trying to get caught up on everything so that I can spend at least part of the semester as a normal, ""good"" student. I'd really appreciate it if we could do it on Friday; I have a few things due in other courses on Thursday, and I'd like a chance to reread a few things since it's been a week or so.

I apologize for sending you this huge pathetic (in both the Aristotellian and usual senses) email. I just want to be honest with you about what's going on (mostly so that you don't think that I'm blowing off your class and intentionally not taking this quiz; I really truly enjoy your class). I was really hoping that I wouldn't have to send a big sad email to a Professor this semester, but I guess all I can do now is avoid future sad emails.

TL;DR: Trying to be a good student with anxiety and depression so that I can into Grad School and be successful and not waste my parent's money and stuff. So fixated on doing well that I'm too anxious to get anything done. I want to get back on track, but it feels like the holes I dig just keep getting bigger and bigger, and I'm sick of digging myself out of them."

    When I interviewed for my first ""real"" sysadmin job (as an intern for
    Acquia up in Boston a few years ago - this was after my 1-year Americorp
    stint as a web developer-turned Lead sys-admin for a nonprofit in
    Boston)....
    
    ... I was asked what my favorite Linux utility was. My answer: rsync.

    &gt; Those of you used to mega bandwidth and solid connections are missing out
    &gt; of how useful basic Linux commands can be when things are not so good.
    &gt; I re-learned why rsync (over ssh) beats a straight ""scp"" connection with
    &gt; the following wonderful example:
    &gt;
    &gt; rsync --partial --progress root@server.foo.com:file.zip  file.zip
    &gt;
    &gt; I'm on my 6th retry, trying to copy a file whose connection is dropped by
    &gt; the ISP in the middle every 10 minutes on the nose of each transfer start.
    &gt;
    &gt; I think it's my new standard file copy method. It's picking up right where
    &gt; it was dropped very quickly. I might even have my 1gb of data in a few more
    &gt; tries :)

    If the data you're coping is relatively already compressed (ISO install DVD, DVD, mpeg4 video, mp3, zip, gz): you can speed things up by disabling compression.
    
    You can also alter the cipher the underlying ssh connection uses.
    
    Using those techniques, I typically gain a 20-40% boost in transfer.
    
    Rsync options:
    -P = shorthand for progress and partial
    
    -e = rsh command and options (defaults to just ""ssh"")
    
    Ssh options:
    -c = use this cipher (defaults to aes)
    -o = ssh options
    
    Put it all together:
    
    rsync -Pe ""ssh -c arcfour -o Compression=no"" file.big.gz remote:/mnt/big
    
    * Uses RC4 cipher (not as secure, but hella fast)
    * turns off ssh compression
    * shows progress
    * calculates partial upload

I'm a current 2nd year medical student looking to take time off during med school to apply to business school.  I know that MD/MBA programs exist, but I don't like the one at the med school that I am at, and it doesn't have a good concentration in healthcare medical tech, so I'm thinking of applying outside (starting fall 2016).  

I'm concerned about the fact that I don't have ""work experience"", though by the time I'll apply, I'll have spent a year working/interning in the hospital, and a year of classes.  

My profile is below - I'm looking for general feedback on my application, and any advice for someone in my position!


**Education**

- Undergrad:  Top 3 USN&amp;WR
- Bachelors in Computer Science/Engineering
- Magna Cum Laude, ~3.65 GPA
- Currently at top 20 medical school (pass/fail like all med schools)
- Haven't taken GMAT yet, but got 36 on MCAT (pretty good).  Not too worried about score - I'm pretty good at test taking.

**Work Experience**

- Interned at Google (software engineer) as a junior in undergrad
- Went straight to medical school after undergrad
- Currently consulting part-time for a medical tech startup in addition to school (1 year x 15 hours/week + summer internship)
- Summer internship in healthcare leadership and management
- Involved in a startup that has received some funding, but still very small scale.  Entering competitions currently (past 3 months)
- Leader of two student groups in med school

**Schools I'm Looking For**

- Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Booth, Wharton (that order)


Any help/feeback is appreciated - thank you!"
2ih9iu,1,2014-10-06,Finally out of financial crisis mode; where do we go from here?,Sometimesummoner,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ih9iu/finally_out_of_financial_crisis_mode_where_do_we/,"Hello r/pf! I'm coming to you guys in hopes of making sense of what to do now that, for the first time, there's a little left over out of every check. 

I know our situation is not great. I know our actions, failures and foolishness got us here. My husband and I made some pretty awful decisions when we went to college, and while he was in grad school, only making part-time Starbucks wages while he did his mandatory unpaid slavery internships, I worked 70 hour weeks for a hyperbolically stupid business that had a lot more promises than they had on-time paychecks. So we wracked up debt and ulcers until we got out of that situation...but we're finally out. $15k in credit card debt will be paid off Friday, and the last phase of my husbands' half-wage slavery internship will be over in December. 

So, what do we do now? 

Opinion 1 is that we should try to buy a house after we can save up the down payment. The housing market where we live is still utterly decimated, and there are lovely homes in the $150k range. There is definite appeal in being able to take my balcony garden into earth, and giving my dogs a yard to run in...and on initial mortgage calculators it looks like our rent wouldn't change more than it already will once our lease renews.

But now that we're almost out of one heap of debt I worry about getting into another one, and I worry about the repair costs of being my own landlord after a decade of apartment life. And I also worry about rent that just keeps going up indefinitely. Renting a house would raise our monthly rent payments by about $150...but I'm fairly certain my family thinks this is what we should do simply because its ""what you do"" after you've been married and out of college for a few years, and we will be in this town at least 6 more years, but...augh.

Opinion 2 is that we need to attack our mountain of student loan debt (160k; my undergraduate, his undergraduate, and his graduate) before we do anything else; ever. This seems the most logically long-term strategy for me, but also seems a little scary. It's going to take us decades to finish paying that off; should we worry about being 50-something's who are debt free but also have no equity or real savings?

Opinion 3 is that we should continue making out minimums on our student loans, invest somewhere else, and otherwise pretend we're still living on $35k/ year. Anything spare goes to loans, but a large chunk each check goes into savings at the start of every month. 

So...yeah. We've been in firefighting mode so long, now that we're gazing out over the ashes we're just feeling bewildered. We've never been on our honeymoon, let alone a vacation while we struggled, and I want to not fuck up the rest of our lives as badly as I fucked the last 10 years, so someday, we might be able to go on one when we retire.

The Pertinents;

We're both 28.

* My Salary - $66k/yr

* His Salary - $15k last year, probably $50k this

* Debt - $6k left on car, $300/month

* Student Loans - $80k at 3%, $80k at 6%

* 401k  - $28k (job matches 50% up to 15%)

* Roth IRA - $20k

* Savings - $2k (just started refilling after a rainy day struck, again)

* Bonus - I usually get a bonus of around $6k every march.

* Credit Score - about 739"

Not nearly recognized as the University of Texas, so finding an internship this past summer was difficult.

Here's a quick summary of what I have been doing: Interned at a semiconductor this past summer where I was the only student from my school here surrounded by Electrical Engineers from Universities throughout the States. I applied for my position even though it was for EE students, but they liked my drive and passion and hired me. Now my position was not strictly for EE's meaning it was something all computer science students could do considering it was very software related. They kept me here to work part time during the Fall during my senior year of College.

My questions are that after my project is done here at this semiconductor for my Co-Op, there won't be much for me to do considering it is a company filled with Electrical Engineers with those requirements. How should I go about starting to look for positions in Texas and California starting today considering I am a Senior.

My University is not as recognized as most major ones, so should I really press the fact that this semiconductor hired me even though I didn't ""technically"" have the requirements, but that they did see my passion and strengths and hired me based off that?

Also, I know I should really start polishing up my LinkedIn, but anywhere else I can start to look and apply? My University doesn't have the most adequate career services but I will go there to see what my opportunities are. "

Things went amazingly well! We got a long extremely well, went on a number of fun adventures/dates, and really hit it off. I've never had any prior serious relationships (not that I haven't wanted to in the past, but mainly because they just never worked out). She became my first and my first for a lot of other things too :). The more I kept seeing her, the more I started to fall for her until one trip to the beach, where I told her I loved her.


The last couple weeks of summer I went on a backpacking trip across Europe with my best friend from high school. I kept in touch with my gf every night until she started having doubts and was in a generally bad place mentally. She suffers from minor depression, anxiety, and I feel that coupled with me being away, she began stressing over whether this is what she/we really wanted. Of course I did! The girl is amazing in every way and I would not hesitate to tell her. Nearing the end of the trip, we messaged back and forth about mainly our insecurities about our relationship and largely she was very short with me. It got pretty heated and I think with all the negative depressive thoughts pouring through her head, she came to the conclusion that she no longer wanted to be with me. She never broke up with me though and promised that she was committed.


I return home and we patch things up. The first couple days were good until we fought. We broke up and I felt like absolute trash. I didn't want to break up with her, but the way things had been going the last few weeks, it didn't seem fair to me to stay in a relationship she didn't want to be in. A couple days later I messaged her, pretty much begging for her back. I felt like a pathetic dog, making myself completely vulnerable.  Ultimately, she took me back, said she cares for me, loves me, and wants to be with me. She said that I had met her at the worst few months of her life (having been through one of the lowest depressive periods in her life) and that she doesn't know why she thought she didn't want to be with me.  Through all of this, I held on to my own feelings. I knew that I cared for her deeply and maybe I don't deserve to be treated the way I was, but I still love her and as long as I do, I will do what's right in my mind to make things work. We often talk about moving together to a different province the next summer after we have both graduated from school. The last few weeks have been really good!


**Questions:**
The last year, I've been working an internship out of town (about an hour away) where I also moved.  I have until the end of November left then I move back home to finish school.  She's started school again this semester and is also working a part time job so we're both busy which makes it difficult to see each other sometimes. During the time I've been with her, I've come home every weekend to see her and I make an effort to come home once during the week as well, homework permitting.  **On weekends, we usually see each other at night, as she studies during the day, runs errands with her family, and is out. Is this enough time to be seeing each other? Should I be making more of an effort to?**


Also, on the topic of her not wanting to be with me: I don't think I can handle the emotional stress again of being pushed away, her being short with me, not wanting to be with me, etc.  I'm worried she might get those feelings again that she doesn't want to be with me and I don't want that happening. **I feel I am right to worry, but in worrying does that mean I'm not confident in myself or the relationship?**  I am worried that this just isn't meant to be. I am worried that that just by having the thought that this isn't supposed to be means exactly that? BUT maybe this is just one of those ""cold"" moments in a relationship people always talk about. I love her and I'm still going to try as long as she wants to try as well. This is what I've been telling myself. **I tell myself I truly love her, but how do I know that love is what I'm feeling and not just strong infatuation? Can you only ever TRULY love one person? If yes, how do I know that I truly love her? If no, what does all these thoughts I'm having mean?**


Laslty, I feel I might be insecure about being alone. I feel that I find activities to do to keep myself busy so that I can drown out my own thoughts of being alone and well, bored.  On one hand, I feel I do these things because I enjoy doing them and I do them to keep myself happy. The other hand, I feel that they are also a primer for covering up my insecurity of being alone. I have to constantly be doing something, watching a movie, playing a video game, going outside for a walk and though a lot of these things I may do by myself, I still don't just sit and reflect. **I'm confused as to how being alone frightens me when I can manage to find things to do that I enjoy doing?** Maybe I am too used to being single and that I am actually okay with it? I don't know how to answer these.



---   
**tl;dr**: I'm having difficulty realizing what true love is, coping with the fact I might be afraid of being alone, and wondering if a relationship with a questionable future is worthwhile to stick it through for the time-being? **Am I overthinking all of this?** If more details are needed to clarify things about her or myself, I can provide more in the comments."

My state overall has a lower cost of living, but the office is in a large city.

2ihzf7,16,2014-10-06,"I've done somewhat poorly in college due to my depression. I've gradually been improving, and I've come off my medication since last semester. I was doing much better but now I'm obsessing so much over my work that I'm sabotaging myself.",macaroni_veteran,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2ihzf7/ive_done_somewhat_poorly_in_college_due_to_my/,"Hey there. Twenty year old lady here, junior with an English major and Journalism minor hoping to get into small town news reporting, editing and publishing, or most favorably, grad school. I want to be an academic, I want to write, but I can't seem to bypass this hump. Here's an email that I wrote to a Professor, then hurriedly deleted and rephrased. It sums everything up pretty well:

Professor,

I apologize that I wasn't in class today (It's two thirty right now, but I assume that by the time you get this email, if you even get it, it will be after class). I really hope that sending a message via iLearn will work this time (I've never sent a message on iLearn and I'm a junior! Hopefully this ""CC to a recipient's email address"" function will work!).

I'm not really in a great place mentally at the moment. I've struggled with pretty awful depression and anxiety and young adult angst sort of stuff pretty heavily throughout my past two years of college. This summer, I finally got off medication, which remedied the sleeping issues that had been attributed to my depression by my psychiatrists since I'd started taking it at fourteen. I had a fun internship this summer that I felt I was doing well at, and the beginning of this semester has gone by without the sorts of missed-deadline disasters that have peppered my whole college career. But I've become so grossly fixated and anxious about being a good student that it's sabotaging me; I've been sleeping three or four hours a night, staring at blank word documents for hours beforehand, too anxious about impressing my professors to amend the ""bad student"" reputation that I feel I have to put words on a page (which is a problem for an English major, let alone any Liberal Arts major, especially).

I just had an essay due for one of my favorite professors, whose classes I've struggled through since my freshman year. I've always done well in his classes because he'd been so lenient with me, but he'd had enough; he changed his course policies on late assignments because of my performance last semester. I was so fixated on redeeming myself that I missed the deadline after spending two all-nighters anxiously pouring over the text.

Moreover, my summer internship at a small newspaper has left me with two articles that I was supposed to complete the week before school started. My car got totalled, I had to deal with insurance, I've had to adjust to living off campus and my extra-heavy workload, and I still haven't finished them yet. They're constantly hanging over my head, and I always have just enough work that I can't get them done. It's absolutely terrifying.

I'm going to see a therapist again tomorrow, I've found one nearby that is covered by my insurance. I'm so sorry I've missed a few of your classes, chances are I was rushing to complete assignments for other courses that had been delayed by this academic block or sleeping off an all-nighter or feeling terribly depressed and stuck in bed. My goal at the start of the semester was not to miss ANY classes or get ANY assignments in late, and I still want to achieve that for the rest of the semester. I absolutely can't afford to miss more of our class; it's pretty foreign, text-heavy subject matter, missing your lectures is going to be pretty detrimental for me. It's also a super fun and interesting class that I don't want to keep missing.

Can we please arrange a time for me to make up this quiz? I'm trying to get caught up on everything so that I can spend at least part of the semester as a normal, ""good"" student. I'd really appreciate it if we could do it on Friday; I have a few things due in other courses on Thursday, and I'd like a chance to reread a few things since it's been a week or so.

I apologize for sending you this huge pathetic (in both the Aristotellian and usual senses) email. I just want to be honest with you about what's going on (mostly so that you don't think that I'm blowing off your class and intentionally not taking this quiz; I really truly enjoy your class). I was really hoping that I wouldn't have to send a big sad email to a Professor this semester, but I guess all I can do now is avoid future sad emails.

TL;DR: Trying to be a good student with anxiety and depression so that I can into Grad School and be successful and not waste my parent's money and stuff. So fixated on doing well that I'm too anxious to get anything done. I want to get back on track, but it feels like the holes I dig just keep getting bigger and bigger, and I'm sick of digging myself out of them.

I speak french and english, and I will work anywhere as long as the workplace speaks either language.

**What's in for you**

I have solid work experience on top of my two previous internships, which means I'll hit the ground running. I have been working in the field for a few years, so you'll get a great bang for your buck.

As for paperwork, it's fairly easy (for you, at least). You need to let my school validate your existence and fill your part of the paperwork for the work visa. I will be the one handling most of it.

I've recently begun looking into web development as a career instead. I have basic programming experience in python and worked on computer vision research in C++ for a few months. Some of my questions are:

1. How much is not having a degree in computer science going to affect my employment prospects? I've taken loads of math courses and have a minor in math. Would these things help in any way?

2. What road map do you suggest for someone just starting out with the limited experience that I have, in terms of learning the language frameworks and technologies? I'm going through the Ruby tutorial by Zed Shaw (http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/) right now and it seems to be going pretty smoothly. I've also dabbled in some HTML / CSS before, so I assume it won't take long before I'm caught up to speed? What about Javascript? 

3. How do I figure out if I want to do back-end work vs. front-end work? Would I even need to know HTML/CSS/JS if I'm looking into doing more back-end type stuff? Is the market better for front-end or back-end, or does it depend on location? I live in NYC if it makes any difference.

2iijnu,0,2014-10-06,Resume Building,jviall,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2iijnu/resume_building/,"Hi all. I'm re-building my resume to gear towards a software development position. To be more specific, I'm applying for an internship in at a few places, one of them being at Google. My issue is that I don't know how I should focus my skills and experience and what things I need to emphasize and in what way. I'm a sophomore at a University in the US majoring in CS, with proficiently intermediate java programming experience and little experience in html, css, php, and bash. My current job is for the University's IT division as a student worker. I do departmental IT support which involves a lot of work with MS DeployStudio, MDT, Active Directory, Excel, Photoshop, Illustrator, and diagnosing a multitude of issues with both OS X and Windows. Previously I also did computer repair for the university doing repairs mostly on Mac's and Dell's both desktop and notebook ranging from RAM upgrades to Motherboard replacements, to data recovery. All of my other experience is some customer service positions in the food industry like cook and cashier at a fast food chain and a busser at another restaurant. Does anyone have any insight as to the best way build my resume to gear it towards a software engineering internship? I have a good resume now but for a more general position that isn't specific to my future career. 

TL;DR: Applying for a software engineering internship at Google and one or two other companies, how do professional software developers build their resume's. Answer's that are specific to my skills would be super helpful."
2iisn0,1,2014-10-06,"Senior, unsure if internship will lead to job. Looking for advice",thatdudekak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2iisn0/senior_unsure_if_internship_will_lead_to_job/,"Hey I am currently a CS student at a small private University in Austin, Texas. Not nearly recognized as the University of Texas, so finding an internship this past summer was difficult.
Here's a quick summary of what I have been doing: Interned at a semiconductor this past summer where I was the only student from my school here surrounded by Electrical Engineers from Universities throughout the States. I applied for my position even though it was for EE students, but they liked my drive and passion and hired me. Now my position was not strictly for EE's meaning it was something all computer science students could do considering it was very software related. They kept me here to work part time during the Fall during my senior year of College.
My questions are that after my project is done here at this semiconductor for my Co-Op, there won't be much for me to do considering it is a company filled with Electrical Engineers with those requirements. How should I go about starting to look for positions in Texas and California starting today considering I am a Senior.
My University is not as recognized as most major ones, so should I really press the fact that this semiconductor hired me even though I didn't ""technically"" have the requirements, but that they did see my passion and strengths and hired me based off that?
Also, I know I should really start polishing up my LinkedIn, but anywhere else I can start to look and apply? My University doesn't have the most adequate career services but I will go there to see what my opportunities are."

2ij1fz,0,2014-10-07,"22, M, US with a STEM degree --&gt; UK, AUS, Germany, Anywhere!",1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2ij1fz/22_m_us_with_a_stem_degree_uk_aus_germany_anywhere/,"Hi, all,

First, let me give you a little bit of info about myself. I am a 22 (23 in Jan.) male living in the US. I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at a state school. I graduate in May 2015. My expected GPA will be well north of a 3.0. Currently, I work as a Technical Writer/Drafter intern for a large company based here in the US. I also have experience in the automotive industry (1.5 years). I was born in Colombia; however, I do have dual citizenship (US and Colombia). I also speak Spanish fluently. 

I have always wanted to move far away and experience this amazing rock we all share. The thought of uprooting my life and moving far away excites me. I'm sure it's something we can all relate to. Anyway, since I'm about to graduate next year, how soon should I start applying for jobs overseas? I'm guessing the sooner the better... 

Just how 'desirable' will I be overseas? I know I have a STEM degree on my side, but even in the states, entry level engineering jobs can be tough to find. My current employer does have positions worldwide; however, the industry my company is in doesn't interest me at all. 

What countries would give me my best chance of getting out of the US? I know the UK, Australia, and Germany all have flourishing STEM industries. Feel free to inform me of others. Will the lack of language be a hindrance on my chances in non-English speaking countries? I can always learn!

Continuing my education is something I have always wanted to pursue. How feasible would it be for me to get a job overseas and continue my education? Would it be more ideal to apply for a student visa than getting sponsored by a company? Also, how could I pay for school overseas? I'm sure I could get some scholarships, but from what I have read, I would not receive enough to cover full tuition and cost of living. Once again, I should probably be applying for programs now... right?

Regarding my dual citizenship, would this affect my chances of moving overseas? I definitely do not want to move to Colombia.  

I know you all see these questions over and over and over again, and I just want to say thanks in advance for being patient with me and helping me out! If there's anything I left out, let me know!"
2ijc2w,1,2014-10-07,"I [22 F] just need some support reddit, I just broke up with my douche of a bf [24 M]",fuckudouche34,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ijc2w/i_22_f_just_need_some_support_reddit_i_just_broke/,"We were dating for three years, living together for 3 months

Honestly there is so much shit I feel like I could write right now, but I'll try to keep it short

-He's called me names when ever we've been in a fight ex) bitch, spoiled bitch, fuck you, fucking retard (his excuse was always, ""I said you were ACTING like a ____"".


-He's done and said so many things that have really just made me say like... ew why am I with you ex) I gave him a card and a little gift when he got a job offer out of his internship, all he did was complain about the way I wrote the card and made me feel like shit... ex) he told me he'd break up with me if I got fat (being completely serious but later on said he was ""just kidding"") btw I'm a petite blonde girl that's like 102 pds 


-If I hurt his feelings or say anything ""wrong"" he makes me feel like shit for however long he feels necessary. Ex) he won't really talk to me... just say how ""fucked up"" it was of whatever I did and basically ram me into guilty obligeration ... won't be ""normal"" unless I apologize a million times and say how wrong I was and then give him a bj/sex


-If my feelings are hurt about something, he never says sorry or tries to make me feel better. He actually gets in a bad mood and basically stonewalls me until I just get over it. Basically I just felt like my feelings didn't matter. He will say ""I'm being dramatic, and that I need to get over _____""

-If he's mad at me about something, he will not let me try to talk to him about whatever it is he's upset about, and will hang up on me, give me the silent treatment (before i moved in with him we wouldn't talk for up to 4 days), tell me to ""leave him alone""


-He thinks everyone is a ""loser"" including his own brother because they party/have a good time? Even his best friend since he was little. He is doing really good in school now and has a job lined up for him already out of college and he thinks he's basically the shit and is going to be rich when he's older...

-I broke up with him yesterday, told him that I couldn't do this anymore, and that I felt like he didn't respect me or my feelings, he said he 
""respected my decision"" and when i asked him if he had anything to say he said ""no"" and then i just left.

He then sent me a text saying ""i respect your decision. but ill say once family gets involved (bc i told him I'm moving to my dads)  thats the end. so i hope you understand the implications. i love u tho drive safe.""

and then he calls me today and is SUPER nice and is like ohhh yeah if you need help moving anything let me know! and also I didn't mean to be rude by my text i'm actually really happy for you that your moving to your dads, i think it's the healthiest situation, blah blah blah.

and then he texted me tonight saying ""hey i just want to tell you that i really appreciate all of the things that you did while you lived here &lt;3""


Honestly there's so many other things, but that is all I can think about off the top of my head. Basically, it's an emotional roller coaster with him. And I know I made the right decision, but honestly that entire relationship really messed with my sanity and just overall self esteem.

I've never felt more crazy in my entire life then in that relationship, and he's still making me feel crazy bc of the fact that he's just taking this so lightly and didn't even ask me why I was breaking up with him...?


I just need some support, advice, anything you can give me reddit. Maybe some insight on what kind of person I'm dealing with right now? Half of my things are still in his apartment, should I just completely stop talking to him at this point? I never texted him back.

Tldr: I just broke up with my crazy/idk what boyfriend and need some support on what to do. Maybe some insight on what kind of person he is so I can better understand what I'm dealing with."
2ijdj3,2,2014-10-07,"[NAW] Not gonna lie, these internship requirements are nothing less than daunting...especially without a car.",Louisacar,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ijdj3/naw_not_gonna_lie_these_internship_requirements/,"For context, I'm a sophomore at a state college that recently (April 2014) transferred into my business school (do the words *hoops of fire* mean anything to you?) for a major in Management Information Systems. The school constantly boasts that its MIS program is the best in the country, and has some pretty impressive statistics and credentials to back it up...however.

I (essentially) need two internships in order to graduate. It is almost impossible to get past this. It doesn't matter where I get them as long as I report them to my school.

There is a car at my house that was promised to be mine when I got my license (this was promised when I was ~14, and I got my license at 18). When I got my license, my dad had done some meager work on it, but it had been sitting for around 5-6 years without being started, so it was obvious that some things needed to be done. It was in no way in driving condition when I got my license, so I had to settle on driving one of my parents' cars when they were home. Luckily, this was not difficult, as my dad is a stay-at-home parent.

Later on in the year, I ask my parents about the car and whether or not I will get it. They tell me that they need to do the insurance paperwork to get it under their insurance again and get it inspected, but other than that it was street-legal. They promised to have this done within the month. Despite my reminding them constantly, it still wasn't even inspected when I graduated high school five months later, at which point my parents cited the fact that I was going to college in the city soon, so I wasn't going to need the car.

Fast forward a year later...I'm looking for a summer job/internship after freshman year and am frustratedly having lots of trouble despite my very nice GPA (I finished with a 3.8 at the end of Freshman year). My mother (who works in my field) asks one of her friends to look over my resume because she had heard that he needed some help at his business. It was in town, paid, basic stuff that I could do...she convinced me this would be a good fit for my freshman summer. I sent him my resume and he very much liked it, and sent it forward to his boss. I heard nothing for a week, and keep in mind this was about a month into summer vacation, in June. I keep checking in every week, and every time it is some variant of ""the paperwork is taking time."" I asked my mother what to do, and she told me to ""stick with him, he's a good friend of mine."" In the beginning of August I get an apologetic email from him that they aren't going to have interns that summer and to check in next summer. Crushed and now unable to get an internship because I had three weeks till move-in, I confront my mother about what had happened. Her response, after all the nagging that she had done to get an internship and then telling me to wait for her friend to process my resume, was to take a class in SQL (a language I must learn for my major) and get it before school starts. 

I lose my shit. I scream, cry, and basically count the hours until I can leave my house. Meanwhile, my father has gotten a part-time evening job as a janitor at my local Catholic school.

I ship off to my sophomore year of college. As I'm hearing more and more about what is required to do well in my major, things are not looking good for the sophomore who transferred in and is basically a year behind. It's looking like I might have to spend an extra semester here because I can't take summer classes due to my internships I should be getting.

Two weeks ago, I found out that my parents were going to sell my car without asking me. After trying to tell them that having a car would be crucial for my getting an internship, they dismissed me, saying that they would be able to get me wherever I needed to go. With my mother working insane hours and my dad at a new job that required his car, I was livid, but said nothing further. 
When they went to sold the car, it broke down a mile away as the people were driving it home. I was now angry beyond measure. Again, I said nothing.

**The point of me explaining all that is to say that now, because of my parents, I no longer have a car to drive.**

Back to the internship problem. I'm looking up internships, and the requirements are steep. Languages, knowledge of intricate systems, and other things are required, as well as at least 3-10 months experience right off the bat. It should also be mentioned I have never had a job before -- I focused on school.

I am too intimidated by the requirements to apply, and I'm tentative about taking a job in the city because of the fact that I no longer have a car. 

My parents seem to expect me to just get an internship like it is easy. When the ""previous employer"" field is required in a lot of these forms, I get extremely nervous. On top of that, I don't want to get an internship anywhere in the city because I don't have a car. I am frustrated and I don't know how to get over it. It makes me extremely anxious and sometimes break down crying in frustration. Why are internships so goddamned hard to get into?! They're supposed to prepare you for being in the field, but they expect experience right off the bat that I don't have...

I'm really sorry for how long this is...it's been bugging me for a very long time...

2ik4m5,8,2014-10-07,The Flash Debuts With a Smash – Early Review *Spoilers*,Vox_Tropik,DCTelevision,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCTelevision/comments/2ik4m5/the_flash_debuts_with_a_smash_early_review/,"WARNING: This is a review. If you haven’t seen the episode yet and you don’t want anything ruining it on you, BACK AWAY now.

Grant Gustin’s voice peels against the backdrop of a red streak dashing through Central City.“My name is Barry Allen. I am the fastest man in the world. My whole life I have been running.”

Barry got in a fight at school and he won by backing down (Well, running away anyway). His father praised him for his actions, not knowing what they were. The memory of his mother’s death still haunts him as he keeps a token reminder of the incident in his office. Already the show has the makings of something grand. It touches the senses and hits the bullseye of nostalgia in the way that it’s predecessors have done so before. The show will excel for fans of Smallville and the fans of Arrow will have something else to look forward to if they want something a little lighter.

The episode truly begins with Barry Allen running in late to a crime scene, his supervisor (Jesse L. Martin as Detective Joe West) taking the flack. It’s a regular thing for the fastest man on earth to be late to the game.

A bit of flavor is added to the scene as Barry leans down to investigate tire treads on the road. This piece while interesting in its own right could have been taken out of the show altogether. It was neat and allowed viewers a chance to see Barry’s background as a forensic intern. . . But the visual gauges and mental mapping of the scene seems out of place for the character of the entire pilot as it is. It’s the only part that shows that kind of inner dialogue at all.

Barry borrows a pen from one of the officers in order to take a sample from the tread. Ahah! Fecal excriment! We have a clue.

“My father gave me that pen. . . Before he died.”
*Shrug* “Sorry.”

Cut to S.T.A.R. Labs and the unveiling of the Particle Accelerator where we meet DCU regular Harrison Wells as portrayed by Tom Cavanagh. He begins a rather unexciting and par-for-the-course speech about the future efficacy of his project. What can my accelerator do for you? Of course, he’s completely interrupted by the random mugging of Iris West’s laptop – no one wanted to hear the speech anyway. Barry chases after the mugger, gets jammed in the stomach by the laptop, and makes the pass to the precinct’s new pretty boy cop who gladly takes the mugger into custody with a boyish grin.

Candice Patton plays Iris West, future wife (most Flashiverses) and best friend of Barry Allen. She appears to take the role of his level head, commenting on his actions and wishing him the best in life. The episode doesn’t do a whole lot to introduce her character, however, except that she’s a total cutie, has a knack for missing blatant come-ons from the main character, and eventually ends up dating pretty boy cop Eddie Thawne behind her father’s back. Now if you’re a smarty pants or a fan of DC it shouldn’t take much to figure out just what kind of a role actor Rick Cosnett is undertaking as detective Thawne.

Barry returns to his post for an electrifying evening at the office as he awaits the power up of the Particle Accelerator which cuts the power to the city after an amazing burst of light is seen from S.T.A.R. Labs and energy surges throughout the city slicing an airplane in half along the way. In a very Frankensteinian scene, Barry grabs the chains to the skylight (I’m assuming to close the window from the oncoming storm ?) and is electrocuted on sight, his body flying like a lost projectile into the shelf of forensic chemicals just behind him.

Paramedics and doctors are shocked at his liveliness after such an ordeal. Clear!

9 Months Later.

Poker face. “What? He likes this song,” explains Cisco Ramon (actor Carlos Valdes). He’s awake, he’s alive. Danielle Panabaker’s Doctor Caitlin Snow (who reminds me way too much of Simmons from yet another comic-to-television creation, by the way,) does a fantastic job taking first aid level vitals on Barry. “Pupils equal and reactive to light.”

“Lightning gave me abs?”
“Your muscles should have atrophied but instead they are in a chronic and unexplained state of cellular regeneration,” Snow describes.

Enter a seemingly injured and wheelchair bound Harrison Wells who does it almost as good, though not quite, as Professor X. He lets Barry know that S.T.A.R. Labs has not been functioning ever since the energy anomaly which took down quite a bit of the city and thus caused the lab to be declared as a Class 4 Hazardous Location.

Barry shrugs it off. He wants to see Iris, and only Iris. The cafe slow mo scene was pretty cool though I would have liked to have seen more of these scenes and less of the blurry streak scenes as an introduction to The Flash’s totally awesome super human capabilities. The scene just following, in which Barry stops a creepo from grabbing an officer’s gun would have been the perfect moment for this though it hit the mark pretty well the way it was.

As usual in DC’s universe, police officers are notoriously oblivious creatures. If they weren’t, there wouldn’t be any need for super heroes.

Having stopped a potentially gory scene, Barry freaks out a bit and takes off running. He runs and runs and smashes straight into a laundry truck to which he responds, “Awesome.”

Cut to the silly tester outfit scene where Barry moves so damn fast it looks like everyone else is standing still. He runs 345 miles per hour in a scene that is more than a perfect introduction to his super human feats of strength.

At the police department a scared bank teller in a blanket (because blankets are always necessary in moments like these) describes a freak hurricane occurrence that precedes the robbery. The “Wide World of Weird” quote touched me somewhere deep inside where my Smallville fandom still resides.

There was this awesome car chase scene in which Clyde Mardon (brother of Mark Mardon AKA Weather Wizard) escapes the police only to be chased down and invaded by Barry in a flash. At this point Mardon shows his power over the nature of storms and disappears under the cover of thick fog. . . At least I thought it was cool until what looks like an empty car suddenly EXPLODES (uh what?) against the toppled get-away car and flies through the air crashing to the ground. Where did the explosive force and fire come from exactly?

Barry brings the sitch up to Wells who’s all “Yeah I know. We’re looking for those dudes all over the place.” A dimensional barrier dispersed all sorts of unknown energy over the city and what’s left of S.T.A.R. labs have been searching for these meta-humans as a result. Barry’s seriously itching to get out there and fight but Wells doesn’t like it. “You’re not a hero, you’re just a young man who was struck by lightning.”

What to do, what to do? I know, let’s give my buddy Arrow a visit! The Arrow makes a pretty good mentor for a young guy who really looks up to vigilante justice as a moral right, choice, and obligation. The Arrow, in his mysterious way, offers some advice letting Barry know that he will make mistakes but “The good you will do will far outweigh the bad. Watch your city like a guardian angel, making a difference, saving lives in a flash.” Insert starry-eyed wonder, mouth agape, and tear drops here.

Let’s do this! The Flash gets back to action at S.T.A.R. Labs where Cisco unveils a totally awesome project he’s working on. He gets Barry to try on this tripolymer, aerodynamic and flame retardant suit already equipped with built in sensors to track vitals (which might be too fast to track if they were too fast for the EKG at the beginning of the episode.)

The dust tornado scene in which Barry confronts Clyde is yet again reminiscent to predecessor Smallville in the DC small screen universe. It functions as a situational battle and conclusion as Barry makes the decision to run as fast as he can opposite to the tornado’s onslaught. He fails the first time, obviously due to the “You’re no hero” talk-down that Wells had given him. It’s okay though because Wells makes it up to him by telling him to keep on going and he doubles his record to around 700 miles per hour as he smothers the cyclone and faces Clyde head on.

I’ll be honest. I looked at the photos and the promos and I wasn’t sure I was going to like the suit design for The Flash. I loved it though, it was new and it didn’t look goofy. Instead it was practical and stylish, definitely something I’m not going to mind looking at once a week.

That said, much of the writing and direction in the episode was spot on. The acting was perfect as it was, action overwhelming most of the dialogue. There were a few pseudo-science and tech “WTFs” but not enough to have me gritting my teeth and closing my eyes. One of the things I really liked about the episode was that all of those who would know his secret or find out at some odd point in the future were notified of his existence right off the bat in the pilot. All except for Iris of course because the smoochikins has to be the last to know. Cue future OMG WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME scene.

News caption: Red Streak Saves Family. My Smallville sense is tingling all over The Blue Blur right now.

“A friend recently gave me the idea for a new name and something tells me it’s going to catch on.” This would have been the perfect point to end the episode as an introduction to the man, the character, and the program. But, as always, some seemingly nefarious plot must take the cake at moments like these. Instead the episode leaves us with a very strange scene. Wells, in true Tiny-Tim fashion, lives to walk another day as he enters a hidden room at his lab, stands up, and walks to a podium that displays a holographic image of an obviously future news caption. April 25, 2024: Flash Missing, Vanishes in Crisis.

All in all I give the first episode of this series an 90%. I’d love to give it more and mark it as perfect even just for the references alone but there were a few WTFs as mentioned prior and some awkward or unnecessary moments as well.

Oh and one last thing – you should really look into the guy who plays Barry’s dad. You won’t be disappointed.


Overall I give it a 90% 

Much of the writing and direction in the episode was spot on. The acting was perfect as it was, action overwhelming most of the dialogue. There were a few pseudo-science and tech ""WTFs"" but not enough to have me gritting my teeth and closing my eyes. All in all I'd love to give it more and mark it as perfect even just for the references alone but there were a few WTFs as mentioned prior and some awkward or unnecessary moments as well.

2ik9c4,5,2014-10-07,Strattera withdrawal?,SchoolIInMyFuture,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2ik9c4/strattera_withdrawal/,"For the past few nights, I have been having issues with sleep - strange ones.  After a trial run on Strattera and experiencing no real positive effect, my doctor told me to discontinue taking it and ever since, I have been having weird experiences.

I hop into bed around 11:45 as normal, feeling tired and ready to go to bed, but I can't fall asleep.  I keep tossing and turning and unable to find a comfortable position.  I start to feel sleepy, then something wakes me up.  Fast forward another 20 minutes, and I start to fall asleep again, only this time I *need* to wake myself up.

It couldn't have been more than a few minutes after I actually fell asleep - passing that intern stage where you're partially sleeping but not quite there yet.  My dream instantly goes to me fearing there is a spider in my bed.  I murmur ""no"" (which I do believe I actually spoke, not just in my dream) and feel my entire body constricted and compressed.  And while in a dream state, I consciously tell myself ""wake up"" and I do.  I took a second to make sure I wasn't still dreaming...I took an ice cube out of the cup of water next to my bed and rubbed it on my face, got up, assessed whether I was vividly dreaming or conscious or not (I was) and got up to go to the bathroom.  But even awake, the sensation in my dream was present with me - the last time I felt such a sensation was when I was taking Oxycodin after my wisdom teeth were taken out - it was powerful and felt from head to toe.  It was actually quite good feeling, if not a bit alarming because of this has never happened to me before.  

After getting back into bed, I continue to toss and turn until finally, perhaps 30 minutes later, I fall asleep.  An hour later I wake up - my entire body feeling stiff, very stiff.  You know when you feel like stretching out every part of your body?  It felt like that, but stretching out did no good.  I fall asleep once again having bizarre dreams culminating with a rapid switch to a nightmare - A storm was approaching my house, with only myself another unidentified person in it.  All of a sudden I hear sirens, loud ones.  I say, ""oh no"" and run to the door leading to the garage and look through the peephole only to see firetrucks rushing into my garage.  My hearts starts pounding and once again I mutter out ""no"" (which I believe I *actually* did - I could ""feel"" my body working to make the sound, if that makes any sense) and told myself to wake up, which I did.  Again, I check to make sure I am conscious and not dreaming, gather my thoughts, and attempt to go back to bed once again.  

This is the third or fourth time this same strange series of events takes place when I go to sleep.  The first time, I had a dream about punching someone, then being covered by dozens of hands, squeezing my body.  The second and third time I cannot remember what happened, but the same overwhelming physical sensation of constriction was present - something I have never felt before in my life.  The remedy was always the same - when I felt it I ""woke up"" in my dream and quickly exited it, back into a fully conscious and wakeful state.

I should mention that there was a lapse in my Strattera prescription that caused me to go without for three days with no such effect, but this has happened as soon as I stopped taking it for good.  Coincidence, perhaps, but something tells me it is due to the medication.  It also means I am flat out exhausted today and I am sure you all know just how much worse exhaustion makes your ADHD.

Thoughts?  Comments?  Did someone drop me some acid and I just don't know it?  "

2ikb9g,8,2014-10-07,I [23m] keep having doubts about my [23f]; would another relationship be any better?,Open-to-a-lot,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ikb9g/i_23m_keep_having_doubts_about_my_23f_would/,"*I’m adding a lot of context, because I’m really in need of some advice and it’s getting difficult to judge whether the information is relevant or irrelevant. I’m giving a timeline about how things haven between us since we’ve started being together, because I think everything is connected.*


**Context**  
I’m a 23(m) and I’ve been in a relationship with my 23(f) for more than 6 years. We started seeing each other right before both graduating high school (at different schools). 
Before we got together I’ve had 2 short term sexual relationships and some one night stands. She was very insecure when we started dating and had no experience with other men/women. I was the first boy to kiss her. I went into the relationship slowly and wanted to do things at her pace, but it was her who started everything sex related. 


After graduating we started being together every day and lived together at either my or her parents house. During the holiday we did nothing but drink, have sex and go to parties. When the holiday ended we both went to college (at the city we already lived in) 


After a while we mostly stayed at her parents, because she didn’t like it at my parents house and I got tired about how things were at my parents too (my dad was already retired at the time (63 years old) and my mother has been dealing with mental disorders since before I was born).  It felt strange living at my gf’s parent’s house, and I felt really bad about it. That’s when I decided I should find a place for my own (at 18 years old). My girlfriend was getting used to having me around every night and couldn’t deal with me living apart from her. That’s when she decided that she wanted to move out together. 


The house we got to live in was terrible (we paid it from our student benefits and side jobs) and it was in a very bad neighborhood. We both didn’t really care for cleaning the house (or both new how) and she soon grew to hate it there. 


Fast forward to living there for about a year and half. She came to regret moving out together and she got very depressed. She didn’t know if she wanted to drop out of college, switch courses and got fired at her side job. It was a struggle every day; it took me almost all of my energy just to get her to do anything (for college, looking for a side job or anything from housekeeping to having sex, or even making her laugh).  At that time we had a dead bedroom for about 10 months. As a final act of trying to make her happy I’d saved up enough money to have a short vacation together at a spa. I literally spend most of my savings that weekend on romantic gestures for her, having no effect at all. She couldn’t even smile at me, nor would she hug me back or give me a kiss.


To this day I feel really bad about what happened when we got back home. I felt cheated and I thought she didn’t love me anymore. She was baby sitting as a side job at the time, which required her to sleep over the night we got back from our vacation. She hadn’t touched me in 10 months and it was a 5-minute walk to the local red light district. I paid a woman to give me a blowjob (my gf hates giving blowjobs so I hardly ever get one) and went home afterwards frantically trying to shower away her smell. I felt really bad about it afterwards and I went on with my life like nothing happened, as if I’d watched porn.  I never told anyone about this until much later. 


I’ve been able to keep it a secret from her until recently (this year). But I’ll get back to this later on when I get there chronologically. 


The week following our vacation she had a mental breakdown. She couldn’t make up her mind about college and really missed her parents and younger sister. I helped her make the decision to change courses and move back in with her parents. She wanted me to keep on living there and paying it on my own. She wouldn’t let me look for another (more affordable) place because she would be only living at her parents place temporary (2-3 months) and wanted to be able to come back. I wasn’t too happy about that, but I went for it because I felt bad about what I did at the red light district. 


As she moved back in at her parents and going to classes of the new course she became happy again. In turn I got depressed. I was struggling to pay rent and not to fail classes. I worked 70-80 hours a week and started depression eating. I gained all the weight I lost after graduating high school again. I started living only for the moments we would be together in the weekend. I was stuck in being home alone in the evenings, because I neither had time nor money to hang out with friends at the time. It didn’t help that her moving back to her parents went from being for 2-3 months to a year. When I decided that it was time for me to find an affordable place on my own, she decided it was time to try living together again. 


We went to a new house (even more expensive; I know that was foolish) and I was determined to see it as a new start. I struggled a lot with her constant complaining about the way I did the housekeeping. We both had college and our jobs during the week and I only worked one day at the weekend. She worked through the whole weekend so that meant housekeeping became my job. Because I still felt guilty about earlier I just went with it. This turned into her bossing me around the housekeeping, dishes and other stuff. Our friends began to notice and starting to tell me that I shouldn’t let her boss me around. When my best friend starting saying that too, I told him about what I did earlier and that I felt guilty. He told me to tell her and be done with it, and/or just stop doing things out of guilt. I tried being more assertive to her and to make a housekeeping agenda. It didn’t work the way I planned it to. She would come up with excuses every week and she started to become less affectionate again. We were constantly fighting and got in a dead bedroom again. I tried talking to her about it and she just told me it wasn’t true. I remember being at the verge of breaking up. That’s when I tried talking to her about it again and that it would mean the end of us. She told me that she wanted to try some new things in bed together, because she thought our sex life was boring(she just read 50 shades). So I read the books too and started reading about BDSM and bondage from better sources. We tried that for a bit, but after a few good times, she would get a mental breakdown at the end of every session (which meant no orgasm for me). She couldn’t communicate what was going on. Which lead to us stopping with our kinky times. Which lead to us going into a dead bedroom again. 


Right when this happened I started on my graduation project, which meant I was only home to eat and sleep (Commuting to another city and working from 8 to 7, followed by hitting the gym bye bye weight gains). When I got home I wanted to focus on us. I just wanted to talk to her, cuddle or be intimate in any way. She would ignore me if I walked in and would never put her smartphone down. Which meant I would just do something by myself until I went to sleep. 
My graduation project involved interviewing colleagues, customers and users. During one of those I met an awesome woman, she was also graduating, incredibly good looking (Jennifer Lawrence lookalike *I’m not kidding*) and the interview was about her graduation project on marketing for a kink fair (*no, I’m not kidding again*).  She gave me her phone number and wanted to meet in a more casual setting. Until posting this I haven’t called her yet. 


I was blown away, she seemed the perfect match and it made me question my relationship again. My gf and I were going through a rough time already and this made me see that things could be better for me and for her.


The following weekend I went on a short vacation with my girlfriend as a gift for my birthday. I already decided I would deal with our problems (by either choosing to fix things or break up) after graduation, which would be in a few weeks. Ironically after dinner on the first night of our vacation she proposed to me. It took me totally off guard. I couldn’t just say yes if my intention was to deal with our problems later and I couldn’t just say no without explaining why. That’s when I told her I had doubts about us staying together and addressed some of the issues: lack of intimacy, her lack of interest in me and her bossing me around all the time. In my turn, I caught her off guard. I told her I needed time to figure out what I want. She took this in the way that I would only marry her if she changed. This caused her to get even more distant and insecure. 


In the week of handing over my thesis she was in no way supportive. She went to her parents a lot and at the last evening, when I was binge writing to finish my thesis she told me to get off my lazy ass and do the dishes. I lost it and told her that she was being an idiot. I couldn’t afford to stop writing for much longer so I just went on with finishing my thesis. 


After I handed over my thesis I had a long time to think things through. I decided I was going to end it after she was done with her tests for the schoolyear. I didn’t want her blaming me for failing classes. At the day of my graduation she only seemed jealous and told me (in front of my friends, my and her parents) to go home early to pack presents she wanted to give to her colleagues for the last day of her internship, while she would go working at her side job. She started arguing in front of everybody when I told her I wouldn’t do that. I had another reason to break up. 


After her tests were done I wanted to have “the talk” with her. She went crazy when I told her that I wanted to break up. She only kept saying no. She wanted me to tell her the reasons why and began shooting them down. Saying sorry for things during graduation etc. She manipulated me into thinking that it was my fault for not telling her earlier and that I should be more assertive towards her. 


So we’re still together at this time. She found some letters I wrote to prepare breaking up with her and one of them contained what I did at the red light district, years ago. 
She forgave me. And that’s when I thought everything would be fine. How could I leave someone who would forgive me cheating on her?


Since then she’s had a lot of mental breakdowns and we’re not in a dead bedroom anymore, but I could call it more of a zombie than a living bedroom. It just “moves” sometimes.   


 Just like back in our old house it costs me all my energy to make her go to classes, her side job or do her part of the housekeeping. I’m starting my first job after graduation soon and I’m afraid our intimacy will go back to the level when I was working on my graduation project, because I won’t be facilitating her all the time. 


I’m lost right now. I still love her, but I’m seeing everything I’m missing out. A friend of mine recently broke up with his gf and is sleeping around. I’m very open minded about sex and I miss the kinks and regular sex in my life. 


We’ve had a very open conversation about our sex life and she told me that she’s never masturbated because she wants it, only to be able to sleep. She likes it when have sex but will never initiate. She has no fantasies and isn’t open in having an “open relationship” or swinging. She knows I’m curious about all those things. 


Which means I have to choose between her and the sex life I want. I have no idea if our relationship is even healthy, and if another relationship would be better. I’m afraid I will end up cheating again. 


What do you think? Do you think this could be a healthy relationship? Could it be better with someone else? Should I be pursuing my fantasies, or is this just something every guy has?



**Tl;dr lots of history with my gf. I cheated on her 5 years ago. She keeps getting depressed and I’ve tried to end it a few times. Want to know if the relationship could ever be healthy. And your angle about our sexual incompatability.**

*Update*
**My gf is away for a few days and will come back tomorrow night. I've had a lot of time on my own and were able to think things through. I also showed this post to my best friend, and he's saying the same as you guys. It's time to end it.   Right now my mind is set to go for it on saturday and stay at my parents for a week (so we won't be in the same house all the time). After that we'll deal with wraping uo the formal stuff (rent, end our mutual bank account etc).  Do you have any tips for me about how to go at it?**

2ikjvr,35,2014-10-07,Girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) 'mutually' ended things 2 months ago after 4 years. Now it's just hit me...,Revernd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ikjvr/girlfriend_21f_and_i_21m_mutually_ended_things_2/,"Just a heads up, there is going to be adult language here.  Get ready.

Setting the Stage;  I was going to use a throwaway, but at this point, fuck it.  We've been dating since Junior year of High-school, it's now (or was) Junior year of College.    She goes to a school in the center of the state, and I stayed near the city.  She, up until this past summer, didn't work.  I work in a hotel and I am a fireman for the town.  We run 7-10 calls a day, we're busy.  It's like a second job.  I don't know if I'm looking for advice, or a place to rant, or whatever it is I'm looking for.  But I need to just say this I guess.

I've been writing and revising, deleting and editing this post for an hour so I'm sorry.  It's not well organized because I've just been spewing words out.  As a note, when I refer to 'Work' I mean at the Fire Department.  While it's not a job and we're volunteer, it has become like a second job with the amount of time not only I, but many others spend running calls, training, etc.  

Background;  I'm not going to bore you with details.  Simply, we met Freshman year of HS, started dating Junior year, now I'm here.  Over the past two years, we had fights, a lot of fights.  About how I'm not around enough, I'm always working, I am terrible at communicating my feelings, I'm not listening, I'm distant, and especially how I'm unhappy.  This all culminated at the end of this summer when she told me that if I'm unhappy, how can I make someone else happy, and suggested (Forced) me to end it.  Yes, that's right.  She wouldn't say it.  She made me do it.  

I didn't know I was apparently unhappy.  I had just completed an internship with the Walt Disney Company, I was just hired in my field at the hotel, we had plans to take a few trips towards the end of summer, everything was, atleast as far as I could tell, fine.  Sure, we fought about how I was at the Station to much on my off time running calls, about how I didn't communicate my feelings and was always coming home mad.  Keep in mind, because she went to school 6 hours away for 8 months out of the year, we didn't live together.  She and I both lived at home during the summer months.  

The reason I'm writing this is rather trivial.  Friday night, while on a Fire call, I got a text, rather, a picture; of some random kid and her.  As far as I can tell, she only sent it to me, and for the reason; Your guess is better than mine.  Then, last night, she makes a new picture of him and her, her profile picture.  Normally, these things don't bother me, because I'm an adult.  Things end, relationships crumble, I was a shitty boyfriend; I get it.  But something about it, something about the day we broke up, it just hit me, hard. At first I thought spite, but she was the one that broke up with me.  She was the one that was so unhappy in our relationship, she was the one that wanted it to end, she was the one who was upset about the things I did, she was the one who said we grew apart.  I don't know what spite there could be.  I haven't gone out to a party, taken any pictures, I hardly go on Facebook let alone go out of my way to otherwise spite her.

I don't know where I went wrong.  I gave her everything I could.  I gave her all the love I could, I gave her a family that loved her, I gave her all the caring in the world, all the support for the things she wanted to do, all the money she wanted to be able to take trips and go out with friends, all the freedom to be an adult at school and not have to worry about what I thought.  I gave her the ability to have her own friends, even if they were guys because I didn't want to limit her.  I never went through her phone or pictures because I wanted her to know that I trusted her.  I spent hours driving each month so I could go out there and see her, see her school and be with her, 12 hours of driving and hundreds of dollars to make her happy because that's the school she wanted to go to and I wasn't going to hold her back.  I gave up time at the firehall to help our relationship and communication, I gave up friendships in Disney because I had her back home, I lost my only friend at school because I was focused on fixing my relationship and didn't make enough time for my other friends.  I missed out on going out and exploring Orlando and going out and drinking and partying and hanging out with friends so that we could talk and Skype.  I never went out, I never went to parties in school, I never went behind her back, I never hid anything from her, I never gave her any reason to think I was talking to other girls, I never got drunk, all because I wanted our relationship to last.  I flew home a week early from my Disney Internship to be there for her grandmothers funeral, paid for meals so her family could enjoy nights out.  I don't know where I went wrong.  I knew I wasn't the best at communicating, and I knew that I spent alot of my time at the station.  I knew that I had things to work on, but I thought that I was doing better.  I flew home and surprised my family, her family, and her at the airport.  I see her mother every fucking time I go to the nursing home for a call (By call, I mean an emergency in which we respond).  I see her sisters shit about being in a happy relationship and about moving on all the time, her Cousin and I were best friends and I don't even know if he fucking knows.  I never got to say goodbye to her parents properly.  The rest of her family has now since disappeared from Facebook which means obviously whatever was said about me must not have been good and therefore I am the antichirst.

 But for 4 years, how many of them were so bad and so terrible that she had been this unhappy and how could I miss it?  I deal with this all the time at work and can grasp on, but in my own relationship, I can't?   Mostly.  I tried to sacrifice everything I had to make our relationship work, I don't know what more I could've done.  I know what I did wrong, I didn't communicate, I wasn't available enough.  But I thought I had gotten better, I thought I was improving and I thought it could work.  I thought I was unhappy in the relationship, but in reality, it was one of the only positives in my life.

I never went through her phone or her computer, or anything.  I trusted her, and maybe that was my mistake.  I never went out and partied, or experienced college because I was always worried that something would happen or that she would get upset.  I left my Internship and my friends early.

 I don't know if they're dating, but I definitely believe something happened.  And we had agreed when we started college that if we found someone that made us happy, we would tell each other, and move on.  There was not telling anything, there was only, from what I can tell, lying.

I guess it was just nice to have someone there.  When I would get home from work I wouldn't have to talk about the calls, I could just pick back up.  For 4 years, we were THE relationship to all of our friends and people we knew.  Happy, loving, had plans.  I just want to know what I did wrong, what I could've done better.  I don't want to go through this again.  Not because I can't handle relationships ending, that is an inevitable fact of life, something I cannot control, something that everyone generally experiences.  I just don't want to go through the fighting and the nights alone and the work days at the Station again.  I get it, being in a relationship with a Fireman is hard, especially me.  I get that.  I just wsh she would've said something sooner.  I wish that she wouldn't have told me that was the reason at all.  I could've accepted that she had just moved on.  But short of our relationship and Disney, it was the one good thing I had going for me.   I hate being lied to.  Normally, I just brush it off or get angry and that's it.  But this, this hurts way more and I don't know why.  I thought I knew her, I thought we knew each other.  I knew we were going to have some problems, and I knew these next few years would be tough.  We wanted to go seperate places.  But I was willing to make a sacrifice because I thought maybe there was something.  I see now there wasn't, and that at some point long ago that though died in her, but I wish she would've said something.  I wish I could have seen it.  Then I could've prevented this all from even happening.  I could've changed.

I haven't slept a full night in months, I have nightmares, I've missed 1 of my classes 5 times since the school year started, my grades are slipping, I dread going to the hotel, even though I love my coworkers, I have 0 friends here, I haven't been to a party because I never wanted to screw up.  I can't talk to people, I have no confidence, I don't want to go out and meet people because I'm scared that this same thing will happen again.  I only feel at home at the Station,  I hate this school and a majority of the people here.  I'm having nightmares, seeing people we've lost, I've been sick for 2 weeks.  I've never felt alone, until today.  I've wanted so badly just to have someone there to talk to.  It helped, even when we weren't talking about the problem.

I get it.  I was a shitty boyfriend.  I wasn't there enough, I didn't communicate my feelings.  I drove her to find someone else, I wasn't involved enough in her life.  I just wish I would've seen it.

  My relationship wasn't the thing dragging me down, it was the thing that held all the demons at bay.

 ---   
**tl;dr**:She said that I was unhappy and attributed it to me being a Fireman.  She then sent me a picture of her new guy, 2 months after.  I realized the my relationship wasn't causing my unhappiness, it was keeping all the shitty parts that I had stuffed away, at bay.

I'm sorry for ranting.  I just needed to type.

2iktb7,3,2014-10-07,"How should I approach discussing my most recent job on my resume? It was my first salaried position after college, and lasted as long as my other jobs combined!",fryzoid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2iktb7/how_should_i_approach_discussing_my_most_recent/,"Hi /jobs/, I'd really appreciate it if someone can critique/discuss this new section of my resume; it has been driving me nuts! Originally, I posted in the Resumes subreddit a few times about this, but unfortunately I didn't get any responses. Since I don't live near where I went to school anymore, I don't have easy access to any critiques, but I'm really only worried about how to approach this most recent job description.

Not only did this job provide much more experience in many different areas when combined with my previous experience, it's also my only salaried position, and it lasted a lot longer than the previous jobs I have listed on my resume (first being internship and the second being a temp job at a large corp. I had right after I graduated in 2010). 

My title was ""Inventory Controller,"" but I also performed many accounting and IT and systems-related functions as well (we had no outside IT). In my last year there, we also had no Controller (the last CFO had quit, and he was my boss) and I was the one who ended up taking a lot of his responsibilities. I think this is a good thing, and provided me with more experience/knowledge than I would have had otherwise. 

**Length:** While I am set on keeping my resume to one side of one page long, is it okay that I have used 5 bullet points on this job, while the two jobs before it only have 5 bullets between the two of them?

**Content:** This is what I have so far on my revised resume. In the beginning, I literally had 15 things that I edited away and narrowed down to these five points: If any seem unnecessary or redundant, I would like to consolidate them to maybe make room for something else or nothing at all. If they are poorly worded, I would like to revise them. Also, I have read that focusing on achievements is important. If it is important, I am curious if I accomplished this with what I wrote.

Anyway, here are the five points I have narrowed it down to:

* Designed and implemented new accounting system procedures and controls for inventory costing and valuation. Improved cost test results from 90% accuracy to 99.9% accuracy over one year period.

* Coordinated physical counts at global warehouses, managed relations with 3rd party logistics companies, and secured financing for purchase orders and finished goods inventories.

* Forecasted daily operating cash flows and performed daily bank reconciliations; reported to company CEO.

* Performed month-end and year-end closing journal entries and account reconciliations.

* Built custom scripts and reports to improve company reporting accuracies and efficiencies.

I appreciate any and all feedback! Thanks :)"

2iktj8,1,2014-10-07,[22m] I feel like I have trouble connecting to girls (emotionally).,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2iktj8/22m_i_feel_like_i_have_trouble_connecting_to/,"I'm a 22 year old male who is going to finish college this year. Stuff in my life is moving to the fast lane: studies, internship, work,etc... But I feel like I'm stuck in terms of relationships, and I feel like I'm the one to blame.

I'm generally quite sociable, and easily make friends. I am very lucky with the social circle around me, I have great family and friends. Altough I'm an introvert, I can really enjoy evenings out, and I'm quite comfortable around girls. This had led to a couple of one night stands and other short escapades, and I'm really confident and at ease sexually speaking.

HOWEVER, I cannot seem to ""bond"" with girls romantically/emotionally. I'm attracted to them, I enjoy them, sometimes I even fall in love, but I can not actually ""seal the deal"" in my mind. Whenever a girl gets really close to me, I always think about everything related to that relationship. Is it a realistic relationship? Are we compatible (boh physical and emotional)? What will my environment think if I get together with this girl? Can I see myself being together with this girl? Am I really in love? It makes me downright **nervous, and uncomfortable**. Sometimes I just get disinterested after a while, even when I originally really liked the girl.

I used to think that I was just not in love with that particular girl, or that it just wasn't meant to be. However, I feel like this has happened way too much in my life. Last year I was with a girl who was really patient about it, even after I flat-out told her that I'm not in love with her. We kept seeing eachother, had sex, but I never really felt connected/at ease. 

What is wrong with me? Why can't I connect to girls? Am I being too critical? Quite a few of my friends were really ""hungry"" for a relationship, and just went along with a girl that was interested in them. Many of them even admit that they aren't really in love, but that they are happy with eachother. I just feel that I can't be together with somebody just for the sake of being in a relationship, altough I would very much like to be.

Any answers are highly welcome, because this is really something I can't wrap my head around.

Cheers

2ikunz,3,2014-10-07,How to get out of a slump…,Pipocas,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2ikunz/how_to_get_out_of_a_slump/,"TL;DR: In a slump, can't function. What to do?

I'm actually not sure if this is a general ADHD thing or if it's just me, but sometimes I just seem to get into a slump where it seems like I just can't or won't do anything. 

Most of the time I get in these slumps when I'm just generally unhappy or overwhelmed, then it's like my mind just shuts off and I can't do anything. Even if I really want to, I just can't get it together. 

But this time, there's nothing that I can think of that set it off. I've been doing really well this year. I'm on a bunch of committees, I work hard for my internship and I like my classes… but these past few days I've just blown everything off for no apparent reason. I'm medicated (lower dose than I used to be, but it's been working so far), I just can't seem to function for some reason.

Like right now, I'm supposed to be in class. I blew off both of my classes today. I'm not sure why, I just feel defeated.

So, does this kind of thing happen to anyone else? And what have you done to snap out of it?"

First post but a long time reader of this sub wanting advice.

This is a long story and I want people to tell me if I'm out of my mind and how to handle this situation, don't worry about my feelings, if you believe I did wrong or was out of my mind please advice me and allow me to become a better boyfriend. Please just read the long story before =)

This girl (Judith) and I have been together since high school. Our relationship has never been easy; people have constantly told me she is a cheater or a gold digger however when I asked for proof no one would bring it up and so I hadn't ever let my faith in her waver and things turned out alright; we had a couple of great years...

However on year 3 we broke up and one week later she was going out with a guy; this surprised me because I had been told she was seeing him behind my back. I left her to her things and I went my way and a month later we got back together and everything seemed great...

Until year 6 when she and I went on a trip and stayed abroad for a few months. While there I caught her using Skype to talk with her ex (her first ex) and they were flirting; I actually saw the chat. I confronted her and she told me she was just joking with him and since we were so far away from our country I decided to just leave it alone. As fate would have it a few weeks later she left her facebook account open and I found out she was talking with a friend of hers (whom I hadn't ever heard about) telling him how beautiful he was and how confused she was about her current situation with me and some guys in her life. And that wasn't it; another guy we met on the trip was telling her how much he liked her but how he wondered about the status of her relationship with me.

So of course I got mad. I confronted her and she said the friend guy was just someone she was talking with since she was confused about how angry I got over the Skype thing. She told me the other guy misunderstood her due to language barriers (none of them speak fluent english).

By this time I was ready to be done with her however splitting with her while abroad would mean economic problems for me so I decided to stay there and wait for my return home to break up.

Once we got home things had been kind of patched (Rome and Paris are way too romantic) and everything was alright. As a matter of fact we even started an internship at the same place and wound up working on the same schedule. Everything was going great; I wasn't worried about the skype thing or the guys across the ocean (yeah, there was another one who insisted on taking her out for dinner though she refused but kept on chatting with him) but soon enough she started taking coffee breaks with out male supervisor and getting invited to eat out with one of our bosses. She went along with it (she said she didn't want to have problems if she refused) and I became apprehensive about her talking with anyone.

And soon enough she asked for a time out. She said that I was too jealous and that she couldn't handle that while on work so she would rather cool things so I decided to let her have as long as she needed and broke things up. A few weeks later she was hanging out with 2 of our supervisors going out for dinner and basically being with one or the other the whole day. As if it wasn't enough she left her facebook open on a work computer we shared and she was asking a guy out for a cup of coffee (the GF of said guy came to me a few days earlier and told me about this but I just didn't care since she wasn't my GF anymore).

A few months went by and I had kind of recovered; we were cordial enough to work together but that was it the rest of the time we were distant. At least we were until I started going out with a new worker; soon enough this new girl and I were dating and Judith started paying more attention to me: Calls, messages, random bumps and facebook posts. It got to the point were this new girl asked me to stop all contact with Judith and so I did however new girl didn't feel sure enough about our relationship and broke things up (thanks Judith...). 

This is when Judith started asking me to get back together and we got back together and for a few years everything seemed good. But 2 years later (7 into our relationship) she got a job at a new place and started acting weird.

She would go out with her coworkers without telling me about the event, she changed her profile pic of us into one of her... She seemed to just erase any mention of me from all her public profiles. Slowly but surely she started cancelling plans we had made one week prior and telling me she was either too tired or too busy to see me unless it was at her house. Sex went dry, not to be the spreadsheet guy but it was a long time, and she was always too tired or too busy for it (we still live with out parents; she doesn't want to move in with me).

And finally 2 weeks ago we had the final fight. We had plans to go out which she cancelled under the excuse of her father ordering her to stay at home with her mom. She told me I was invited to hang at her house and I decided to take her up on the offer and try to talk with her. She made light of me getting angry over her not defending our date night to her dad. I was about to get angry so I decided to just leave (we kissed goodbye so she wasn't mad at that point) however once I got to her front door I realized I had left my keys, I went back for them and she was sending a message (according to her it was to her dad) and I just lost it telling her in a snide tone if she was getting ready to do something with her friends. I left extremely pissed and haven't heard from her ever since despite me sending a message out asking her to talk and telling her how much I missed her. 

So with all that done... Do you think I overreacted? Is this relationship something I can save despite her attitude change which reminds me of the times she might have cheated on me (cyber cheating counts as cheating?). Should I just forget about contacting her and let her close the gap or should I just press her to talk?

What hurts me the most isn't the old attitude it's her being able not to talk with me for 2 weeks.
 
TL;DR GF and I have been in a turbulent relationship (she might have cheated on me in the past however the only proof I have are facebook messages in her inbox and a skype conversation with her exBF). This has caused me to become way more jealous than I used to be; specially when she started cancelling our dates and erasing all info about her being with me. It got to the point where I just exploded and told her sarcastically that she must be cancelling me so much because she was hanging out with someone else. She hasn't talked to me ever since despite trying to contact her. I just had bad news delivered to me (she knows I was getting news on the weekend) and she hasn't even called to ask about how I'm dealing with the problem.

Too rambly... Sorry."

My bf has had money issues as long as I've known him. Sometimes not his fault but most of the time...

He moved to an expensive city to chase a dream 2 years ago. I followed from an internship a year later. For the first three months, he paid for both of us (except for the foodstamps I set up and the little savings I had) while I looked for a job. After temping forever, I landed a decent job. He continued to freelance. When I first moved in, he had nothing but a potato in the fridge. Maybe two months in, he had to borrow money from his parents to pay rent. A few months after I land my job, he can't cover his half of the rent. For two months. I got upset at this and it turned into a huge fight over the phone. 

It gets tense between us. Two years after I moved to him, we were still living in a studio. He was still up and down financially depending on the project but reluctant to get a regular job as maintaining the hours would fuck up the project schedule (sorry, trying to be vague). I suggest temping, like I did. He seems into it, but doesn't follow through. I start getting more vocal about needing a bigger place. I ask to set a goal to LOOK at places in 6 months. He says it's ""too much pressure"" due to looking for another paid project.

2 months later, I snap and move out. The money stress, the dragging the feet on moving. I had no personal space and had run out of patience waiting for ""when things settle"" to make SOME sort of move as a couple. I wasn't asking for marriage or kids, I just wanted a fucking bedroom with a door I could shut and to adopt a damn dog.

He starts to turn it around. His patience comes back with understanding. I start to think we can recover. He tells me in June (when I left) that he didn't know if he'd have the money to cover the full rent with me gone. Here we are in October... and he's facing eviction. 

Two days ago, he asked to borrow money via text as he's out of town. I can't do it and pay my rent at the same time,  I explain, I can ask my roommate to let me slide. He asks if I'm mad, I respond that I'm pretty frustrated. He tells me to forget it then. Okie dokie.

I'm watching his apartment while he's gone so yesterday he texts me to check for a notice from his building in regards to eviction. I choose instead to call him and ask what the hell is going on.

Over the phone, he mentions covering me when I moved over, says he doesn't want to take my help if I'm going to make him ""feel like shit"", etc.

This is where I'm not sure if I'm an asshole. I lose my temper and respond that he SHOULD feel like shit. That this is a pattern going back ages and it causes me a lot stress to worry if he's got his shit together. 

He breaks in that he's already in a low place and it's cruel of me to make him feel worse. Besides, his ""plan"" for rent coverage originally included me splitting the rent with him. (So he didn't say it was my fault but...)

I respond that to ask me for money and then take exception to me being frustrated with it is UNFAIR and MANIPULATIVE. 

He got really upset there, started to lose his temper, maybe started crying (sounded like it) and hung up on me.

Haven't heard from him since.

So am I insensitive? I don't know what else to do here. I'm sick of feeling like a dream killer because I harpied down on him to GET A JOB. He was loaned a LOT of money by his parents to buy a car for BOTH of us when I my bus commute was still 2 hours... and it's gone. 

I'm really fucking hurt... which sounds weird because it's HIS money issues. WORSE he WILL be evicted in 2 days.

Trying to get into HR,Rooibosisboss,human_resources,https://www.reddit.com/r/human_resources/comments/2il3y0/help_me_please_trying_to_get_into_hr/,"Basically, I'm really interested in trying to get into the HR field. I'm 25 turning 26 and am getting so frustrated and discouraged at the lack of finding anything.

As I said I'm almost 26, I just graduated with a degree in business last year. I have a steady work history, where I have management type experience and even some HR experience from my first job where I was for 3 years, basically my high school job so I put it last on my resume. I do think I have a decent looking resume now and have gotten a few nibbles, but nothing materializes. 

For example a job I really want right now is at a place called Global Advanced Metals and is literally down the street from me, it's for a Contract HR Assistant, that even says HR experience isn't even necessary. I found the posting 8 days after it was posted. I went into the place (in a suit, shaved, the whole 9) after applying online and dropped off my resume on nice card stock with references and then called the next Monday (yesterday) and still haven't received any acknowledgement. I mean with the steady work history (all from places near me) plus a degree and some peripheral exp, and applying not early but not super late by any means I would think; it all just baffles me. 

I start thinking, is it because I'm a guy? I look too young? my mind starts going all the depressing places. Am I too old maybe?

I've worked throughout from 16 years old till now and took awhile to figure out what I wanted to do. I finally got my degree after on and off schooling for 6 years basically. I talked to my aunt who worked in HR, she's retired now and lives far away and she basically said she's sorry she can't help me connections wise because she knows I'm a good worker, but she kind of burned a few bridges where she worked when the company wouldn't pay for her cancer treatments (another story).

I also hate it because tons of positions I look at say ""Entry-Level"" than specify 2 to as much as 5 years required exp. I start thinking how could going to college have been such a mistake. 

My ultimate goal is HRIS and I understand there not being to much entry for that from what I read about the position, but the things I read about getting into it, Generalist/HR Assistant/Payroll, especially payroll all say you need experience, how does anyone get exp for a position where all the supposed entry levels all require exp.

I apologize for sounding angry, but I guess I kind of am, I've been looking really hard for more than a year, the last 3-6 months like a mad man and still nothing. I've applied for internships, but of course they all require you be in school. I have loans I have to pay and can't go back to school again, not now anyway. My only saving grace is a really part time job I have right now and I live with my parents. If I didn't have those things I swear I'd be lying in a ditch somewhere.  

The only thing I've thought is should I reverse the chronology on my resume so my exp at my first job is seen first? Is that ok/allowed? I mean I'm just afraid no one ever sees it because its the last thing on my resume, since it was my first job. Also does the exp I had there even matter since I haven't been there since 2008?

I mean with the steady work history (all from places near me) plus a degree and some peripheral exp, and applying not early but not super late by any means I would think; it all just baffles me.

I start thinking, is it because I'm a guy? I look too young? my mind starts going all the depressing places. Am I too old maybe?
I've worked throughout from 16 years old till now and took awhile to figure out what I wanted to do. I finally got my degree after on and off schooling for 6 years basically. I talked to my aunt who worked in HR, she's retired now and lives far away and she basically said she's sorry she can't help me connections wise because she knows I'm a good worker, but she kind of burned a few bridges where she worked when the company wouldn't pay for her cancer treatments (another story).
I also hate it because tons of positions I look at say ""Entry-Level"" than specify 2 to as much as 5 years required exp. I start thinking how could going to college have been such a mistake.

My ultimate goal is HRIS and I understand there not being to much entry for that from what I read about the position, but the things I read about getting into it, Generalist/HR Assistant/Payroll, especially payroll all say you need experience, how does anyone get exp for a position where all the supposed entry levels all require exp.

I apologize for sounding angry, but I guess I kind of am, I've been looking really hard for more than a year, the last 3-6 months like a mad man and still nothing. I've applied for internships, but of course they all require you be in school. I have loans I have to pay and can't go back to school again, not now anyway. My only saving grace is a really part time job I have right now and I live with my parents. If I didn't have those things I swear I'd be lying in a ditch somewhere.

tl;dr Help me please"

My uncle was the president of a nice little IT company that ran out of a data center and provided some managed services to clients.  I asked him for an internship over the summer to pad my resume a bit and he agreed to sign me on.  Really this was just a front to pay me to move furniture from the old office to the new office and do other ""**PICK THINGS UP AND PUT THEM DOWN**"" type stuff.

This was my first week on the job and I was a complete and total newbie when it came to tech support.  I hadn't ever done any hardware builds, hardly any actual tech support work besides virus removal and drive cleanup for myself.  I had **ZERO** actual responsibilities in my job aside from, do what boss says.

___

One night I was with one other tech and it's about 10 minutes until our shift ends and $ViceBoss runs into the room points to me and says ""Come.""  I get up and start following $VB out into the hall.

&gt;$VB: Pheonix, *BiggestClient*, is having MAJOR issues.  I need to send you down there now to fix it.

&gt;Me: Uhhmmm, wh-what's going on?

&gt;$VB: The server just died out of nowhere!  We have no one near by and we need someone there ASAP!

&gt;Me: Wh-what do I need to do?

&gt;$VB: You'll figure it out.  Come with me

&gt;&gt;My Mind: Holy shit holy shit **HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!**

I follow $VB to the main offices and then into his office.

&gt;$VB: okay so you're gonna head down into the city **at this point my mind cuts him off.*

&gt;&gt;My Mind: FUCK, the city is like an hour away just to get there, then I gotta find the building... I'm so. royally. FUCKED!  How the fuck am I going to fix this shit?!?

&gt;$VB: Alright, got it?  Good.  Stay right here, I'll be right back I'm going to grab you some spare parts.

As the $VB is walking away to some supply closet somewhere $UncleBoss walks by, sees me, and sticks his head in the door.

&gt;$UB: Hey!  How's the first week so far?  What are you doin' up here out of the bunker? Aren't you going home soon? (**We call our data center the bunker*)

&gt;Me: $VB is giving me some spare parts to bring to *BiggestClient* to try and get the server working...

&gt;$UB: Wait.. he's sending you ***where***?  Hang on, go into my office, close the door and sit down, I'll be right there.

I nod, head into $UncleBoss's office and sit down, admiring his work battlestation.  3 big Mac Monitors and a laptop dock with a brand new MBP sitting in it next to the iPad lying on his desk.  I forgot how big of an Apple fan $UncleBoss was.

***mumbled yelling***

Suddenly, the door to $UncleBoss's office opens up, and $UncleBoss pops his head in...

&gt;$UB: Go home.

&gt;&gt;My Mind: ***Sigh of relief***

&gt;Me: Uhhh, sure!

I nearly broke my foot leaving the office in a half sprint.

My entire life I've been.. shy. All throughout high school I was too shy and uninterested in the extracurriculars offered at my school to actually want to participate in anything. I struggled so much to stay interested in Model UN. And then I finally transferred to community college.

I had everything planned but it just.. didn't go as planned. I fell sick with mono the first semester and had to withdraw. I had so much planned. I was going to get involved in so many things I was interested in at a club fair I went to. But when I came back to college in the spring, I felt so confused and lost. And I fell back into my shell...

I started working as an admin on an online forum and self taught myself how to program websites and make browser based games. I've done that to make money and earned a decent pay. But I never went back to the clubs I was interested in. And now I'm almost done with community college and I have to transfer. I don't what to do. The school I *think* I want will probably want to see more initiative than just some computer geek that has no community service, no internships, nothing interesting other than good grades and determination. I feel like I screwed up and I can't reverse it. It makes me want to cry. There are not many places that I *want* to go to. I finally found a college I like...and now I just. I don't know. I don't feel good enough.

I've been told I can sell myself if I go there and interview. But I doubt it. It just reinforces the feeling I  have. I've never, ever, ever gotten ahead in life through socializing. I've always been a better writer. It drives me crazy that I can't hold a good conversation. I don't know why. I don't know what it is. People just don't like me when I talk. I've done everything I could to improve my social skills, but I just feel constantly judged and silently discredited for thinking differently about things. 

I feel like I have nothing going for me. I feel like I'm not going to pull this off. I feel like my future is screwed...."

I recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I have been job hunting, and would like to be involved in Embedded Systems/Firmware Engineering in my career.

I would prefer to start off as an intern, as this would give the company (as well as myself) the opportunity to evaluate if this is a good fit. 

I have completed an internship at NASA AMES Research Center, and a few start-up companies. At my recent internship I created a self-test routine in Python that would at input/output commands to a console. This was exciting because it would test certain features on a circuit board such as; Fan Duty Cycle, and read different temperature modules (system, and ambient). This succeeded and aided in the testing process for our Thermoelectric Cooling Circuit Board. I was able to navigate and learn WingIDE, allowing me to improve on my software skills. I recently helped create a Charlieplexing LED with comparators, quad buffer tri-state, XOR Gate, voltage translator, and charge pump. This allowed our group to light up an array of LEDs that are independent of each other. This experience was awesome, and it gave me a better understanding of circuit design. 

I enjoy a mixture of hardware and software - primarily because it's fun and challenging! Feel free to message me any questions! Thank you."

A. Do an internship/coop over this summer, and get some great experience but delay my predicted thesis completion date.  
B. Start my thesis over the summer and presumably finish earlier and (hopefully) find employment sooner - meaning more money.

I feel like everything I am doing is just because I have nothing better to do and I'm I am too afraid to just end it. I have no friends since everyone I spoke to was a proximity friend from college or my internship and the two people I actually kept talking to since I knew them from elsewhere have stopped. I'm not *mad* my friend has new responsibilities to tend to now that she is going to be a mom but she was literally the only person I actually spent time with since I moved here. And the other one... I don't even know where we stand anymore. I knew our friendship had an expiration date but I didn't think it would be now. 


I go weeks without talking to anyone at all aside from responses to my bosses and co-workers. ""Yes I will make the crepes. Yes I can make the tarts. I've got the parfaits done.""


All I can think about is how wonderful it would be if everything just stopped. I only don't kill myself because I would feel bad if I left my cats behind because they have severe codependency issues and I'm sure no one would want them plus I would feel bad for my old man and I don't want to be more of an inconvenience than I already am.

Because I don't have a right or a reason to actually be as upset as I am when everything has worked out for the best. I didn't even have a job mid August.

A bit of background info-
My mother is definitely a narcissist. I'm not sure about my father, but what I do know about him is that he is big and tall and scary and his mood changes on a dime. He is an enforcer who goes where my mom directs him. As a team, they have mentally and verbally abused me. I'm too big to be dragged anymore, but when I was little, they'd do that, too.

I do not respect these people who have raised me, just fear them. When I was angry past my limit, I've told them this before. Apparently it's offensive.

I was raised in a remote area where I could not see friends without my parents permission. I have been kept dependent on my parents in every way possible. They pay for my college education. They have kept me from getting a drivers' license. (I live in the US.) Over the summer, I took an internship very far away.

They told me that they will pay for the remaining driving classes I need. It's basically driving practice, and most people's parents do this when they as soon as they are of age. My father insisted on teaching me, but that actually consisted of telling me how wrong I was, yelling, and telling me how I was going to get us killed. When I asked for them to help me find someone else to teach me, they made me feel like I was asking for the world, yelled in my face until I had a panic attack, then told me how disappointing I was to them while I couldn't sit up saying, ""help, I can't breathe."" I refused all lessons from him after that.

I am doing everything I can to get out of my situation, but everyone I ask says they don't know how to help me. I'm a very hard worker, and if I could just find some way to get out, I would do it. If I knew it would work. I just feel so helpless and trapped.

Last month, I opened a bank account in my name. I'm moving my savings over to it, but there isn't much.

A couple days ago, I received an email,

""(first name I utterly loathe,)
Sounds great that you might have time to start driving after the current show is complete.  Before you begin Mom and I would like to talk about the ""learning to drive"" plan, goals, and general schedule.  If you could call us on the telephone sometime so we can learn and ask questions that would be great.
Thanks!
Mom and Dad""

I'd like to mention that I am 19 years old, am in college and have made the dean's list every semester. I'm intelligent and I understand how to study and how to learn.

I have a shitty cell phone that they pay for. It has very few minutes or texts, but I don't use it much at all. Generally, I keep it off. Last time I called them, it was because my shoes were worn out and I needed money. I have a job 5 hours a week, but I haven't been paid yet and I'd like to save up for other things. When I began college, they told me that they would cover it because they were such great people. They put together a savings thing when I was born, and I understand that I am very lucky for them to have done this. Anyways, I wrote out a script of safe things for me to talk to them about. I bs'ed them for almost an hour to get some new shoes. I was pleasant and I laughed at all their bigoted jokes and I let them make me into a nothing- some sort of child-thing with no mind of her own. My Nmother actually does call me GirlChild, both to my face and in reference to me to others. I felt so dirty after that phone call, but I had to do it.

Anyways, I know what this email means. I've been down this road before. It means that I have to jump through every hope and pander to everything they want and tell them everything they want to hear and use the right tones and everything. I've been yelled at very thoroughly for saying ""hi"" in the wrong tone of voice. Even if I get it right, they might not be good on their word. I'm working towards finding another way to learn already. I'm asking professors and friends and anyone I trust if they can teach me in their free time. I'll have to pay for gas, but I think it's worth it.

All the same, I feel incredibly trapped. It seems like every time I try to get some small amount of freedom, they reel me back in. Every time I try to assert myself as a human being who out to be viewed as such, I am shut down so completely with them yelling at me until I have panic attacks and am grounded for months and months in one night.

I don't think that I'll be able to stand this for much longer. I got lucky last summer with the internship, but the previous one I didn't have anything. I was trapped in a house in the middle of nowhere and I nearly killed myself and spent the rest of the summer in a haze where I also forgot how to have facial expressions. I know that I will not survive another summer unless I get out, and winter break is also very iffy, but I can't get away for all of it because I'm going to have my wisdom teeth removed. I don't have a car, I don't have a license, I don't even have enough money to pay for one month's worth of rent. I've already decided that I am not returning to my parents' house after I graduate college, job or none. However, I'm not sure I'll even make it that far. I'm not in immediate crisis, but I need to get out of this situation. I've done all I can think of. I've done everything I can to reason with them. I don't know what to do. When I am around them, when I hear their voice or read their words, I'm no longer anyone at all. I'm whatever they need me to be at the time, and it's going to kill me. How can I leave?"

Blessed to be born in a free country, in a household that can support me, in a state that gives me scholarships to attend university. Yet this summer everything came crashing down. Stranded in an unknown city for an internship, in company-provided housing, with no one there I knew. I became suicidal, told a doctor, and I was put into a psychiatric hospital for 5 days. I'm now on an antidepressant.

I was at home for three days before I came back to school. Now I'm regretting not taking the semester off. I haven't been to classes at all...it's almost halfway through the semester already. I am torn between trying to go to class to salvage my grades, and just calling it quits, withdrawing, and going home. The emptiness inside won't go away and the therapists keep telling me to suck it up and go to class but I can't...it's a vicious cycle of guilt and shame and feeling like my life is out of control and beyond help. 

I think I'm going to try to finish the semester and go to classes. I feel like I'll be a quitter if I don't try and finish out the year, not to mention the backlash I'd get from my parents for basically wasting a semester.

I know Java and I'm taking an advanced course in it this year, and I just recently finished the Python code on code academy. However those are the only two I know, and I have no portfolio of accomplishments because I've never actually done any noteworthy projects to add to it. 

I'm trying to build up the amount of knowledge I have by adding more languages. Besides the obvious of C and its derivatives, what else should I know? I've taken a close in visual basic and aced it but that's not enough to do more than basics, Not even I/O.

I would attempt android development after my advanced java, but I do not have an idea what I should make and my motivation wanes unless I'm working on it with or for someone else. Why go balls out for an application someone won't even use? 

So, what languages should I know, what kind of things could I add to my portfolio, and finally, how do I prepare for that internship? What kind of questions would they even ask me?"
2io7qk,2,2014-10-08,"The Super, Crazy, Effed-Up 11 Days in NYC",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2io7qk/the_super_crazy_effedup_11_days_in_nyc/,"Story time! Note this is LONG. Basically, I just spent the last 11 days in NYC with my SO whom I met and fell in love with a couple months ago. She moved there for college and about a month ago I decided to spend the $ and go see her to figure everything out and if we really were meant to be. Here is the story. 

I landed on the 26th of September very very early in the morning and saw her face at the baggage claim. We were ecstatic. I have never been so happy to see someone in my life. After getting my bag, and taking a bus into the wrong neighborhood, we finally got to her dorm. Where I met her roommate. Her ex boyfriend whom she left for me. Yes. This is a crazy situation. To avoid awkwardness, we went to sleep right away. I did not sleep at all. There was far too much on my mind. 

Now during this 11 day trip, she had school 4 days a week, and an internship a couple times a week, plus homework to do. So much of the time we spent together was at the dorm just cuddling doing homework. Which was perfectly fine. But when we did have time, we did not try to do the typical NYC tourist things. We went to a few random interesting fairs and events, even saw a Late Night Show that I got us tickets to a few weeks earlier. 

BUT, I'm not going to go on for 15k characters about what we did, even though I could. I want to share about where we are now as a couple, and about what I learned from this trip. 

So, the crazy situation aside, (ex boyfriend roommate). One night towards the end of my trip, something was wrong. I knew by her tone, and how she acted, that something was up. Like many times, her response was that she was fine. She took a shower, and I had to get it out of her. She opened up. She told me that for the past couple of weeks, before I came, the LDR was not working. She was over stressed with school, the internship, homework, dealing with her ex boyfriends problems (she did not mention it but he adds tons of stress on her), and so she told me that its not going to work. I was, devastated to say the least. I went on and on about how we need to try and change a few things when I went back home. Because, before actually coming to her, there were a few things I could have done differently that could have made a difference. For example, almost daily I tried to see if she wanted to Skype. Sometimes I'd get a maybe later response, and then occasionally she'd have the time, but forget and would do something with her ex (they are friends, I know I know) or her other friend. The problem was she was so stressed that I was stressing her out even more by wanting to Skype. After hearing her stance on things, I knew immediately that I need to change how I go about wanting to Skype with her. Couples on here Skype once a week if they get the chance to. So that is what it will be. But, I'm getting side tracked. Basically, with all that is going on in her life, dealing with these emotions was just another thing to worry/stress about. But there are things going forward that we could change to make it work, or so I hope.

So, after that night, which was insane... I'll omit the rest of the night because from there until the day I left, (yesterday) her ex was just causing problems. Maybe if you are interested in more you can PM me and I'll explain because I really want to talk to people about this situation, and I have no friends anymore where I live. 

I'll just skip to Monday night. The night before I left. I'll also omit the problems the ex caused then, and skip to right before bed. Where we were in the hallway sitting by ourselves talking. We essentially came to the conclusion that for the next week or so, we'd take a break, and she'd let me know if things change, but she seems to think they won't. Its very hard. We spent the last weekend we had together, as if we were the perfect couple. So, since this ""break up"", or whatever you want to call it, I don't even know what to call it, is so weird. I don't know what to do now. We both love each other. I'm in love with her. I know it. I know I can deal with her busy schedule, and deal with the drama because I trust her. But we both have this feeling that it may work out, just not now. We spent all day yesterday texting/talking when I was not on a plane. And she'll be calling me in an hour when shes on break from class. We still say I love you, and everything. It does not feel at all like we are not in a relationship. Its very confusing. 

One thought I have is, that if us together causes so much stress. I have his feeling that us not together, will add just as much if not more. She does not think her love will fade, and I know mine will never fade. So is it worth not being together, if it also adds stress? It's sort of a weird trade off. Just for your knowledge, I live on the other side of the US. And next semester, I'll be moving to the East so I will be MUCH closer to her. Won't be moving into NYC because well... who can afford that, but I will be close, and there won't be as much of a distance. So that is one thing to take into consideration. 

I think there is far more I can write. And I assume there are holes in this story I can fill. Some, I'd rather just talk about privately, others... well this post is already 5k characters so I'll stop here. Just wanted to share my story of what's happened in my relationship in the past two weeks. 

Again, if you are somehow interested in more, feel free to PM me. Or hell, we can Skype if you want. I'd love to hear about your own story and relationship. :) 

If you read this far, kudos. lol. "

So, i am a really shy person. I will never start a conversation with someone unless they talk to me first. I can't even maintain eye contact with strangers passing me on the street.


This is my first big problem. The other one is that I am moving quite often, I am currently doing an internship for half a year and after that I will move into a different city to continue studying for a year, after that I don't know where I will go.


Those two problems lead to the fact that I never really had friends - with a small exception. Just some people who are nice to talk to, nothing more. My boyfriend of 3yrs is my only good friend, but the relationship isn't going that well either.

Every week I am waking up crying from a dream I have since quite a long time. In school there were three girls, they were the only good friends I ever had. They stopped contact because I didn't show up to a party I was invited to, I never heard a single word from then since then. (it was 4 years ago). But every week I am dreaming that we still are friends and have fun. I then wake up cyring and am depressed the rest of the day.

To be honest, I don't know if I am dreaming it because i miss *them* or if I miss having friends.


I am sorry for this long post. But I really don't know what to do. I am normal looking and my hobbies aren't that strange either - pc games, drawing, cooking, movies. Why is it that I can't make friends? What should I do to gain a best friend? This whole thing is a mystery for me and it is making me depressive.

Please help :(

Is this the new thing to respond with?",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2ioz40/why_does_everyone_keep_responding_dont_do_it_for/,"Whats up with this new fad in responses? It seems like anytime someone says something about being unsure of going in to engineering the first response or there are many responses saying “Don’t do it for the money”. I know this is a sub for engineering students, but I’m curious; how much money do you guys think engineers make? Most of my friends that graduated with a BSEE and took jobs out of undergrad made about 60. I’m finishing my MS in computer engineering and a standard offer is about 83 for semiconductor industry. A few companies do it differently but for the most part you end up right in that range for starting out with a masters. I have a standing offer from a fortune top 50 company in semiconductor and it’s the highest anyone of my classmates has gotten so far at 90.

So, maybe I have a skewed sense of what “big money” is but engineering isn’t really about the money at all. If you want big money you’re better off trying to work in the business side of these engineering companies. Seemingly the technical side of a business never makes as much as the business side. That being said, is that big money or do you guys potentially know something I don’t so far as salary goes. Engineering will give you a comfortable life but it’s not likely going to make you a millionaire in industry (start ups and individually owned companies aside). Sure, there are great internships out there like intel that pays interns in the order of about 70k. That’s not a long term position that you can stick to though.

The pay and outlook may be better than some other career fields but it’s hardly the easiest thing to get a degree in compared to the prospect of how much money you’ll be making. There are plenty of fields that offer jobs competitive with an engineers salary and the degree might not be nearly as technically challenging.

My problem is that I feel like I am not learning the right way.

Like right now I am trying to right python scripts to automate tests for my internship and trying to learn new python modules on the fly, and I feel like I am not understanding it at all. Or I read it and understand but forget it the next day. 

I just feel like at this point in my Computer Science career I should be able to learn new technologies quickly and implement them as well as understand how different programs work just based on reading the code.

I realise how ambiguous it looks! I'm a maths student looking for a career in computer science, I will NOT have a degree in CS.**

Hi, I'm a second-year maths student who has recently discovered an interest in computer science and I've decided I probably want a career where I can work with computers but from quite a mathematical angle. 

The areas of maths I'm most interested in are linear algebra, probability and combinatorics -- all of which I believe have strong applications in CS. I also really enjoy scientific programming with python, but I have little experience using the language for anything else.

1. If I'm being honest, I'm not really sure what that career is (maybe data science or something). I'd be very grateful if you could suggest careers in computer science with a strong mathematical component. 
1. What's more, I would appreciate guidance on what areas of computer science I need to brush up on in order to be well qualified for such a career (right now I'm trying to teach myself basic data structures and algorithms).
1. And one last thing: I realise internships are very important in computer science. Given my current situation, would I be able to secure a computer science internship for next summer? Or would I have to work on my programming and deepen my knowledge of computer science before any company would take me seriously? (and miss out on an internship before I graduate?)
 
Thanks so much! I'd really appreciate any help, the world of computer science can be so impenetrable when you're looking at it from the outside.

2iprp9,3,2014-10-08,Recent grad – Are most CS jobs like this?,MB_Zeppin,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2iprp9/recent_grad_are_most_cs_jobs_like_this/,"I recently graduated from college last May with dual degrees in History and Computer Science and was hired by a large pharmaceutical firm, ostensibly as a software developer. I started working back in mid-July and haven't been terribly thrilled with the experience. I miss the sense of community, cooperation, and curiosity that came of constantly working in a CS lab pursuing common interests but I'm also routinely disinterested with my work and have trouble maintaining the discipline to complete my responsibilities. Thus far, very little of my time has been spent working with computer science related concepts and I have written perhaps a dozen lines of code.

Instead I largely use software that requires a CS background to understand and operate but which is not itself terribly interesting. For instance, we're doing some data processing work that's being done in Hadoop. In order to use Hadoop I have to be familiar with Python, Java, MapReduce, some SQL, etc. but the actual work that I do is attempting to get a scripting language to work, getting Hadoop to recognize all of our remote drives, pasting some code from an outside contractor in, and that sort of thing. All fairly menial tasks that simply require a large amount of background knowledge and persistence to do. When I go into work tomorrow I'll be loading some XML data into a Fedora repository for use as a back-end. After that I might help some interns wireframe a UI for a web front end. Based on conversations with my manager, this is what I can expect in future.

Speaking to my friends who have recently graduated and been hired by financial firms and similar, this seems to be a common experience for them as well, although one of them has done a little bit of development in COBOL.

I originally went to school to become a history teacher but after taking an introductory computer science course I enjoyed the discipline so much that I dropped my education major to pursue it. I remained strongly passionate about computer science throughout the 4 years, took extra classes, did research projects over the summer, and developed some software for local non-profits. After only a few months of working in the field my interest in remaining within the field is waning.

Is the experience of myself and my peers representative of typical positions within the Computer Science industry? If so, how do you guys keep yourselves productive, motivated, and interested?"
2ipvmh,3,2014-10-08,Benefits of Doing Your Internship Overseas,advercomm,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/2ipvmh/benefits_of_doing_your_internship_overseas/,"An internship is important for every student to help them prepare for the real world of finding a job. This is the primary reason why schools encourage this type of program so that students will be well oriented on the realities of life and what they should expect.

Of course, the most common type of internship is usually done locally. But for some, getting an internship abroad is a whole new different experience. Other than that, it will help them be exposed to different cultures that will surely open their eyes on how business works on the other side of the world. In addition, getting an international internship can provide you with much credibility when you finally apply for a job in your country. 

So if you are not yet convinced on how beneficial an [international internship](http://www.crosscontinental.org/intern-abroad/) is then here are a few pointers that you should know about:

1. Make friends – A network of friends on foreign land is something that you might want to consider for both your personal and professional relationship. This means that whenever you find internship abroad and get to make friends then surely you won’t have a hard time in getting a real job there someday plus you will have some company when you get there.

2. Boost your resume – Having an abroad internship experience is something that will lighten up your resume. If you apply for job locally then chances are you will be hired since a foreign company was able to train you. 

3. Global experience – Learning about the work culture of your country is great but experiencing an international work culture is something else and will put you on a flexible state. You can also land a job much faster in your home country since you were accredited by a foreign company.

2ipwgl,4,2014-10-08,Me [22F] with my friends (mid 20's) I guess I wasn't meant to be born in this generation,Im_nofun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ipwgl/me_22f_with_my_friends_mid_20s_i_guess_i_wasnt/,"This certainly isn't the most provocative post ever written in this sub (long time lurker first time writer with throwaway) but here is my dilemma.

So I have a LTR with my 24 year old boyfriend, we've dated since high school and right now he is finishing up an internship in another state, thus making us a LDR for the past 4 months.  He is coming home in November (woo hoo) and I already know he is proposing to me and I already know it will be a yes.

That's not the problem, not by a long shot.

My problem lies with a group of what I thought were my friends and their total lack of respect for me, my boyfriend and our relationship.

In our group of friends there is a mix of both men and women and generally we hang out after work on Friday night and hit different venues for different things.

Now keep in mind this is a group.

Well in this group is a guy who likes me, or more to the point he finds me attractive and would like to have sex with me.

How do I know this you ask?  Well simply put, he came out and asked me last weekend to come over to his house after we got done going to the clubs so that we could spend time together.  At first I was totally unaware as to what he wanted, I thought he was asking if the group could come over and when I asked how many of us were going that is when he let me know it was just me and him and what his intentions were.  

I shit you not, he said and I quote ""I have been jonesing for you for so long that I have to get this worked or I am going to bust"".

When I realized he wasn't joking or playing some kind of punked event on me I literally told him to fuck off and get the hell away from me.

Here is the problem, we are all part of the same friends group and little did I know that they were all in on knowing he was going to ask this before I did.  They all know about my boy friend.

One of my female friends hit me up on Saturday and decided to tell me that she thought I was being a prude and that she wanted to know what was wrong with our male friend and why I didn't want to have a FWB with him.

I could hardly contain myself, I asked her if she was fucking kidding me because she knew damn well I had a boyfriend.

Well I guess much to my surprise when I go home at the end of the nights on Friday they pretty much turn into Sodom and Gomorrah and different ones go home with different people.  Here is the bitch of it, most of them are all involved in long term relationships and not with other people in the group.

I was told that I wasn't sex positive, that I would ruin the dynamic of the group and if you can believe this next part that she doesn't think my boyfriend would care.  

First of all I can tell them for fact my boyfriend would care immensely and even if he didn't I would care.

I obviously don't think like they do.  They are pretty cool people, at least I thought, but this is just to much for me.

I love my boyfriend, I have no feelings for this other guy at all and when I told her that she tried to explain to me that I didn't have to have feelings for him, it was just sex.

There is no such thing as ""just sex"" for me.  I pretty much hung up on her and I am planning on avoiding the group from now on.

I guess my question is, am I over reacting here?  I don't think I am, in fact I think they are being disrespectful as hell. 

Now to be fair though, there are several others of the group who I have not talked with so I have no idea on their feelings.

---   
**tl;dr**: Male friend wanted me to enter into FWB relationship with him even though he knows I have a b/f.  Female friend supports male friend, I'm probably going to kicking the entire group to the curb"
2ipx8t,13,2014-10-08,Overwhelmed about HIV diagnosis and my life in general,underworldusa,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ipx8t/overwhelmed_about_hiv_diagnosis_and_my_life_in/,"Bit of back-story - About a week ago I decided to have some STD/STI tests done, since earlier this year I engaged in unprotected sex.  I did know it was a bad idea and regret it, and even though I've tried to justify it to myself, at the end of the day it was a stupid mistake and I have to own up to it.  

So anyway, this afternoon I get a call from the student health service place at my college, which is where I got tested, who told me the test results came back and the doctor wanted to see me.  I did start to freak out at this, but I read that doctors usually any HIV results over the phone, so I went in hoping that all my tests would come back negative.  When I saw the doctor he told me that most of the tests had come back negative, but the HIV test had come back positive/indecisive (I'm not 100% sure on how everything works but from what I understood any result that is greater than 1.00 is considered positive and mine was 1.25).  He ordered another test to make sure my result wasn't a false positive, and he had me speak with a person from my school's counseling center, which helped for a little bit but now I just have a ton of emotions balled up and just had to get them off my chest.
I'm primarily angry at myself for being stupid and having unprotected sex in the first place.  I'm studying to be in a healthcare profession, I have a bunch of family members in healthcare or healthcare related positions, and throughout school I remember learning about safe sex and the risk of STDs/STIs.  Plus I'm also a gay male and I know how high the HIV rate is among that population.  That's even one of the reasons I had trouble coming to grips with my sexuality, and now I can't help but feel I deserve it.  I'm mad at the guys I was with for lying to me, they all said they were negative, but I'm still angry at myself for believing them and not insisting on us using condoms.  

I'm really regretting getting testing too.  I'm in my last semester of college and am already struggling with depression and anxiety from worrying about my classes and trying to secure an internship before the end of the month; the last thing I need is to deal with HIV.  I've been struggling with depression and anxiety issues on and off since middle school so I've kind of learned how to somewhat cope, but this just seems like too much to handle right now.  There's no real close support system for me to turn to for help either. I transferred to my college last fall from community college and didn't know anyone, plus I'm kind of shy and feel socially awkward so it's been hard for me to make real close friendships.  My family is supportive of me, but I don't feel like I can tell them until I graduate.  They are more on the conservative side and I haven't even come out to them yet.  While I don't think they would disown me, they do pay for everything for me so I don't want to disappoint them.  If I told them I took a HIV test and it came back positive, they would totally flip out and I don't think I could handle that right now.  I really just want a best friend that I could talk to about all of this, but I don't which makes me both depressed and angrier about everything. 

There's a lot of guilt going through my mind about everything too. I know I'm a pretty privileged person  I'm a white, middle class 20 year old guy in the US, not an impoverished HIV infected person in some part of Africa where they don't have widely available treatment.  I know I'm overreacting to this whole situation and that I can still lead a normal, healthy life, but I can't help feeling depressed and mad.  If I didn't have piss-poor self-confidence and self-esteem and was actually outgoing I would have never put myself in this position in the first place.  It sounds weird but deep down inside I know the only reason I was on grindr hooked up those couple of times was because I was lonely, depressed and wanted someone to tell me I was good looking and seemed cool.  I put myself in dangerous situations just so I could fake feeling good about myself for a few minutes and it really sickens me.  Sorry for posting a mountain of text and feel free to move this to another subreddit or something if this doesn't belong.  I've had a bunch of this balled up inside of me for a while now, but I just need to let it all out right now 

TL;DR version - Me currently stressing about school and internship + underlying issues with depression, anxiety and crappy self-esteem + probable HIV positive diagnosis = me angry at everything and just wanting to explode"
2iq5xu,1,2014-10-08,Can't forget girl after all these years,vudlew,teenrelationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/2iq5xu/cant_forget_girl_after_all_these_years/,"I know this is a long wall of text and I don’t force anyone to read it, it’s just here if you’ve got the time and want to read it.  
  
I am male and currently 19, the girl is the same age.  
  
I accidentally stumbled upon this subreddit tonight and I thought I might as well share my story here. I have never really talked about it with anyone. It is nothing bad, it’s just this girl that I haven't been able to get out of my head for YEARS.  
  
When I was 13 this girl from my class (at the beginning of the school year) told me she had feelings for me and was wondering if I felt something for her. Back then I really hadn't thought about a girlfriend yet, I really wasn't prepared for it, but I said yes. It were a fun and cute, yet awkward two months. We went on a few dates, just holding hands, nothing more. But we were in the same class so we saw each other a lot. So after two months she suddenly broke up with me, WITH AN EMAIL, just when a weeklong holiday started. I really hadn't seen it coming (love makes blind I guess) and didn't know what I did wrong. She never told me a reason why she broke up me. I guess it was because I was around her too much, or because I didn't dare to take the next step beyond holding hands? I don't know and it was stupid that she used an email to break up, why not talk to me in person. But well we were both young and really shy so I can't blame her. Obviously it was my worst holiday ever, I was really hurt, I didn't know what to do. I became a real asshole to her and eventually even told her I never wanted to talk to her again. Still it somehow happened that at the end of the school year (like 8 months after we broke up), we got back together. I can't really remember this period myself, but I don't think much happened, I was still too busy with the fact why she even broke up with me in the first place and I really wanted to know that reason, and asked her multiple times but never got an answer. So after a few weeks I just broke up with her again (IN PERSON), I really couldn't be with her. And again after like a month I told her that I didn't want to talk to her again. I know, I probably shouldn't have started ignoring her, but at the time it really felt like the only way I was ever going to be able to forget her. And she accepted it and never tried to talk to me either. After that we weren't in the same class anymore (not on purpose), but we kept ignoring each other. After I changed school I kept seeing her every few months because of mutual friends. Our class from the first 2 years in high school is really close and even today we still meet every few months. But even at those meetings we didn't talk to each other. BUT I have never been able to get her out of my head. Every time there still seems to be this connection (this might just be my imagination). And so it happened a few months ago at one of these meetings we accidentally started talking again. I don't know how it happened. Someone saved a seat for me and it was next to her. I suddenly forgot about everything. We somehow started talking about I don't know what. I even brought her home that night with my car. It literally took me a few days before I realized what I had done. I had done my best to keep ignoring her, and now I ‘broke’ that. Since all those years back we hadn't really thought about what happened, I asked her if we could meet and finally talk about it. She agreed.  
  
Before I continue I should mention that all these years back I was more of a 'tough' guy. I was more open, I broke some small rules a few times, nothing major. (I have never touched a cigarette or drugs or anything like that) But over the years I grew more and more of a closed, silent type of guy. I don't know if that has to do with me still being a little depressed inside, or just with me getting older and more mature. Don’t get me wrong, with being more of a ‘closed type’ I don’t mean I don’t have any friends or stay inside. Quite the contrary, I have good friends and have a lot of fun with them. And I’m currently doing my studies abroad for a few months.  
  
Where were we... Oh, yes! We agreed to meet to talk about what happened long ago. Obviously this didn't work out. I tried to talk a bit, but couldn't get out of my words, I didn't know what to say. And she claims that she doesn't remember anything of that time. So that talk was pretty sh*t and a waste of time. I didn't really feel much better afterwards. This is a few months ago and since then I haven't really spoken to her much, I'm not ignoring her, but not really talking to her either.  
  
In all those years neither I nor she have had a girl-/boyfriend. For some years now I have felt 'scared of girls'. I have never really had a girlfriend, or any interest in a girl (besides the girl this block of text is about). And if I think about myself in about 10 years, I don't really see myself with a girlfriend/wife or wanting kids. But I feel that if I ever want to have a girlfriend it has to be this one girl. But I don't know why this girl. I really would like to be with her, but she has hurt me so much back then and it still hurts. This is probably what's keeping us apart, I don't want to be hurt again. But I don't know how to get over it, or how to forget her... it's been so many years and she's still in my head.  
  
Maybe I should just go to some random club and talk to some random girl, but that’s just not in my ‘nature’. All those girls in there also feel like sl*ts to me (sorry for being so rude with this prejudice)  
  
Well I just wanted to share my story, if anyone has some advice, feel free to comment. If not, that doesn’t matter, I just continue my life as it is now. My life is going pretty well, as I said I’m currently studying abroad and next semester I can do my internship abroad, so I’m pretty happy. There’s just this girl issue that’s been haunting me for some years now and I thought this subreddit might be a good place to share. If you read this all the way through, sorry for 'wasting' your time.

I'm cringing anytime I hear someone say college is the best time of your life. I seriously wish mine was.

* I'm having to work on senior thesis which has been absolute hell because of administration politics (and I was trying to work with them in the summer and they really didn't do much for me). I just want to be done with it because the process is no longer fun. 

* My thesis professor treats me like an idiot that doesn't know what's going on and finds every reason to criticize me, even though I'm generally following her instructions. She's a walking hypocrite. 

* I'd much rather be at my unpaid internship than school, but my internship has been a love-hate relationship. My boss interviewed me and promised me different things than what were offered, but she has a high school mean girl personality (she assists the head of the company, so I get she's stressed; I try not to take what she does personally). Most of the people there are nice, but they constantly send me out on errands in rush hour traffic. I haven't really been doing much apart from grunt work, and I don't think my boss cares about how hard I work (I wake up at 5 AM for a long commute and I'm first one in the office at 8:45) since she's so self-centered and in her own world assisting the head to the company. I try and stay out of her way, but she has given me attitude many times when I've asked her a question. I'm scared to talk with her because she'll just find a way to blame me, or worse, fire me.

I'm still kicking myself because I had an interview scheduled for a paid internship at another company, but I had to cancel it since I took this one. I should've been patient. The HR guy even remembered me when he visited a class of mine at school. The paid company is offering to interview me for next semester, but I don't know if that company would be the right fit and the best place for my last-ever internship.

* College has overall been incredibly frustrating social-wise since I can never get people to hang out with me. Senior thesis has made this even harder; I'm the one who is alway asking if people want to hang out; no one ever reaches out to me and even makes an effort to find a time to hang out. I can be socially awkward so I'm constantly putting blame on myself (IF they ever do want to hang out with me it's because they feel obligated and guilty, not because they want to) when I know it's generally not the case. 

I keep telling myself all of these things won't matter in a year when I graduate, but I don't have that luxury right now. In fact, I'm afraid life after college will be even worse because of social stuff. "

I spent a year (last year), completing prerequisites for graduate study in Computer Science.  I received a sweet offer: a half-time TA position, including a tuition waiver and stipend. This semester, I'm taking two additional, required undergrad courses. Completion of the degree will take me about 3 years.

Right now, I'm pretty certain that I won't finish --  I'm leaning heavily on dropping out at the end of the year, getting a job and going from there.  I'm wondering: what should I expect in terms of job prospects? If it helps, I will have taken the following courses:

Computer Programming I &amp; II; Multi-User Operating Systems; Computer Architecture; Data Structures; Discrete Structures; Object-Oriented Software Design

I hope to get in/take two courses from the following next semester:

Mobil App Development; Web App Architecture &amp; Development; Media Processing and Computing  

Right now, next semester, I'm scheduled to take a grad course in natural language processing and a math-heavy foundation course for data mining.  I'm more interested in pursuing the courses already mentioned, however. 

For what it's worth, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA in every CS and math course taken (I've effectively completed a math minor), although I have no internship experience.

At the end of the day, I'm unsure of what I want, career-wise. On this topic, I've been waging internal battles for a few years now. Right now, I think it's best to get out there, acquire real world experience. 

One last comment: I'm particularly intrigued by journalism, being around journalism, and web programming (although I've done little outside of basic HTML).  

Any comments, words of advice, etc. are much appreciated!

And have hit a road block  

I just took my GRE today and didn't get what I expected (I figured my math would be better than my verbal)... Wondering about what to do now is killing me..  

157 verbal
156 quant

I spent extra time studying the verbal stuff because I knew I was horrible in it and barely studied the math portion because it didn't seem too difficult..  The geometry problems got me... and statistics killed too much time for me :(

So now I'm here with a subpar engineering quant score and a better than average verbal score. Should I retake the GRE?  

I'm worried that the admission reviewers will cut me off before even checking my letters of recommendation, resume, internship experience, projects, grades (3.58 gpa right now), in the top 1/5 of my class at least (according to a Tau Beta Pi recruitment letter) and as dumb as it may sound... my passion for computer engineering.  

What do you guys think? I normally just browse reddit... This is my first post here haha  Is it worth to spend the extra money to retake the GRE or are my scores not bad enough to be automatically cut? I know I meet the minimum requirements for SJSU and UCSB says there is no requirement... but I'm not sure what to do still...

2iqlro,2,2014-10-09,Was on the verge of braking NC yesterday night... please help!,lacaprica,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/2iqlro/was_on_the_verge_of_braking_nc_yesterday_night/,"Broke up with that unfaithfull lady about 4 months (3.5 months currently in NC) ago due to her[26 F] cheating on me [23 M] while in LDR. 




It was (is still) too difficult to accept the fact of her cheating, I did not even realise that it'd affect me so much. I did not know what's depression is like before... Every SINGLE day since break up I think about our relationship of 3 years and her. I analyze my experience, trying to figure out what was wrong and what kind of mistakes I've done, she's done, facts, dates, names, facebook snooping, changes in her behavior, lies, insecurities, loss of repsect  e.t.c. 




This overthinking led me to many conclusions, lessons and 1 horrible suspicion that nearly forced me to break NC yesterday night! (I was about to call but I couldn't make it due to service provider policy about international calls ... it was so close, my hands were shaking while holding the phone!!!). 




Well here is the deal: 5 months ago she called me crying and saying: ""Why were you not near me... "" through the tears and I could not understand what did she mean, later on she said that she's changed, fell down and it was true! I could see those changes: she wouldnt respond to my phone calls, messages, stopped attending classes at the uni. Skype sessions reduced from EVERY DAY to ONCE a week, she started to resent me for no reason. Well later on she confessed to me that she had an affair with that guy who smoked weed with her and helped her to ""rise"". (The guy dumped her after 2 or 3 weeks of fucking her) During her revelation she stated that she made a lot of huge mistakes and to show me that she wanted to work on our relationship she said this to me: 




""Do you remember that guy[45ish M] last summer working at the caffe who was super nice to us? Well he tried to hit on me while you were doing your internship and I turned him down! See? I said truth! You did not even know this before, I am being honest... I solved that problem back then without you...""




Eventually, after couple of fight skype sessions I went to NC and deleted her from all social media. After over analyzing staff I had been thinking about that time last summer and OH GOD, It hit me yesterday.... I came to the conclusion that it was trickle truth! I was remembering that time last summer and here my memories:




* was coming from internship and finding her with a nice make up on her and all pretty, she said that she just wanted to look cute, no reason for make up


* avoiding of going to that cafe where the guy worked...


* getting calls from unknown number (evenings)


* and the most ponderous fact/memory that gives me **shivers** and makes my mind crazy is that one day I came from internship and found her without make up sitting playing game, all normal, then I lean to kiss her and I felt this mixed smell of smoke, cigarettes and sweat from her... Even in her mouth! I complained and said WTF are you smelling like and she just burst into tears and saying sorry to me... (She cried all evening and apologized many times) I was confused at that time and did not even realize what was going on (most likely she had sex with him)... we dropped it and I forgot about this **UNTILL YESTERDAY**.




When I came to this conclusion based on these facts and memories I was numb! It was trickle truth! So much anger... tears were just dropping from my eyes uncontrollably.. I wanted to call her and get the confirmation regarding breaking the NC and ask why did she do this to me... what was wrong, how much of a bad person she is... I even wanted to smash her head against the wall due to the excessive anger! I did so much for her and in return got this! How disrespectfull... I still want to call her and talk/confirm that she fucked him (even though I might over think things I am 85% sure she did this)... I feel like I deserve to know the truth. 




Reddit... what should I do? Every time I think about it I get the tremors, I want to confirm my suspicion. I want to call her and talk about it. I deserve the truth! Should I really break the NC, make a short call and ask how's she doing in a good and civil manner and try to get the confirmation ? I need your input guys/girls, please... or I will borrow someone's pnone and make this damn international call!

So I'm a third year CS student... My resume is not exactly typical though. I've been involved in a lot of social justice/mental health initiatives, I have never done an internship, and I have two years of research in a cognitive neuroscience lab... I also have three publications in cognitive science and about the same number of guest lectures/conference presentations ranging from guest lecturing in sexual diversity studies classrooms to doing workshops/presentations at mental health national conferences... I actually really love CS and I don't have any desire to switch careers, but in a certain sense I'm also a hopeless generalist.

My GPA is pretty high (dean's honour roll + two scholarships so far) and I've been teaching myself various skills on the side (basic webdev/design and smartphone development mostly).

Anyways, I have two main questions:

1. Do you think I'll be screwed for getting good internships considering my really weird CV? I'm better at my classes than most of my peers, but I have less internships/hands-on experience. I'm also concerned employers will think I'm ""unfocused"" even though I'm quite focused and do well at most things I set my mind to.
2. I have debts, so I guess I should get a job, but I really just want to use computer science to help with social justice initiatives (like this one that I'm spearheading: http://ethanbrycemacdonald.com/tactics/). Do you think it's possible to make a career out of open source/social justice/grassroots research type work? I've never heard of anyone doing that so I'm not certain... I'm thinking I might do a masters so that I can keep working on these projects on the side while upping my skillset (here in Canada, I'd be fully funded)..."

2iqsvf,1,2014-10-09,Anyone know much about Neuroscience-related application of computer science? And also general advice about entering the computer-science industry?,mikogk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2iqsvf/anyone_know_much_about_neurosciencerelated/,"Let me start by saying that I really enjoy computer-science and learning how computers work from the ground up. I've recently built my first desktop PC, I enjoy tinkering with Linux and Android a lot and i just love the idea of technology making everyday people's lives easier or better.

A little background -- I'm currently a fourth-year Neuroscience Major at a university in Los Angeles. I took a year-off after high school to live in South America, came here as a Biochem Major, and late last year decided that i wanted to work with computers. I'll be taking a 5th year towards graduation for two main reasons. 

1) I lack software engineering experience and I want to use my time as a student to be kind of ""forgiven"" for my lack of experience in applying for internships as a student, and have extra time to network and hone my technical skills and knowledge.

2) My Neuroscience degree requires a year of related research at the university and I don't think I'd want to rush that.

I chose to graduate as a Neuroscience major partly because it was too late to change my major to computer science and because it seemed to have the most interesting prospective technical applications of the biology related degrees I could have chosen from.

I recently went to a workshop for how to complete this research requirement and the idea popped into my head that they MUST use computers. My question is, where can I be useful? Brain-imaging, brain scans and just data analysis all use computer-programs, and there is tons of data collected and stored in databases--another widespread application that needs lots of management.

Another question is, what would be a worthwhile direction to go in if I eventually want to work in a tech company? Brain science isn't the first thing I'd think to write a program for, and I wasn't able to take a databases class (the only CS classes I had space for were Data Structures and Algorithms... which are both quite important). What is the best way to approach this?

Sorry for any redundant questions, and if my question seems vague or if it seems like I just need to do my own footwork. I've been trying to think about ways to use my time here in a way to gear me to more technical work, and I'm so excited by the epiphany I've had that it really is possible to make use of my remaining time, and that all my time wasn't a waste. If any clarification is needed or you have any general advice beyond that, I would love to hear what you have to say."

Thoughts?,RockyValderas,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/2iqxn3/treating_myself_to_new_monitors_equator_d8_or/,"Hi all. I just landed my first internship at a studio, and thought I would treat myself to a pair of nearfield monitors. So far, I've been mixing mostly my own stuff through my Shure SE535s, and checking my mixes in a variety of ways. But now that things are getting more serious, I feel like my gear needs to catch up. 

So I've had my eye on a couple different models, as the title suggests. The Equator D8 or D5, and the Yamaha HS8. 

I'm open to any other suggestions you all may have, but I would like to keep it around this price range. 

My room is currently untreated, so that will be a factor. I plan to mix at moderately low levels anyway, so hopefully it won't be too much of a problem. Eventually I will be investing in treating my space (probably a DIY project). 

I would really appreciate your thoughts :)"

I'm a CS student from Belgium graduating in June. Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out what I want to do afterwards.
I don't really have to feeling that I already want to start working fulltime. As I always wanted to see the world, I guess that it will be the right time to do this after my graduation.
If possible, I would like to combine this with doing a paid internship abroad, so I would get some more work experience from it and earn money I could use while travelling. I'm currently on an Erasmus exchange in Norway, and it turns out internships here are very well paid.
Other options would be doing some extra studying (business?, management?), or finding a fulltime job with remote possibilities.

Does anyone have any other ideas or experiences? Thanks in advance!"

Its metal and plastic with other comfort pieces. 

Second, everywhere we go in the building requires us to scan our badge to get in and out. 

Anyways I was asked to deliver a package to our loading deck. Ok no problem, I am a young intern. I go to the elevator lobby hit parking level one and on my way out of the lobby I come to a hallway with scanners at both entrance. Well FML I realized I didn't have my badge. So I'm waiting a minute or two when someone comes in, for a second I think hey I should just follow into the elevator lobby that way I can get to my floor and get my badge; but my lazy self was like fuck that this package is heavy just leave it down there. 

So I reach the FedEx/UPS area at our guards desk and realize that I can't get back in, else I be trapped in that hallway, so my dumbass just says hey I am going to go in through the visitor's center.

Well I get to the visitor's center and of course I forgot that they have metal detectors -_-

So I take off my belt and shoes and I'm like fuck it, maybe it will work. Nope.

So I'm like holy shit I can't take this shit off here, so I wakwardly am like heyyy I'll brb and grab my stuff and go outside. 

That when the game plan is hatched. 

So I realize I have to take it off and stash it somewhere and then come back. But where will it not be noticed? hmm.... Already kicking myself because, cautious guy like me always tells himself to have hiding place ready, in case, you know?
Well first thing first I have to take it off and I can't whip my dick out in public so i go to the closest public restroom. In a rush I take it off quickly in a stall and walk out without washing my hands - attracting attention. So I start waking to the other side of the building where I know there is grass. I go up to the second level and start looking around.

Damn nice grass and tables, no where to stash......
and then I see mulch. Thank GOD! for mulch. So I'm walking along these big planters and I find my spot. A little deeper hole with water. So I sit down and wait for the walking traffic to dissipate and stick it in. Well of course it's fucking mud so I just cram some other mulch on top. Literally putting a $200 piece of equipment in the ground. I'm wearing nice clothes too so I'm looking pretty shady if anyone notices this guy has mud all over his hands. So I had back to the restroom and wash them. good to go. 

Walking back to my office building I'm brainstorming ideas. And I decide that I was going to say that I was going to use this as an excuse to go to McDonalds (next to the bathroom) but didn't have my wallet, hence no Mcdonalds. Butt fuck that right, security guards are probably thinking well wtf made the metal detector go off before you left all wierdly. AND let me tell THANK GOD I AM A CHRISTIAN cause I am wearing my metal cross with metal. So I go in and make a show of taking off my cross, to prevent those questions, and get through. Co-worker brings my badge down and I am now back in the building. 

Now I don't want to leave immediatley cause I'm guessing I already garnered unwanted attention so I've rationalized that I'll go down close to McDonalds lunch time since I already had breakfast and don't want to buy more just for show.  

Current considerations: 
Should I bring the small pencil pouch, I use for transorting it, to bring it in because it's dirty? It would look suspicious carrying only a pencil case, especially because I am a 23 year old guy.
If I put it in my pocket it will get my trouser all dirty and i can;t clean it there because I am in public. I guess I might just have to bring the pencil case, to take it to the restroom, to clean it and then put it in my pocket so it's not noticeable. 
Should I say fuck it and go grab it now, else I lose an expensive piece of equipment?
Will my boss and co-workers notice when I'm gone for 20 mintues; they didn't the first time I was not there.


Updates coming


TL;DR I forgot my badge inside a secured building and set off metal detector trying to get in through the vistiors center. Awkwardly left and hatched a quick/successful plan to get  back in and then recollect my extender later. haven't yet though.......

Different lawyer from this one : http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2ioveg/the_joys_of_too_much_free_time/  This customer is very intelligent about non computer related stuff, and does well with his law practice.  He is not afraid to spend money to get a better product.  One week prior to this, I had just installed the most powerful non server computer I had ever touched in his office.    Intel i7 with 32GB ram, SSD, plus a second, 2 TB drive for storage, I don't remember the exact model of video card, but it cost $299 in addition to the computer, and was hooked up to dual 21"" monitors. He basically runs Office and a couple legal programs.  We would not normally recommend this powerful of a rig for office work, but he picked it out of a Dell catalog, and wanted it.  Hey, it's his money.   A week after install, customer calls and complains that it is slow.  He said it was fine for a couple hours after I left, but then it was slow.

&gt;Me : I am sorry to hear that.  I'll come over and take a look at it.

&gt;Rich Lawyer :  I want this fixed.  I don't have time to wait on my computer.

&gt;Me : Let's see what's going on.

&gt;RL : I open Outlook, and get the ""Blue Ring of Waiting.""  It sucks.  Fix it.

Sure enough, it takes about 5 minutes to open MS Outlook.  Then I see it.  His inbox has over 15,000 messages. All in the main folder of the Inbox. They date back about 6 years.

&gt;Me : We need to move some of these emails to subfolders.

&gt;RL : I need those emails.  I need a record for legal purposes.

&gt;Me :  We need to get those emails out of the inbox.  At least the older stuff.  You will still be able to access it, but it won't load them all up when you open outlook.  

&gt;RL : I don't have time to search for my emails. I need them.

&gt;Me : Do you have time to wait for Outlook to search through each email every time you start it?  That's what it is doing now.  You see those books over there?  Imagine if you had to read them all every day before you started work.  Even the ones that have nothing to do with what you are doing that day.  

&gt; RL : So you can't fix this without screwing up my email?  I want your boss to look at this.

&gt; Me : OK.  lets call him in.  I won't tell him what I found, and we'll see what he says.

Boss comes in, takes one look and tells him to clean up his email.  RL argued and got very angry.


&gt;Boss :  If someone broke into my house, and I shoot him, should I talk to the police before talking to you?

&gt;RL : That would be stupid.  You would probably end up making things very bad for your self.

&gt;B :  So I should follow your advice on legal matters, because Law is what you do, and you know more than I do.

&gt;RL : That's why I get paid the big bucks.

&gt;B : Computers are why *I* get paid the big bucks.

I'm not dispelling
that I'm a fucked up guy. But this is just me being honest here. I took a lot of time for me to accept that I was affected by it, but I got there. I've always been the guy who believes that the end justify the means, and that utilitarianism is correct, and I'm ""neurotically pragmatic"" (as I've been described by a friend).

How I got this way ? I'm not sure. I didn't have too bad a childhood, dad wasn't in my life, mom had these ""boyfriends"" who were jerks. But overall, not too bad. I wasn't too stupid as a kid. I was good at studies, and ran fast. Didn't go into any team sports, simply didn't work. I did my track events and got through middle/high school. I wasn't a loner. I had a small group of friends but only spent time with them, in school. I liked my privacy. So, at a point in high school, everybody felt the compulsive need to ""be with someone"". Honestly, I didn't. Simply didn't.

When I got horny, I masturbated. Its just something I got over with as soon as it could be done. I had my first ""relationship"" with a girl who was honestly being passed around the school. I did it because she was hot and she was easy. All I wanted was sex. As soon as that happened, I didn't feel any need to spend any time with her. She didn't take it too hard, but I sure was called a million names.

I've always had a good physique and worked to maintain it. I did get quite a bit of female attention, but I never felt the need to reciprocate. Not only because I didn't know how, but because I always question the why. If I got horny, I beat off. Naturally, a time came when that wasn't enough. But my handful of friends would always come and slap me on the back of the head and say ""Dude, she's into you. Ask her out"" whenever a girl showed interest in me. I really didn't want to. 

I moved on to college. Attended a very good university. Same story there too. I had a small group of friends, I loved spending time alone, but occasionally just to appear normal I forced myself to go out with them. Luckily in college, I found a simpler solution. One night stands. This worked for quite a while, when that fizzled out, friends with benefits (but that always leads to the other partner assuming too much). After graduation, I found something even better. Escort services. I know this is hellish to some people, but I don't want to leave anything out here. It seemed to me like the perfect arrangement. But my friends almost found out after my second time, so I just gave it up, so that I'm not considered weird in my social circle.

Everybody was ""dating"" so I went out many times. Now I didn't want to hurt these girls but I simply didn't share their vision of ""love"". I honestly never quite got it. In this cycle, I was called an ""automaton"", ""unemotional"", ""a fucking computer"", and they just assumed that I saw life in mathematical terms. It never really affected me much that I didn't call these girls back.

I can only imagine how absurd this might come across to everyone else. Honestly, I feel you. But this wasn't some ""bachelor-party-fuck-everything-that-moves"" phase. I honestly saw things that way. It started worrying me.

I started reading up on books like ""5 Languages of Love"" - which everybody knew about. I really didn't get it. I could relate it to the stuff to people I saw in real life actually doing this stuff, but didn't quite feel it myself.

But I forced myself to date seriously. I tried getting serious with a girl I had gone to college with. I tried it for a month and a half. But it simply didn't work. First, I didn't get the need to tell her everything about my past. Who I've had sex with, who I was attracted to. I've done some pretty bad things and I didn't want her to know. Again, these bad things aren't diabolical crimes, its just that the mentality I had then towards dating was completely different. As for the sexual part, the sex was good. But simple stuff about myself caused her to get mad. for example, if I got horny in the afternoon, I asked her if she's down for it. If she said no, I'd go beat off. Then she'd be mad that I wasn't ready for sex in the evening.
Then, she'd constantly be nice to me, and I tried to reciprocate but it simply didn't come naturally to me. I didn't give her random compliments, didn't suddenly hug/kiss her out of the blue. So, naturally she broke up with me. Again, I didn't feel the ""emptiness"" that I was supposed to.

I'm trying everything again now with another girl, been with her for 3 months. She's busy with college so we meet sparingly. Not only is she pretty, she has a nice voice and is smart. I've created reminders to get her a random gift sometimes. I'm still not ""feeling"" what I'm apparently supposed to, but its better than before.

Now, she's gone to do an internship overseas for 5 weeks. 1 week has 
passed. She's expressed that she wants us to do naughty stuff over Skype. She gets turned on by muscle and sweat so she asked me to work out while she masturbated with her vibrator. It was the weirdest experience of my life. She asked me to get naked in front of her but its just too weird. I don't want to do it. Nor do I want her to send her nudes to me. Not only is it unsafe, it doesn't quite help me in getting off. I feel uncomfortable saying ""I miss you"" and stuff to her. I don't call her ""honey"" or ""babe"", her name suffices. She's never said anything about that, but I imagine that this'll be a problem sometime in the future.

I'm feeling helpless like I've never felt before. I simply don't know what to do. I can't quite explain what I feel, or whether I feel the ""love"". But I want to fix this.

So, I'm quite fucked up. I've never had a problem with it, but am having issues with myself now. Because I don't want to hurt the girl I'm dating.
And now I'm here. On the internet, which can be arguably the worst place for a person like me who is ""different"" to say the least. But you gotta believe me guys, I want to fix this.

**tl;dr**: Pragmatic self doesn't quite share the common vision of love and therefore appear as cold to partners."

You guys are wonderful, and I'm so glad this is a real thing--I'm not alone! Now, I need to get this off my chest and maybe some of you can enjoy or at least relate to some of my Nmom's gems.

* My earliest memory (age 4 or 5) of Nmom was after her fight with her mother. She said she'd one day poison all our food when I wasn't looking, so we'd die and not have to deal with my grandmother (to whom I was close) anymore. She then promptly offered me an already open bag of snacks. I became paranoid about eating food I had not witnessed the preparation of for weeks. 
* I've had a chronic illness since birth. Even knowing this, Nmom would throw a tantrum every time I needed to go to the doctor, saying that I'd somehow caused it, and threatening that I'd have to pay the bills myself...as a kid.
* She loved to tell me that I smell bad. At 7, she locked us in the bathroom, and, backing me into a corner, demanded that I take down my pants so she could check that I'd washed. When I refused, she slapped me, knocking out my front loose baby tooth onto the tile floor.
* She loved to suggest that my judgement was poor. Living with her during college (still telling me I smell bad), I reached my 21st birthday. I was working a full time internship at a prestigious company, pretty much just a workaholic. My birthday fell during the workweek, so to celebrate, I picked up a pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade. I drank only one during dinner, while doing a crossword puzzle, still in my business clothes. The liquid hadn't even passed below the neck of the bottle before Nmom accuses me of being an alcoholic. ""No, I'm not an alcoholic. I'm just having dinner, and its my 21st birthday."" ""See? That's the impaired judgment talking!""
* Allegedly I lost my housekey once during my college summer stay at home. Thereafter, I was allowed only to slip the key under the door once I'd locked it, but not keep it myself to return. Nmom must be home to let me in. (I'm sure she enjoyed this because she could request specific information about when I'm coming and going, and demand that I not arrive at a certain time because she HAD to stay awake open the door). Well one night I get home from work (~8pm as usual), and Nmom is not home. I call her. ""Well, this is why I ask what time you'll be home! I'm not there now, so you'll just have to wait."" Well, there IS no place to wait in this building. No lobby, darkish hallways, etc. So I walked back down to the bus station, sat on the bench and read the paper. After about an hour it got dark, most commuters and buses had already left the station. Then someone playing that stupid knock out game thought it would be fun to have a go at me, so there I was. Bloody, broken nose, lost glasses, and only a block from my house. Call Nmom. Tell her what happened. ""See? This is why you shouldn't be out at night.""
* Went back to college, low contact after this on the advice of a counselor (""Its probably best if you pretend you just don't have a mom.""). Sent her financial aid paperwork through the mail. Get a voicemail: ""I got this envelope in the mail that says its from you but...I don't really hear from you anymore so how do I know its from you? I'm not going to open it because it could be a BOMB."" Edit: The best part about this is that she used a direct message feature, which lets you send a message directly to another's voicemail without having to dial them. (I'm guessing because she was too cowardly to make such a ludicrous accusation directly to my face/ear.)
* Nmom found a list of songs in my room that I wanted to download. Later, I'll admit I went snooping in her room to find personal things she had taken from mine. I found my list, modified with her handwriting, noting that the songs were evidence of my possession by the devil.  A couple examples from the list: Rocket Man (Elton John) and My Sharona (The Knack).
* Once after an argument, she told me she had brain cancer. Have not heard anything about brain cancer since. Truth is, I was relieved when she told me, because I wanted her to die so I could finally be happy.

I'm looking for a programming internship at the moment. I started to teach myself programming after I finished my bachelor's degree in a totally different field and fell in love with coding so I decided to switch careers and pursue a programming career :) Everything I know about programming I taught myself but you can only get so far teaching yourself and honestly it's pretty hard sometimes. I would love to find an internship where I could learn hands-on from more experienced people. My experience so far is that companies usually don't want to hire people on my level, everyone seems to want senior developers with lots of experience. I know I still have a lot to learn but I'm motivated and willing to learn so I can make my dream of a programming career come true and I'm hoping to find someone who will give me a chance. I know there are programs like Hackbright out there but I can't afford doing anything like that. 
I thought some of you might have sime tips who I could contact or what else I could do.
I live in Germany but I'm willing to relocate and I could start as soon as possible.
Thanks for your help! I really appreciate it!"

I'm in my final year of university for a degree in computer science, graduating in May 2015. After living expenses, rent, and tuition are paid for throughout the rest of the school year I'll wind up with roughly $30,000 left over in my 529. I'm trying to figure out the best way to drain/transfer the remaining funds from it while minimizing the income taxes that the rest will be subject to. The 529 is currently held with my parents in all of their Fidelity accounts, I have a Vanguard account and will transfer the leftover money there. Here's the situation:

- Will start working for very large tech company in California (currently live in Texas) in August 2015. Everything is in writing, have signed all necessary paperwork, company will certainly not flop / renege offer.
- Salary will just put me in the 28% tax bracket, and CA state income will be (I think) 9.3% on top of that
- I interned for same company summer 2014, grossing ~$14k before taxes (again, in California)
- I have never filed taxes myself, my parents always claim me as a dependent

It seems (to me, anyway, I know very little about taxes) that it would be in my best interest to go ahead and drain the 529 of all funds now and file taxes myself rather than wait until I graduate since internship money + 529 leftover money would put me in a much lower tax bracket for 2014. Am I right? Or completely off base? My tax knowledge is very limited. Should I speak with a tax professional about this stuff? Thanks for any advice.

Also, I will be draining all of the remaining 529 money rather than leaving it there in case of continuing education / giving it to potential kids / etc, so please don't suggest anything like that.

Thanks for your help!

I’m in engineering school and basically I had to make a choice between two options, and I made the wrong choice. This means that I will probably need to work a little harder, and that my grade for this project will be a little lower. But that is not what is bothering me.
I have been doing really well lately in my studies, and a lot of people in my specialty are having some trouble due to the fact that it is our final year and there is a lot to be done in a short period (Projects, internships...). Some of my friends and classmates are even breaking down or on the verge of it.
I thought I was doing well, but now after this insignificant mistake I’m starting to question it. It’s really eating me up and causing a lot of unnecessary stress.

2ithhv,16,2014-10-09,"20F with no direction, I just want to do something.. fun and meaningful",lovetothelightning,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2ithhv/20f_with_no_direction_i_just_want_to_do_something/,"I apologize for making this a bit long.
I am 20, I graduated from HS a couple years ago and took a year off to figure things out, then got a job at a retail store where I worked for about 6 months. Those 6 months were hell due to shitty management, but I did meet my boyfriend there. He is in a similar position as me, with no direction. I quit my job and started going to community college, just to do something with myself. I had wanted to get some kind of physical science degree, eventually transfer colleges, but after a couple semesters I think I might not be cut out for university, especially a subject as rigorous as biology or chemistry. My boyfriend is interested in drama and acting, but that's a whole different situation.

Basically, right now I have absolutely no idea what to do, all I know is that I HAVE to get out and go somewhere. I can't drive and even if I could I can't afford a car (my boyfriend is looking into getting himself a car though). I've been job searching my area but there's limited options for someone with no degree and no transportation besides walking/biking. There's also very very few opportunities for volunteering or internships. I had started to look into the AmeriCorps program, which both me and my boyfriend are very interested in, because it would allow us to get out, even if we had to live on a small stipend. I'm usually very optimistic but lately nothing has been going right for us, so while I want to apply for this program, I am doubtful that either of us would get in. I've been trying to find other similar programs and internships but I don't really know what I'm looking for. It's our dream to live in a big city, hopefully like in California or Washington or something, but the only thing standing in our way is lack of money and fear of failure. That's why I'm looking into programs that, if accepted, it'll be the exact swift kick in the butt that we need, along with the offer of money so we can move (we have some money saved up but only enough to last us a few months).

So here are some interests of mine:

* Volunteer work type stuff. Specifically environmental or helping the homeless/disadvantaged people. I like helping.

* I love cooking. I've applied to plenty of cook/prep cook/baker positions in the area but I have no professional experience.. I do have the option to do the culinary arts program at my CC, but I'm kinda worried about the trouble that switching around programs would cause with financial aid. I also am very interested in this free college thing? in San Diego that offers a culinary program, but I do not live in San Diego..

* Art. Painting, drawing, etc. I'm good at it, it's been my only passion my whole life but the past couple of years I feel kinda hopeless with it. But it is something I enjoy and am good at. I have this dream of making album/poster art for bands, but well.. that's kind of a difficult position to get into. I gotta keep building a portfolio if I want freelance art work.

* Science, I like science very much but I am not good at studying and have never had a high GPA. Chemistry was my forte, but I'm not a genius at it. (I like geology, anthropology, paleontology, sociology, psychology... etc. I like psychology a lot but don't think I could do the schooling.)

* I do enjoy fashion and make-up, but that's a recent interest. I think doing special effects make-up would be so cool, but I'm not really qualified for it.

That's all I can think of for now. There's lots of things I like, just not a lot of opportunities that I can take involving them. Like I said, I mostly want something that can kick my butt into gear. If you know of anything similar to AmeriCorps, please tell me (I'm not really looking to go out of country, but I may consider it). Also, if you know of a city that is fun/interesting and has some good opportunities for someone with little education and experience, PLEASE let me know! I don't know where to go (although San Diego is sounding nice)."

I've been applying to a bunch of places since maybe April or May this year. I've gotten a decent amount of interviews, maybe 4-5 for Software Dev internship. So getting the interviews hasn't really been a huge issue. But no matter how hard I work, I never get job offers. I definitely messed up on one of them on the technical questions (phone interview), did ok on one, and then got 1/1 questions correct on the most recent one I had. 

I get it. I'm not a CS major so the road is going to be a bit tougher and I have to prove that I actually know shit and am not BSing the people who interview me. I have a GitHub with projects, a portfolio website that I set up, have taken a decent amount of CS classes at school (plan to take more) and try my hardest at these interviews. 

I have gotten 0 offers. I know I don't deserve anything, but god damn, I used to go on my college's career website and apply to everything relevant to programming and now I just feel so discouraged. Like what's the point of applying if the same shit is going to happen...

She knows that I feel this way sometimes but I don't think she really understands. 

She has rough days and anxiety about future events like anybody else, and I just have a hard time being there for her when I feel like this. Its like I don't know how to help her and myself at the same time.
No matter how good of a day I have I just feel like I'm not going towards anything, theres nothing to look forward too. I don't want to put any of this on my girlfriend because she is already so stressed. She has a job that is requiring her to do a lot of training in her spare time, as well as being a full time student. 


I feel like I am being insensitive for not being able to support her and be the goofy fun boyfriend she knows me to be most of the time. Or I feel like if I bring it up then its just me using it as an excuse.

Despite the fact that I have a degree and can put on a  friendly-people-pleaser smile in general I've always struggled in the job department. 

I was in high school when the recession hit so I never managed to find a job despite countless applications. I chalked it up to the recession - where I live adults were taking all the menial jobs typically reserved for teens. So after high school I had practically no work experience.

I managed to get a job at a taco bell, but during a bout of depression following being kicked out of my home and living in a laundromat for a while I quit. 

When I got better (at least for a little while) I managed to get into a good private business school. Although I got good grades I never qualified for any grants or scholarships or even campus employment so I had to pay for everything out of pocket.

During the first year and a half the only interviews I had were at a local gas station and a telemarketing firm. Although my interview at the gas station went great (or so I thought) they chose to hire a mentally challenged girl instead, who cried every time she had to do basic tasks and quit less than a month later. I got the telemarketing job and did very well at it. It was a few weeks after I had been working there that I got the news that I had to switch to working day shift (which I couldn't due to school) or be fired. I shook my managers hand and immediately left the building.

I applied seemingly everywhere business related. Part time, full time, seasonal, and especially internships which I desperately needed to compliment my degree and give it some credibility. Still nothing.

Months passed without any interviews until one day I got hired at a doggy daycare. I loved this job. Playing with dogs all day is the easiest, most fun job I've ever had. Until there was a change in management. Almost overnight the place turned into a nightmare with all the other employees neglecting the dogs. The were fights, attacks, no one was cleaning and no one cared. For nearly six months I picked up the slack for everyone but all this animal neglect really got to me. I spoke with the owner and told her her my issues with the manager, who was also the owners best friend. She told the manager and next thing you know I've been fired again, after a year of being the best worker they've had.

I graduated with my business administration degree shortly after and quickly found that all the time and money I spent on this sheet of paper is worthless, especially with no credible work experience.

I begged my friend who happened to work at my family vet clinic for a job. I got a job cleaning kennels a few days a week. Eventually I got promoted to vet tech and got the privilege to work with my family vets and learn the business. I loved this job and bosses All of my coworkers who were easily the most intelligent, respectable people I knew.

One day out of the blue a police officer showed up and five minutes later I was fired and threatened with legal actions and being the suspect of a major crime which I didn't commit. I was never questioned before, during, in the matter and from what I suspect was used as a scapegoat for something shady my employers were doing. 

After this I started having panic attacks several times a day and nightmares every time I tried to sleep, which continue to this day.I got hit by depression so hard I almost started to lose touch with reality.

I won my unemployment case and eventually stopped having as many panic attacks and nightmares but recently I was called into the unemployment office for  woman to review the jobs I had been applying for and receive help finding a new one. The woman was extremely hostile and abrasive and pretty much told me i had no skills, I was going to be audited, and I was worthless.

I walked with a friend to get coffee last night. We walked past a restaurant where he looked through the window. He told me wait for a minute while he ran in. He came out holding a job application which I thought was for me, but it actually was for him to fill out. He went in and got hired on the spot. He already has a great job with benefits and this waiting jobs would be ""just for fun""

I've have never felt so worthless, depressed and crazy in my life. I've wasted so much time and money on a degree that's just worthless. I'm smart and friendly and am a very hard worker. I just feel like no one wants me. I don't even want myself.

Because of today's rejection, I'm currently on pace to be a fucking virgin in my godamn parent's basement upon graduation. So now what? Is this the life I'm destined to live? It honestly doesn't seem fair.
I'd like to think I'm smart and funny, but that can't be true. It sucks seeing all these people around me getting jobs and being successful while I fall flat on my face time and time again. I fucking can't do anything right, and it's fucking my future over big time.

And if for some reason I do end up getting a job, it'll end up being in the middle of nowhere with no prospects relationships or friendships. God damn have I fucked myself over.

See, the stereotypical college plan is to either be successful or find someone who you want to spend your life with. I have done neither. I have had four years to get my fucking life in order, and after today, apparently I've done shit.

I've always like to think that I'd never be forever alone, but that fucking lifestyle follows me around no matter what I do. Go to the gym? Fuck you. Try extra hard in classes? Fuck you again, because you apparently have no personality to succeed in interviews. Fuck my life. There is honestly no greater disappointment in life for me knowing that I tried my goddamn hardest not to be forever alone, yet still ended up forever alone. Fuck this shit.

I tried so hard too. I went to the gym and improved my looks. I studied hard and worked extra hard in my internships. And what do I have to prove for it? Absolutely nothing. I'm still the same fucking baby faced asshole loser that I was in high school. And that's what fucking sucks. No matter any improvement I make to myself, my (apparent) destiny doesn't change. Shit fucking sucks.

Very recently (read: 3 weeks ago), I was hired on as an intern at the local theatre, and I was handed the task of cleaning out the depot so that the single permanent IT technician would have a better place to work other than his own office desk, and just to point it out, this doesn't mean that it's him and me and a bunch of other IT-inclined people. It's literally just me and him. This has since led me to take on the task of, in general, trying to put up a more dedicated IT support infrastructure. So far, it has been going well. The IT workshop now has two desks, one being the desk on where I'm currently typing this and the other one being a dedicated workbench, intended for Hardware fixings. Now, the hardware side of it, I have fairly nicely locked down (A screwdriver and a case of bits, mostly insulated (best I could manage, I nicked it from the basement woodshop), planning to get my hands on a soldering iron, and a voltmeter. Already got a powerstrip attached to the table so that I can have multiple PCs hooked up, so that together with the networking switch, me and my boss would be able to update multiple PCs at once).
Now, this is all well and good, but I have run into a bit of a snag. While we do run on a TerminalServer (Remote Desktop'ing into your workstation, pretty much), the first, and pretty much only, avenue of action in case a machine shits itself when it comes to the software is to nuke it from orbit and reinstall Windows. And by this, I mean from scratch. So, in order to try as hard as possible to get away from the nuclear solutions, I am turning to you guys in a hope that you can recommend me some software (preferably stuff you can shove onto a USB-stick or similar) which can do some of the following things:

* Restore from an image. I have already thought about Deep Freeze, since that's what they use at my dad's school (the kids got smart, the IT department became smarter), but I would like to know if you can think of anything better/cheaper/more practical/whatever.

* Clean the computer. Here I'm talking about anything from CCleaner to Malwarebytes and everything in between. Not anti-virus software, though. We already run F-secure.

* Possibly automate some stuff. I'm only an intern here until mid-December and from then on, my future is a little bit uncertain. I might move company, might stay here, or might just be straight-up out of work and my boss simply doesn't have the time to do everything, since he handles pretty much ALL the IT in this place, ranging from the ticket sales system, to the computers, to the great big F-off screen outside that shows what's going on in the building.

* Help him monitor stuff remotely. This one is a rather recent addition, but it fell into my head after they were discussing the ventilation system in one of the theatre halls, they ran into the issue that they didn't have any way of checking if the ventilation was working properly other than adjusting it on the computer (which is in one end of the building, followed by going all the way to the theatre hall itself (in the other end of the building). Now, this point is not a requirement, since it'll likely end up being rather expensive and not completely necessary, but it would still be nice to be able to control most of the building without being chained to the desk.

* Something else I haven't thought of, but that you guys think would be nice to just have, just in case.

One last requirement for all of this. It has to be fairly easy to learn how to use, or at least somewhat quickly googlable. I don't have proper training as an IT technician beyond basic google-fu and common sense, I mainly use Plug'N'Play stuff and my boss simply doesn't have the time between helping set up IT for the shows that are coming in and making sure that the building IT in general doesn't burn to the ground.

Also, just to make it interesting, a list of limitations:

* First, the obvious one: Money. I have no idea what the IT budget is, to be honest, but let's go by the assumption of ""The cheaper, the more likely we are to get it"". This shouldn't stop you from recommending more expensive solutions, though, but do keep it in mind before suggesting something. While it will be appreciated for future reference, it is sadly not something I will be likely to be able to get a hold of.

* It has to be user-friendly. As in, a learned end-user should be able to learn how to use it, since that's kind of what the IT department consists of, between me and my boss. (Did I mention that my boss was literally the first semi-dedicated IT technician in the building ever? And that I'm technically just hired on as a Theatre Technician, but I just managed to hide away in what is now the IT workshop?). I'll write documentation for him on how to use it, of course, but I can't really do that unless I know how to use it.

* No touching the hardware or the servers. We have some media players (for the advertisement screens around the place) which are all the same hardware, but that's it. Workstations are a variation upon each other and we replace them on a ""as they break""-basis, so not a lot to do there. While we would love to institute GPOs and whatnot on the domain server, it is handled by a third-party company. Though peripherals are allowed (at least, semi-cheap ones). 

* Also, while general solutions are nice, I would like to know specific software in order to pull these things off. I have pretty much little-to-no clue about any of the software pieces of the world and what they can do and how they do it. 

* It all has to be legal. While this is kind of a given, it here means everything. I can't even go around with a USB-stick with MBAM and CCleaner on it and stick it in more than one computer. So... If someone could recommend some variation upon Linux (or the likes) that you're allowed to use in buisnesses, for data recovery, that would be awesome. 

Go by the assumption that we have nothing in place, software-wise, other than F-Secure when it comes to Software repair.
If you can provide documentation for why we should choose precisely this or that piece of software, it would be nice, since, in his eyes, at least, the argumentation of ""A bunch of guys claiming to be trained IT technicians on the internet said we should put this near the computers!"" isn't that good of an argument.
In advance, thanks for the help guys! Both from me (An Intern, honoured for being chosen to do this), and my boss (who sadly isn't here right now since he's off trying to make ticket sales behave).

If you want/need more information, do ask and I'll see how much I can wring out of my boss before he disappears.

TL;DR: Interning at place where there is no IT Support infrastructure. Need help with setting up repair software and the likes. Plz halp"
2iu9by,10,2014-10-10,It's been about 2 years since I graduated with a BS in ChemE and I haven't had a real job yet. Is my degree useless now?,[deleted],ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/2iu9by/its_been_about_2_years_since_i_graduated_with_a/,"As the title says, I graduated in Dec. 2012 with my BS in a school in the northeast area. A little about academics: 3.3 GPA, no internship, undergraduate research experience (in fluid dynamics), AIche membership, some volunteer experience. Looking back on my college experience now, I understand how underwhelming my achievements are which is why I was never hired to a real ChemE job (I applied to hundreds of positions). I also did not network as well as I could have because I am a little shy. I have had odd jobs here and there since 2012 and I really feel like I have wasted 4 years of my life obtaining a degree that now seems useless. I just want a straight and honest answer from this subreddit: is there any hope at this point for me? 

edit: I did not tell my full story and I want people to learn from my mistakes. After I graduated, I worked at a retail store. I applied and got 4 interviews in the first months after graduation but no job offers because I now realize I am not great at interviewing. I finally thought I got my foot in the door when I got a job (in Sept 2013) as a technician manufacturing ELISA kits however my contract with that company was terminated after 6 months. Since then, I was so overcome with depression and anxiety that I had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital and now here I am. Stale degree, not contacts, no real opportunities. This post for me has been a bit of a rant/pity show but I also want to give some advice to people still in school/looking for jobs. Do not give up like I did. Search carefully what industries are in your school area and see if they are hiring. Talking to alumni/professors and continue networking. I understand ChemE is a hot degree in some areas, but in other parts of the country the market is limited. I went through my 4 yrs with underwhelming achievements thinking I could get a job anywhere but now I am in this situation. Do not be like me. "

I'm an international pharmacy student.
I've been in United States for about 10 years under my mom with an F-2 visa from 2003 to 2011 and finally received my own F-1 in 2012.
Everything was going wonderful for me. I was getting good grades, had a girlfriend, and good friends. But everything came down on March of 2013.

I was getting a ride from my friend's friend to a university, and we were stopped by a sheriff. The driver was going 60 mph on the left lane and the sheriff decided to search the car because he smelled marijuana in the car. And he found alcohol in the driver's friend's bag. Based on the circumstances, sheriff decided to charge EVERYONE with underage possession of alcohol because we were all underage. We all attended the diversion class and had our cases dismissed.

I've already received my internship license. But I was wondering if this first degree misdemeanor would affect my chance of getting a job in United States since I'm also an international student.

Any response or input would be great!

Thank you!!

2iusta,15,2014-10-10,First post! My home renovation project 2014. would love to hear your comments and opinions!,hye4ever_13,HomeImprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/2iusta/first_post_my_home_renovation_project_2014_would/,"Hello redditors!

I have been following reddit for quite some time and I finally decided to make an account to post my very own first post! So take it easy on me!

For the past 10 months or so I have been rebuilding my parents house meanwhile juggling a full time internship for 6 of those months and summer school for 3 of those months. It has been quite the journey considering from where it all began and I must say I’m very pleased with the outcome. It goes to say how dedication, persistence and hard work are vital in creating a work of art. Although I have done small remodeling jobs in the past, this is my first major rebuild of a home.

Starting with the first floor:

The first floor was completely gutted along with the basement. Old walls were broken down and new walls were put up. The addition room had the sub-floor completely taken out and level with the rest of the house. New insulation and plywood sub-floor was installed. The rest of the sub-floor was screwed to get rid of all the squeaking in time for brand new red cherry hard wood floor with natural stain. The HVAC system was reworked by moving the boots away from the wall about 5 inches and returns were installed throughout the house. The old death trap of stairs into the basement were tore out and a custom stair was build (calling them steep is an understatement). New tile was installed in the foyer area to match the hardwood flooring and they are flush to the hardwood. (nice touch! Those T moldings are too tacky!).

2nd floor:

The existing flooring was ripped out and pre-finished hard wood flooring was installed. The entire house got a fresh new paint job along with crown molding and trim was installed. The master bathroom got ripped out and new plumbing was installed to relocate the drains and vents. The master bathroom is definitely one of my most impressive project in the entire house. Everything is brand new from the sub-floor to ceiling. The designs were modeled in CAD prior to the build to ensure there is enough room. The build was very time consuming and the tiling was very intricate to make sure all the trims lined up properly. Laying a custom shower bed pan was completely new and I was able to do it properly with the help of the internet and professional plumbers (to be honest, a professional most likely would not have done as good of a job since they just want to get paid). I made sure to measure and center all the tiles meanwhile minimizing waste (tiles are expensive!) The galvanized steel water pipes were ripped out and brand new copper piping was installed throughout the house from the main line along with a brand new water heater, expansion tank and an instant hot water pump. The electrical was converted to 200 amps with a brand new box and most of the wiring replaced. The existing wiring was done poorly and a 100amp sub-panel was installed alongside an existing 100 amp. I’m probably missing a lot more stuff that was done but I think I’ve covered the major renovations.

Back yard:

Built a fire pit, however a stone patio around it still need to be done. A large garden area was fenced out and first year’s tomatoes turn out great! Along with other herds, cucumbers, potatoes. A pond will be installed this summer with lighting and a waterfall. Flowers have already been planted and fruit trees are all healthy!

Projects still remaining:

1. Remodel the kitchen


2. Renovate 1st and 2nd floor bathrooms

3. Finish the basement furnished with a wet bar, projector movie theater and a billiards table. Also, cannot forget the stripper pole for those crazy late night parties.

Ideas for the backyard:

1. 2 story wood deck with a clear polycarbonate awning

2. 4 season room with hot tub and sauna

3. Outdoor movie theater (in the making already made a PVC projector screen stand)


I would love to hear your opinions on my home renovation project. The link to the video is below.

tl;dr: My first major home renovation project. I would love to read your opinions so leave a post to let me know what you think. I would also appreciate it if you share the video so my work can be seen around the world!

Thank you all for you time and I look forward to reading all of your comments! Like I said this is my very first post so try to be nice! Thanks again!"

**Request**: Access files on old Unix machine from internal work network without connecting it to the network.


**Idea**: - Connect Unix to Windows 7computer using possibly a crossover cable
* Use something like FTP to transfer files from Unix to Windows 7
* Transfer files from Windows 7 machine to internal network.


**Back story first**: So I'm a new intern at my workplace and I've been given the amazing challenge.
There is a really old Unix Machine that Security says by no means can it be connected to the internal network. (It's too old and it's a security hazard).
Now the idea that a coworker and I have come up with is to take a computer that is running Windows 7 with 2 network cards. 1 network card will be used to connect to the Unix machine and the other network card will be used to connect to the internal network.
The Unix machine already has a FTP server set up on it because my other coworkers were using Filezilla to access the files. Unfortunately now we can’t connect the Unix machine to the network.

**My Problem**: I don’t know what process or what specifics are needed to get 2 network cards to work correctly.

These issues show up frequently when I'm using OneNote. Basically, the screen acts as if there are 10 touch points being randomly activated in a vertical line about 1/3 of the way from the left across the screen. When this freakout happens, touch stops working all together until I restart the computer. Formatting and reinstalling windows from recovery did not resolve this issue. Has anyone seen this before? 

I'm upset because I *just* got my SP1 in August. It was not bought from a retailer, but it was actually purchased from a former Microsoft intern. It was sealed in box when I bought it. I'm concerned that if I brought it to a Microsoft store that they would not be able to help me.

Recent graduate,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2iv6r9/should_i_be_trying_to_get_a_job_im_overqualified/,"So I just graduated from UC Berkeley with an Environmental Economics degree and I try to place emphasis on looking for jobs where I can apply what I learned, namely econometrics. I haven't had much luck finding such jobs, and even worse is I am entry level and these jobs are requiring many years of experience.

I've looked for internships or easier positions just maybe in sales or finance where the only requirement is a degree, but then I have been told a few times or questioned, why am I applying for such a position, it seems to be under me as a UC Berkeley grad, and to go for these higher up positions instead.

Although I have been putting in the effort to finding jobs, I objectively think that I am not trying hard enough. I certainly am not doing this ""treat finding a job like a job, 9-5"". It's partly because I am not financially struggling as I live with my parents, and a bit of a slump since most of my days are spent in the house, half lazying about, half finding a job.

I've read here a few times just having a job would be more motivating and of course productive, but then if I find something, I feel as if I would settle into that and then when I get back from work I'd just want to do my hobbies as opposed to finding a more appropriate and better job. Additionally, I wouldn't be planning to stay with a low skilled job for very long, so I feel that poses its own problems.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially anything for a fresh graduate. I find myself relating to these posts, and it helps."

I include among the seventy-five studies showing positive effects only those with randomized, placebo-controlled designs published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Included are studies not only of the dual N-back task, as originally studied by Jaeggi and colleagues in their 2008 paper, but also other kinds of working-memory training, as well as other cognitive training programs, such as those designed by Michael Merzenich of Posit Science. In addition, I include among the seventy-five studies those that used mindfulness meditation, music training, and physical exercise. While only twenty-two of the positive studies found benefits for fluid intelligence per se, the remaining fifty-three studies all found other significant benefits on measures of attention, working memory, reading, or other important intellectual abilities. What all of these studies have in common is that they were relatively brief and straightforward and simple to implement, required no more than two to four hours of training per week, and reported statistically significant cognitive benefits. Here I present the fifty-three studies that showed benefits that did not include increased fluid intelligence; in the next note, I present the twenty-two additional studies that found benefits for fluid intelligence or reasoning.""

Just wondering about all of you ents out there that have IT jobs, working in an office, either programming or something behind a computer.  I have my Associate's Degree in Computer Information and Technology, and while I know degrees aren't that important compared to what you can actually do (I also have had an internship though and one certification), I still want to use it and get out of the $10 an hour job I have. I know with a degree I should be able to work at least in a nice office doing IT work of some sort.

But what about drug tests? I know some companies (like government related) can do hair tests, but do IT companies do? I had a friend who worked for one IT company and they did a hair follicle on her for 90 days, but I'm wondering if that's the norm, and if so, I guess that means I need to take a break? If not, can I just use my synthetic urine still?"

I'm currently an intern at a company doing web development, IT/server work and a little bit of marketing. There's only 2 IT workers and my boss will be helping set up and maintain a new location that's opening up. Leaving me to handle the HQ and sometimes shuttling between the two locations.

I want to ask for $22-25 but that's a significant increase in what I'm making right now. 

I'm wondering if this is a basis for a raise and if so how do I go about asking HR for it? Should I just be upfront and tell HR that with the opening of a new location I'll be handling a lot of my bosses previous work along with helping out the new location I think it deserves a raise?"
2iwbpp,4,2014-10-10,Old workplace I held sentiment with is getting outsourced. Is this the direction most departments are taking?,ITinternthrowaway,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2iwbpp/old_workplace_i_held_sentiment_with_is_getting/,"I used to intern at this marketing agency years ago that I enjoyed a lot before returning to school. Everyone in their IT staff is really sharp, and worked/played hard.  I've kept in touch with my director there for years. He and his team are great people and really skilled.

Now they are being replaced with managed services from a very large corporation. I have a piece of sentiment for that environment because it gave me a heart beat for this line of work. I'm sure everyone will land on their feet...but damn. From a stakeholder perspective...uh, good for you for saving money by cutting corners. From a support perspective, you're probably ruining a good thing.

Ironically, I just started with a tiny company that outsources IT for much smaller firms that are generally under 100 people. It's a nice (and stressful) trajectory since it allows me to use abilities beyond helpdesk/desktop. I wanted to stick with it for a year before finding something in-house, but I'm kind of worried I'll get outsourced too! Anyone else share/been through my predicament? 

**TL;DR:** Venting about old workplace's in-house IT getting outsourced, saddened by this because eventually I want to leave the stressful MSP I work for now for something in-house.

2iwrm2,109,2014-10-10,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend [22M] duration 1.5yrs, I got diagnosed with chronic illness, he freaked out and totally broke my trust",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2iwrm2/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_22m_duration_15yrs_i_got/,"Backstory: Isaac and I met last summer and have been dating for a year and a half.  He is currently working an internship about 2 hours away, so we generally see each other on the weekends.  We've both had pretty messed up relationships in the past, so there have been a lot of up and downs.  I had thought we were finally settling into a healthy, happy relationship, and then shit sorta hit the fan.


Starting about January of this year, I began having horrid, random flairs of massive joint swelling, fatigue, feeling sick but never totally getting better, and repeated infections of all kinds that didn't respond well to treatment.  We're talking, knees so swollen I could no longer walk up and down stairs and fingers so stiff I couldn't take notes in class.  Talk about terrifying for a 21-year-old.  At first, Isaac was super supportive and sweet, but over time began to get more and more frustrated with what was going on and started picking fights and generally being meaner and meaner. 


Some examples: **(1)** I was upset because I am a very active person and could no longer exercise or dance as much as usual.  He suggested swimming for my joints, and I had to explain that that wasn't logistically possible (gotta love dat student budget)... at which point he started screaming at me for being stubborn and not doing what was right and good for me.  **(2)** A lot of the infections were vaginal... meaning between that and joint pain, sex became incredibly uncomfortable for me.  I tried really hard to keep him happy (including daily blowjobs during visits), but he would start pressuring me and get angry over the lack of sex.  Eventually I would give in and sex would really hurt and I would start crying and then he would get frustrated because ""he felt like a horrible person but he was hungry and needed to feed""


Now, between these instances, he continued to be kind.  Listened to me cry and rant at all hours of the day, helped me up and down stairs, helped me pick up groceries, etc. So it's not all bad.


Finally, about two months ago, I was diagnosed with systemic lupus.  Honestly, I was incredibly relieved to finally -know- what was wrong with my body so I didn't feel quite so crazy.  Again, Isaac took the diagnosis well initially and held me while I cried and helped me research longterm options.  He started being more and more pushy and pressure-y about sex again though, and the pushiness and whining just made my (already low due to stress and chronic pain) libido disappear entirely.  I still tried to keep him happy, but it wasn't working.


He finally exploded at me one evening explaining that he had given up all his fun to be in a monogamous relationship with me, and getting into a monogamous relationship meant entering an agreement that if we were expecting each other to remain monogamous, we would keep each other fulfilled and happy.  While I agree to a degree with this sentiment, I was so tired and exhausted and in pain and just really needed a break and some patience.  Sex felt like a requirement and a chore, and that's just really not sexy.


I ended up in the hospital for a kidney failure scare all by myself a few weeks ago - my parents couldn't get work off, my roommates had class, and Adam was at his internship.  I left for what I thought would be a 30min doctor's visit... and ended up staying for close to 8 hours.  By the end, they had drawn 12 large vials of blood (and I am a pretty small person) and done two kidney biopsy punctures.  No one could pick me up, so I had to walk to the local train station to make it home.  I barely remember this walk or train ride, I was so out of it.  I got home and called Isaac in hysterics because I was so overwhelmed and exhausted and just wanted someone to listen and comfort me.  About 10 minutes into the phone call, he started sounding more and more agitated, so I asked what was wrong.  He responded that nothing he was saying was making me feel all better and he was too frustrated because he couldn't make it better.  **I ended up apologizing for being in a bad space.**  He then picked a fight over how I never stand up for myself, culminating in him yelling that if I would just stand up for myself, he wouldn't end up getting so angry at me.  Much confusion.


I was supposed to go visit him that weekend, but this fight triggered a pretty intense panic attack, so I ended up going to the emergency counseling service at my school.  The counselor stayed after hours to talk with me because she was so worried about my mental state and essentially told me I deserved better and should leave.  I ended up missing my train to stay with the counselor, and called Isaac when I got out.  I was so tired and fed up that I just let everything out and called him out on how he'd been treating me and that I felt sick at the thought of even visiting him that weekend.


He responded by... apologizing.  He said he hadn't realized just how bad the lupus was and had gotten so caught up in his own wants and selfishness that he had totally dropped the ball.  He called it the biggest mistake he's ever made.  After some long talking (and him driving out to see me before I left to go stay with family and recover), he agreed to get counseling for his issues surrounding sex (feeling entitled, needing it, getting angry when I said no) and also his resentment and response to my diagnosis.


Which leads us to now.  Things are... ok.  He's trying really, really hard, and I can see that.  We've totally stopped having sex for now and he's allowing me to approach it when and how I want so that I feel safe (although he's slipped and gotten upset a few times, but always apologized).  I guess my question is, how the hell do I even begin to build that trust back up?  Sex makes me incredibly anxious.  I feel awkward cuddling.  I'm still nervous about seeing him, and where I once very much wanted to move in with him, I now feel sick at the thought.  I won't always be healthy- what if this selfishness is how he responds the next time something shitty happens and I need support?


I think my friend said it best: ""it sounds like at a time of your greatest need of support and care, you got the exact opposite""


I don't know what to do.  Should I just break it off now?  Is there any way for that foundation of love and trust to be rebuilt?  Is it too fundamentally broken at this point?


I still care about him a lot, but I'm not sure I still love him.  I'm angry and resent how he responded and treated me when I needed support most.  I don't know what to do.


If you made it through all that-thank you.  I appreciate it, a lot, and look forward to any guidance or advice you can give.

---   
**tl;dr**: I have the lupus, boyfriend picks fights on my worst pain days and pressures me into sex/guilts me about being monogamous despite chronic pain/illness and resentment. Has now apologized and is trying to make up for it, but I'm struggling to feel anything towards him or even begin to trust him again.  Is it worth working on or should I just leave?"

What's the reputation of the program like? I've heard reviews saying it's just like any other CS masters, and reviews saying it's more like a CC. What about the campus providing housing for graduate students? I read about the off-campus graduate housing program and those apartments look pretty great online, what are they actually like? Anyone have any stories? Are the higher level courses taught in a specific language, or is it more of a ""language of your choice"" kind of deal?

Sounded like a good idea at the time. Lot of fun classes. Graduated with a 3.8 GPA and approximately 0 job skills.  Been working customer service and some front end design for a web company for a few years now.  Decided to try and break into actual development.  Been auditing CS classes through my Alma Mater (online) plus the whole Treehouse/Coursera/Udacity thing.

Been thinking more and more about trying to get an internship. Something to get me real hands on experience somewhere, to make up for my lack of actual on-paper CS degree.  So, two questions:

I'm pretty open to taking anything anywhere. Long hours for low pay, to get the actual experience. Relocation isn't a big deal, even if it's just temporary.

1: Is this even a good idea? Is it feasible? Is being technically enrolled IN school a requirement for an internship?

2: Where's the best place to find internships, beyond checking the carrers section of the websites of tech companies? Is there a Monster.com for dev internships, perhaps?

3: I'd probably feasibly shoot for internships for next summer (I'm assuming most internships are over the summer). What's the typical deadline for applying for those? Coming up soon, or do I have some time to keep adding to my GitHub?"

So, I recently interned with a middle-sized company, and extended my offer into full-time work afterwards. As a bit of background, I spent most of my internship building a large module, but have had an incredible amount of (mostly political) difficulty getting it merged back into the main code base.

Shortly after making the transition from intern to full-timer, I was quietly moved to another team - I myself didn't find out about it until I was required to show up at daily scrum meetings. I was then approached by a few project managers, who were almost hostile in their opposition to me continuing work on my previous project. 

Since then, I've been sort of pressured into abandoning my work to take on their backlog of bugs. This involves learning an entirely different stack, setting up new dev environments, etc. What's more, there is absolutely no direction given - I'm just pointed to a nebulous blob of tickets, and told that I should find something to fix. 

Since the issue tracking system is very poorly managed, there's no indication as to what issues are important, which I could feasibly contribute to, or even which are still unsolved. The first bug I worked on was closed as ""fixed"", even though I was able to perfectly reproduce the bug on production. Another issue was a duplicate of someone else's. I was able to push a fix to a third, but was met with disapproval because it wasn't one of the ""right"" issues to work on.

At this point, I'm feeling pressured at every single meeting to divine what's ""important"". What's more, I'm also told asked almost daily if I will give up on my 4 month long project and close out the ticket, and publicly embarrassed when if I say no.

I know this may sound a bit rant-y and specific, but my question is - how much of this is normal? I feel like I'm being pushed from dev work to QA/QE, which is not a career I want.

2ixp35,1,2014-10-11,"I [21M] have been in a Long Distance Relationship with my gf [21F] for 3 years, and things are getting a little shaky...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ixp35/i_21m_have_been_in_a_long_distance_relationship/,"Hi /r/relationships, throwaway account here. And sorry in advance for the insanely long post...

My gf, lets call her 'Alice', and I, are based in the UK, and started out back in May 2011, when I was 18 and she was 17. We were each others' first everything. And the relationship was amazing. We took things slowly to begin with, but over the few months that we were spending practically every day together, we completely and utterly fell for each other (me first, then her shortly afterwards).

We were starting out in separate universities in late September, and were going to begin our long distance relationship. We of course made plans right away to see each other as much as we could (physical visits every couple of weeks), skype calls, texting etc... 

First year was pretty good (other than when we had to say goodbye each time, which was awful and always ended in tears.... mostly from her). Our sex life was fantastic, as soon as we would see each other, and got back to one of our rooms, we were all over each other. We were experimenting a little too and were completely comfortable in each others' company. We did stuff over skype, and we even sometimes left skype on overnight with a dim lamp on in each of our rooms, and our own microphones muted, so it felt like we were ""sleeping next to each other"". If either of us woke up during the night (and skype hadn't kindly disconnected), we would be able to see the other person sleeping (a bit creepy i know), and when one of us woke up in the morning, we could choose to wake the other person up with our voice, and see each other and talk before going to studies...

During the first year, Alice had a bit of difficulty coping at university, and some of her flatmates were a little shitty... Anyway, difficulties like this, and with studies, and with being away form me (I guess) led to depression and anxiety. She started on citalopram about 1/3 of the way through the year, and things started to get better for her. And of course... this pill comes with the side-effect of a decreased sex drive... so we were not looking forward to that, but to be honest it didn't effect her too much during the first year.

It became quite apparent that we really wanted to spend the rest of our lives together, we would talk about the future frequently, talk about how, after Uni, we would move in, eventually get married, eventually have kids etc... we ""just had to get through these 3 years, and then work out what we're doing afterwards"".

After our first year, during the summer, she was feeling happier, and decided to come off citalopram. We went away on holiday to france for 2 weeks, with my family, as she was decreasing her dosage... and I have to say those two weeks were amazing, the most intimate I had been with her for a while, and it was incredible seeing her for such a long amount of time. Her sex drive increased, and our sex on that holiday was great.

Second year starts, and with uni and distance again comes depression and anxiety. She starts citalopram again; it has less of an immediate positive effect. This year was still good-ish, but the amount that we were doing sexual stuff had decreased dramatically, we were no longer at it like rabbits each time we saw each other in real life, we had decreased the amount of ""skype stuff"" we did, both sexual and just talking, and she rarely masturbated (although when she did she of course thought of me). Although we had a couple of ""blips"" at times, when we didn't really know what we were feeling about each other, each time we pretty quickly realised those feelings again, and still felt completely in love, with just a desire to be out the other side. ""only 2 years, then everything will be fine"".

During the summer of second year, i had an internship and she had a job for the majority of it, we were only about half as far apart as when compared to term time (at uni), but we were still in a LDR, and definitely didn't see as much of each other as we would have liked to...

Third year, and sexually and emotionally, things are slower still. I would go up and see her for a weekend, or she would come down, and we would do something sexual maybe 0-1 times over the course of maybe 3 nights. skype sex stuff ground to a complete halt, and we were generally skyping less anyway. She didn't masturbate or anything at all this year.

Over this year, we both decided that we wanted to do a masters', which meant an additional year for both of us, so 4 total.

Anyway we get out of third year, still in a relationship, still ""good"", and start this next summer (the one just gone). I have yet another internship, but she wasn't working or anything, so again we don't see much of each other. At the start of the summer, she begins to feel a little numb regarding us, she feels she is loosing feelings for me, and it really eats away at her. Our sex life completely grinds to a halt (it pretty much had by the end of the 3rd year anyway).

She decides to stop citalopram again, she said ""because she is feeling better and doesn't want to be on it forever"". She may have convinced herself that was the case, but it later came out she did this only because she wanted her sex drive back, hoping other ""in love"" feelings would come back.

During the summer, directly after my internship, and just before we both start our masters  year, i go away on holiday with my family somewhere hot for 2 weeks, and she (and some of my other family who she flew with) stay for just 1 week, due to time constraint. It was the first time in a very long while that we were going to be able to have a completely uninterrupted, un-fragmented week together.

We didn't do anything sexual once... We saw each other naked, getting dressed etc (like we'd grown accustomed to), we even showered together, but nothing sexual came of it. We had a couple of ""chats"", mostly about her reduced sex drive. I was definitely of the impression that because we were on holiday, she was feeling pressured that we NEEDED to do something sexual, and be back to how we were, and this was making her put up a big brick wall regarding the whole thing. it was a pretty bad holiday in this regard...

fast forward to now, back in the UK, just before my term begins (hers already has, about a week ahead of mine), and skype calls me, in a state. She says she is ""struggling"", we talk lots, we skype, we cry.

At this stage we are best friends, we have been best friends among all the other stuff for years, and we truely love each other very much. But she is confused about her own feelings... about a week ago she, for lack of a more appropriately romantic phrase, ""looked after herself"" after she found herself in the mood once after waking up. She thought of me, having proper loving sex, and she enjoyed it, and felt closer to me. As the day went on these feelings subsided...

Yesterday, she took a train home, and drove down to my uni (we both live not very far from where I study). We talked lots, and cried lots. Her, ultimately thinking (for the past week) that the best course of action is to break up, but also having conflicting feelings in the other direction too.

One of the biggest difficulties has come with trying to work out where to draw all the lines, are we still allowed to hug, where abouts can i kiss her, on her forehead? on her cheek? do we hold hands? can we think about each other when we ""look after ourselves""? do we still visit each other?

There were a couple of points where we were hugging, and had our faces really close to each other, sort of, rubbing our faces against each other, comforting... where we would then usually naturally just kiss, and it was really difficult for me not to, but I didn't. And at one point when I didn't she burst into tears.

Another point when we were trying to work out boundaries, and said that kissing on the cheek is fine, and we were hugging, we kissed each other on the cheek... maybe a little too close to the mouth, but she broke down again...

this also happened again later on when i kissed her on the cheek again...

I mean, she wants to be able to hug me, she feels comfortable naked infront of me still, she likes the thought of my touching her legs, and spooning in bed when we go to sleep, hugging her, and holding her boobs or her stomach, again she finds it comforting, she just has no sexual desire, and doesn't feel ""in love"" any more.

Ultimately, whatever happens, we are still each others' best friends, and we will remain in contact... and we will be helping each other through each others' problems. But we both just **REALLY WISH** everything was back to how it was 1st year...

I completely believe that had we been in a ""normal"" relationship, and not long distance, we would be better than amazing right now, probably even in our own place and who knows... I'm blaming uni right now...

We're so lost reddit... we don't know where to draw the lines.. . we don't know how much we should see each other, contact each other... anything...

please help.

**tl;dr**: We've been going out for 3 years, all the while at university, a few hours train ride apart. Sex life has been diminishing, (particularly over last 2 years), and gf is worried her ""in love"" feelings are disappearing... what do we do?"

I may as well put it all out there. I'm about to graduate college and it's taken me over 5 years. I have an average GPA and no relationships with my professors.

It's very hard to come to terms with why I've skipped hundreds of classes over the years and why I've never spoken to my professors. I think it was because I thought I was going to kill myself before graduating college.

I'm doing an internship in a department full of people with PhDs and people keep asking me what my plans are, with the expectation that I'm going to graduate school. It's embarrassing to keep telling them that I'm not. It's embarrassing to think that these people, who are very accomplished and went to the best schools, saw my shitty GPA from a shitty state school. I don't belong there.

It's hard because I know I could have done so much better. I could have gotten into a much better school for undergrad, but I only applied to one school that was close to home. I really want to go to grad school, but I will never get in with no letters of recommendation and no research. I know I am smart and I know I could have done it, but now it is too late. 

It's very hard to accept that this is the end of the road. I just did a quick job search today and almost had a panic attack because everything wants graduate degrees or years of experience. I don't think I will be able to survive searching for a job.

I can't understand why I did this to myself. I could have gotten treatment years ago and I would have led a normal life. There is no point anymore."

I really don't want to get there, because I fear I would be stuck, having little time and energy to study/practice programming and hardly getting more employable.

Can you help me to find a path that would get me a job or internship within one year considering the following skills?

- I'm a years long linux user (debian and archlinux), accustomed with command line and run some personal server with it.
- I'm learning C++, I'm at chapter 13 of C++ Primer 5th, so this mean I covered most of the basic. I also made a simple 2d game with C++ and SDL.
- Last year I learnt basic python.

But I'm open to learn other languages and tools if they are better suited to achieve my goal. 
Also: I live in Italy but would be ready to move anywhere in northern Europe.

Turns out they were really important in the eyes of a program director.

I've been able to secure a few rotations in the US by coordinating with the administration of my school. But now, I have a few more questions.

Medical school education in my country is different from the US curriculum. We have a 5-year course but we are considered graduates after the 4th year. The last year is spent as an interns before we're able to take the board exam for Medicine. 

1. **Up to how long are my LORs valid when uploaded to ERAS?** I plan to take the board exams here in my country so I would be sending in my application one to two years after my graduation. Other IMGs skip the internship process and apply directly to a US-based residency so this isn't a problem for them.

2. **Would it be detrimental as an applicant if I'm not a fresh graduate anymore?** However, can this be offset by having clinical experience as the reason for the delay? The 5th year of internship is required by law for board examiners in my country."

I'm not a native speaker. Usually I only lurk around, so I'm not used to posting, but I have never feld this unhappy before. I'm studying media management and currently in my 6th semester, so there's two more to go till I have my bachelor's degree. The thing is: I hate it. By now it's pretty much everything I stand against. 

The last 2-3 years I noticed that my absolute passion was illustration. Last semester I did an internship in an advertising agency 500 miles away in a city at the other end of the country. 

I hated the internship also, but afterwards I stayed for 3 more months during holidays and rented a studio space to focus on my illustration and make a portfolio for an application for art school in the same city. Also, I met a girl while I was there and we started dating there. We told each other that we had feelings for each other and now that I left we still talk everyday and I'm even planning on visiting her next week, we're looking forward to it very much.

But I hate school and my life in this city so much. The last 3-4 months were the best I had probably my whole life. I did what I loved and I had a great girl by my side. A few days ago, I got a letter from the art school I gave my portfolio to. I'm invited to the next round of tests and there's a real chance that I could get in. But there's still a month till the test and also by now, I kind of think I want to go there anyway, whether I get accepted or not. I don't think it would be great but I could bartend until I get accepted, so it wouldn't be impossible. But I'm also in my 6th semester now.. 

I know that I definitely don't want to work in media management or anything related, but I'm still so scared to let it go this late. Also, I'm scared that a move this big might pressure the girl away from me although I definitely wouldn't do it ""only for her."" I'd planned on moving to the city if I get accepted anyway.. I'm just so unhappy and don't know what to do.. 

Any thoughts?

Also, if you need any more information to form an opinion, go ahead and ask. I'm 22, btw.

Thanks for any answers and sorry for the long post."
2iym3m,0,2014-10-11,Bit of a dilemma over here.,wagerpascal,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2iym3m/bit_of_a_dilemma_over_here/,"Hey all, been a lurker for a while now. I'm stuck in a bit of a conundrum here, and would really appreciate any advice/thoughts on my situation. Also, sorry about the super long writeup, I've been thinking about this for quite some time now.

I am currently a junior at a reasonably good public school studying biomedical engineering, but the program is the first engineering-related program that the school has had for a LONG time (apparently the last time my school has had an engineering program was in the '20's, and so we don't have ANY ties to mechE or EE departments). The reason why I'm in this program was because I didn't initially plan on doing BME; I first entered college thinking that I would do genetic engineering, but slowly moved away from bio/chem things and towards technical stuff. Mind you, we are currently NOT ABET-accredited, but the department says that my year will be retroactively accredited. My GPA is okay, around a 3.2 (taking organic chemistry was a terrible misstep on my part)

For BME here, we typically aren't taking very engineery classes until Junior year (although I have taken statics and matsci last year). So here's the thing: I'm taking electronics this semester (as everyone in my program does), and to be honest, I'm enjoying it. While I'm not doing the best with the conceptual material, I find it a lot easier to understand and figure out on my own than other classes. Building circuits in the lab has actually been fairly enjoyable as well, and I'm not sitting around cursing at myself when I'm in the lab at midnight or by myself. I honestly am starting to think that electronics is my thing; I haven't felt this way about any class for a long, long time. 

As of this year, I'm also spending considerable amounts of time at a somewhat nearby school with a solid engineering program doing BME research (believe me, at this point, I would switch to EE research if I could), and I'm getting back in touch with friends that go to that school that are also doing engineering. I recently went to a engineering career fair at that school (since no engineering company wants to come over to my school's career fairs), and I ended up talking to far more electrical engineering companies about internships and co-ops than BME companies. Might even land something for next semester :D

I've taken all the more EE- electives (which is only really one- microcontrollers) that my school has to offer, and am not interested in the rest of the electives. My three close BME friends are also planning/considering to leave the field for greener pastures. I've tried everything that I could for BME (research, genetic engineering, etc.) that my school could offer, and I'm starting to feel more and more isolated from this university in more ways than one. All my projects besides research are electronics-related. I honestly am getting very sick and tired of BME, and especially the reactions that recruiters often make when I mention that; it always feels like an uphill battle just to get to the same point that a mechE and EE major is already at without any work. Honestly, I don't have very much to gain from hanging around anymore, and I'm considering transferring to the university that I do research at (apparently the EE transfer requirements aren't as strict as some of the other fields). But I'm so close to finishing, as I just need two more classes after the end of this year. Should I take the jump, switch, and use two years to transfer and finish a degree in EE (which is what my EE friends have estimated would probably take me to get through)? Or should I just grit my teeth and ride it out at this point?"

I was previously a Computer Science major but due to some extenuating circumstances I had to switch to an online software engineering program that my school offered. Those circumstances have now changed and I can go back to on campus. Only problem is I just started an internship with a government agency up where I live. I'm loving the internship so far.     




    
    
The online classes are 7.5 weeks compared to the 15 weeks with the on campus courses. Some very important classes are coming up such as Discrete math and Data structures and algorithms and I think it would be very beneficial to go back to campus. Is it worth giving up the internship to move and switch back to CS?I am at the halfway point in my degree. Would love any input you guys have.

2iyxud,10,2014-10-11,My partner [21M] doesn't seem to want to make time for me [22M],wetterdew,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2iyxud/my_partner_21m_doesnt_seem_to_want_to_make_time/,"He and I met online in April, and hung out for a week before I left for a summer internship in another state.  We got along really well and it felt amazing being together.  When I was away, we texted, phoned, and Skyped often, and we both felt like our relationship was growing stronger.

Then when I came back three months later in late August, we were so excited to see each other again.  But when I slept at his house on my second day back home, things seemed to turn around.  He had a sort of panic attack that night where he felt uncomfortable with another person being in his bed (first time it had happened for him; no sex, just cuddling and sleeping in the same bed).  After that he told me he was uncomfortable and wanted to take things more slowly, and that we weren't in a relationship, but that he definitely wanted to try dating me.  He said he wasn't sure if his feelings for me were more than sexual--he didn't know if he actually liked me as a romantic partner.  That really hurt.

I know that we both felt very strong romantic and sexual feelings for each other that only grew stronger over the summer until I returned.  At the end of the summer, he'd said he's never felt so strongly for another person the way he did for me.  He said he couldn't wait to introduce me to his family.  So it was a shock that his attitude changed so quickly.

I was very anxious for a while because for a week or two after he'd told me he was feeling bad about it, we didn't see each other.  I could tell through our texts that he had become a bit more distant.  He didn't send ""good morning"" texts any more, and he didn't reciprocate when I told him I missed him.  But eventually we met up again and it was great: we both got along fantastically and felt so at ease with each other.  We went on our first official date and everything went well.  He started sending texts again saying that he missed me.  I was relieved and so happy that things seemed back on track.

He still is hesitant: he still won't call us boyfriends or this a relationship.  That's okay with me, but the problem is that he also seems to not make much time to see me.  It feels like he's not as excited about the idea of seeing me as he used to be, even though we get along so well when we *are* together.

He never asks when I can see him, it's always the other way around.  I understand that he's at college and I'm not, so I have much more free time than he does.  But even at college he should be able to make time at least once or twice a week to see the person he's dating.  Last time I saw him was very briefly a week or two ago.  When we see each other, it's at his apartment, where we cuddle, make out, and sometimes watch TV.

Possible problems?  I think we should do more than just hang out at his apartment and make out.  I want to go out on dates to go to places.  I want to go to a corn maze, go and carve pumpkins, see movies together, go to restaurants, and stuff like that.  I want to meet his friends, and I want him to meet mine.  He's said he wants to do that stuff too, but he seems to not have time for it. :(

The past two weeks have been hard because we really haven't seen each other at all.  A few days ago he apologized for being so distant.  I'm the first person he's really dated (same for me) and he said he was missing me.  Said we definitely had to meet this weekend.  Unfortunately he got sick and we couldn't meet up, and he also has a lot of work.  He says he probably will be booked next weekend, too.  I don't think I can be in a relationship where I see him so rarely.  I think about him so much, but it's enveloped in a sense of doubt about whether he actually wants to be with me.  I hate this roller coaster of feeling happy when he tells me he likes me, and then feeling horrible and self-doubting when he doesn't make time for me and becomes distant.  I can't tell if he doesn't want me or if he's just bad at dating (it is his first time, mine too).

**So, what to do.**  He just told me this morning he probably can't see me this weekend *or* next weekend.  I think I have to tell him that I can't date somebody where we see each other so rarely.  I want to tell him how it makes me doubt whether he likes me.  Makes me so anxious not knowing.  I know we get along well when we get the chance.  But we don't get enough chances.  I might just ask him whether he actually wants to keep dating.  I want him to be honest.  If he wants to keep dating, then I want him to promise to make more time for me.  Otherwise, we have to stop.

----

--We get along really well, especially when together.  It feels like we're perfect for each other

--We're really attracted to each other

--He's told me he really wants to date me, show me to his parents, and more.  Wants me to take his virginity, also

--We had a magical start to our relationship and felt like it only grew stronger over the summer even though I was away and we could only text/Skype

But, ever since I got back home...

--He almost never asks to see me; it's always the other way around

--He doesn't seem to have time to see me very much.  It's been about once a week, sometimes not at all.  And that's just for me to visit his place for a couple hours and hang out.  Not like a huge date.

--I can tell through his texts that he seems less excited to talk to me.  Could be that he's distracted now that he's back in college.

--Today, he told me he can't see me this weekend and probably won't be able to next weekend, either.

**tl;dr: We had a great start to our relationship, which blossomed over a summer spent apart as we skyped regularly.  When I got back, he suddenly became distant and didn't make as much time for me even though we still have great fun when we *do* see each other.  I like him a lot, but I feel like the effort is only going one way, and I'm trying to decide how to tell him.  What should I tell him?  My goal would be for him to agree to put more effort into seeing me more often, but if he isn't truly willing, to be honest and tell me he doesn't want to date any more.  I just have to tell him how I'm feeling.  Thoughts?**"

* This is my first serious girlfriend.
* We lived together for 11 months
* Everything was fine up until the 6 month mark
* I was VERY insecure about myself and what I was doing with my life because we were living in a place I never wanted to be in. (Small-ish town)
* She cooked for me almost every night she could.
* She was very loving and always asking me to go out with her. I usually refused because I didn't feel like it. I later found out that it was because of my depression.
* We had sex, a lot. There was nothing wrong with that.
* Overall, she was a very good girlfriend.
* She was not the reason I was depressed, it was because I felt like I was going nowhere.
* Her back hurt every once and a while because of something called a Pars defect. Her L5 and S1 aren't fused together correctly. But nothing too serious.
* She was making $1,200 to $1,400 a month while serving. And so was I.
* We didn't fight very much, until the end.

We broke up because I blew up about not getting food when I came home. Yes, I know it's the dumbest thing I've ever done.

2 Months go by, and we get back together.

When we got back together, I told her that I was wrong to be so angry at her for some food and that I should be trying to socialize with people more. During those 2 months I cried almost every night (at least 4-5 times a week). I desperately worked on my social skills and making sure I could keep myself fed and healthy without anyone's help. I never wanted to feel dependent on her for something that small. I started drinking fresh veggie juice and I felt amazing, physically. It wasn't that hard, actually. I realized I have been doing it for a long time now.

When we got back together, we moved back to our hometown area (we grew up about 45 minutes away from eachother). Which helped me so much. I realized how I needed to achieve my goals and I got back in touch with some old friends. We didn't fight about anything for a long time.

We are now living with her mother rent-free. We're back in the room and town where she grew up. Her mother doesn't have to pay rent, water or electric. Just cable. So it's a sweet deal. How this is possible is not important.


Here's how our relationship is now:

* She rarely cooks for me. But I understand why.
* Our sex life is pretty bad. We only seem to have good sex after a fight. I also, understand because of her back.
* Her back is in pain 100% of the time. Not always a 10, but usually a 5-9. We have seen multiple spine specialist and we are on our way to surgery. She's been in this pain almost ever since we moved here, which was 5 months ago. I can't imagine what she's going through and I tears me up inside to see her like this, while being helpless.
* She took a new job in education. She's a special education major and wants to help severe and profound students. She makes $400 a month now. Her car and insurance are around $500. So I'm helping her with bills as I'm still making $1,200+ and only have to pay around $160 a month in bills plus gas money. The main reason she took this job was because she will get a guaranteed internship when she gets her B.S.
* I serve at a restaurant all day, and serve her when I get home because she is usually down by the end of the day. Which I am perfectly happy to do. By serve, I mean she's in bed, and I cook her food and bring her anything she needs. The only thing she does by herself is go to the bathroom or shower. This may sound like heaven for her, but remember, even in bed she is in pain. You would think that after doing it all day that I would be tired of it, but It's actually much nicer to serve someone you love. That being said, sometimes I am very tired and It gets to me, but I try to make sure I don't damage anything in our relationship because of it.
* I hang out with her and our friends a LOT more than I used to and I really do enjoy them. But sometimes I just want time alone with her. She spends most of her time with her friends when I'm at work but she's always gets upset when I ask her to just relax and stay home with me on my days off. She says she doesn't want to stay in the house, which is understandable given the fact that she feels like she might be stuck in bed for a long time after surgery. I tell her all the time that I feel like I'm being worked too hard but she doesn't budge and says ""we always spend our time in bed"". Which is true, we usually do because I'm usually tired. But it's also true because most of the time we spend together is before bed at night and in the morning while waking up. SHE spends a lot more time in bed than I do because of her back and she sleeps like 2-3 hours more than I do. I usually get breakfast ready in that time.
* She wants to get her nails done and toes done almost twice a month. Which can cost from $25 to $50. She wants to smoke weed almost every day (we both do, I don't look down upon her for it, however she smokes much more than me because of her back), which can cost up to $15 a day. She likes to drive around a lot, which kills her gas tank. I want her to do all these things because, I mean come on, she's in constant pain. But it's still putting a strain on me because I'm trying to save up enough money for us to move into our own place. And sometimes I think she doesn't think about the future and just lives in the present.
* She feels like we fight 80% of the time we are together. Now, it's important to know how much time we actually spend together. She works Mon-Fri from 2pm to 6:30pm and has weekends off. She also is going to classes Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9am to 12:30pm. I don't go to classes because I'm taking the semester off to work more. I don't have a set schedule, but I usually work Monday or Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday. And sometimes I get scheduled friday night. I did the math and we get on average 30 hours together. I get scheduled nights most of the time, so I go in around 4:30 and don't get home until 10 or 11. On weekends, It's more like 12. Most of our fights start over some bullshit. For example, today I made pancakes for breakfast. I usually cook the pancakes very medium-well ish. They are super soft and are cooked all the way through (to me). She tells me today that she wants them well done. Like bread. But for some reason she couldn't figure out how to tell me, she just kept saying ""cook them all the way"" and I didn't know what to do differently, as I always cook them all the way. So she got angry and started being mean before she finally said ""Like bread!"". Which was a perfect way to tell me how to cook it. The whole time I was just trying to find out how she liked them so that she could have a perfect breakfast. Not a lot of things can be perfect, but dammit I can make the breakfast perfect. She had already planned to spend the day with her best friend and was leaving and said ""why do I even try with you? you always make me the bad guy"". She was referring to me calling her mean because she got so angry at me so fast. Almost every other fight is because of bad communication or a misunderstanding, like this one. I always tell her, we don't need to break up because of this. We just need to stay calm and focus on what the other person needs. All I need is a straightforward answer, calmly. I can't stand someone yelling at me for something this small. But she has such a hard time doing that. The only reason I can think of is because of her situation.

Sorry about that wall.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like she is so quick to give up our relationship after some silly argument that didn't need to happen in the first place. I feel like she's immature and doesn't understand what a long term relationship takes. I feel like she's insecure about herself no matter what I tell her. Most arguments consist of me saying ""babe, it's okay. Can we just talk calmly?"" and her saying ""No, because you aren't listening."" I used to think I had a listening problem, but she said that shit today about the pancakes. Even If i'm not listening well, how is yelling at me going to help? I'm just trying to make US work.

How do I get her to talk calmly about these things when she's so stressed out in the first place? I feel like I'm stuck.

I just need some advice. How can I prevent these silly fights?

---   
**tl;dr**: She thinks we are fighting too much and wants to give up most of the time. She is in constant pain because of her back. She took a job more suited to her long term goals but also took a pay cut. She says most of the time she's unhappy because her back hurts, she doesn't have much money, and it feels like she's fighting with her boyfriend all the time. I'm doing everything in my power to help her but it doesn't seem like it's ever enough."

Also I realise this may be a bit of a common/generic problem, so Im appreciative of anyone that would read this and give an honest response.

In the summer I went on a working holiday with a bunch of other interns. We got close and at the time I had a girlfriend, while out there I knew my relationship (of two years) wasn't going to work and I really liked this girl I'll call Emily. For this reason I didnt want to get too flirty for the sake of my girlfriend but knew Emily was my type completely. By the end of the summer away people knew I was going to break up with my girlfriend and our mutual best friend while out there really wanted us to get together when we all got home.

Fast forward till we get home (broken up with my girlfriend at this point) and this mutual friend has told me she knows for sure Emily likes me. So when we all get home me and Emily hang out. She invites me to go to two gigs with her, inviting me ahead of everyone else and paying for my ticket. We get on *so so* well. We end up booking flights to see our mutual best friend and plan a couple more days out together again. 

So we go out, get drunk and at the end of the night I go for the kiss and she dodges it, ignores me and we walk to the afterparty. I ask can we clarify this etc. In her drunken stupor she kind of does, says she's still hung up on a guy from our working holiday, we're just friends and I ask for a clear yes or no, is she attracted to me. She says no. Heartbroken - obviously. That seems to the end of that. My mutual friend tells me sorry and that Emily is worried we wont be friends anymore. I kind of tell her we wont be as close, cant drink together etc. 

Fast forward to us going to see the mutual friend, we get on great, sleep in the same bed and sort of cuddle all night. On the flight home it felt weird, but good weird. We end up texting the next day and I ask why she didnt go out with the guy that was all over her at the party. This is how the convo goes after she says she didnt wanna go out with anyone that night

**Emily**: it's pretentious to say it that way, i just didn't like him like that

**Me**: Awwh, I should have gave him a empathy-hug, start a club 

**Emily**: oh shut up smart arse lol you just hada dose of drunken horny

**Me**: Nah i think dutch courage is the right term but aye whatever ya feel comfortable with :L

**Emily**: oh. well in my defence you sorta took me by surprise :L 

**Me**: Not your preferred approach? :L. 

**Emily**: Just bad timing. lol

**Me**: Fs, lemme know if theres a better timing then :L.

**Emily**: oh aye i'll just shout ""now"" lol 

**Me**: You mean that isnt the way it works? 

**Emily**: you're such a MALE lol

But now since we got home we've just been talking more normal less flirty, largely cause we're both stressed with uni. I should have continued to be flirty I guess. But what am I suppose to do now. Just sort of stuck because I dont wanna straight up say to her 'Listen I still like you' and her say 'we went over this' and i dont wanna get too friendy and ruin the chance of going with her. As an aside, I know neither of us could get into a relationship, we've both said that, but I think we'd both be keen for just seeing what happens if we did get together. Iono. I appreciate any responses anyway.

**TL;DR** I fell for a girl I've became really close friends with. I tried to kiss her. She rejected it, but she's suggested it was bad timing. Dont wanna get even more comfortable as friends to take the spark away further."
2izdfj,4,2014-10-11,In response to a 19-year-old redditor feeling overwhelmed,EntropyDream,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/2izdfj/in_response_to_a_19yearold_redditor_feeling/,"There was a thread in new posted by a 19-year-old feeling overwhelmed by the transition into college and adulthood, asking if anyone was in a similar boat. 

In writing it, in putting all these ideas into words, I learned a lot about my path through life these last few years.

The thread was deleted before I finished writing my response, so I thought I'd share anyway. Maybe there are some like minds out there.

---

I graduated college in May, so I am in a somewhat similar position. About two months ago, I started a job, marking the official beginning of my career. The transition from college to ""real life"", much like the transition from high school to college is sobering. After each of these transitions, it suddenly feels like your decisions matter more, like everything before was just preparation.

In a sense, it's true. At each transition, you suddenly have both more freedom and more self-responsibility. You have less supervision in college than you did in high school. I mean supervision in several senses. Your parents control your personal life much less. Your instructors are much less interested in your personal academic success (which isn't the same as being worse instructors, it's just a different kind of relationship). It forces you to step up to the plate.

Graduating from college is very similar. My parents haven't had much control over my life for years, so I'm used to that, better prepared. But now there's very little structure guiding my career. In college, which was really a part of my career, I had a program to complete. I knew exactly what doing well looked like, and achievement was pretty straight forward. It wasn't always easy, but it was simple. The problem was well-defined.

Success in your career is not as well-defined. Or at least not in mine. I don't know exactly where I want to end up, and I certainly don't know the best way to get there. As a naturally introspective person, I imagine that I have a better idea than most of what my goals are, but there is no clear path to getting there. In my field, reaching the level of achievement that I want to reach requires doing a lot of work not directly related to my actual job. It's very reminiscent of the feeling of there always being studying or extracurriculars I could be doing.

But I don't feel overwhelmed. What I've come to realize, as you will, is that while your choices and actions now are more important than ever before, they come at you as a steady stream of small events each with very little effect on the greater trajectory of your life.

You'll have a few big decisions to make. What major should you pursue? Should you take this internship or that one? But those big decisions won't hit you all at once, and you'll usually have weeks or months to think about them. It can be nerve-wracking at the time, but you'll figure it out, and in the aggregate, you'll make good decisions. It's what humans do.

What is much more important than any single big decision is how you handle the constant stream of small decisions. I'm 22 years old, so definitely not some wise sage, but I can share what I've found helpful. You sound similar enough to me that it might be helpful for you too.

Try to build an integrative, consistent life. Try to build interests, take up hobbies, adopt philosophies, make friends and even develop personality characteristics that all work together. Allow me to explain.

What do you love doing? What are your favorite things to think about? What do you like most about yourself? What do you like most in other people? You probably don't know the whole answers to all of these questions, and that's okay. Just think about them, and try to notice when you're getting hints to their answers. Notice when you're really enjoying something or someone's company. When you're happy, try to notice what it is that is making you happy. Try to figure out what you like. That's the first part of this, trying to get a clearer picture of what makes you tick as a person.

You'll be wrong frequently. You'll realize certain hobbies aren't really your thing. Sometimes you'll realize that friends or romantic interests aren't what you're looking for. Being wrong about relationships tends will probably lead to more stress than anything else, but you'll get through it and you'll learn from it. The key is to be open to things. Everyone gives you this advice, but it's true. 

Be a scientist: willing to investigate new hypotheses about what you like. Try new things liberally. Notice when it really clicks with you and also when it doesn't. Make sure you give things (and especially people) a fair chance, but don't stick with things that really don't make you happy. It can be hard to distinguish, things that really aren't for you from things that you just haven't given enough of a chance, but you'll figure it out.

The other part of this is to try to weave all of the things you realize you like into a consistent lifestyle that truly suits *you*. Look for opportunities to mix your hobbies and interests into your friends and into your personal philosophies, and even into your personality. Let your life be guided by the things you love most. If you do this, it becomes much easier to handle the constant stream of small decisions that will make up your life from now until you die. You'll naturally make choices that bring you happiness and that are consistent with each other.

The result for me has been an almost ever-present sense of feeling grounded as a person. I know what I like. Not perfectly, and I'm always trying to learn more, but I feel like I have a much better idea now than when I was 19, for example. I have also cultivated a life that fits very well with what I like. My lifestyle supports my interests and vice versa.

I'll be more concrete. I love computer science. I love philosophy, particularly the philosophy of mind. I love science. I love the idea of evolution. I'm deeply a materialist (in the philosophical sense). I love long, heady conversations with close friends. What I appreciate most in other people is interesting worldviews and well-thought out personal philosophies (surprise). I love fantasizing about the future. I love technology. I love building things.

I've tried to integrate these things that I like as thoroughly as possible. I work in natural language processing and machine learning, integrating my love of computer science, my love the philosophy of mind, and my love of building things. I have specifically chosen to cultivate a small set of very close friends, which I think leads to more of my favorite kinds of social interactions. In all of my non-CS hobbies, I try to find ways to incorporate computer science somehow (which, due to the nature of the field, is easy). I have gone so far as developing, in an only half-joking manner, a religion with some of my closest friends. We have a mostly internally consistent theology that is built around evolution and entropy, with a bunch of tangents into the philosophy of mind, art, and music.

Now, following this advice will likely be look very different for you. You need to let it be guided by what you learn about what *you* love most. 

And so, the tl;dr of all of this is that life is going to be a steady stream of small decisions. In my view, the best way to handle them is to try to gradually discover what you love by paying attention when you find that you're enjoying yourself, and letting those insights guide you. In doing this, you will naturally develop a lifestyle that is self-reinforcing and perfectly tailored for you. It works for me.

I work part-time in the video game industry and intern part-time at a community mental health facility.

* Despite how academically ""successful"" I am, or how well I hold down a job, I feel like I can't fully fulfill the roles I need to fulfill: student, friend, daughter, girlfriend, employee, etc...

* I have mounting social anxiety and feel like *everyone* I talk to immediately hates me as a person as soon as I open my mouth. I feel like my cohort of 10 people in my doctoral program absolutely despise my existence. They all clique together and do stuff with each other, while I'm left out. They're all on one side of the fence in debates and I'm on the other by myself. My opinions and expressions are met with short answers, nods, or just deafening silence. I don't have panic attacks or anxious physical responses, I just feel like I am completely worthless and that opening my mouth for more than just stuffing it with food is a pointless act.

* I am the worst psychology student in existence because I feel like therapy won't work for me. I self-medicate with food, proceed to feel like utter shit because I binged uncontrollably, and because of those fucking feelings, I binge again.

* I am in a relationship with my boyfriend approaching 9 years this January, but I feel like I, and I alone, am the sole reason we are not engaged yet. I feel like an absolutely worthless piece of steaming, rotten shit on the bottom of Hitler's boot.

* I have sought help, but I'm prone to cancelling my appointments because I'm too embarrassed to get dressed and be a productive human.

* I can't even figure out how to appropriately end this self-post."

The first ninety days were amazing. My eyes were opened to see just how much I'd been missing due to my own insecurities. I had all the “superpowers” everyone described, girls noticing, voice deepening, urge to stay busy and kick my ass in the gym. 
On day 30, my first star, I asked out my college crush for coffee and to my surprise, she said “yes.”  On day 35 we had the most wonderful morning enjoying each other’s company. On day 41 we had a second outing that resulted in a NoFap post I wrote called “The Worst Date Ever.
http://redd.it/25ufxh
I was hurt, but realized I had to let her go and move on. On day 48 I said goodbye to her and my best friend. I moved to Colorado to start an unpaid internship.

I was hesitant to move so far from home as I had never left my home state for 14 years. After three days of leaving and seeing where I had ended up, I knew I had made the right choice. I moved to a summer ski town, I was given the royal treatment, I climbed seven 14,000ft mountains, I rekindled a lost relationship with my estranged brother, I got to go to Red Rocks, I got to work at an unpaid job that I absolutely loved, I got to have my work screened for half the millionaires in CO, I got to see the band I had waited over ten years to see (Mighty Mighty Bosstones), I met a lot of amazing people and made a bunch of new friends.  It was the best summer I’ve had since I can remember. 

By the end of summer, I had two goals: 1) get a job 2) get a job in CO. On day 136 I left Colorado behind to start a road trip of the entire western half of the U.S. I got to see so many things that I had seen in pictures, read about in books and seen in movies. I survived a flash flood in remote Arizona, I braved the triple digit sandstorms of southern California, I saw some of my family I hadn’t seen in 10 years, I saw San Francisco for the first time, I went to Oregon, I saw Crater Lake, I got to see some of my best friends whom I graduated with this past year. 

On day 153 I stopped in the hometown of my college crush and stayed with her. It was civil. I look back at it now as a mistake because she was still rather passive aggressive towards me despite the fact she put me up for the night. I guess I was searching for some closure. I think I learned that no matter how much I try, we’d never end up together. It was probably the lowest point of my trip because I headed home after that.  That night, I stayed with my best friend in my old college town. We laughed, drank beer, ate pizza and watched old Simpsons episodes. If that were to be my last night on earth, I would have been all right with that.

I got home, unsure where I’d go from there. On Day 157 I got a call from a production group back in CO asking me to come down and intern for them. With no other alternative, I hit the road again on Day 165 and on Day 168 I started working again. As grateful as I was to be back in CO, it started a downward spiral in my life. My internship is unpaid, I’m living with a host family who live an hour away from where I need to be, I fear they may kick me out soon, they’re super religious and I don’t really have any friends.

I got this internship from a girl I met over the summer in CO who works at the company. We hit it off, and she was a main reason I wanted to go back. We hung out the first two weeks, getting dinner, hiking and making plans that I couldn’t wait to carry out with her. On Day 185 she informed me she was moving to the east coast in three weeks and severed all ties with me. Depression creeped in, brain fog started clouding my judgment. I started doing things that I wouldn’t normally do. I began using Tinder and OKCupid to reach out to girls that I don’t want anything to do with for any kind of human contact. I stopped eating, I stopped feeling good about everyone and everything around me. I became a loser in my own eyes and during all this time, I had no one to talk to. 

I was frustrated. I wanted to fap. But I had done so well with this streak, I didn’t want to end the good streak I started. The pressure and tension built up into a case of sore balls that hurt so much I could barely walk today in the grocery store. I decided to let it go. Leading up to it, I felt like I was going to commit a murder. I fapped and it was the most painful ejaculation I can remember. I never got hard. When the pain subsided, I felt relieved and came back to reality.

What this comes down to is that I didn’t want to let go of the past and my success. Yes, I had a lot of fun this summer and I carried a great streak with me along the way. I was afraid to let go of home, I was afraid to let go of the girl and I didn’t want to lose the streak. I associate everything that happened in the last six months with that streak. It’s gone. The mission failed. But I’ve been able to reflect on the successes. I can’t wait to see where I end up during my next 90-day challenge. 

If you’re still reading this and made it this far I want to extend my deepest gratitude to those who post here and support one another on a regular basis. Some of these posts are what some need to read to talk them off the ledge in their darkest hour. You are all awesome. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren’t for your support.

 tl;dr: there’s life after relapse.

2izv50,2,2014-10-11,Is it okay to take a short break post-(college)-graduation?How do I justify it? Desperate for advice!,CloudsTasteGeometric,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2izv50/is_it_okay_to_take_a_short_break/,"So I graduate from Uni in december, I have an internship under my belt and am getting my feet wet with professional network and job interviews/prospects. I am not walking away with the kind of degree that guarentees a srraight and narrow path into a solid career, like engineering, but its comprehensive and Im work hard with it to cultivate my skill sets. I even took the GRE if I want to move forward to grad school down the line.

But in the face of it all, both the struggles, time commitments, and ambiguity after graduation, I am getting...anxious? Depressed? Idk...I always read that people should enjoy themselves, adventure, and be spontaneous in college as you'll never get another chance. I never had money or time for any of that, it was perplexing. Weekends have always been for work, ""breaks"" (spring, summer, thanksgiving) were opportunities to get overtime hours, catch up on school/intern work, etc.

Ive been working hard to get my life off the ground, saying that these frivolous fancies are for people who already have careers, only to realize that once I begin my career i will have less time and energy than ever before. Im not too burnt out really (tho i have been before), i get afternoons here and mornings there to myself, but i havent had two or more consecutive days off in *years* and I invest my intermittent stretches of down time just sleeping/crashing, or doing something mundane.

I feel uncentered. Like i forgot to have fun or live my life. Like I only understand happiness anecdotally, as if it is some dessert course that never comes. Im tired and done with being bitter towards people who took college as something other than working all the time, but admiting these things and writing this post makes me feel entitled, like a failure.

Do all college grads face this? I feel like it takes a lot of nerve to really waste the time to take a break during *or* after college in this economy. How could I possibly justify it? What would I even do? I feel too anomic to learn to live life again, too cynical to take the prospect seriously, and too conflicted to do anything other than continue to ride this wave of stubborn momentum.

Long story short I took a class about OOP in Python and now am taking a data structures class in C++ as well as a computer systems class that works in unix writing a bit of c, and also decided to graduate in 3 years, meaning I will finish this year with no internships (though I have certainly had jobs) and most of my higher level computer science classes ( I will be taking an open source class, a database class, and a software development class at least) will be taken in my last semester.  Also I am taking a class in Automata and formal language now though it seems more to be math than computer science to me.  In any case, what can I do to showcase my skills now to potential employers without some of the more focused classwork under my belt? "

MAcc,royrtr,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2j1mq9/cpajob_v_macc/,"Hi all, I am a current senior at a public university and I am having difficulty deciding on what do next year. In January I will intern with the Big 4 in the Assurance practice and then graduate undergrad in May with well over 150 hours. 

I plan on sitting for the first part of the CPA in July and then hopefully knock off the subsequent parts by December 2015. My question is, do I need to attend graduate school and enroll in the MAcc program? Everyone tells me they go to grad school to get their 150 hours, but I don't need that. In addition, it will cost a lot of money unless I get a scholarship (currently studying for GMAT, practice exams put me in the 610-650 range, which is right on the cusp for scholarships at certain schools like Georgia and Ole Miss). I don't want to become $20k+ in debt by getting a degree for the sake of getting one.

On the other hand, if I theoretically get a job with the firm with whom I'm interning, I can start in the Fall and take the CPA as well. Going to grad school results in lost income that I could earn by starting early. However, I am concerned with working long hours and becoming tired, and I wouldn't be able to study for the CPA properly. 

Has anyone else been stuck with this kind of dilemma? I don't want to go in debt for grad school when I already have the hours for the CPA, but I also don't want to fail the CPA by working long hours if I start early. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you very much!"

I went to an art school to study concept art. I wasn't the best, but I was the hardest working kid in the class. I was the anti-social one, left to my own devices. Even in art school there are cliques. It was the pretty girls, and the more jock-ish guys (yes even at an art school). Anyway, an opportunity arose for an internship at a AAA company. It took months of conversation back and forth. Eventually the guy got fired for corruption and general laziness, but they wouldn't accept me as an intern, because they wanted to clean house.

After that experience I got ready for my portfolio show, and a nearby AAA came to see me. (Hilariously this company is one of the huge anti-GG ones, it rhymes with Eargox) I was thrilled. They told me to sit tight, the project was starting but I wasn't needed yet. Days turned into weeks, into months. They eventually would no longer take my calls, and HR stopped responding to emails. A few weeks later I heard through the grapevine what happened. The art director hired a friend, but didn't have the decency to tell me.

I was eventually hired by a smaller game company. It had roughly 20-30~ people employed. I was extremely excited, and interestingly enough 3/4 of my bosses were women. I had a female art director (who could kick my ass in art any day of the week), a female producer, and a female art team lead. I was excited to be there, things were great for awhile.

Along with myself, the other recent hire was the wife of a prominent AAA 3D modeler. She had no experience (she had to learn Maya from scratch), and was only hired due to her connections. She brought the entire team down. She was unwilling to learn. My art director hated her and they routinely butted heads, but the director couldn't get rid of her because of her status. She would go on vacations during crunches and would take 2 hour coffee breaks. It was terrible, not only for work not being done, but morale. There were nights we'd end up sitting at work at 3 AM because our team was short staffed. 

Eventually she was let go. My art director and I pushed hard for it. I was eventually moved to a new project, an FPS tech demo. The project lead was an ex-iD 3D modeler, we disliked each other, he was good friends with the girl above. It turned out he had the same sort of relationship with the boss. He was quite experienced, but was unwilling to do much. Whenever I went into his office he'd be watching Dane Cook or some other comedy stand-up. In a given week he only did about 15 hours of work, he blamed issues on the rest of the team. I was up up for a raise before this project, but was eventually laid off at his request, and the company folded about 6 months later due to financial issues... *cough cough *

After these 3 events I was like 'screw AAA', went into freelance and started developing as an indie in my free time. This sort of behavior happens in all business, but part of the reason I became an artist and game dev was to avoid it. 

Eventually my indie team released an RPG. It hovers between an 8/10 and 9/10 with 1800~ votes. (was over 9/10 before downvote brigading). We ended up receiving a 4/10 review and I was shocked. They were free to their opinion, but I was upset about it. It's hard not to get a little butthurt when you're criticized so harshly. At the very least I wanted to know what critical flaws the game had to deserve such a low rating. Not being terribly experienced maybe I missed some critical issue? It turned out that our main competitor had written a blog about how our game sucked (on their business website). He lead downvote brigades against us, so he'd get more face-time than us. He wrote dozens of forum posts on multiple websites about how poor quality our game was. This reviewer was good friends with our competitor and... well you see where this is going. 

Maybe I was naive, I didn't expect such favoritism and clique-ish behavior to follow us into the indie world. Giving biased media coverage to friends, attempting to destroy your friend's competitors. Exchanging favors for publicity, questionable relationships, bribes and contests. 


**Hypocrisy of anti-GamerGate:**

Ever since I was about 5 I've had chronic nightmares. When I was 13 I developed chronic depression from being unable to sleep. After my dealings with the game industry, it became a  lot worse. I needed an outlet. I have a family history of depression and suicide. 'Game' was created out of all of these issues. We wanted to tell a story about an abused young girl dealing with depression and family issues. Real world stuff. Real life problems.

During Gamergate we received absolutely zero support from the anti-Gamergate crowd. Nadda. Ziltch. Not only that, we were told writing about suicide and depression is unethical. It's a trigger. It's offensive. You're not allowed. These same people said I didn't deserve to live due to my lack of support for an anti-gamer woman. Another prominent anti-GG figure told me that nothing I did mattered, because I'm a white male. That I've never had to think about my decisions, never had challenges in my life. 

While researching both sides of Gamergate, I was sent messages and emails telling me I should kill myself. After seeing how I was treated, and how her friends were treated, my wife jumped into the fray for #NotYourShield. Anti-GG types called her a whore, a slut that only wanted men's attention, a princess, a 'white male in disguise'. Told she actually hates women, and that she was a disgusting human being. We were both demonized. It really didn't matter that my wife was a woman, or a minority. It didn't matter that she helped make 'Game', a game about a young girl with depression. It didn't matter that we're both socially progressive. The only thing that mattered was towing the line.

To push the hypocrisy even further, she was not the only woman that worked on 'Game'. There were two others, one of whom handled game testing. 'Game' was her first game-dev related job, she put it on her resume, and we helped her 'break into the industry' as a full-time artist in St. Louis. They're LITERALLY FIGHTING AGAINST THE PEOPLE HELPING FEMALE GAME DEVS.

I was bullied a lot of my younger life. For being a nerd, for being a gamer, I even had a bully for being a scrawny white kid. The current environment seems to mirror that part of my life. Most of these people do not care about female developers. They don't care about social issues, or helping mental illness. They don't care about minorities or the disabled. They only care about themselves.

I will be graduating in this fall, 2014 but for the completion of my academic program it is compulsory to go through an internship at a reputable firm. From the last six months I had started, as a precautionary motive, searching various prospective firm where I can do my internship. After sorting out various organizations I came up with a list of three companies where I will be going to apply for internship one by one. 
Now the scenario is I got a connection in one of the top firm in my list (More of a leader of their field in our country) who asked me to come over for an interview. While preparing for the interview I was just checking their website and I found there are some spelling mistakes in their website(total of 26). Now I am having a feeling for a moment that I can pitch my internship idea by showing them the mistakes I found on their website. but then I am having a thought that It will be silly of me to showing them their mistakes while I was only on entry-level stage of my career.

So I'm a sophomore computer science major. I'm currently deciding if I should spend this coming summer and fall studying abroad, or if I should not go and work my butt off to land an internship. 

The study abroad program I want to do would leave mid July and I'd return around mid November. It's in New Zealand and I AM guaranteed an internship while I'm there. However, the internship is really just doing basic IT, and I want to work in software engineering, so career-wise I don't think it will help me all that much. 

My school really pushes that we should try to get an internship every summer in order to get a job in the field. I really, really, reallyyyy want to go abroad, but if losing this summer for getting an internship is really going to hurt me, then I won't... 




Other notes:

-Money isn't an issue as I have a generous scholarship.   

-Program is done through my uni, so all credits will transfer.   

-I was too much of a beginner to land an internship last summer, so I already feel behind career-wise. 

-GPA is OK, but not stellar. (3.13 right now, but probably gonna go up after this semester.) So, I don't even know if I can get an internship.

-There are other study abroad programs I can do, but they don't offer classes in my major, so I'd end up behind schedule and have to  overload. "

Bradley's eyes would trickle back and forth through his thick glasses, smiling when his eyes grazed over his assets as if they inspired a flood of memories. He licked his cracked lips, looking up as if he were about to speak only to see Erica give a halfhearted, impatient smirk while looking forward at his will, waiting for him to sign it. Bradley's smile disappeared into the folds of his wrinkles, focusing back on the paper as he continued to read carefully. It wasn't long before another one crept onto his wrinkled, spotted chin.
""I was born in that house..."" said Bradley in a phlegmy voice, he cleared his throat with a quick grunt. ""So many memories...I'm sorry, this is just a little 'overwhelming'--"" he said a bit clearer, his voice still shook though as one would expect of someone his age.
""--Take your time."" said Erica softly even though she was lying.
Erica watched as Bradley picked up his pen. ""Ben?"" she called out.
A well dressed man stepped through the door, brief case in hand as he impatiently walked in. ""We ready to do this Bradley?"" said Ben as his phone began to rumble in his pocket, he glanced at it quickly, leaving it alone to rumble in his pocket.
""Don't you have to swear them in--"" asked Bradley.
""--Already did that."" snapped Ben.
""We did?"" Bradley starred at the dotted line at the bottom, rotating his wrist while the pen sat in between his frail spotted hands. Everyone watched, waiting for him to finish but Bradley just sat there, wondering how long he had actually been in the room, wondering how many times he had read the document to himself. His heart sank a bit, he couldn't remember anything at all as the feeling of embarrassment washed over him. Forcing down the lump in his throat he dropped his hand, The pen finally landed and Bradley signed the paper as if it were the last thing he would ever sign. His signature looked worthy of such claim as Bradley smiled at his own penmanship.
Ben quickly snatched the paper and slid it towards himself. He clicked his pen and signed, sliding out of the way to make room for Erica's interns to sign. Once they did Ben stamped the file and clapped his hands together.
""Alright, Bradley you have a nice night."" said Ben with a quick smirk as he prepared to leave.
""Night?"" muttered Bradley as he looked to his wristwatch.It was 8:05 p.m. ""It's 8:00?-""
""--It's 9:00."" said Ben as he lingered around the doorway, the interns squeezed by him as they made their way out the office. Erica pulled the blinds open to look out and see if there was a car waiting for Bradley, there was none. Bradley peeked out as well to see that it was true. He looked down at Ben's stamp to see that it was May 9th.
""Who's picking you up?"" asked Erica. Ben had been lingering hoping to see a car pull up out their office.
""I was going to take the bus...but-""
""-They stop running after 6:00 p.m."" snapped Ben. Erica looked over at Ben, their eyes met and he knew that he would have to drive Bradley home. He simply waited for the words to leave Erica's mouth so that he could contest it.
""Excuse me but could I trouble you for a ride?"" asked Bradley. Ben turned to see that Bradley was speaking to him. Ben's eyes shot back to Erica who simply cocked her head, waiting for a response. ""I think we shop at the same Grocer, at least I think that was you."" Bradley thought to himself if Ben was the man he saw so regularly, as he turned his watch forward an hour. Ben looked to the ground, exhaling. It was him, he even went out as far as to help him load his bags into his car a few days ago. He wanted to lie, he was going to lie but as he picked his eyes back up he could see the look on Bradley's face as if he had almost realized that it was in fact him.
""We do."" said Bradley and Ben simultaneously. Ben looked over to Erica who had already began to gather her things with a smile as she stood up from her desk, filing away Bradley's will.
""Alright, let's go."" said Ben with a halfhearted smirk, he waved his hand to the doorway as Bradley raised from his chair.
""You remember where you live right?"" said Ben in a prodding tone as Bradley walked through the doorway. Bradley turned almost coming to a stop giving a wink.
""Ha! yes, I remember that.""
Ben gave a smirk as he looked over at Erica. ""See you in the morning."" he said.
The drive was quiet mostly. Bradley was too embarrassed to initiate any form of conversation and Ben hadn't noticed the silence, he was just focused on getting Bradley home so that he could do the same. The silence grew uncomfortable after awhile as he looked over at Bradley.
""I just bought my daughter a cat...I uh, I like dogs but my girl kept asking for a cat."" said Ben.
""That's nice."" replied Bradley.
Ben focused on the road occasionally looking over to Bradley who looked to be genuinely enjoying the small talk. ""We're trying to train it-him, now but uh... it's smelly, ya know?.""
""Smelly? This is very interesting Ben, please go on."" chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he turned the corner.
""I was just wondering what brand do you use?""
""Me?"" said Bradley quickly and curiously.
""Yeah, I remember seeing a bag of cat litter the other day when I helped you --""
""--Oh that was you?""
""Yeah--""
""See I knew, I knew you. I never forget a face, I do forget everything else though."" said Bradley in a joking tone. Ben laughed out loud as he stopped at a light. ""I never thought I would actually lose my mind; ya know? I never really thought I would be this old."" Bradley turned to Ben as he continued. ""I mean, I knew I would get old, but no one ever really thinks it you know?""
""Do you have any regrets?"" said Ben; he immediately realized that this question might be inappropriate, that it might make the rest of the car ride a complete uncomfortable silence but, to his surprise Bradley answered, unbothered.
""Yes. A girl."" said Bradley as the light turned green. Ben continued down the road and looked over to Bradley to see him staring out into the distant night. Ben was curious and wanted to hear more, he was glad he didn't have to ask. ""I loved her, she was my first and only. Most people want wealth, or success; I guess it's the same thing fame, some men want fame...I just wanted her. She had a dimpled chin and red hair that framed her perfect green eyes...I remember our first kiss, it was cold but I still loved it. She would just lay there and I would run my fingers through her hair for hours with her head in my lap.""
""Sounds nice.""
""It was.""
""What happened?""
""Time.""
""Time?""
""Time, we simply just...had our time. It ran it's course. I mean, I was happy for the time we had but there just wasn't enough... it never would have been enough....""
Ben turned to see Bradley looking out the side window, staring at his own reflection, into his own eyes. Ben glanced at the road for a moment and when his eyes turned to Bradley's reflection again he could see Bradley looking back at Ben through his own reflection. A smile grew on his face as he turned to Ben.
""Did you ever try to reconnect, like get back in touch with her?""
""No.""
""Why?""
Bradley sighed a little. ""Because she's dead."" he said with regret.
""I'm, I'm so sorry--""
""--Like I said time."" said Bradley as he looked at his wrinkled frail hands, they were spotted and the veins were dark and thick. ""It's never enough time, It would have never been enough time....I never thought I would be this old, I mean, I knew but I never really actually believed it..."" Ben watched as Bradley looked at his watch and at the time on Ben's car radio,. A confused look grew on his face as he looked back at his watch and reached to set it to the correct time.
""Uh, no you're right...I forgot to set it back an hour, I actually keep forgetting."" said Ben.
""Ah, I was confused for a moment there. Thought I was forgetting the goddamn time for a moment."" Chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he drove through the neighborhood slowly, the houses were large and farm from each other and all looked like variants of the same home.
""Any of these look familiar?""
""That's me on the right.""
""Wow."" said Ben as he looked at the large three story house. It was different from the others as it had a very traditional theme to its construction. White paint, blue shutters, red door and the moon reflected off the lake right behind his house. Ben turned the car to pull into the drive way which was about twenty and some yards away from the home.
""No, you're fine."" said Bradley as he tapped Ben's hand which was resting on the steering wheel.
""Are you sure? I can pull in closer, it's no problem--""
""No, no I want to walk the rest of the way.""
""Are you sure?""
""Yes. It looks beautiful tonight, I don't know when I'll see it from this angle or light again. I'd just like to take it all in one more time.""
""It definitely a beautiful home.""
""Yes it is. You know I was born here? Right in that basement."" said Bradley as he unfastened his seat belt and pointing out the window.
Ben smiled. ""No, no I didn't."" Bradley opened the door and stepped out slowly, turning around and waving.
""You have a good life Ben."" said Bradley. A lump grew in Ben's throat for some reason when he heard Bradley say that.
""You too."" said Ben as Bradley closed the door. Ben took his car out of park and looked ready to drive away but stopped and rolled the window down. ""Bradley, I forgot, what brand you use? For uh, your cats.""
Bradley looked confused. ""I don't have cats. I sure hope I don't because I don't remember buying any cat food."" chuckled Bradley
Ben chuckled as he raised his eyebrows together in slight confusion. He thought about the day he helped put the bag in his trunk, thinking that he might have been mistaken but suddenly remembered distinctly seeing several cats on the bag. ""What's with the kitty litter then?"" he asked.
""I do a lot of work in my basement, Cat litter is great for soaking up spills. In fact, I could definitely recommend 'Kitty Secret'.""
""Yeah?""
""Been in business since I was your age, gotta be doing something right, right?.""
""Yeah, I guess so.""
They both lingered there for a moment, a comfortable silence as Ben looked over Bradley's shoulder to his home in the moonlight. A picturesque moment . ""A wonderful home Bradley, it looks like you've had a wonderful life.""
""I did, didn't I?"" he said with a smile. Bradley turned around and began walking. ""I'm off to relive my glory days, goodnight Ben.""
""Good night Bradley."" Ben watched him for a moment after he rolled his window down, taking in the sight. He hoped to see him in the grocery store next week as he drove off.
Bradley walked , the freshly cut grass crunching beneath his feet. The closer he got the wider his smile grew. Closer and closer, wider and wider and he could begin to hear her voice but couldn't make out what she was saying. When he reached the porch he could hear her voice clearly, he wondered why she would scream so loudly; no one would hear her. He looked down to see the paper on his porch, he picked it up with a grin.
""Help..."" he could hear her yell faintly as he walked to his door. She must have been screaming for hours because her voice sounded desperate, as if she had been crying all day. When he opened the door he could hear her grow quiet for a moment. The silence made Bradley grin as he closed the door behind him. The sound of the door closing behind him made her sob, she tried to yell through her tears but it was broken and unintelligible. It was just like his first time.
Bradley made his way to the basement, the house was acoustically sound and you could hear every foot step made in every room. The woman sounded panicked and he could hear her struggle and cry. When he opened the door to the basement the light filled in what it could, illuminating half of her face as she laid on her side. Her eyes were swollen with tears as she looked up at Bradley who had closed the door behind him, covering them in darkness. She rolled around making small crunching noises as Bradley stepped down the stairs slowly. She could hear every step, one by one as his loafers clacked against the wood.
She tried to hide, she tried to muffle her breath. 'In the Dark?' she thought 'Is this his game?' She could hear his loafers crushing the cat litter on the ground as he opened a drawer. She could hear him rummaging through it, closing it and opening another. He did the same to another drawer until he laid something heavy on top of it, making a deep thud as he closed it. She could hear the sound of a knife being unsheathed, it was unmistakable. Bradley had done this every night just to get a reaction out of her just like he had done so many years ago.
She was silent, Bradley couldn't even hear her breathe. It was so dark you couldn't even make out shapes yet she closed her eyes tightly. She wasn't there anymore. She would have been invisible if the lights hadn't come on. She could feel the slight warmth coming off of the bulbs and the light coming through her eyelids, yet she never opened her eyes. She could feel her body shaking as Bradley spoke.
""You look just like her."" he said in a soft voice. ""Red hair framing those green eyes, open them for me...""
She didn't think it was possible to close her eyes tighter but she did.
""No?"" he said. ""I still know they're there...even your chin. Wow, you look exactly like her, and you're exactly where she was...and I'm exactly were I was..."" Bradley was quiet for a moment, he just starred at her. ""My god even the dress looks exactly the same."" He took her in, every feature, she was beautiful even with the gag, even with the grains of cat litter on her cheek, even with her legs and arms bound to each other. ""I love you so much Christina. I don't have enough time, but neither will you.""
She sobbed through her gag as the tears forced their way out of her tightly pressed eyelids.
""I'm going to hold your head just like before Christina, I'm going to look into your eyes just like before.""
She cried a bit more as the tears rolled down her cheeks.
We'll lie together just like before...I don't have enough time, but it will be more than enough. I'll be gone before your beauty fades.""
She could hear him getting closer, the cat litter crunching beneath his feet. She cried louder, sobbing ""No."" hopelessly. She could feel his presence right in front of her and something inside of her made her eyes open. She looked up at him and his large knife, her tears blurred her vision a bit and her eyes fluttered to push away the tears. It was in this moment that Bradley paused, she looked exactly like her, his heart swooned at the fluttering lashes as he plunged his knife into her belly.
She looked into his eyes as he looked into hers, both were wide. Bradley could feel the warm blood running down his blade and trickling against his fingers. They both closed their eyes at the same time as Bradley twisted the knife, just like he did before but unlike before she was quiet. He twisted the blade more and deeper but still, nothing. He opened his eyes and looked down as the blood dripped onto his loafers. The pain came all at once as Bradley looked down to the knife in his gut, he fell on his side and looked around the room for her, and saw no one. Bradley reached for the knife but it was tender and he flinched when he touched the handle.
The lights turned off and the door to the basement opened. Bradley rolled over to see her standing at the top of the steps, the light pouring down through the doorway illuminating half of Bradley's face. Her makeup was fresh, her skin glowed and her dress was clean and pressed.She took a step down with wide pale eyes as she looked down at Bradley, full of fear and regret as the door closed behind her, consuming Bradley in darkness.

2j24ju,6,2014-10-12,Without Regret.,adrianwrites,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/2j24ju/without_regret/,"The room was cold and quiet, Erica and her interns patiently waited as Bradley read through his estate. Bradley's eyes would trickle back and forth through his thick glasses, smiling when his eyes grazed over his assets as if they inspired a flood of memories. He licked his cracked lips, looking up as if he were about to speak only to see Erica give a halfhearted, impatient smirk while looking forward at his will, waiting for him to sign it.

 Bradley's smile disappeared into the folds of his wrinkles, focusing back on the paper as he continued to read carefully. It wasn't long before another one crept onto his wrinkled, spotted chin.

""I was born in that house..."" said Bradley in a phlegmy voice, he cleared his throat with a quick grunt. ""So many memories...I'm sorry, this is just a little 'overwhelming'--"" he said a bit clearer, his voice still shook though as one would expect of someone his age.

""--Take your time."" said Erica softly even though she was lying.
Erica watched as Bradley picked up his pen. ""Ben?"" she called out.

A well dressed man stepped through the door, brief case in hand as he impatiently walked in. 

""We ready to do this Bradley?"" said Ben as his phone began to rumble in his pocket, he glanced at it quickly, leaving it alone to rumble in his pocket.

""Don't you have to swear them in--"" asked Bradley.

""--Already did that."" snapped Ben.

""We did?"" Bradley starred at the dotted line at the bottom, rotating his wrist while the pen sat in between his frail spotted hands. Everyone watched, waiting for him to finish but Bradley just sat there, wondering how long he had actually been in the room, wondering how many times he had read the document to himself. His heart sank a bit, he couldn't remember anything at all as the feeling of embarrassment washed over him. Forcing down the lump in his throat he dropped his hand, The pen finally landed and Bradley signed the paper as if it were the last thing he would ever sign. His signature looked worthy of such claim as Bradley smiled at his own penmanship.

Ben quickly snatched the paper and slid it towards himself. He clicked his pen and signed, sliding out of the way to make room for Erica's interns to sign. Once they did Ben stamped the file and clapped his hands together.

""Alright, Bradley you have a nice night."" said Ben with a quick smirk as he prepared to leave.

""Night?"" muttered Bradley as he looked to his wristwatch.It was 8:05 p.m. ""It's 8:00?-""

""--It's 9:00."" said Ben as he lingered around the doorway, the interns squeezed by him as they made their way out the office. Erica pulled the blinds open to look out and see if there was a car waiting for Bradley, there was none. Bradley peeked out as well to see that it was true. He looked down at Ben's stamp to see that it was May 9th.

""Who's picking you up?"" asked Erica. Ben had been lingering hoping to see a car pull up out their office.

""I was going to take the bus...but-""

""-They stop running after 6:00 p.m."" snapped Ben. Erica looked over at Ben, their eyes met and he knew that he would have to drive Bradley home. He simply waited for the words to leave Erica's mouth so that he could contest it.

""Excuse me but could I trouble you for a ride?"" asked Bradley. Ben turned to see that Bradley was speaking to him. Ben's eyes shot back to Erica who simply cocked her head, waiting for a response. ""I think we shop at the same Grocer, at least I think that was you."" 

Bradley thought to himself if Ben was the man he saw so regularly, as he turned his watch forward an hour. Ben looked to the ground, exhaling. It was him, he even went out as far as to help him load his bags into his car a few days ago. He wanted to lie, he was going to lie but as he picked his eyes back up he could see the look on Bradley's face as if he had almost realized that it was in fact him.

""We do."" said Bradley and Ben simultaneously. Ben looked over to Erica who had already began to gather her things with a smile as she stood up from her desk, filing away Bradley's will.

""Alright, let's go."" said Ben with a halfhearted smirk, he waved his hand to the doorway as Bradley raised from his chair.

""You remember where you live right?"" said Ben in a prodding tone as Bradley walked through the doorway. Bradley turned almost coming to a stop giving a wink.

""Ha! yes, I remember that.""

Ben gave a smirk as he looked over at Erica. ""See you in the morning."" he said.
The drive was quiet mostly. Bradley was too embarrassed to initiate any form of conversation and Ben hadn't noticed the silence, he was just focused on getting Bradley home so that he could do the same. The silence grew uncomfortable after awhile as he looked over at Bradley.

""I just bought my daughter a cat...I uh, I like dogs but my girl kept asking for a cat."" said Ben.

""That's nice."" replied Bradley.

Ben focused on the road occasionally looking over to Bradley who looked to be genuinely enjoying the small talk. ""We're trying to train it-him, now but uh... it's smelly, ya know?.""

""Smelly? This is very interesting Ben, please go on."" chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he turned the corner.

""I was just wondering what brand do you use?""

""Me?"" said Bradley quickly and curiously.

""Yeah, I remember seeing a bag of cat litter the other day when I helped you --""
""--Oh that was you?""

""Yeah--""

""See I knew, I knew you. I never forget a face, I do forget everything else though."" said Bradley in a joking tone. Ben laughed out loud as he stopped at a light. ""I never thought I would actually lose my mind; ya know? I never really thought I would be this old."" Bradley turned to Ben as he continued. ""I mean, I knew I would get old, but no one ever really thinks it you know?""

""Do you have any regrets?"" said Ben; he immediately realized that this question might be inappropriate, that it might make the rest of the car ride a complete uncomfortable silence but, to his surprise Bradley answered, unbothered.

""Yes. A girl."" said Bradley as the light turned green. Ben continued down the road and looked over to Bradley to see him staring out into the distant night. Ben was curious and wanted to hear more, he was glad he didn't have to ask. ""I loved her, she was my first and only. Most people want wealth, or success; I guess it's the same thing fame, some men want fame...I just wanted her. She had a dimpled chin and red hair that framed her perfect green eyes...I remember our first kiss, it was cold but I still loved it. She would just lay there and I would run my fingers through her hair for hours with her head in my lap.""

""Sounds nice.""

""It was.""

""What happened?""

""Time.""

""Time?""

""Time, we simply just...had our time. It ran it's course. I mean, I was happy for the time we had but there just wasn't enough... it never would have been enough....""

Ben turned to see Bradley looking out the side window, staring at his own reflection, into his own eyes. Ben glanced at the road for a moment and when his eyes turned to Bradley's reflection again he could see Bradley looking back at Ben through his own reflection. A smile grew on his face as he turned to Ben.

""Did you ever try to reconnect, like get back in touch with her?""

""No.""

""Why?""

Bradley sighed a little. ""Because she's dead."" he said with regret.
""I'm, I'm so sorry--""

""--Like I said time."" said Bradley as he looked at his wrinkled frail hands, they were spotted and the veins were dark and thick. ""It's never enough time, It would have never been enough time....I never thought I would be this old, I mean, I knew but I never really actually believed it..."" Ben watched as Bradley looked at his watch and at the time on Ben's car radio,. A confused look grew on his face as he looked back at his watch and reached to set it to the correct time.

""Uh, no you're right...I forgot to set it back an hour, I actually keep forgetting."" said Ben.

""Ah, I was confused for a moment there. Thought I was forgetting the goddamn time for a moment."" Chuckled Bradley. Ben smiled as he drove through the neighborhood slowly, the houses were large and farm from each other and all looked like variants of the same home.

""Any of these look familiar?""

""That's me on the right.""

""Wow."" said Ben as he looked at the large three story house. It was different from the others as it had a very traditional theme to its construction. White paint, blue shutters, red door and the moon reflected off the lake right behind his house. Ben turned the car to pull into the drive way which was about twenty and some yards away from the home.

""No, you're fine."" said Bradley as he tapped Ben's hand which was resting on the steering wheel.

""Are you sure? I can pull in closer, it's no problem--""

""No, no I want to walk the rest of the way.""

""Are you sure?""

""Yes. It looks beautiful tonight, I don't know when I'll see it from this angle or light again. I'd just like to take it all in one more time.""

""It definitely a beautiful home.""

""Yes it is. You know I was born here? Right in that basement."" said Bradley as he unfastened his seat belt and pointing out the window.

Ben smiled. ""No, no I didn't."" Bradley opened the door and stepped out slowly, turning around and waving.

""You have a good life Ben."" said Bradley. A lump grew in Ben's throat for some reason when he heard Bradley say that.

""You too."" said Ben as Bradley closed the door. Ben took his car out of park and looked ready to drive away but stopped and rolled the window down. ""Bradley, I forgot, what brand you use? For uh, your cats.""

Bradley looked confused. ""I don't have cats. I sure hope I don't because I don't remember buying any cat food."" chuckled Bradley

Ben chuckled as he raised his eyebrows together in slight confusion. He thought about the day he helped put the bag in his trunk, thinking that he might have been mistaken but suddenly remembered distinctly seeing several cats on the bag. ""What's with the kitty litter then?"" he asked.

""I do a lot of work in my basement, Cat litter is great for soaking up spills. In fact, I could definitely recommend 'Kitty Secret'.""

""Yeah?""

""Been in business since I was your age, gotta be doing something right, right?.""

""Yeah, I guess so.""

They both lingered there for a moment, a comfortable silence as Ben looked over Bradley's shoulder to his home in the moonlight. A picturesque moment . ""A wonderful home Bradley, it looks like you've had a wonderful life.""

""I did, didn't I?"" he said with a smile. Bradley turned around and began walking. ""I'm off to relive my glory days, goodnight Ben.""

""Good night Bradley."" Ben watched him for a moment after he rolled his window down, taking in the sight. He hoped to see him in the grocery store next week as he drove off.
Bradley walked , the freshly cut grass crunching beneath his feet. The closer he got the wider his smile grew. Closer and closer, wider and wider and he could begin to hear her voice but couldn't make out what she was saying. When he reached the porch he could hear her voice clearly, he wondered why she would scream so loudly; no one would hear her. He looked down to see the paper on his porch, he picked it up with a grin.

""Help..."" he could hear her yell faintly as he walked to his door. She must have been screaming for hours because her voice sounded desperate, as if she had been crying all day.

2j2599,2,2014-10-12,Finish double major or focus on CS?,smark22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j2599/finish_double_major_or_focus_on_cs/,"I'm currently a senior, hopefully graduating at the end of next semester, and currently double majoring in CS and philosophy. I love CS, and it's definitely what I want to do for my career, be it software engineering or research. I've recently decided that I don't love philosophy like I thought I did, but I'm very close to getting the major. If I finish the philosophy classes I have this semester, then take one more next semester, I get it. I also have the option of just doing the minor, which means finishing my philosophy classes this semester without having to take another. If I do the minor, I will probably have time for both an internship and research next semester (I'm definitely doing one either way). I would like to do as much in CS as possible, because I decided on CS late in my college career, which made me miss out on the opportunity my previous semesters/summers.

So what would look better overall? Having a double major, but only doing one of either an internship or research, or just getting the minor and being able to do both? (Side note: if I don't get an internship, I may have two different research projects lined up)"

Before anyone asks, yes the company is legit. I don't want to mention what it is but I can 100% guarantee you there are reputable. Anyway, I'm just scared I won't be able to do what they require of me. What if I have to know a certain programming language or skill? What if the work load is too much?

It begins with all of the firms that want to be involved (around 30) attending a career fair with all the students one evening.  The students hand out resumes to the reps of the firms and talk about internships and jobs.  From there, the employers call back the students they're interested in; many accounting majors at my school get jobs like this

So anyways, I was offered a position with a small firm about 2 weeks into the whole process, which was much sooner than expected.  They offered for me to start the internship now, one day a week, when I don't have any classes.  I felt pressured into accepting this offer because it was so early in the process and I didn't want to risk not having a job after graduation just to wait and see if something better would come along.  The offer is with a great firm, they just never would have been my first choice for an employer.  Anyways, I did end up accepting the offer, and I have since worked two weeks.

At the end of last week, I was offered a position with a firm I like better that pays $6 more per hour.  

Ethically, I know it would be wrong for me to leave my job after accepting an offer for the spring.  Is there any way of being able to be professional, but accept the new offer and rescind the first offer?"

I moved to Rio de Janeiro 2 and a half years ago... actually, almost 3 now, when I was 18. Time flies. I moved here because I met a guy on the internet and our long-distance relationship of 3 years was amazing. And it only got better when I moved here. He's everything I could want in a partner and I try to be the same for him. He's 25.

I'm trying to learn Portuguese, but it's not going very well. That's my own fault.

First, I'll say that I love where I live. It's beautiful and people are wonderful. So my problems have nothing to do with where I live, just me.

I used to teach English, but the branch I was teaching at closed down. I don't actually have my work documents, so I was getting paid under the table. I didn't mind, and my documents were pending so it wasn't a permanent thing. I liked teaching English well enough; it wasn't my passion, but I was good at it and it paid the bills. But when the branch closed, it wasn't really easy getting another job; it turns out that not a lot of other English courses will give you a job if your Portuguese is only basic (we had a 'no portuguese' rule in class, and most others at the branch spoke English, so it wasn't a big deal there), and my visa documents are taking a long time... but by the end of this week, that really shouldn't be an issue. I've thought that for months though, the red tape they put on this stuff really is bullshit.

What I really want to go into is graphic design. I want to build brand identities and bring out the souls in companies. The only graphic design agencies worth looking at are at least an hour away from me, but whatever. I'll take that bus ride. I found a really great design firm near the beautiful botanical gardens. It's prestigious, pays great, and takes interns. Best of all, *holy shit everyone speaks English there.* Jackpot! So I've speant the past month or two putting my nose to the internet books and studying my ass off. I've learnt a lot (mostly with Skillshare, take a look if you're trying to teach yourself design), but still not enough. It's hard, not being able to go to university here, but thank the gods for the internet! I'm on my way and I love learning this stuff. I checked their website today, just out of excitement really, and it looks like they've updated it. They only take interns if you're enrolled in an undergrad program in a related field.

**GOD FUCKING DAMNIT**

Okay. Okay. No sweat. Maybe they'll just take you in a regular position if your portfolio is good enough!  


&gt;Needed: 2+ years of experience in the field, preferably with agency experience

**AAAAAAAAGH**

I just thought that this was my shot. Where else am I going to find a place this good for me that speaks English for fuck's sake? But this is my own fault. I neglected to learn Portuguese for almost 3 years now because I thought I could get by. To be honest, I don't know what the fuck I thought. Me living here is not temporary. Me living here is going to be at LEAST 10 years, if we decide to move at all. And I'm okay with that.

So why did I take so fucking long to move my ass in learning the language? In the process of being so stupid, I became really dependent on my other half. He's been great, but sometimes he treats me like a kid because he's so worried about me going out with subpar Portuguese. And that's my own fault! It's because I haven't shown him what I can do, even. So how is he supposed to know? Fuck. I've set myself back so much.

In the end, I spent the Sunday researching design agencies, checking websites and sending out emails inquiring about their use of English in the office, and if I can get by with my level of Portuguese. I expect a lot of ""no""s. Of course I've resolved to learn Portuguese asap now, but I could have been fluent by now. Why did I do this to myself.

It's hard to keep reminding myself that I'm only 21. I've accomplished a lot more than most other 21 year olds have, uprooting myself and living in a new country and teaching English and gaining skills. But I still feel like I'm going so slow. Do other young adults feel like this? 

I don't expect anyone to have read this wall of text, thanks if you have."

My logic seems right, as 19/20 solutions are correct, but there is one edge case that yields a wrong answer. That's one in 20 and I'm having trouble figuring out why.   

This is how I coded my solution:    

    using namespace std;


    int main() {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
        int t,n,c,m;
        cin&gt;&gt;t;
        while(t--){
            cin&gt;&gt;n&gt;&gt;c&gt;&gt;m;
            long answer=0;
            // Computer answer
            answer = (n/c) + ((n/c) / m);
            answer += (answer - (((n/c) / m)*m)) / m;
        
            cout&lt;&lt;answer&lt;&lt;endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    
I'm really having trouble figuring out what case is making this solution incorrect. Any ideas?"
2j2s30,2,2014-10-12,"I don't care if it's your girlfriend or your clone, it was pertinent to the conversation.",fayryover,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2j2s30/i_dont_care_if_its_your_girlfriend_or_your_clone/,"So some back story first. Last year my sister moved out and my first non-familial roommate moved in. a couple months later our condo is foreclosed on and the old owner steals our security deposit. We are now currently in a group lawsuit with a few other renters in our building. 

The lawyer sent a notice saying everyone owed $48 each for the filing fee. I did not know that the 48$ was to be split between my roommate and I, I thought we each owed a separate $48. My roommate had just moved out and so I texted him letting him know to get the lawyer his money. And I sent mine to the lawyer. Now this was the last couple of weeks of summer and I was broke until I got my financial aid check so I borrowed money from my sister to pay it. Then about a month later, the lawyer attaches the invoice for the money to an update on our case and it shows that our $48 was supposed to be split. But just to make sure of that I planned to ask the lawyer about it because as far as I knew my old roommate had also paid $48. 

So first I text my roommate to make sure he did pay the money. Then I text him again. Eventually he answers saying no he owes me $24. So I ask him when he is going to pay me and he say he gets paid on Oct 3rd. I say okay. It gets past oct 3 and I ask him to pay me in the next feew days. he says ya. A few days go by and I ask him again. He doesn't answer. A few days later (today) I text him 'you need to give me my money and get your mail (mail of which I have been trying to get him to pick up for a while as there is a lot of it.) A little rude I guess but honestly I was getting pissed off about his behavior. 

He replies saying don't be rude, I get paid Friday. I replied back ""Don't be rude? You told me you'd pay me on the 3rd and you should have paid me a lot sooner. You should have told me you owed the money when you found out."" + or - a few typos and speech to text errors. Anyway he gets pissed and says 'sorry I fucking work'. Guess what? I work and I go to school full time. I still somehow manage to take care of my responsibilities.

I reply back that I didn't have the money to give to the lawyer and really could have used it then and that I work too. I avoid using curse words and try to say everything as civilly as possible. the worst thing I said was ""I had to clean up his garbage and crap"" when he moved out.   

His texts are swearing at me that I shouldn't run my mouth. and that I made messes a lot I guess. The living room wasn't always picked up and I agree that was almost always me and my dog's responsibility but the kitchen counter and sink and fridge was as much his as it was mine. The only chore he ever did was the dishes every other time mostly. He never took out the garbage (maybe 3 times) or recycling or washed the counter or threw his old food away or cleaned the sink or unclogged the sink or refrained from not rinsing his dishes out on the side that contained the garbage disposal. 

I mentioned this to him and asked if he could handle this conversation civilly (I was trying not too make my texts sound pissed off and yelling as his definitely felt like they were (going by the times he used fucking and i shouldn't run my mouth). After his next reply I mentioned those things again but added that he always paid bills to me late. They were all in my name (electric and internet) and I always made sure they were paid on time and would give him the number he owed me. He would always have some excuse not to pay me until his next or so paycheck (how do you never have money left over from the last one. and I would have to remind him a lot to get my money.

He had also mentioned in his text that he didn't make my new roommate pay him the security deposit. Guess what? he signed the lease renewal which made him technically be on the lease for the next year. He's lucky the management company made it slightly easier to find a roommate in time by only making the new roommate pay them half of the normal security deposit on our unit and not also make them pay the admin fee for switching names. The new roommate was never going to have to pay him the security deposit because that's not how it works.

My old roommate blamed me for not getting his security deposit. I can't see the future. I did not know the landlord would steal it. I lost mine as much as he did. I had also told my roommate that it is hard to find a new one too close to the school year so if he was moving out even after he signed the lease renewal he needed to tell me sooner than later but he didn't tell me until a week or too into August. I found a good match I think which is nice but it was extremely stressful for me and he didn't make it easier. 


I would clean up the apartment to show it (i had to do all of the cleaning including picking up his bathroom.) His girlfriend and her 3 kids were living there (sleeping over the majority of the time counts as living) for over a month. The toddler and the five year old would chase my dog around terrifying her whenever we came out of my room. They would make messes that I would clean up so I could show the apartment. He didn't even clean his room. At least three times that last month that I was trying to keep everything clean, he would have a barbeque and his friends would stay late into the night. They wouldn't be quiet at all. I put headphones in my ears so I could sleep and he would never clean up afterwards. I would. One morning I woke up to find my favorite pen in his beer mug. (im not petty enough to complain to  him but this is offmychest and I loved that pen. )

I also had to clean up all of his garbage and crap when he moved out but I did get him to come back to clean his toilet. (with my cleaner).

His latest reply was to not bring his girlfriend into it and again to stop running my mouth. Guess what? Your girlfriend living here is kinda pertinent to the conversation about our frustrations with each other. It was not an attack on her. And I do not get how expecting him to pay me is 'running my mouth'. What does that even mean? 

I'm not going to reply and while $24 can be a lot to a full time student living off of student loans and a (low hours paid-high hours non paid) internship, I don't even want it any more. Frankly I think he's probably drunk. Our recycling bin was always full of beer bottles and I don't drink. Also after his texts I honestly don't think I want him back in this apartment. I'm a girl and he's a lot bigger than I am. 

You can keep your fucking $24 you irresponsible POS.

edit: He wouldn't even be in the lawsuit for the security deposit if I hadn't of convinced him too. "

For the last two years I went to a community college. I did fantastic all A's and B's except for a D in a government class. It was my plan, go to community college, get most of my gen-eds done and then transfer to BU to get my major in Computer Science done. Right out of high school I had done a summer semester at this school and I didn't do so great. I figured it was because I was living on campus (I'm commuting now) and I just wasn't ready. 

Well the semester starts and everything seems to be going okay except the Java 1 class I have. I practice and study but nothing I can't pick up on any of it. Then just a few weeks ago I have 3 tests in one week, two on the same day. Java, College Algebra, and U.S. Gov ( I can't avoid this class.) Well I failed Java because I didn't submit the right files. I got a 40% on the Algebra because I couldn't remember the formulas. I got a 57% on the Gov. I don't understand, I studied for hours and I did this shitty. The next week I had an Art History test. I took that test and I felt great, figured I messed up on 2 but 2 out of 50 is pretty great. I got a 79% I was devastated. All of this just started to weigh in on me at once. The semester is half over and I'm failing 3/5's of my classes, including my major. I honestly though comp sci was right for me because if it wasn't I wouldn't know what I would do. 

All of this at once, it's so incredibly stressful. I'm pretty sure I'm starting to develop depression which is the last thing I need. I live at home, my parents payed for 4 semesters at community college, and this one here at BU. I don't know what I'm going to tell them, they were so proud of me. They had a class reunion last night, got home and asked me when I was going to apply for internships. That was the worst thing they could've asked me. It almost made me cry right there. I really don't want to let them down. I'm snapping at the people I work with. I don't know what to do with my life. I don't have anyone to confide in.

I guess I'm pretty good with tech support, but I don't know if that's something I could make a living out of and if I could I wouldn't know how to get formally trained in that or how to really pursue it. 

TL;DR: My life has become a giant train wreck and I just don't know what to do about it."

It is really starting to get to me albeit 3 months after the actual breakup.  

Long story short, I dated my girlfriend (21/F) for almost 2 years. It was a long-distance relationship and we met while studying abroad our sophomore year of college. While abroad, my girlfriend suffered a couple of health scares and had to stay in the hospital for days at a time and I was by her side through all of it and this really brought us closer. I was from the midwest and she from the east coast. I would fly out to her every chance I had including Thanksgiving and Christmas to spend time with her. We spent this past summer sharing an apartment and living together for our internships (we choose to find an internship in the same city so that we could spent more time together).

Living together was much tougher than expected, we were sharing one car, her internship was unpaid while mine was yet she was working longer hours than me some nights, it was tough supporting someone completely at such a young age. I fought with her about money and brought up when would she start making money.  In hindsight, the adjustment of being an adult for the first time and only spending time with each other took its toll on the both of us. Towards the end of summer, we broke up in a very bad manner and ended up no longer on speaking terms. 

She was my first love...we talked about marrying, settling down, kids, all that jazz which in hindsight truly makes me realize how naive love makes you but I don't regret any of it. With that being said, I have tried my very best and gave it my very all to move on. I've done no contact and we are no longer connected on any social networks at all. 

It is now approaching 3 months, and I find myself hating myself over what has happened starting recently. I tell myself I should have treated her better, more nicely, not have gotten so frustrated at her. She had tried to tell me before that I needed to change and treat her more nicely but I guess I didn't listen. She's now been seeing someone almost right after we broke up and that hurts too. My confidence probably is at an all time low along with my self-esteem. I don't know what to do, in fact, I find myself struggling to not reach out to her again, even just as friends. It is just tough and I'm here now asking for help. "

A little back story so you can understand my situation a little better. This past summer, my long distance girlfriend moved in with me so she could do an unpaid internship. I was bring in around $1,200 a month so I figured I would be more than fine financially to take care of us. I also made a huge mistake, by getting a credit card with a $1,200 limit. The original plan was to pay it off as soon as I got paid. Well we ran into financial issues (Car is a piece of shit). So I used the card as a safety net. 

Here's where I obviously went wrong. I had maxed it out. So I checked my credit score before all this and it was in the upper 600's. Not to bad for a college kid I've been told. So I was pretty proud of myself. I figured I'd be able to pay it off as soon as she went home. Well, she ended up getting very sick, so I paid her rent for the past few months and will for a bit. (Rare stomach virus, prevents her from eating without vomiting) So it's still maxed, and I'm only making minimum payments. 

I was unaware of what this would do with my credit score. Dropped it over 100 points and it's really bumming me out. So with a maxed out credit card, student loans, and something that happened when I was a kid...

My mother put comcast in my name, thinking there would be no harm and never paid it. Well it went into collections and fucked my credit score up.

Basically, I'm posting here because I'm stressed and have no idea how to fix this and am really fucking hoping someone here can tell me that my credit score can easily be fixed. I work three jobs and am a full-time student. I'm busting my ass to kick life's ass and this whole ordeal is making it hard to feel any accomplishment. 

Any advice, or good news?"

2j34sr,1,2014-10-12,"I (21F) have really hit it off with two guys (26M and 40M) on an online dating site. Both have unique appeal. Found out one is married, need to cut ties before I do something I'll regret.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2j34sr/i_21f_have_really_hit_it_off_with_two_guys_26m/,"**LONG POST, SORRY**

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Let's start off by saying I have daddy issues. I hate that term, but there is no other way to explain it. My father passed away when I was 11, so I've been without a father figure for literally half of my life.

I'm not generally attracted to older men, unless you count Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr. I don't actively seek older men. I couldn't even see myself *seriously* dating a 30 year old.

I'm in my last year of university and haven't had a boyfriend since high school. I am a liberal in a conservative city. An atheist in the bible belt. An educated woman among high school dropouts. And a closet kinkster in a world of vanilla sex. Needless to say, it is very, *very* hard to find somebody who would line up in all aspects of my life, so I've resorted to an online dating profile.

I decided to be incredibly open on my profile, because there's no use in lying or beating around the bush about who I am/what I like. After a little over a month and a half on this website, and several hundred messages, I have only *really* connected with two guys.

The first guy (Matt) is 26. Ivy league educated. Good job. We have compatible personality types (if you're into that sort of thing), and line up in every area of life according to our dating profiles (sex, lifestyle, politics, dating, etc.) This is pretty hard to find and pretty significant given the area I live in. We met at the beginning of September and really hit it off. We both felt a huge connection, almost to a scary degree. However, I am now 1,000 miles away for an internship and won't be back home until the end of the semester in December. We chat every day, either via text, facebook or Skype and I find myself drawn to him more and more. Like I said, we're so good together it's scary...and we've only met in person once.

The second guy is 40, a professional in the field I'm hoping to get a job in after graduation, compatible in all areas except religion. When he first messaged me, he said ""We don't have to date. I'd just love to get to know you."" Then he told me that I'm ""Fun to look at."" After a few days of messages, he casually mentioned he might have a job opening for me when I graduate. We met for lunch before I left for my internship. He is attractive, funny, driven. I honestly thought he just wanted to get to know me because we had a lot in common. Maybe it's my naivety, but I really didn't think he wanted anything sexual from this encounter. Mainly something like a mentor (think college professor).

A few days later he messaged me, ""Would you need/want a sugar daddy? I can help you out."" Even though I never brought up financial troubles (I actually told him I'd be graduating debt free).

I have never even entertained the idea of sugar daddy/baby, but I've had friends who have done it and it seems like a pretty good deal. I didn't know what to say. It shocked the hell out of me, so I told him it sounded ""Interesting."" He replied with some nonsense about loving my confidence; I ignored it. I wasn't *honestly* entertaining this idea. But it's an easy way to get money, LBR.

I talked to my friend who has been in this situation before and she told me that I'm overthinking this and this guy could be a contact I want later on in life. She begged me to meet him to straighten out details, but I had no time before I left for my internship. I continued to ignore his messages, thinking he'd get over it and find somebody else.

After three days of ignoring his messages, he offered to fly to the city I'm interning in so that we could meet again. Then he told me how much he'd be willing to pay and I nearly had a stroke. This made me uneasy. I continued to ignore him, but the more he'd message me (and the more I ignored), the more tempted I was to say ""Fuck it"" and agree to the deal.

This morning, purely on a whim, I asked if he was married, to which he SHOCKINGLY replied ""Yes.""

His profile said ""single"" the other day, but now it's left blank. I honestly don't know what possessed me to ask that and I don't know why he was so honest with me.

Now I'm stuck in a conversation with this guy, who I'm incredibly intrigued by...but know that I can't pursue anything with, no matter how much money he offers me (and it is an obscene amount that nobody in their right mind would turn down). He never explicitly said he wanted to have sex with me, but he said that the sugar baby/daddy thing is a kink for him. Now, I know I said I'm kinky, but adultery is *not* something I consider a kink. I told him I wasn't judging him (because I have questionable morals), and he repeated that he could ""help me out in several ways"" and that it'd be ""fun to mentor me.""

Before the marriage bombshell, I knew that if I ever pursued anything with guy #2, it wouldn't be anything serious...not like how it would be with Matt. With Matt, we actually have a shot of turning it into something serious and *good*, but the forbidden nature of guy #2 is fucking tempting the hell out of me.

I know if I don't cut ties with him soon, I am going to do something I regret. Please do not judge me. I know that this is fucked up. I was trying to think of ways to cut ties without pissing him off (in case I need some help for a job later down the road), but I honestly don't see how this can end well. No matter what I do.


---   
**tl;dr**: Met two guys on a dating site. One is close to my age, extremely successful for his age, and we really hit it off. The second is twice my age, and offered to be my sugar daddy (for a large sum of money per month). After a few weeks of messaging, many bordering on inappropriate, I found out he's married. I know that if I don't cut ties soon, I'm going to do something I regret. Advice on how to let him down easy without pissing him off? Or is there no way to do it and have it end well?"

Well as the title says...my mom is being abused.

She is with the guy for 2 years, and has been abused slowly but increasing gradually. He slowly distanced her from ALL her friends, then slowly made her burn every cent that she had with bills and payments. He forbid her to come visit me during week days, she is only allowed to visit Sunday afternoon (I stayed with my dad when she moved out), then he broke her phone and forbid her to do many things. Also blocked her from her family.

He has FULL access to all her email accounts, facebook, phone, and she can't talk on the phone next to him without being on speakers.

The times she tried to leave (like 4 or 5 times) he threatned her, saying he was going to kill her and dissappear, and also said he was going to kill her dog. He makes her come back by saying he is going to kill himself. Or by going to the hospital and telling her he is there.

He also has a 21 year old daughter that HATES my mom's gut. The daughter moved in with them and is making my mom's life even worse. She cleans and does everything for the girl and the girl treats her like shit. Her boyfriend demands that my mom drive the daughter around, and doesn't provide any gas money.

Anyway, I think y'all got the picture here. I already talked to her several times. My aunt (her sister) also tries to talk to her, but nothing works. I have showed her texts about emotional abuse, told her about the abuse cicle, said she should go to therapy because it is the ONLY way she will be free from this cycle....but it doesn't work.

And now me: I'm a wreck. Every time she starts crying saying she is afraid of him, that she is running from him, that he is going to kill her or the dog, or that he did this or that... it breaks me.

When she left our house, I became the ""woman of the house"". I do all the cleaning, cooking, washing. Note that she left me with MANY cats to take care of. And also my dad, who had someone to take care of him ALL his life and can barely cook to survive, can't bend to clean, etc. But my dad is the best and most kind human being on the planet, we have our fights but we are learning to get along better. On top of all that, I go to college (veterinary medicine) and also go to internship at the hospital after class at least 3 times a week. 

I feel more than overwhelmed, I feel that I'm on my breaking point. I got a very supportive boyfriend, but we're long distance until college finishes (in 1 year). 

I don't know what to do or how to deal with this. I honestly just want to cut her out of my life and not have to worry about this stuff anymore. I would go to therapy myself (I really want to) but I just don't have any money to spare (barely paying for food).

Anyway...I guess I'm just trying to hear some words about what could I do and also hear from you guys if cutting contact with her is way too much. Or...what to do? 

Sorry about the wall of text.

**Tl:dr:** I don't know how to handle my mom being abused. I don't know what to do and feel on my breaking point. Help?"

This is going to sound really petty but I'm worried about making as much money as possible for my upcoming graduation in May 2015. I go to a top ten school, and had an internship paying me roughly 7,000 a month this summer. However; I didn't receive an offer from them, so I went back to the job search in the fall. I currently have one offer for around 72,000 and a few more interviews next week. However I'm hearing of people who I consider roughly equal talents getting offers in the high 90,000 range, from return offers from their internship. Are return offers from internship usually higher than other offers? Do I have any hope of reaching the 90,000 range? I know this is a great place too be in, but all the debt I have is driving me crazy, that I won't be able to get an offer that high since I got no return offer.

Anyways, I'm about to graduate with a B.S. in chemE and my professors have always said with confidence that chemE's are very high in demand. However, only a few chemE related companies (mostly oil and gas) visit my school for recruiting each year (and it's a very large school), and they only have a handful of full time openings each year. It's very competitive, and only the best of my class were able to get those positions. I worked my ass off to apply for those golden opportunities but now they are gone, and my question is where the hell are all these jobs? I can't seem to find any entry level jobs on linkdin (all require experience)? I would literally go to any place on earth if it meant I could be employed after graduation. I have a 3.27 GPA and internship experience, so I feel like while I shouldn't expect to just get handed a job, I should at least be able to search for them. It is essentially crucial that I have a job lined up before graduation, so I'm very worried."
2j3ome,10,2014-10-13,I'm [21F] having doubts about an otherwise wonderful new guy [25M] after creeping his fb,doubtsaboutlove,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2j3ome/im_21f_having_doubts_about_an_otherwise_wonderful/,"Three months ago, I met a new guy during my short-term internship program that I ended up crushing on. Throughout my internship, he would do little things that would catch my attention, like inviting me to take a lunch break with him, taking extra time to oversee my progress, and hugging me goodbye at the end of the day. In the middle of conversation, he would mention frequently that he was single. At the end of the program, we traded numbers, and without the pressure of having to remain professional, we quickly started flirting.

I was the first to suggest that when he has the time, we could go for drinks together to catch up. He was thrilled at the idea but said that since he had an upcoming project, we'd unfortunately have to wait until his schedule cleared up. I was absolutely fine with that.

While texting, he mentioned that he had a free weekend off and was planning to go on a road trip with one of his friends from back home. ""Cool,"" I told him, ""I wish I could be as spontaneous!""

Two months later, we finally met up for the drink, and it was amazing to finally go on a date with him. Neither of us got drunk, but our chemistry was incredible. It turned out that we were extremely attracted to each other, and in the middle of conversation, he kissed me.

We've been in close contact and have been dating for a couple weeks so far. He's a very affectionate guy, and loves to hug and kiss me, and tell me how gorgeous he thinks I am. After every date, he lets me know what days he's available for the next one. It's been a while since I've meet a guy so wonderful, and while I'm not head over heels, it's only a matter of time. We've gotten physically intimate, but have not yet had sex. Regardless, it's evident that we both have incredible sexual chemistry: he's dominant and likes to pin my hands over my head before kissing me, while I wait in breathless anticipation. I've been considering having sex with him on our next date, and for me, sex is still a very vulnerable act.

So what's my point? Well, I recently added him on facebook, and he teasingly gave me full permission to creep. And I found that he might be seeing another girl back home, which completely took the wind out of my sails. They have a couple pictures together, all on her facebook, which she captioned with a heart ""&lt;3"" or with ""spending time with my love"". What?! Sounds pretty serious to me! Furthermore, I'm 90% sure that she's the one he went on a road trip with, and the pictures are only a few months old.

So, I'm pretty bummed that I might be the girl on the side, and if he's seeing her, I have no intention of being the ""other woman,"" and will break it off with him immediately. I don't know what to say to him the next time we meet, but I want this clarified ASAP. What should I do? Am I being overdramatic? Should I feel upset? Should I just cut my losses and run now?

Please read.",[deleted],gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/2j41q9/no_luck_at_all_landing_any_interviews_looking_for/,"EDIT:  I heard back, oddly enough, from a job and have talked with them today.  It's pretty spot on what I have done professionally in the past so I feel confident in that I can manage the tasks and learn a bit from it as well.  I can't say too much until I hear back but I will update with results when they come in. 



Alright, so I got a job working in an engineering office as a GIS/Drafting Technician 2 years ago, which I left a year ago for lack of being able to afford living in the area.  It took 18 months to land that job and it was something unsustainable on a single income.  I moved back home and began searching again while working a small job just to supplement the family income a little. 



I went to school in the south, got a Geography degree in which I focused all of my coursework on GIS studies.  My grades weren't amazing through my Sophomore year but I got into GIS courses and brought up my average quite a bit. I went from a C average to a high B average.  Really enjoyed the coursework and started searching out jobs my second semester senior year whether it was an internship or full gig.  No bites what so ever.  I was on a forum totally unrelated and asked for some guidance and was able to get a position through a member knowing someone at the top of a company.  I was actually denied that at first and they gained a new contract I guess so they did hire me on. 



Anyways, I have no idea what I'm doing now as I have been out of practice for some time but really enjoyed the work I've done.  I have an interview Wednesday but it is a civilian job, so I imagine a Reserves candidate will be chosen over myself for obvious reasons.  I have thought about an online Masters as my local school really just puts you into the same exact coursework and adds a lengthy paper on top of it and calls you a masters student.  I'm ineligible to even attend that school as I got my undergrad there anyways.   

If anyone knows of some learning resources and/or a good online masters program, I'd be interested in hearing about it. 


TL;DR : Got a job, realized my school didn't prepare me (nor did I) well for the industry, need help/resources."

Happy update for you guys.

Basically, the last time I told you that after she told me she loved me, and because I didn't say anything back, she was acting a little hurt. Well, I didn't quite say it back but I tried to show her. Arranged a nice couple of dates, a trip to a theme park and blew off a college day to spend her off day just with her, cuddling and all that.

I did talk to her about holding off on expensive gifts and gladly she understood.

However, the real magic a couple of days. Basically I had an appointment with the guy at out college who sets up internships. So we got there in her car, and I went inside. I figured it'll take me like 10 minutes, but once I was in there I thought that it'll take longer so I texted her to leave and come back in an hour or so. However, the appointment only took like 25 minutes, and he was closing up so I'd have to walk a long distance while its pouring cats and dogs. But I step outside and she was still waiting. I dash towards the car and ask her how come she didn't go. She said that she didn't want me to wait in the rain, in case the appointment got over early so she was going to wait the entire hour for me. I know it was a very small thing but it was a very big deal to me. So I just kissed her hard and told her that I loved her. It just came naturally, didn't have to force it or even think about it. She absolutely lit up.

Things are better than ever now.

* 1. How do I judge whether or not my application is good enough for the school I have selected? Essentially how do you figure out which university is safe/moderate/ambitious.
* 2. I am definitely looking for schools in area where its easier to get an internship and a job later on. People have often told me Bay area is the best.But does that mean I should sacrifice other good schools that have an excellent faculty for my program of choice?

Is this actually the case? Would there be a difference in the companies point of view if I pass on either December or February?

**Application deadline is Monday, October 20, 10pm EST.**

**What does being an intern entail?**  
We’re going to be honest with you upfront: it isn’t the most exciting job in the world. Broadly speaking, this is a clerical position. You will start out by handling the Request Your Mayor thread on a daily basis, processing all requests and adding them to the Find A Mayor Index. You will also process requests for updates to existing RMM threads via modmail. It’s counting, copypasta and knowing the alphabet.

There is room to grow in this position, and as you demonstrate ability and willingness, we will discuss giving you more responsibility, first on RMM and then perhaps into a promotion to full moderator on one of our subreddits. A few of our current moderators are former interns!

**What’s in it for me?**  
This position is for someone who already loves being part of our community and wants to do more to help us out. You will gain insight into how the community operates and how all three subreddits work together, and you will be able to discuss behind-the-scenes issues with the moderators. Basically, if the job itself isn’t reward enough for you, it isn’t for you.

**REQUIREMENTS**

* Ability to follow and apply rules.
* Good clerical skills such as alphabetizing and spelling.
* A keen eye for detail.
* Availability on a daily basis to handle the tasks assigned to you.
* Ability and willingness to communicate with the moderation team regularly and clearly.
* Ability to check in with us in IRC at least periodically.
* Exemplary history of active participation within the community.

As soon as I landed, I fell in love with the country. I absolutely love everything about it. I think the fast pace and climate really appeal to me. I want to give living over there a go!

I graduated a year ago from a university in the UK with a 2:1 honours degree in Web Development. I worked in Chicago for 12 months for a digital marketing agency as an intern 2 years ago. After I graduated, I went straight into working for a telecommunications company. I quit that job 3 months ago and set up my own limited company (in the UK) and now work as a contractor for a variety of clients (my main client being the company I interned at).

I'm full-stack web developer, with my speciality being open-source software. I know closed-source software is very popular over in Dubai (most jobs I've found are for .net positions). 

I've looked on Dubizzle, registered for job alerts from Indeed.ae, and frequently look at other job boards in Dubai and the UAE.

From what I can tell, all of the web development jobs are quiet low paid (compared to the UK) and I have only found 1 job which would allow me to work and live comfortably. 

So r/dubai, what are the chances that I'll be able to get a well paid web development job in Dubai? I've been told that getting a visa wouldn't be an issue (visa run etc). Can anyone help me out? I'd love to work in the Internet City, but I don't know how often those jobs come up!

I've been casually looking for other jobs (Engineering and I.T.) because I've been getting pretty over worked due to some staffing changes recently. I may be offered a position that not only pays more, but will offer some project management experience. This is great, but I feel like the longer I wait to get into Engineering the more difficult it will be. I also don't wan't to seem like a job hopper so I'm guessing I should at least put a year into the new position.
  
There are a few different ways I can think of handling this, I'm just not quite sure what the best in the long term. 
  
1. I pass on the opportunity and stick it out for the next 6 months and see what I can land after graduation.
2. I accept the offer and stick around for a year or so, then look for an Engineering job 6-12 months after graduation.
3. I accept the offer and look for a job straight out of graduation, but this means I'd only be with the new company 6 months or so.  

I'm almost certain if I decide to stay in I.T. I will regret it later even though I think it'd be easy to move up the ladder. I am good at I.T. but enjoy Engineering more, even if I'm not as strong in it.    
  
If you were in my shoes, what would you do? I should probably point out that internships are not an option at the moment because I need insurance and to be paid a certain amount to keep up on bills and pay off debt before graduation."

So, I'm wondering how long it would take to learn C++ to a degree where I could use it in an engineering environment.  I already learned some basic things like conditionals, declaring variables, etc.

Also, is C++ as useful in data manipulation and analysis as MatLab is?

2j5o0t,2,2014-10-13,"I'm having a lot of issues with self-confidence, self-esteem, and relationships with people. What do you think this means or how can I help myself?",whatdoidonow2020,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/2j5o0t/im_having_a_lot_of_issues_with_selfconfidence/,"Hi guys, perhaps this is the wrong sub-reddit, but I've found your conversations very cool and loved it last time I posted about something.

I'm 22, male, I have a lot of these feelings, I'm embarrassed I have them, and I try to mask them so I don't feel like an asshole, but deep down, they are all still there, so I'm just gonna say them.

I dated my best friend from kindergarten from 8th grade until January this year (girl). I've mentioned my concerns of sexuality with her for years, but it always just worked out for the time being. I realized in January it wasn't going to work with her anymore, and I have to be with a guy to be happy. She was devastated of course, and so was I. I don't think I did anything for two weeks other than cry.

I had lost what was essentially the only stable and part of my life that made me feel a sense of belonging and and acceptance. And was the only person in my life that socially and relationship wise I was 100% myself and confident. I tried to avoid this, but after knowing someone for so long, its kind of unavoidable.

I came out to my parents a couple months ago too, they were shocked, emotional, and still being weird and taking time to process it. I just feel completely out of place with them and don't feel like I belong at all, so I just try to avoid them for now to avoid the feelings and strange comments and questions they ask in hopes of understanding, but in reality they just hurt me. They still try to convince me I'm not gay, and tell me how much better life is being straight.

My best friend, who's my age, straight, and male, has been the only guy that has been pretty helpful in all this. I'm a really anxious person that tends to go on-and-on about things that bug me, he's been the only guy to sit down, talk about it calmly for a long time, listen, but then also not feed me to go on-and-on on repeat about things.

Me and him know 3 other guys that we hang out with a lot, and right now, essentially make up 90% of my social life. I've known these guys for a few years or more, but just recently have we all gotten really close (the last year or so).

I really enjoy hanging out with them, I never had many friends (literally my gf and one other friends at a time) growing up, and finding these guys made me really happy that there are people that are willing to do things with me. Right now I'm kind of depressed, and hanging out with them makes me really happy, and they are the people that I feel best to be around right now.

I have a lot of feelings about it though:

1. I always feel lesser than everyone else, they are all straight males, and after coming out, I just feel like I'm kind of the outcast, no one had any problems with it when I told them, they just act very confused, kind of shocked, and just sort of took it with no comment and carried on like nothing happened, which is a good thing, but at the same time, sort of left me feeling bad because I don't know what they think about it, I don't know how they view me faking being straight my whole life, etc.
2. Whenever they talk about girls, finding girls, and sex, I always just sit there in silence, or have very little to add with no excitement like they do, it really just makes me feel like I'm being pushed away or can't be relatable
3. If I was to state an equivalent fact about my sexuality like they do, its met differently, they talk about a date, everyone asks about it, is excited for the other person, etc. I said I was going on a date, they ask about it briefly, then move on like I never said it. I just feel the sort of awkwardness of me vs. them having a date.
4. I have a really hard time feeling like my relationship with them is the same as everyone else's. I see my best friend doing things one-on-one with them and having a conversation with one other person, and it just seems so much more natural, and both people just seem to genuinely enjoy it a lot more. No one ever usually hangs out or talks to me one-on-one, and when they do, it tends to not be very exciting, and I find myself trying to find things to talk about, as opposed to me seeing everyone else just have things flow naturally. I tend to be a pretty shy guy, but if other people just acted the same around me as everyone else I open up a lot more.
5. With all these things I just don't feel as important as everyone else, I always feel like if I wasn't around no one would notice
6. I always feel like my conversations and comments are never met with the same excitement and interest as everyone else
7. I never ask to hang out with people individually besides my best friend, and rarely initiate anything, I'm terrified, because I have nothing better to do, without these people I have no one. So I look desperate. And I'm not as interesting and cool, so I feel like they rather just hang with someone else, as it would be better because they would be able to feel the same thing I'm jealous of not being able to have with other people.

I can give an example of what happened last night that made me feel really shitty:

I asked my best friend if he wanted to eat with me and play this online game we all play together when I got home from a dinner with family, as I don't work today, and want to do something fun that night. He said no, he didn't want to, he was probably just gonna do homework until I got home, then he'd play the game with me, but over Skype and not in person for a bit.

Anyway, so when I get home, I log on to Skype, and him and our other friend are at his house playing together and having nachos and having fun. This made me really upset and slightly angry. I just shut up and forgot about it. But its exactly this kind of thing that makes me feel all these things. Why didn't he want to see me? Why didn't the other friend ask me if he could come over? etc.

They play on the same soccer team, two of them work together, and they all go to our same college. The first two happened as a result of being friends, and latter was just a coincidence. Because they do all these things together, I feel left out, and whenever I make a conversation about my job or what I did without them, its always shot down, but they can talk about their job for half an hour.

It just makes me feel even more excluded, as now they see each other without having to try, and I have to go out of my way to hang out with them, which just makes me look desperate, because now instead of us all being together naturally, I'm going out of my way.

They invite me everywhere, it just feels so different. Before I always had my gf, she was always my backbone, I never felt lesser, she was always there to take my mind off any of these feelings.

I'm working a one year internship right now, and I cannot wait to go back to school in January, that means I get to be around my friends more, I get to talk and see people that I only see at school, and I just feel such a better sense of community when I'm there.

But then I'm also scared since I feel like that's just masking the problems, and when schools done again, it will be the same thing.

One thing that I always feel like that sums up how fucked up I feel right now is I wish I could soar really high, have amazing relationships with people, do well in school, and put myself in a position where I feel like I'm doing better than them so I no longer feel desperate. That way I have other things to do and be proud of, and I can still consider them my best friends.

Which is really just messed up, because I'm essentially wishing I could soar high and make them look up to me and be slightly jealous, instead of me being jealous of them.

Thanks for taking the time if you read this, I try to do my best, be the best friend, be happy, and be a good friend, but in the back of my mind all these things are there."

2j5rjk,1,2014-10-13,AOTD Regulations,NTRX,NTRX,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTRX/comments/2j5rjk/aotd_regulations/,"Alright so in case you haven't heard, /r/ArtistOfTheDay is in a temporary haitus. Due to multiple dates being missed and a declining number of writers, the mods decided it would be a good idea to temporarily shutdown AOTD until it was back on top of its feet. With that being said, the mighty /u/Greypo, has decided to retire from his position and since he has left I will be managing the calender. But besides that, I think that AOTD needs a makeover in the way it is run because if anyone has ever been a part of it you know that we have a lot of moments where people forget to post and the rest of the team have to scramble to fill in the spot. AOTD has also had a problem with keeping writers as it is fairly time consuming(but fun!). Because of these problems I am proposing a few new changes that could possibly help AOTD run smoother and also give more opportunities to people.

---

###I. Recruiting:
Previously the way of recruiting members was hectic and unorganized. We would mass recruit and have a 5-7 new writers on the team with little to no training. In the end only 2-3 writers from that group would actually stay on the team and write multiple posts. A 50% drop-off rate is pretty terrible actually and it would cause problems. New users would reserve a date only to go AWOL and cause the rest of the team to scramble and make a new post that usually wasn't their best quality because it was rushed.

&gt;**The Internship:**

&gt;Similar to /r/SubredditOfTheDay, the internship would allow users interested in writing AOTD reviews to get optimal training and practice before becoming a full time writer. The internship would similar to:

&gt;* Atleast 6 month old account

&gt;* No net negative karma

&gt;* Write 3 AOTD posts in a month and have them reviewed by a full-time member

&gt;* If their ""practice post"" was given the ok by a senior writer they could reserve date and post it.

&gt;* Once fulfilling the post requirement(by completing 3 posts as an intern) they would become an official writer, allowed to reserve dates on the calender and make posts unassisted.

###II. Ranks:

&gt;I don't want this to sound like it excludes writers because it doesn't, just certain ranks have more responsibilities than others.

&gt;**Senior Writer:** The senior writers would be anyone who has been apart of AOTD for a long amount of time or someone who has showed an exceptional amount of dedication towards the subreddit. Senior writers would get more of say in group decisions but would also be required in making at least 3 posts a month. A senior writer would be designated by becoming a moderator of the all of the AOTD based subreddits. They would also have the ability to recruit interns and review the intern's practice posts(giving the intern's posts the ""ok"" I was talking about above). I've grouped the 2 different reasons in which a writer can become a senior writer below to help explain what I mean.

&gt;&gt;Time: If you have been apart of AOTD for let's say 4+ months and have been active the whole time. Then you would qualify to become a senior member. As long as the posts have been consistent in high quality they would be qualified to become a senior writer.

&gt;&gt;Dedication: If a writer shows that they are serious about AOTD and has dedicated a lot of time to writing posts, helping interns out, filling in missed dates(which we shouldn't have any of) they could be considered for becoming a senior writer. This option would have a minimum of 1 month as a writer but other than that could be available to any writer. 

&gt;Senior writers would be chosen by other senior writers or recommended by other writers(not the writer him/herself). Also writers who have been chosen as a senior writer could decline the offer if they wish as it will be a little more work compared to just being a regular writer. Also all current AOTD writers(moderators) would start of as a senior writer. However they could request to be a regular writer if they wish.

&gt;**Writer:** 

&gt;A writer is someone who has completed the internship and is now a regular writer at AOTD. They would be required to make 1-2 posts a month(more is better). They would also be expected to help interns and also fill in for missing dates if needed. Writers would be approved submitters of all AOTD related subreddits.

&gt;**Interns:**

&gt;An intern is someone who is interested in becoming a full time writer at AOTD but is still in the training. They would be given pointers by **all** members of the AOTD family and would have to write 3 posts in their first month which would be overlooked by senior writers. If the the intern is missing something on their post, it is required that they will fix it before being allowed to reserve a date on the calender. Senior writers and regular writers will also provide feedback to the interns on how to make superb posts and it is recommended that they follow the tips and tricks given by the writers. An intern can only reserve a date on the calender/post if it is passed by a senior writer. This does not mean that other writers can't help only that they can't ""ok"" a post.

###III. Eligibility:

&gt;AOTD is a pretty chill subreddit but that doesn't mean people can do whatever they want. 

&gt;**Posts:** Every writer must complete at least 1-2 post a month, every senior writer must complete at least 3 posts a month, and every intern must complete 3 posts in a month. Now obviously things happen and that's ok! If you're a senior writer, writer or intern and you know that you won't be able to make these requirements, that's ok! Talk to me and we can figure out a plan that will both benefit you and the subreddit! 

&gt;**Missing Dates:** When you reserve a date on the calender, you are promising that you will be able to make a post between the time of 12am-8am eastern on that day. However, we realize that things happen and emergencies come up! If you know you will not be able to post on your date let a senior member know(by mod-mailing the subreddit) as quickly as possible. If your date comes and you are absent and don't post by 10am eastern(noon), it will be assumed that you will not make your post for that day and we will scramble into overdrive to cover that post. The worst thing to happen is someone who misses their date and acts like nothing ever happened. If you miss your date, let someone from the senior team know and all will be forgiven. If you forgot to make your post just say you forgot. We'd rather have you be honest than lie about you ditching a post. As of now I don't have a rule in place to penalize a writer if they miss a date but if it becomes a problem one might be added like miss 3 posts in a 2 month time period and you're out. Emergencies of any kind are understood and we'd rather have you miss a reddit post than miss something important in **YOUR LIFE**. Please do not miss real life activities to make a AOTD post but we do expect you to already have a time period scheduled when you will post. 

&gt;Tl;dr... family &gt; reddit

&gt;**Comments/Opinions:** Your opinion is your own and what you want to say is up to you but if you post an opinion/comment **on an AOTD subreddit** that reflects poorly on AOTD or another user/part of reddit, than you will be asked to remove it. Failure to comply could result in removal from the team. I do want to clarify that the bolded **on an AOTD subreddit** is important. I don't care what you say about anything but if you say anything negative about AOTD(judged by senior writers) or say negative things about a particular user or part of reddit(judged by senior writers) on an AOTD subreddit you will be asked to remove it. You are repersenting AOTD and we would like to keep it civil here. If you want to protest your hate towards /u/Greypo's Big Toe do it somewhere else other than /r/ArtistOfTheDay.

---

These are proposed rules and **ARE NOT OFFICIAL!** Please comment below on what parts you like/dislike and how you would change them. I want to make these work where everyone will be happy but also provide some guidelines for the future to prevent further shutdowns of /r/ArtistOfTheDay.

^^Shout ^^out ^^to ^^/u/RespectfullyYours ^^for ^^some ^^of ^^the ^^ideas

2j5so0,2,2014-10-13,"[22/m] Dealing with uncertainty and trying not to lose my mind [21/f - her, not my mind]",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2j5so0/22m_dealing_with_uncertainty_and_trying_not_to/,"So I've been seeing this girl that I really like for the past 1.5 months and it seemed like everything was going very well. However things got much more confusing recently, and I'd just like some opinions on where I actually stand. (sort of a long read so please bear with me).

Some background: she's in her last semester at school in a major city (so she graduates in mid-December). I'm working and living about an hour outside of the city.

So we've been seeing each other on a pretty regular basis, usually at least once a week to go to concerts or just to visit. However she's very busy and getting busier with school plus a internship starting soon so we had said that we'll be hanging out a little less during the semester, but once she graduates we'll spend much more time together, and it was sort of implied that it would most likely turn into a relationship (or that's what I told myself).

We get along great and have a lot of shared interests, amazing sex, all that. However recently we had a long talk and she told me that she's been thinking about it a lot more and is not sure where she wants this to go. This is partially due to her not knowing exactly where she'll end up after she graduates and not wanting to feel tied down, which I totally understand (although there is a good chance the internship will turn into a full time job). But she said the other part is that she feels like ""that spark"" isn't there, which is what worries me. She said previously she felt like she *did* want a relationship because I was the type of person she should date (and was also attracted to and got along with) even though she didn't necessarily feel ""that thing"". Personally I do feel that with her, but that's beside the point. 

My hope is that maybe she's not feeling this because she's so stressed out all the time, but I would guess that's not the case. Regardless she said she still wants to hang out some weekends when she's not swamped with work and keep talking during the week, just taking things slowly, rather than just jumping into something (which it didn't even seem like we were doing before). 

So overall, things really haven't changed much since we had this talk. We'll still be spending time together and there's still a decent chance that things will work out after graduation, but I guess the uncertainty is starting to get to my head. I realize that the best thing to just is just continue along and let her decide when the time comes, but inside I'm freaking out and feeling like now she doesn't want to spend any time with me and is just pitying me, which is really not the case (I hope).

Also a point worth noting: her last relationship ended at the beginning of the summer, and she's still best friends with the guy. I don't have any issue with this, it seems very unlikely that they'll get back together, however he is a very jealous person and refuses to even meet me and resents me for spending time with her, granted she has spent less time hanging out with him because most recent weekends we've been hanging out. So I know he's giving her advice about this because they talk about everything, and while she's said he's just looking out for her and telling her not to rush into anything (because that's basically why they got together and eventually broke up, mistook friendship for a relationship) my gut is telling me that there's likely some strong ulterior motives behind that advice. Of course I can't say anything about that because he's her best friend.

So I guess what I'm getting at is, should I be freaking out as much as I am? Is it possible that stress has just gotten the best of her and once the semester ends things will be better? I just don't know what to think about this whole situation at this point and wanted some other opinions. So thanks for reading if you made it this far, and sorry about the wall of text. Also I really hope she doesn't stumble upon this or I'll probably looks like a crazy person :|

2j5tzd,1,2014-10-13,"If someone tells you that you appear older than your age because of ""how you carry yourself', are they lying?",[deleted],askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/2j5tzd/if_someone_tells_you_that_you_appear_older_than/,"** If this is too long for you just read to the TLDR at bottom**

I'm 25 and basically since high school people have told me I seem way older than my age.  When I was 20 someone thought I was 28.  As a woman, it's done a big number on my self-esteem because naturally I just worry that my skin is aging badly (which doesn't make much sense, because I take great care of it!)  

So I did what any concerned person would do and posted pics so that the mean anonymou Internet could have their way with me- and anonymous people online mostly believed I looked younger than my age, or my age.  And this is the INTERNET so I assumed they'd be mean.  Rarely did anyone think I looked older.  So naturally, I was confused.

So then I wondered if it was my clothing.  I posted some outfits on another sub, and the women told me that my clothing was a bit dated (mid-2000s instead of 2014) but that it was actually teen-type clothing and probably had nothing to do with the older age guesses.

Today yet another person thought I was older than my age.  I'm so sick of this happening because it's really consumed my self esteem (especially considering most other women seem to constantly be mistaken for teenagers- I don't know ANYONE ELSE my age who wants to look younger).  So I asked the person, ""Did you think I was way older?""  She said ""Not that much older, maybe 26 or 27.  I think it's how you carry yourself.""

Now, I want to believe it's the truth...but there's pretty much no difference between 26 and 25 so she was probably lying to be nice...PLUS I have no idea what ""carry myself"" means.  I don't walk around with a monacle and granny knitting needles constantly.  The only things about my personality that may seem older is my marital status (married) and my job title (not that senior, but I'm not an intern or assistant or anything).  Other than that, I have no idea what people mean.

So many people have said this to me (the ""way you carry yourself"") thing and it's so frustrating that I have no idea what they're talking about, and they can't even put it into words!  I'm afraid that it's something physical, but that they're lying and claiming something else..but if it was all physical why do people online think I'm younger? (And I'm sure a lot of people will respond saying that I""m being immature--so if I""m being immature why does anyone say I ""carry myself"" older?)

Anyway, I know I'm getting overly worked up about something inconsequential, but hearing, ""omg I thought you were so much older!"" as often as I do...well, as a woman it can really get to you and drive you crazy.  I'm aware that I'm focusing on it too much, but I'm not here for therapy so please let's not get into my priorities or mental health, this is just driving me nuts and I'm sure if it happened to anyone else it would drive them nuts too.

**TL;DR** People online who see my pics think I look young or my age, people IRL say I seem older bc of ""how I carry myself"".  So, have you ever said ""It's because of how you carry yourself"" in regards to a person looking older, and actually meant it?  If so, what did you precisely mean?"

2j60sq,4,2014-10-13,"[Proposal] Since /r/ArtistOfTheDay is temporarily shutdown, I would like to propose a new way of operation.",NTRX,ImaginaryNetwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork/comments/2j60sq/proposal_since_rartistoftheday_is_temporarily/,"Alright so in case you haven't heard, /r/ArtistOfTheDay is in a temporary haitus. Due to multiple dates being missed and a declining number of writers, the mods decided it would be a good idea to temporarily shutdown AOTD until it was back on top of its feet. With that being said, the mighty /u/Greypo, has decided to retire from his position and since he has left I will be managing the calender. But besides that, I think that AOTD needs a makeover in the way it is run because if anyone has ever been a part of it you know that we have a lot of moments where people forget to post and the rest of the team have to scramble to fill in the spot. AOTD has also had a problem with keeping writers as it is fairly time consuming(but fun!). Because of these problems I am proposing a few new changes that could possibly help AOTD run smoother and also give more opportunities to people.

---

###I. Recruiting:
Previously the way of recruiting members was hectic and unorganized. We would mass recruit and have a 5-7 new writers on the team with little to no training. In the end only 2-3 writers from that group would actually stay on the team and write multiple posts. A 50% drop-off rate is pretty terrible actually and it would cause problems. New users would reserve a date only to go AWOL and cause the rest of the team to scramble and make a new post that usually wasn't their best quality because it was rushed.

&gt;**The Internship:**

&gt;Similar to /r/SubredditOfTheDay, the internship would allow users interested in writing AOTD reviews to get optimal training and practice before becoming a full time writer. The internship would similar to:

&gt;* Atleast 6 month old account

&gt;* No net negative karma

&gt;* Write 3 AOTD posts in a month and have them reviewed by a full-time member

&gt;* If their ""practice post"" was given the ok by a senior writer they could reserve date and post it.

&gt;* Once fulfilling the post requirement(by completing 3 posts as an intern) they would become an official writer, allowed to reserve dates on the calender and make posts unassisted.

###II. Ranks:

&gt;I don't want this to sound like it excludes writers because it doesn't, just certain ranks have more responsibilities than others.

&gt;**Senior Writer:** The senior writers would be anyone who has been apart of AOTD for a long amount of time or someone who has showed an exceptional amount of dedication towards the subreddit. Senior writers would get more of say in group decisions but would also be required in making at least 3 posts a month. A senior writer would be designated by becoming a moderator of the all of the AOTD based subreddits. They would also have the ability to recruit interns and review the intern's practice posts(giving the intern's posts the ""ok"" I was talking about above). I've grouped the 2 different reasons in which a writer can become a senior writer below to help explain what I mean.

&gt;&gt;Time: If you have been apart of AOTD for let's say 4+ months and have been active the whole time. Then you would qualify to become a senior member. As long as the posts have been consistent in high quality they would be qualified to become a senior writer.

&gt;&gt;Dedication: If a writer shows that they are serious about AOTD and has dedicated a lot of time to writing posts, helping interns out, filling in missed dates(which we shouldn't have any of) they could be considered for becoming a senior writer. This option would have a minimum of 1 month as a writer but other than that could be available to any writer. 

&gt;Senior writers would be chosen by other senior writers or recommended by other writers(not the writer him/herself). Also writers who have been chosen as a senior writer could decline the offer if they wish as it will be a little more work compared to just being a regular writer. Also all current AOTD writers(moderators) would start of as a senior writer. However they could request to be a regular writer if they wish.

&gt;**Writer:** 

&gt;A writer is someone who has completed the internship and is now a regular writer at AOTD. They would be required to make 1-2 posts a month(more is better). They would also be expected to help interns and also fill in for missing dates if needed. Writers would be approved submitters of all AOTD related subreddits.

&gt;**Interns:**

&gt;An intern is someone who is interested in becoming a full time writer at AOTD but is still in the training. They would be given pointers by **all** members of the AOTD family and would have to write 3 posts in their first month which would be overlooked by senior writers. If the the intern is missing something on their post, it is required that they will fix it before being allowed to reserve a date on the calender. Senior writers and regular writers will also provide feedback to the interns on how to make superb posts and it is recommended that they follow the tips and tricks given by the writers. An intern can only reserve a date on the calender/post if it is passed by a senior writer. This does not mean that other writers can't help only that they can't ""ok"" a post.

###III. Eligibility:

&gt;AOTD is a pretty chill subreddit but that doesn't mean people can do whatever they want. 

&gt;**Posts:** Every writer must complete at least 1-2 post a month, every senior writer must complete at least 3 posts a month, and every intern must complete 3 posts in a month. Now obviously things happen and that's ok! If you're a senior writer, writer or intern and you know that you won't be able to make these requirements, that's ok! Talk to me and we can figure out a plan that will both benefit you and the subreddit! 

&gt;**Missing Dates:** When you reserve a date on the calender, you are promising that you will be able to make a post between the time of 12am-8am eastern on that day. However, we realize that things happen and emergencies come up! If you know you will not be able to post on your date let a senior member know(by mod-mailing the subreddit) as quickly as possible. If your date comes and you are absent and don't post by 10am eastern(noon), it will be assumed that you will not make your post for that day and we will scramble into overdrive to cover that post. The worst thing to happen is someone who misses their date and acts like nothing ever happened. If you miss your date, let someone from the senior team know and all will be forgiven. If you forgot to make your post just say you forgot. We'd rather have you be honest than lie about you ditching a post. As of now I don't have a rule in place to penalize a writer if they miss a date but if it becomes a problem one might be added like miss 3 posts in a 2 month time period and you're out. Emergencies of any kind are understood and we'd rather have you miss a reddit post than miss something important in **YOUR LIFE**. Please do not miss real life activities to make a AOTD post but we do expect you to already have a time period scheduled when you will post. 

&gt;Tl;dr... family &gt; reddit

&gt;**Comments/Opinions:** Your opinion is your own and what you want to say is up to you but if you post an opinion/comment **on an AOTD subreddit** that reflects poorly on AOTD or another user/part of reddit, than you will be asked to remove it. Failure to comply could result in removal from the team. I do want to clarify that the bolded **on an AOTD subreddit** is important. I don't care what you say about anything but if you say anything negative about AOTD(judged by senior writers) or say negative things about a particular user or part of reddit(judged by senior writers) on an AOTD subreddit you will be asked to remove it. You are repersenting AOTD and we would like to keep it civil here. If you want to protest your hate towards /u/Greypo's Big Toe do it somewhere else other than /r/ArtistOfTheDay.

---

These are proposed rules and **ARE NOT OFFICIAL!** Please comment below on what parts you like/dislike and how you would change them. I want to make these work where everyone will be happy but also provide some guidelines for the future to prevent further shutdowns of /r/ArtistOfTheDay.

^^Shout ^^out ^^to ^^/u/RespectfullyYours ^^for ^^some ^^of ^^the ^^ideas"

I have been writing about our journey and thought I would post a small piece here. Please don't drink and drive!",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2j6cdx/my_sister_lani_was_hit_by_a_drunk_driver_10/,"15th December 2013 7.15am

 

....... I had just arrived at Melbourne airport and my brother in-law Nick was waiting to pick me up. We got in the car and the first question I asked him was ‘how serious out of 10 is Lani’s situation?’

His response was ’10 out of 10.’ Sounding shocked that I wasn’t aware of the severity of the accident. It was then that I realized I had received the sugar coated version of events. It was fastly dawning on me just how serious the accident had been and I was not mentally prepared for it.

We finally arrive at the Alfred hospital, it’s only about 20 mins away from the airport, but it felt more like 5 hours. We walked in and the first faces I recognise are my Mum and Dad’s. They looked tired. They looked 15 years older than the last time I had seen them. Especially my Dad.

We had to be signed in and then we started to walk through the intensive care ward that Lani was in. I knew she was in bed #26. As I was walking down the corridor, arm in arm with dad, I was counting down to her number.......31, 30, 29, 28.....

My dad looks at me and squeezes my arm and says ‘ray, you need to prepare yourself. It’s pretty bad. ‘My dad then says something that makes my heart stop...’the doctors say she might not make it.....’ With tears in his eyes, my dad has given up on trying to be the tough guy. He lets the tears roll down his checks freely.

#26......the curtains are drawn and there is a swarm of doctors, nurses and interns buzzing around. This only adds to the drama and chaos. From behind the crisp white curtain, I can hear beeping machines and pressure valves releasing air. What happens next can never be erased from my memory; it will be burnt there forever more!! As dad squeezes my hand so hard it brings more tears to my eyes, a doctor moves the curtain across just enough for us to pass through in single file.

I see Lan for the first time......she is laying on her back with more tubes going into her then I dare to count. She has cuts and stitches all over her face including her eyelid.  Multiple bandages covering open wounds and holding my broken sister together. She still has blood stuck in her hair, under her fingernails; eyelashes.....the list could go on forever. She is cold, lifeless and bloated.

 All of a sudden nothing else in the world seems important!!  My instinct is to hug her, take her home and nurse her back to health.

I tread softly and carefully around her bed, trying not to step on any of the power cords, tubes etc.

Lani’s head has been shaved and her skull is extremely swollen, so are her eyes, her lids are closed but they are bulging out of her skull. It is at this time that the nurse tells us that Lani’s brain is 100% bruised, so severally in fact that there are red dots on her brain.  I notice tubes coming out of the back of her skull and 20 odd metal staples holding them in there. I’m told that they are draining fluid off her brain, trying to release pressure on the brain.

None of this seems real, you see this stuff on the news, this doesn’t happen to OUR family. I haven’t even begun to process any of this information, where does one begin?

I remember that it was around this time that there were minimal nurses, doctors etc in the room, and I took the opportunity to whisper in Lani’s ear. (I had a flash back from a documentary I watched about coma patients and how they can still hear your voice if you talk to them.)

I told Lani that she shouldn’t worry about Indy, SHE WAS SAFE!!! I told her that she only got 3 little stitches and she was being very brave. I told her that mum had her and she was safe. I told her that I love her so much and I knew she was strong enough to get through this.

What happened next broke my heart. A single tear rolled down the left side of Lani’s face!! SHE HAD HEARD ME!!! I couldn’t believe it.

It was at THAT moment I was reminded of just how strong my sister is and if anyone can do it, she can......."

Where do I really start?

I have 2 Javascript books (Eloquent Javascript and some other generic Javascript book), an HTML&amp;CSS book, and a Visual C# book I snagged from the bookstore. Of course, I have internet as well, and a LOT OF FREE TIME. 


How often should I be studying? Are any of these books okay to start with? What goal should I work towards in the next couple of weeks to stay motivated?

Thank you for your time; after reading the FAQ and lurking here I finally decided to make a post to see if the community would help me figure out a schedule/goals I could write out for myself for the coming months."

I apologize if I'm breaking the rules by posting this here. I know I should be doing this on /r/depression but there's such a thick pallor there, and the more I read that subreddit, the heavier this weight on my soul gets. 

I'm diagnosed with Asperger's, and very much INTJ. I over-analyze and over-think things, and I'm cognizant that my overthinking has brought me to this point. But I think I really need help from those who think the same way I do. 

Now, where do I begin?

I am:

* 27
* a foreign student from Singapore who has been studying in the US for 3 years.
* an International Relations major.
* was supposed to graduate this Spring, but medical and surgical complications happened. I missed at least 60% of classes.
* I committed plagiarism in order to alleviate my workload, and was caught. Even though the punishment was light as the act of plagiarism was on a research paper plan, I decided to apply for medical withdrawal
* I am now a super senior
* During my surgery period, I received and accepted an offer to write an entry for a prestigious encyclopedia for political science. But I never got to writing it.
* I returned to Singapore to take a break for 1 term. I then took on an internship with an industry advocacy NGO to pass the time and make myself useful. I accepted a research project within the NGO
* I have completed basic research for the project and all I need to do is to write the sucker
* But I can't. I stare at MS Word, and I just fucking can't. 
* NGO asks me to write a fluff piece for the quarterly newsletter. I finish it without fuss and boss praised me for it.
* But I still fucking can't write the fucking fucker
* Then I think about the encyclopedia gig and what a useless fucker I am. I didn't even tell them that they should find someone else
* Grad school application season is here. I want to start my applications but I can't. I don't even like myself enough to sell myself to grad schools.
* 3 weeks later I still can't write. I'm sitting in the office feeling like the most useless fucker in the universe
* I lose all interest and derive no pleasure in what I usually like to do. Video games feel so empty. Reading... nothing. Painting my Warhammer 40k shit just results in nothing. I don't even get hard from porn anymore.
* I checked on my insurance policies and discovered I have $800,000 in life insurance. Dad has nothing left in his retirement fund because he's sent two kids overseas for school. Mom had Stage 3 breast cancer and defeated it. It may recur anytime. I feel like a financial sinkhole for them.
* I come to the conclusion that I hate myself and deserve to die.

The John Adams quote used to inspire me for my pursuit of an academic career:

&gt;I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.

But I read it now and no longer have any fucks. Reading about Hong Kong, Syria and Ukraine would have lit a fire in my belly to write op-eds for my student newspapers, but I just don't give a shit anymore. Those people can die for all I care.

I need help. I seriously need help. I have enough of a theory of mind to be aware that I do, but I can't stop the self-loathing and I cannot help myself. I think of myself as a plagiariser and because of that I don't have any place to consider myself of any intellectual or academic worth. This country has high-rise apartment blocks all over the place and it really is no trouble for me to walk to the nearest one and fling myself off the top floor. What can I do?!"

I am from Ireland, with citizenship. I am studying ""Computing in Game Development"" in a fairly unknown IT. (4 year Hons. Bachelor Degree). It covers the fundamentals of CS.

I have since realized that I probably don't want to work in games. (but it's a nice way of keeping the degree interesting at least). I am finished 3/4 years, and am currently doing a year long internship with a company Citrix in the UK. Seeking to work in the US after graduation.

So when I graduate I'll have done 1 year long internship, working mostly in SDET type role, lots of automation etc, with some really nice projects I to be able to say I contributed to / talk about. Also have a lot of project work from my degree, (3D games with lots of cool math etc.) as well as some small solo development. Python scripts that crawl a blog's server and downloads music, C++ library code that deals with perceptual image hashing, stuff like that. All hosted on github / good things to talk about.

So right now it looks like I might have two options. 

I hear first off that working for a company with offices in both locations helps (which Citrix happens to have). I hear that you usually have to work there for a year, and then they can sponsor you with a visa to transfer. Would something along the lines of my internship count towards that? Would they be in the position to sponsor me for a position in the US after graduation?

My second option would simply be to apply to grad positions in the US, and hope to get through with someone who is comfortable with sponsoring someone. It seems like there is going to be a relatively small number of large companies who would routinely go down this road, so it seems kind of a long shot. Would you think I would have a chance given that I don't exactly have a big name degree but some fairly solid experience?

Thanks in advance for any input!, I appreciate this is a bit of a common topic but I couldn't really gauge an opinion from topics I searched through. I don't have a current CV as I'm employed for the next 9 months~, but I could drum one up if it's of interest."

Do firms typically recruit harder for students who are in grad school ?
I know they offer internships and sometimes full positions for people with only an undergrad/ no CPA.


Reason I ask is because I got turned down for an internship by 4 firms( top 16 firms) however I got an internship offer with a smaller firm.

I can choose to accept the offer and probably lock a job offer upon completing a masters degree/CPA exam, or I can just decline the offer go straight into grad school and then apply again next recruiting season and hope one of these firms hired me.


Advice please

2j7w2p,6,2014-10-14,I [23/F] am having issues with my landlords/roommates and am at such a loss...,cocoanutter,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2j7w2p/i_23f_am_having_issues_with_my_landlordsroommates/,"Warning: wall of text.  

I rent the upper floor of a ranch style home from an engaged couple (the guy owns it) that are about the same age as myself [24/F and 27/M].  We clicked well when we first met and I was very excited to move into their home, they seemed to feel the same.  One of the big selling points for me to choose them was how clean they are; the place I was living for a few months beforehand was with 4 other girls, 2 of which were extremely dirty and it drove me crazy, so I was quite happy to find a nice, fun couple that had the same standards of cleanliness as I do.  

Within the first week there were two incidents that made little flags pop up in my head, but nothing serious at all, they seemed pretty minor.  The first was when I unpacked some of my kitchen wares, I was told by the female roommate that I didn't really need to unpack much of my own stuff as they had most things already, and some of the things I had on the counters didn't fit with the style she was going for in the kitchen (colors, etc).  No big deal, it was true, but I still had a few things of my own that I wanted to use (certain glasses I liked, a wooden spoon I use for everything, little unique pieces like that).  Keeping these things out was fine apparently, but she was oddly adamant that I not have any of my things besides food out showing on the counters... Fine, a little stringent, but not a huge deal. After all it's her house! The second thing was a similar situation with the bathroom.  They told me when we were discussing whether I would rent there or not that the upstairs would be my domain with the exception of the shared kitchen.  So, I thought it rather normal to expect that I could have my bathroom supplies on the sink counter in the bathroom.  Apparently not - nothing but the hand soap dispenser is to be on the counter, so I had to try to find a way to fit all my things into two sliding drawers under the sink and between their things in the hallway closet (they have things stored up there even though they primarily live out of the basement).  Again, not a huge deal, but a little odd.. I went out and bought a rolling tote for the things that wouldn't fit, and that's now sitting in a cramped corner in my room because she doesn't want it in the bathroom.  

I'm glad they're clean and neat people, but things have gotten more odd and unreasonable as time has passed.  The next issue goes back to the kitchen.  I eat a specific diet that requires mostly home cooking, and a lot of seafood.  Now I know fish doesn't smell great, but when it's fresh and cooked properly it doesn't *stink*, at least not to normal people.  The female roommate would comment indirectly that the kitchen smelled bad any time I cooked dinner that included seafood (i.e. she wouldn't tell me directly that it smelled bad, would say things like ""oh man it stinks in here!"" when I was in the conjoining room and she knew full well I could hear her).  Again, I'm a very clean person, so I would cook my food, eat it, wash all my cookware immediately, and any leftovers would be wrapped up airtight to be stored in the fridge immediately.  Nothing was left sitting out or left in the trash can to rot, yet she'd always make a comment about the smell.  I almost considered cutting homemade seafood out of my cooking routine because I didn't want to disturb her apparently overly-sensitive nose, but after talking with a couple friends determined not to do so because I was doing everything in my power to make sure things were cleaned up and sealed properly, and it's not my issue that she has an issue with a smell of fresh fish, which is an important part of my diet.  I cook it less now that summer is over so this hasn't been much of an issue anymore, but it was rather uncomfortable at the time.  Last week I had an evening where I was doing my bulk cooking, and again, cleaned up immediately after I was done and stored everything properly.  When I walked into the house from work the next evening, I said hi to her, and she said hi back rather quickly, followed by ""ya I just got home a few minutes ago and it stinks in here! Maybe something didn't get washed down the disposal very well.""  Rather passive but.. whatever. Due to the previous fish smell issues, I have taken *extra* care to be as clean as possible in the kitchen, so to hear a comment like this rubbed me the wrong way since I had done everything possible to make sure there wouldn't be any smell.  The trash and recycling was taken out, the dishes were all washed completely, all my food was packaged tightly in the fridge, and I'm not one of those idiots who puts things down the disposal that it's not designed to handle.  I told her I didn't know what the smell could be because I took out the trash and cleaned up after myself; nothing was said after this (it's been about a week).  

I leave the day after that incident to go out of state for a weekend vacation.  Come back, hoping there's no reason for them to complain about anything since I hadn't been there.  Sure enough, this morning something happens.  A little background for context first: I work full time days (8-5 M-F) and also am completing my bachelor's degree, which right now means working 20-30 hours a week of an internship on top of working.  Needless to say, I don't get much sleep or have much downtime, so when I have the time and energy to run errands, I do.  Last night at about midnight I finally had some time to go grocery shopping.  I use the front door of the house, they always use the side door.  When it's dark, I leave the porch light on so that I don't have to come home in pitch black by myself.  We don't live in a terrible neighborhood, but there's a shady area just next to ours that has plenty of police attention and makes me a bit nervous.  So, leaving a light on so that I don't have to fumble to get my phone out for light along with trying to handle my house keys while carrying multiple bags of groceries by myself seems like a pretty reasonable step of action in my mind.  I leave the house and as I get into my car, which is facing the kitchen windows, I see a light come on.  Maybe they're just getting a drink from the kitchen, whatever, barely take the time to register it in my brain.  Then I drive up the driveway (it's a pull-through from an alleyway) and turn onto the street in front of the house - the porch light I had *just* turned on has been turned off. Um. .... So I text them both (didn't see which one had come upstairs, so I wasn't sure who to direct the message to) telling them I will be home in 20 minutes &amp; I had left the porch light on so that I don't have to come home alone in the dark, it's a safety thing.  I tried to word the message in a very neutral, non-confrontational way.  Didn't hear any response that night, but got a text this morning, from the male roommate.  I'm shocked by his response... I'll break it down into pieces, with my thoughts about each part:

""Well then there is no need to leave the house for 20 mins at midnight"" 

 - ...I'm sorry, we're adults, and you know how busy my schedule is, who are you to tell me when it's appropriate or not to run the errands I need to get done?

...""there's nothing unsafe about this neighborhood""

- are you not aware of the crime that happens frequently literally one block from our street? Also, I'm sorry but as a man you just don't have to think about the same safety concerns that I do as a woman.  Yes, there *are* unsafe things about this area that I have to worry about.

...""if you're that worried about it, I'd hope you have some other way to defend yourself other than a light""

- fair enough, though why is it such a big deal that I have a light on? What's the problem? It's not like the light can be seen by you when you're in the basement.

...""also, the squeaking in the floors is amplified a lot downstairs. We just try to deal with it but it's really loud sometimes.""

- I'm not sure what the relevance is of this to the light situation, but I'm guessing when I came home last night to put groceries away the squeaking through the floors was a problem.  Now, I also prefer quiet roommates, so it is no exaggeration when I say I am VERY respectful of the fact that their bedroom is below my living room, and therefore try to be as quiet as humanly possible. I take off my shoes in the entryway to reduce sound, walk more on my toes than heels and am very conscious of trying to step as quietly as possible. I also take great care not to slam around the fridge or cupboard doors, set down bags and food items lightly on the counters, and anything else that needs to be moved around I do so in the most quiet way I possibly can. Other than learning how to float through the fucking air, I literally do not know how I could possibly reduce the sound any more than I already am.  

I think the part of the message that bothered me the most was him telling me there's no reason to leave the house at midnight.  That *really* is rubbing me the wrong way... I have things to do when I have time to do them, and nothing is going to change that.

In response, this is what I said:

""Ok, well I'm sorry.  With how busy I am sometimes I don't have time to get all my errands done until it's late, last night I had to get groceries.  I do my best to walk quietly and be as respectful as possible when I have to be up and moving around when it's late.  I'll try harder.""

I feel like that was fairly calm... haven't heard anything back.  I don't expect any kind of apology, though it would be nice to know he understands that I'm not *trying* to be loud or leave the light on just to raise the electrical bill.  

Here's where the advice-seeking part comes in.  Even though it's from my POV, I've truly tried to relay these situations in as neutral a way as possible - no exaggerations or filler words have been added to the dialogue.  I feel constantly like I have to walk on egg shells when home, that I'll be doing something wrong, not up to their standards, or too loud, even though I (and everyone who knows me) consider myself an extremely clean and quiet housemate.  I can't help that their floors creak... I can't help that my every vigorous effort to keep the kitchen clean and smell-free is no match for her sensitivity... what the hell do I do?  Any time I've explained myself or apologized (even when I felt I shouldn't have to apologize), nothing changes and I'm not sure where to go from here.  Do I look for somewhere else to live after only being here 3 months?  How would you handle this? I'm drained, always uptight at home, and very sad that the original connection we felt as potential friends has basically now been destroyed.

I'm 23 this year, I have a year and a half minimum to complete my bachelor's degree(Computer Science), and I am working at a broker-dealer in the Operations department.

I managed to land a full-time position(was an intern) by automating many processes in Excel via VBA which freed up the developers time for company-wide issues.

I make 44K base, with O/T and had a 12k bonus last year.(NYC)

This isn't my first full-time semester since i started working, but it seems I took on more then I can and am falling behind in my courses.

My problem is I don't like finance, I feel that my job is either boring (My job description is just daily tasks- glorified button pressing essentially), OR If i am assigned a project, then I feel like an extremely underpaid developer. 

I'm contemplating quitting my job, and finding an internship in a tech company for some pocket change, this way I can attend school full-time, but then I would be losing my salary, benefits, and it might not look good to future recruiters saying that ""I couldn't handle the workload"".

The alternative is to cut down on classes, but I dont wan't to spend years just to get a bachelor's degree, while either being bored with my work or underpaid for my additional projects. 

(Not to mention that I had a chance to internally transfer to a Trade Analysis(Front/Middle office) position, and that chance was taken away only because of my degree.) The point is that I don't want my degree to hold me back from other opportunities. 

Just curious on your inputs. Thanks!

2j89j6,1,2014-10-14,I switched fields and I'm back to square 1. What do include in my new dreadfully barren resume?,coldfire323,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/2j89j6/i_switched_fields_and_im_back_to_square_1_what_do/,"This is a very general question, so no resume linked.

Context:

Graduating with a BS in computer science in Dec '15. Switched from a BS in Psychology last semester. Right now the goal is just internships, I am in no position to apply for a job yet.

I've been lurking the various past and present topics in this subreddit and the occasional Askreddit with a resume proofreader. I'm concerned because I'm consistently seeing advice to not to include coursework or experience in irrelevant fields. That's all I've got though! Aren't these internships expecting students with no experience anyway? I'm noticing people having trouble fitting everything into one page while I'm sitting here with the opposite problem...

tldr: How do I squeeze blood out of a rock?"
2j8ezp,0,2014-10-14,Internships: Working with outdated / not innovative products and portfolio,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j8ezp/internships_working_with_outdated_not_innovative/,"I just finished my bachelors studies and I have solid two years experience as a full stack developer in which me and my team did tons of research and development. We worked on a project that was on the innovative side and we mostly used modern and creative tools to accomplish our goals. The project was a success and we had lots of fun exploring and testing everything new but above all I loved how innovative and inspirational the startup world really is. 

The country in which i'm residing has a lot of job and trainee offerings for developers and most of them claim to be on the innovative side. However when I read the requirements and offerings of the listing I notice that all of them include training or require a skill set that is in my opinion very outdated. Starting from supporting old CMSs (Joomla, Type3) etc., using MySQL and PHP combined with old JS Frameworks.

Now I don't want to seem arrogant or anything but why bother? Why bother teaching interns outdated stuff? Why bother building new technologies based on that old same stuff? Isn't researching and innovating a field where you constantly have to look and explore the newest technologies? I would understand if it's about supporting old software but that is mostly not the case.

Like this company for example claims to create ""smart"" and ""innovative"" apps for Android, yet it forces its interns to use Eclipse and hasn't heard of AndroidAnnotations or Square Spoon. Why would anybody do that to themselves?!

Or another example: a company claims to be just as ""innovative"" and ""modern"", yet requires jQuery, Wordpress and Bootstrap as a skillset to develop the newest web apps. Hardly ever heard of AngularJS or Dart, Single-page apps and stuff. 

I don't want to waste 3 to 6 months of my life coding with outdated IDEs and frameworks still using session stores instead of JWS. This are just very small examples but you get the idea. And no, I'm not the guy that screams ""Relational DB's don't scale"" or ""Rails is slow"", ""mongoDB FTW!""

So why the hell would anybody pursue a career down that path? I've already given up looking for internships or job offers in the technical field because there's nothing that can truly offer me ""innovative"" stuff. I love designing and coding, I love working with modern frameworks, yet it seems nobody wants the world to go down that road. And keep in mind, I'm talking about innovative agencies, that claim to be the top notch in ""smart technologies"". 

Funding is a bit scarce right now so I need to find a half-time position for a few months - ideally an internship.
So what should I do? Should I start looking for other job openings at startups? Or change the field, like enter IT Research Projects ? Something with an IT background but focused more on researching and planing innovative projects? I really don't see any future for me as a developer in those openings.

tl;dr: cynical rant: everybody claims to be ""innovative"", ""smart"", ""pushing forward"" yet uses outdated shit to create more shit."
2j8h0a,3,2014-10-14,Exercise and sleeping,Wizzowsky,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2j8h0a/exercise_and_sleeping/,"Backstory:

When I was in high school I always had a really hard time getting up in the morning. Even when I had motivation to do so it was still very hard to drag myself out of bed no matter if I went to bed early or late. 

Fast forward to college, suddenly it is much easier. Still not perfect but I am getting up much better. Get to my senior year of college and I start go to our local climbing gym at least 3 times a week. First time I have ever really dedicated time to exercise in my life. That last year was the best I had for sleeping and waking up.

Now, what would be my 5th year of college I am doing an internship and over the summer and now into the fall for the internship my sleep pattern has been falling to pieces.

Question:

So, the only thing that I can really pinpoint as changed is in high school I was pretty lazy. Didn't do much, was a little fat, etc. When I got to college my eating habits changed (basically just ate less, not really different food) and I started walking everywhere. Last year I was climbing all the time as well and did occasional biking and things as well. Now as summer and fall have gone on I've slowly gotten lazier and lazier, doing less and less. It is hard because I can't walk anywhere where I live and my internship schedule is so irregular it is hard to set up a schedule. So the question is; is this pattern I noticed a possible cause of my issues getting up in the mornings? Is it possible that being active effects my sleep enough that I don't sleep for 12 hours straight (as I did last night, even though I tried to get up earlier slept through my alarm)? Or is that unlikely and it is something else?

Any input anyone has would be greatly appreciated. It is just a kind of wild guess really so feel free to let me know if I am completely off track."

Should be graduating in the spring, but due to financial issues, had to take some time off and graduation is being pushed back to next fall or spring 2016. I've wanted to be a lawyer since I was in the 3rd grade, but I'm having second thoughts since the job market is crap.

Every fall and spring, my university hosts a ""law school open house"" type thing for undergrads interested in law school. You go to the law school, learn about writing your essays/getting recommendations/passing the LSAT and can meet practicing attorneys in the area.

I met my boss (let's call him Jeff), in September 2013. I had decided last minute to go to the open house. Jeff's dad owns the firm where Jeff is a partner. 

He was talking to some other undergrads when I was passing his table and he paused their conversation to hand me some brochures and stuff about the firm he works at. I continued on around the tables and about 30 minutes later, was tapped on the shoulder by Jeff who had sought me out to ""talk.""

We stood there talking so long that the open house had ended and people were cleaning up. He told me to not give up on law school because the industry can always use ""enthusiastic lawyers.""

Jeff told me they'd have job openings around January (mainly for research interns) and we exchanged business cards.

By the end of the semester, I had decided to take time off in the spring to work more and save money. I had interviewed for a second job around Thanksgiving and was waiting to hear back from them.

On December 10th (a week before my 21st birthday), I got a call from Jeff which surprised me. I seriously thought I'd never hear from him. He told me they had openings for research analysts, and he needed a personal assistant, but I told him I was waiting to hear back about the second job. After a week of him calling every day telling me to come in for an interview, I finally gave in. He hired me on the spot for the PA job and offered me more money to work 9-5, five days a week than I would get working 18 hours a day six to seven days a week with the other jobs.

I began working at the firm by the end of the month. Jeff is young for a successful attorney, turned 40 this year. Attractive, fit, funny, intellectual. Over the first few weeks, I really got to know him. We were alike in many ways...enjoyed the same recreational activities, music, books etc.

After a month or so of working, Jeff started asking me to lunch with him. Which progressed to going running together after work. Which progressed to dinner 2-3 times a week. By the beginning of February, the relationship had turned physical. Jeff began staying at my house a few nights a week because his office is in the city (about 2 miles from my house), and he lives on the outskirts...a 30-45 minute commute.

For his 40th birthday in April, we flew to the Caribbean. That's where he told me he loved me, which freaked me out at first because I had never been in love. We were going on trips about twice a month, usually just on the weekends, but sometimes he'd take off Thursday/Friday to give us more time together. His brother (who also works at the firm), knows about our relationship, but his father doesn't because he has a strict ""no fraternization"" policy. And it's not hard to hide from him since I can probably count on one hand how many times his dad has been in the office since I've started working here.

By June of this year, Jeff began letting me do some clerk work for him and his brother, which is usually left to recent law school grads. Not people who still haven't earned their bachelor's. He told me I had ""earned it.""

Jeff constantly tells me cheesy things like ""I've never felt so alive as I do when I'm with you"" and ""You make me want to be a better man."" Sometimes I feel uncomfortable when he says these things, because neither of us are particularly affectionate, so it always catches me off guard. He's been doing it more frequently in the past moth or so.

I started back at school this fall. I work in the firm every day, but Jeff works around my school schedule and still pays me the same (even though I'm working less), which I'm thankful for because I don't know what I'd do without this job.

Jeff never wears a wedding ring. Doesn't have pictures in his office. The few times I went to his condo, there were no clues to a wife or *kids*. He never told me about a wife or kids. The few times we talked about exes he'd say things like ""All the girls I dated in the past weren't as adventurous or fun as you"" and ""They can't compare to you."" And he'd shut down when I'd ask for details, making excuses like ""The past is the past for a reason.""

Well, fast forward to today. Jeff came in talking about our upcoming trip in December (for my birthday and Christmas). We went to lunch with his brother and came back to the office. I answered a few calls until I got one from a woman, ""Mary."" The conversation was along the lines of ""Hi, this is Mary. Couldn't reach Jeff's cell, can you let him know that Bella is sick and Laura is picking her up from the school, so he'll need to get her from Laura's?""

Laura is dating Jeff's brother. I don't know a Mary, never heard the name...so I get on Facebook to do some investigating (Jeff doesn't have FB) and I find this woman, Mary, who has Jeff's last name and tons of pictures of them together on various trips. She hasn't uploaded any pictures from any trips since 2011, but I went back through her stuff, and there are tons of pictures from 2005 to 2011 of them together and **THREE CHILDREN**. The last one was born in 2011. The other two, she had between 2005-2007, and according to her ""highlights"" she married Jeff in 2008.

I broke down in the middle of the office. Jeff's brother came out to see what was wrong. I couldn't say anything to him about it, so I told him that I was getting bad cramps and it was painful. He went and got Jeff who told me to take the rest of the day off and he'd be over later. I don't know what to do. I don't want to see him or talk to him. I wrote the note down and stuck it on his bulletin board like I do with all the other calls, so he'll see it soon, if he hasn't already.

---   
**tl;dr**: Been in a physical relationship for 9 months with my boss. We love each other, spend tons of time together...but today I get a call from a woman that was suspicious.

I've also done a boat load of free courses on sites like coursera to learn programming &amp; data analysis. Since I'll be working mostly on my bachelor project during the spring, I would like to start looking for data scientist internships. What's a good way to go about it? I live in Los Angeles so there are lots of tech companies around, do I just email their HR departments?

I'm also looking in to the possibility of doing my bachelor project on behalf of a company (my university is supportive of such initiatives), and possibly use that as a way to get an internship. How would I go about getting in touch with the right people and the right companies? I would love to have an internship under my belt before I start grad school so I have a decent shot at getting a job while completing it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

2j90dc,21,2014-10-14,My experience. I hope someone reads my story.,NerfHerdess,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2j90dc/my_experience_i_hope_someone_reads_my_story/,"I would like to share my story with you regarding Minnesota School of Business. The term “crooks” does not even begin to describe how they operate.

Once I was young and naive with a bad high school GPA but ambition.  I applied everywhere for college when I was 23 yet no one would take me. Except one. There it was; my golden beacon of opportunity. I enrolled at MSB for paralegal studies to pursue a career in law.  

Admissions was so nice, letting me take out 10x the amount of student loans anyone probably ever should because they told me it would be much easier on me if I didn’t have to work and I could even use my student loans to pay my rent!

I excelled greatly in the subject and loved every minute of it. I couldn’t believe how easy it was.  I realized quickly that not a lot of my teachers actually had teaching degrees. One was an old retired attorney, another a paralegal. But they did not go to school to teach, nor had they ever taught classes before.

A semester away from graduating with my bachelor’s degree I fell very ill and was unable to attend classes. I figured I would just drop out for the time being and re take the semester.  I searched online for potential jobs and internships out in DC. My goal was to work for the department of justice and work my way up the paralegal ranks. “Please select your school from the list below.”  No matter how hard I looked, or what company I went to look for jobs, my school was never listed. 
That’s when I found out that my school was not accredited. At. All. No one would accept a degree from this imaginary fake school.  I did not go back to finish my semesters.

Years pass. I am a paralegal, without a degree, working in a firm that I helped open.  I got a job working the corporate books for a firm but showed immense potential so another attorney whisked me away to start up our own.  We are successful, busy and I love every minute of it. I helped build something and I am so pleased with my life. My attorney mentions that I would be a great lawyer.

Looking to transfer my credits to school to get into law school I was heartbroken. Not one single “accredited” college would accept any credits for transfer. I would have to take 4 more years of college over again THEN go to law school for 4 years. At 27, this is just not an option. Especially after porking out close to $62,000.00 for “private” college at MSB. I would not be able to financially survive with that sort of school debt.

I had a mental breakdown. I was depressed, didn't eat, couldn't sleep and hated everything. 

Luckily, there is currently a class action law suit open against MSB for these reasons. False representation claiming their school is accredited, etc.  Please keep hope that these bastards will burn for the future they have ripped away from me so easily.

2j92hg,26,2014-10-14,Rejected from Google internship before interview despite being offered interview last year? Am I blacklisted?,googleappthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j92hg/rejected_from_google_internship_before_interview/,"I got offered a Google internship interview last year (sophomore year) after submitting my resume online. It took too long for them to get back to me, so by the time they did, I told the recruiter that I had already committed to another internship, so I couldn't interview anymore. 

I submitted an app again this year, with more classes + another summer internship + projects on my resume, but I just received an email saying they decided ""not to proceed"" with my application. I think my resume is good enough to get to the phone screen, at least (I've used it to get interviews at Facebook, Microsoft, etc and also received an offer from Microsoft already). So I'm wondering if Google blacklisted me? I'm really surprised I didn't even get an interview...

More background: I go to a target school, have done 4 internships (started doing them in high school). I have a perfect GPA. The only things that I can see might be weird about my resume are the fact that I haven't taken some cool upper level classes like Machine Learning that other juniors might have. And maybe that my internships have all been heavily web-based (JavaScript is probably my most used language). One other caveat is Google is coming to campus to do on-campus interviews for the internship positions soon--perhaps other students from my school are better on paper than I am. I'm really just shocked I didn't make it to a phone screen...

Any ideas on what might've turned them off from me? I'm not too heartbroken because I'm pretty sure I'm going to accept Microsoft's offer, but I really want to fix whatever it is before I apply to full-time positions next year.

Would it be of any use to actually ask the person who contacted me why I've been rejected?"

However they want me to go in for a final interview at their facility about 2 hours away in a few days.

So, I'd have to ask for a day from my new/potential future employer to go interview for another company. 

Sounds kinda bad, and I don't know how my new bosses would take it. Should I even ask or is that just bad form (especially considering I've only been there a few days)?

I'm going to ask the new company if they'd consider a Skype interview, but they've already emphasized that they really want me to go in in-person.

I currently have a 3.06 GPA.

I have no internship experience, but I have a lot of research experience. Is all hope lost with this GPA? I am interested in hardware internships primarily, but there are many more software internships available. Unfortunately that means that I will be compared to computer science majors. At least at my school, they tend to have substantially higher GPAs than comp eng majors.

I've already applied to a few companies, and this week I'm planning on applying to as many companies as I can. What can I do to improve my chances? Lately I've had the feeling that anything &lt; 3.5 and your resume is automatically thrown in the trash.

Hi y'all, I found this sub the other day and was so surprised to see so many people who are dealing/have dealt with narcissistic parents. My own stories aren't that awful compared go many I've read here (not by a long shot), but I feel compelled to share them anyway--this is kind of a vyvanse rant, but I'm also sharing because the only times I have unpacked my childhood in this regard were scattered car conversations with my (not narcissistic) mom and my twin brother. 

There isn't anything TOO awful in this post, but I guess I will include a trigger warning for emotional abuse. I am feeling emotional at the moment and wanted to get everything out of the table, because the narcissistic words and actions of these two people in my life have ultimately shaped who I am today. I'm not naming any names, I will just refer to everyone using their relationship to me. My brother is a redditor so he may very well see this--he'll definitely know it's his sister that wrote this. Not sure if he views all of this the exact same way I do, but we have talked about it lots of times and our feelings towards our childhood is very much identical.

I will start from the very beginning. My brother and I (female) were conceived in vitro because my mother desperately wanted children and my parents couldn't conceive the natural way. My dad wasn't especially keen on the idea but didn't dislike it, either. He was (and is) a professor at an Ivy League university so I guess that probably made the in vitro method of conception more available to them. 

When my brother and I were young, we were treated equally by both my parents. In fact, we were always treated equally, and we are now. But I'm getting ahead of myself. When I call my father an Ndad, I don't mean to say I ever hated him. He isn't a horrible person, and I wouldn't even really say he ever seriously abused us. Never hit us or molested us--any abuse he did unto my brother and me would probably be classified as being of a psychological nature. 

He wouldn't really gaslight or anything like that. No, instead he would CRITICIZE. Every single time we would do anything that was the slightest bit neurotic, he would browbeat us into correcting the behavior. Sometimes the criticism would take the form of a simple lecture. Other times, it would be much more outrageous: once when the four of us went out to eat, my brother wouldn't stop clearing his throat. It was a habit of his that he couldn't control. My dad didn't seem to understand that, and devised incentives to get him to stop--first, he took my brother's gameboy advance. Then it escalated to taking his glasses, without which he was blind as a bat. 

As far as abuse goes, it didn't really go much further than that with him. He would be very overcritical and invalidating over the course of several years until my brother and I were 9, which is when my parents divorced. A little backstory: when we were six, we moved to a house right on a lake because my dad likes to sail and thought a lake house would be a worthwhile investment. When he split up with my mom, *Ndad * was the one who moved out, leaving my poor mother with custody of both kids, a much lower annual income, and this house which had so many problems that it would take us another 6 years just to move out. 

When my dad moved out, he rented a small house in a neighborhood right by the ocean. He became a lot more mellow and less critical, probably because all of the tension of living with us constantly had been lifted from his shoulders. We went to visit him together, every other weekend. It was GREAT. My brother and I had both made friends in the first few weeks and I have so many fond memories of playing there--I even remember liking my dad a lot more. When I was young I remember feeling so much annoyance and resentment towards him about how he treated my brother and me. When he lived on the ocean, though, our relationship became a lot better. He stayed in that house for less than 2 years, but it seemed longer. I would even argue that my life at Ndad's place was better than my life at my mom's at the time (not because my mom was doing anything bad; I loved my mom and still do--it's just that I had more school, medical and social problems than most 5th graders could handle and going to my dad's house was kind of an escape from that). Of course, though, it couldn't just end happily ever after right there. 

Both my parents had begun dating somewhat shortly after the divorce. My mom went through a lot of guys but never ended up marrying any of them. Ndad, however, married someone within probably 6 months of them dating. That ""someone"" is my Nstepmom. 

The description of my dad might not seem all that bad compared to some other vile characters I've read about in this sub. Sure, he sometimes made me justifiably mad or made my brother feel like crap. Overall though, like I said--just because he is a narcissist doesn't mean I hate him for it. He isn't a bad guy, he just wasn't a good father to young children because expectations were too high. He always had to be right, always had to win an argument--it's true that growing up as an inquisitive and impressionable child can be difficult if you have a parent like that. In retrospect, though, I think he might even have Aspergers or something similar. One thing I inherited from him was an obliviousness to the emotions of others, or at least the inability to properly read someone's emotions. Things go over our heads a lot. Another thing I inherited was a short temper. These are definitely character flaws, and I do think his treatment of us qualifies him as an Ndad. But if you think that this is as bad as it gets, think again.

When I first met my soon-to-be Nstepmom, she seemed pleasant enough. She was originally from Russia but she wasn't some young ""mail order bride"" or anything--she and my dad met on Match.com and she had been living in the US for nearly a decade, plus she was only 7 years younger than my dad. That might seem like a slightly large age gap but my mom and him were also 7 years apart. 

This woman was in her mid forties but tried dressing really young, put on bright lipstick,  and had a house decorated waaay too fancy for its average size. The interior design was intentionally expensive-looking and gaudy, in kind of a ""look-don't-touch"" way. The first thing she actually ever said to me was kind of snooty, actually. On the way to her house the day we met her, we stopped at the dollar store and I bought some stick-on nails for fun. When we arrive and I show her my nails, she goes on a small tirade about how fake nails were ""so out of style"" and how 11-year-old me had better step it up to be fashionable. This is the kind of person we're talking about here. 

She was kind of nice to us before they married, but after the ceremony she went from being sometimes-snooty to being a FINAL FORM NARCISSIST. She must have been trying to win us over while they dated, but once they were married, she had no incentive to get us to like her anymore. 

To this day, if my brother or I do or say something she doesn't agree with or flat-out like, she will be on us about it for AGES. Examples of this include having me pull up my shirt and implying that I was fat (I weighed less than 100 pounds at the time), telling my brother and me that our acting camp's summer performances were mediocre, throwing a drunken trantrum on Christmas eve over a frivolous debate (resulting in our mother coming to pick us up that same night, much to my dad's embarrassment--though he acted like nothing was wrong and never apologized), telling my brother he couldn't get an internship because he lacks motivation and talent, trying to guilt me for accidentally knocking over cell samples whilst I was doing a genetics internship, accussing me of stealing a myriad of things from her house, telling 12-year-old me that my drawings weren't art but that her paintings (hung up all over the house) *were*... The list goes on and on and ON. If I call her out on being rude, she pulls the ""I'm older than you and you should always respect me"" card. Hell nope. During another initially-lighthearted debate, she tried to prove some kind of point by telling me that the subjects I am most knowledgeable about are trivial, as well as bringing up that *she* got all As in *high school*. Fifty-year-old woman here, folks. What grown adult puts down a child in order to make themself feel superior, and in such a ridiculous way??

She also uses any and every excuse to brag about her own son, who is ten years older than us and is honestly not doing much with his life. If we were biologically related to her, this guy would without a doubt be the golden child. My brother and I both currently go to the same university he went to, so often times if we discuss our experiences at school she HAS to turn it around to somehow be about our stepbrother, and by extension, her. 

It also bears mention that back when my dad married Nstepmom, we had to say goodbye to the house on the ocean (and all our friends) to go live in the over-the-top gaudy house, which was in a *swamp*. This isn't that big a deal, because we still occasionally keep in touch with our old friends even to this day, but being an 11-year-old and forced to leave such an awesome neighborhood with amazing friends you once saw every day to live in a house with a self-absorbed witch was too much for us, especially my brother. I'm just glad we didn't live there full time--that would have been awful.

We don't know exactly *why* Nstepmom is out to get us, but we think it has something to do with us being the ""leftover children"" from a failed marriage involving her precious husband. She probably resents us because our dad had to pay child support for so many years. Whatever the reason, Ndad quickly became Edad, constantly sweeping our tense relationship with his wife under the rug and basically trying to be the middle-man. For someone who could be so stubborn, he sure wasn't (and isn't) good at commitment. 

I am sure there is a lot of stuff I'm forgetting to add, but this is the gist of what my brother and I have to go through whenever we visit our dad and stepmom. It could be a *lot* worse, of course, and I'm thankful it isn't. I'm thankful that my mom raised us in a home that didn't feel like a dictatorship. I'm glad that my dad has mellowed out in a lot of ways as we have aged. He may still enable Nstepmom's snide, abusive remarks, but he's a way better dad today than he was 12 years ago. He recently has been helping my mother and us out more financially (aside from child support and ococcasional wads of Christmas/birthday cash, he never did this before) and we just moved into a nice mobile home (doesn't sound like much but we own it and before the three of us plus a dog were in a tiny rented two-room house). I am really grateful that he has made that possible and this rant isnt really about antagonizing the person he is today. It is more about who he was, and who my Nstepmom continues to be. I honestly hope they divorce.

My brother is currently going through his wild substance-abusing college phase, which I hope doesn't consume his life to the point where he misses a large part of his life. I think a big reason he is into the drugs and the bottle so deeply is because he too grew up feeling repressed by our father's expectations. Our mother was also quite strict on him in his earlier teenage years (to the point where he was always afraid she would be angry with him), which I do take issue with, but that's another story. 

I myself am 19 now and fairly well-adjusted. As I said, I do suffer from some depression and anxiety, but unlike my brother I don't go too hard with drugs or alcohol--just some here and there as a recreational thing. Sometimes people who have gone through hard times in life fall into addiction as a coping method, and I try to avoid that slippery slope. Anyway, in general terms, I attribute a lot of positive things (and a lack of many negative things) in my life to my parents' divorce. I would probably be a lot more repressed in every way if they had stayed together. And had my Nstepmom been my biological mother, I'm sure I would have an eating disorder or something. She is just too damn obsessed with being ""feminine"" and all around perfect, which always struck a nerve with tomboy-me. Additionally, I talk about how I am queer on twitter a lot and I am pretty sure my dad reads my twitter so he probably knows, but I can't ever see myself purposefully coming out to him, MUCH less my stepmom, for the aforementioned reasons. I didn't even really *come out* to my mother because the environment she provided made me feel comfortable enough to casually slip the fact into a regular conversation, which I did without consequence. I don't think I could do the same with my dad, and *especially* not my step mom.

As I said before, I do believe I have inherited a lot of my father's characteristics, including some of the ones that make him what I believe to be a narcissist. We are both stubborn, easily-angered, and introverted. These traits may have been genetically passed down to me, but his expression of them has also led to a lot of insecurities on my part. In some ways I *am* stubborn, but in many others I am so weak and constantly in need of validation--validation I never got from my dad as a child. I have awfuk depression and anxiety that affects me life even while medicated.  My dad's distance in my life, paired with the lack of males in any of my immediate circles (aside from my brother of course) has led me to be a bit wary of men, and most of my close friends are female. I even find myself having a preference towards females *sexually* (pansexual here). I tend to stick to what I'm familiar with, and I know that's irrational.

Sometimes I worry that any neuroses forced upon me by my father's ego don't impact my potential children in a way that would cause a repeat of my own childhood. I just hope that if I have children, I am better prepared to step up and be the best parent I can be *from the beginning.* 

So that is basically my experience with Nparents in a nutshell. Again, could be a lot worse, but there's no denying that my dad and stepmom had/have some serious N complexes.

I'm sorry this is so long, and I'm not even really sure this kind of story is what you guys are looking for. I just felt the need to write it all down and maybe get some validation that this stuff has happened to other people and that I'm not being irrational in my resentment.

Example Story Ideas:

**Chaperone on a Class Trip**
I am an adult chaperone on your high school class trip. While walking past the hotel pool I see a couple of the male students on the trip laughing outside of the girls locker room door and holding what appear to be a girls swimsuit and clothes. I go up to them and see what they are up to, realize they have taken your clothes and bikini while you were showering in the girls locker room. I take the clothes and send them away, handing them back to you around the locker room door. However, while you're changing in the locker room, I notice a baggie of pot fell out of your clothes. I question you about it when you come out of the locker room, fully dressed, and tell you I have to search your room. Once we're up in your room I search your things and find a lot more contraband. Enough to call your parents and send you home...


**Job Interview with Friend's Dad**
I am a powerful lawyer, used to getting my way and walking all over those I view as weaker. You would be one of my daughter's friends who is looking for an internship or full time job. You've had a great deal of trouble finding work and, out of desperation and even though my presence has terrified and intimidated you ever since you can remember, you ask your friend if she will ask me to at least interview you. I very reluctantly agree to at least interview you. As the interview starts I don't show much interest but as it progresses, I realize just how weak and easily manipulatable you are and begin to use my leverage and intimidating presence to use you sexually and turn you into my personal and company slut.

**Prospective Student on First College Visit**
You're the naive prospective college student making her first college visit. I am your tour guide. I notice you are by yourself and seem a bit shy so I make a point of walking with you on the tour, acting very personable and charming. Helping to ease your nerves about being on your own and visiting colleges. After the tour I invite you to a party that my friends are having later that evening. I tell you it will be good for you to make some friends before you start so you have a leg up on all of the other freshman. You hesitate but eventually accept, telling yourself that you really have to put yourself out there now that you're about to be in college. You arrive at the party later that night and...

Just a few ideas. Many more and interested in scenes and roles you would like to play.

Look forward to hearing from you."

I'm typically a sweet, quiet sort of girl, but there was always something about him that made me open up. He is a stereotypical Type A, can-do-anything kind of guy who makes it his life mission to be the best at everything. He never really had serious relationships before, and he also couldn't connect intellectually with many girls, so he wasn't looking for anything when he came into college. I typically dated sweet, loving, romantic guys who were usually slightly codependent. We weren't each other's ""type"" going in, but we connected very strongly and began to fall for each other. He was always working very hard at everything, but once things started to calm down, he began to pursue me. We were inseparable until the summer began. When we weren't working on our own projects, we were talking to each other. I met his parents, and he met my mom and sister. We even began sleeping in each other's beds whenever one of our roommates let us have the room.

Over the summer, he moved to a city an hour away and began working harder than he'd ever worked in his life. This was a byproduct of 1) being surrounded by highly competitive people in a very prestigious internship and 2) being in a new city with nothing else to do but work. As a result, we only saw each other a few times a month (which was my decision, because I didn't want to distract him, though he said I could come over anytime) and our communication began to dwindle. I wasn't working, so I had a lot of free time to miss him. When we saw each other, he was able to focus 100% on me, and was always apologetic about how much he was working. But as soon as I was gone, it was hard to reach him.

I never complained, but I was hurting because I thought that it was my fault that he didn't reach out, and that he simply didn't care enough about me. My dad told me to call him and tell him he had to change, because it wasn't fair that I felt like this and that the relationship was so one-sided. I had been coming to him, bringing him food, supporting him, etc. while he worked, and he hadn't made the effort to come down here on a free weekend to hang out, which my dad thought was unfair. So I told my ex that we needed to talk, but it took a few hours before he could get to a private place to chat. He spent that time thinking I was going to break up with him. Instead, I told him that he had not met my expectations this summer, and I just wanted to talk to him and figure out what was going on. He said that he was so overloaded at work that he couldn't sleep or even feel anything. He didn't know what he wanted at all, but he knew that he didn't like his work and that he couldn't seem to stop doing it. I asked him if he wanted time away from the relationship, and he said no. He said that he just needed to wait until the summer was over so that he could figure out his life path, because he had wanted to work at this particular place for so long, and the fact that it was so draining on him was unsettling to him. He also didn't understand my need for check-in texts (he thinks that words of affirmation are kind of pointless), so it didn't occur to him to reach out. I didn't get a sense that his feelings for me had changed at all, though he had looked a lot more stressed than usual.

He sent me some check-in texts that week, which I appreciated (and let him know that I did). I was his cheerleader during his last week of work. But a few days after work ended, he came to visit me and broke up with me. He told me that there was nothing wrong with me, and that I was the sweetest girl he had ever met and didn't want to hurt me anymore. He told me that he knew that he would always be this way, and that he would only continue to frustrate me. He told me that he had been thinking about it for a few weeks. It was a very calm, mutual breakup. We immediately went back to being friends, though it took him a while because he seemed pretty sad at first.

Myself, I felt happy and relieved. It was a new school year, and I had two very popular roommates who let me into their friend groups. Soon, I had boy attention left and right, and began going on dates and generally having a good time. After some time, reality hit me, and I realized that I missed my ex. Boys were fine, but none of them ""clicked"" the way my ex and I did. My ex was my perfect complement, and we would often talk from dinnertime to sunrise. He would always come into work sleep-deprived on the days that I visited because we would talk so much at night and end up missing out on sleep. We both have pretty low sexual libidos, so we really emphasized our connection and love. He didn't let many people get close to him or see his vulnerable side, but he let me in and let me see it all. I learned more from him than I've ever learned from anyone in my life. We also came from the same background, had similar interests but different (yet complementary) skill sets, and we both had completely different ideas that we debated about back-and-forth for fun. I never really knew what it was like to truly be engrossed in someone else until I met him; the hours would fly by like seconds.

This year, we are both extremely busy, and I'm starting to lift my own career off the ground. In some ways, I'm busier than him -- I'm in a sorority, I help lead a magazine, I'm taking a full courseload, and I'm involved in student government. Plus, I have a new social life I am involved in. Yet I can't stop thinking about trying again with him. We talk pretty much every other day via text, and sometimes we get so absorbed in our discussions that we get distracted from our work. He tells me he misses our talks. He has also come to visit me before and has expressed interest in hanging out with me and my roommates to get to know them better. We both talk as if nothing has ever changed. I think that he still loves me, though we haven't talked about our feelings at all (he isn't a very feely kind of guy). Now that I understand that his workaholism is innate and has nothing to do with me not being enough for him, I feel like I am prepared to understand it and accommodate it as my own career launches off the ground. The question is, should I reinitiate the relationship? If so, how should I do it?

---   
**tl;dr**: Ex and I broke up over his workaholism. I've ""moved on"" (no longer sad about him), but even during my best days, I can't help wanting him back. Wondering if we should try again."

So, as the title implies, I've been and gone from this sub, in fact I've been gone for a fair amount of time. I had hoped my coping skills had developed enough to deal with the trials life has to offer, but sadly I think that's no longer the case.

I've dealt with depression for the better part of my life, was formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when I was a child, as well as ""obsessive compulsive tendencies.""

Thing is, I know the shtick; I know the warning signs, and I know the tools... I just can't get them to work.

It's been about 2 weeks and I've never felt worse. I haven't slept much, I'm either starving myself one day or stuffing my face the next, and I've consistently missed lectures and assignments. I just feel sapped of energy (again... I know the signs... just can't get my damn brain to work right).

I know what the trigger was... my girlfriend left me two weeks ago, caused by irreconcilable differences between me and her family. I'm angry and self-loathing, because I know it could have been salvaged.

Quick background, I was invited to go on her family's yearly beach vacation this summer. When I left, I had just left a very high-stress internship, and instead of taking a day or two to decompress, I stuffed myself in a car for 13 hours and spent 9 days with her very over-bearing and intrusive family.

I'm not being prejudicial, but she comes from a **very** old fashioned and large Italian family (legitimate Italian, as in her mother immigrated as a child), and they do *everything* together. The culture shock over those 9 days was nothing short of monumental. Sadly, and I can only blame myself for this, I did not act as politely as I should have at times, I let my stress get the better of me and I started to withdraw. I would get moody at times and snap at someone if they poked hard enough. I know I screwed up there. 

But it was when she and I returned to school that shit hit the fan; she told me they were unhappy with me, but despite my repeated asking, she wouldn't let me contact them to apologize. I didn't try to go around her and do it myself, because she claimed it was better to let things blow over, and I figured she obviously knew them better than I did. Two months later... well here I am.

I'm back to seeing a therapist, but fitting that between classes, work, homework, and tests, its only stressing me out more. I just figured I'd resubscribe here for a little more support... figured it wouldn't hurt anything.

Thanks for reading, here's to hoping I can get back on level ground."
2j9xsk,8,2014-10-14,Should I continue working help desk or look for an (most likely unpaid) internship?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2j9xsk/should_i_continue_working_help_desk_or_look_for/,"I'll be graduating fairly soon, but have enough time to either a) continue working help desk at my college and getting paid to do so, getting some good hands on experience b) look for an internship that will most likely be unpaid and not teach me very much.

 I'm not very optimistic about an internship because, from what I've heard from fellow students, most IT internships that students at my college obtain tend to not be very educational, and often focus on doing basic office tasks (copy this, file that) rather than genuine IT work. At my current job, I deal with faculty and students, troubleshoot a wide variety of technological issues, and learn quite a bit about different operating systems and technologies.

By the time I graduate, if I stick to my current job, I'll have around 2 years of help desk experience under my belt. Currently, I'm encouraged to constantly learn, and I'm often able to follow along with another higher ranking IT employee to fix an issue that I am unable to fix myself.

I really don't know what path I should pursue, but right now I seem to be gaining a lot of solid experience at my job, and I need the money for living expenses and various school-related fees. What do you all think would be the wisest thing to do? Any additional advice?"

Some background: I'm already maxing out my Roth IRA at Vanguard (Target Retirement 2055 Fund. I only have $5500 total in there right now.).  This internship is only for 6 months so after that I am planning on rolling the 401k into a traditional IRA at Vanguard.  

I wanted to generally follow the asset allocation of the Vanguard target fund I already have. From my understanding I can approximate the total stock market using MXISX, MXMDX, and MXVIX. Other than that though I'm lost. It doesn't seem like there are index funds for bonds or international? Since this is only for 6 months does it matter as much what I choose as I will roll it over shortly anyways?

I'd appreciate any help here. Thank you!

Anyway, tomorrow will be my first job fair since switching to CS. Most of my internship and work experience has been EE related, and my resume was tailored to EE but I smoothed out the edges to give it a more ""CS"" vibe when explaining my internship and work experience.

There are some big name companies coming to my school tomorrow, including Intel, Apple, Microsoft, Micron, Cisco, and more. I'm used to talking to them about my experienced with hardware and EE related topics.

2jabop,3,2014-10-14,Do you ever feel homesick?,cr0career,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jabop/do_you_ever_feel_homesick/,"A little something different here, but I got a nice offer to move out of state next year after I graduate with a big name company. I've telling my parents that I'll probably accept it and they even hinted that they want me to accept it. I think having this name on my resume plus the starting salary will lead me to greater success as I grow older. 

However, I love my home state and my family. Even while in college right now, I make a fairly lengthy drive from my college town to visit my parents weekly, which I know sounds weird, but was pretty much expected when I first moved out.

Lately my mother (who is a tiny Asian lady, bless her heart), has just been acting all nostalgic, showing me little things I gave her when I was a child, telling stories about how much she missed me when I was away during my internship, and constantly reminding me that I'm leaving next year. 

It's literally breaking my heart and although it's not going to sway my decision to accept the offer, it certainly is swaying my thoughts about how homesick I'll be and how long I'll be with the company for. Due to certain reasons, I need to be with the company for at least 5 years, and after that I'll determine where to go from there. 

So does anyone have similar experiences once they moved away? Is this just what they call ""growing up""?"

It worked getting rid of the pain and itching!  It was about a year later that I started using it to treat facial pain.  My mother gets the same thing - cramps in the forehead.  They can be constant and just horrible.  Makes it hard to sleep and it just hurts.  My mother has seen all kinds of doctors for it but they just give her muscle relaxers and tell her she's stressed.

When I started my internship at a hospital (I'm an MA for a neurology clinic) the forehead cramps turned into all out eye twitching face burning pain.  It occurred to me then to use the Anbesol.  I figured some people use botox to paralyze nerves that cause chronic pain, anbesol is just inhibiting the nerve only less drastic and it works!

Not only does it take the pain away but over the last 4 years Ive been using it Ive noticed an improvement in my skin tone (Im guessing just from the petroleum in the product) and the wrinkle in my forehead had diminished since I dont clench as much.  In fact, I started using it around my eyes to prevent wrinkling there.  I figure even if it doesnt work, what could it hurt?

But, every time I tell someone this they look at me like Im nuts and tell me I should see a doctor - that Im probably causing some kind of irreparable nerve damage.  Frankly Id love those nerves deadened forever!  I asked one of the doctors at my clinic and he told me hed never heard of such a thing and hed have to look into it but never got back to me.  Is this hurting me?

2jbclw,0,2014-10-15,My Opinions On How To Save Your Game Bungie.,voltage_drop,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2jbclw/my_opinions_on_how_to_save_your_game_bungie/,"Hello everyone,
The following is just my personal opinion of small changes that could expand the game and help to recreate the feeling of satisfaction that completing your first raid does, or getting your first amazing drop.

1. In my opinion EXOTIC weapons should have been just as the title said EXOTIC. Selling these weapons and armor from xur literally killed the EXOTIC feeling of receiving one. Many MMO players are used to grinding for hours and hours for amazing drops and receiving nothing, I personally don’t want these items given to everyone *SUROS online.
(SOLUTION) Adding a higher tier reward would help solve this. Example if there was a higher tier reward called “Prevailing” or anything trivial, that you could only equip one weapon or piece of armor that you had a 1 in 1000 chance of receiving from a strike or raid, AKA receiving the best drop ever it would give people incentive to grind these strikes and continue playing for that small but possible chance of receiving an item truly rare to see.


2.    Adding shaders/ ghost shells/ and class items for veterans would be an asset. As of right now chatterwhite is the only sense of accomplishment shown in a shader. Now I did feel special receiving it the first day but since then its appeal has worn off  and I have nothing else to work for that shows off the hard work of grinding and playing this game.

(SOLUTION) Adding simple rewards for the truly dedicated to maxing their accounts. Example:
100 strikes – Shader
1000 striker – Ghost Shell
1,000,000 kills – Class item
500 hours – Shader 
1000 hours – Class Item 
HARD RAID – Shader
ETC….. just anything that takes a lot of time that people will feel special and unique to receive.

3. More crucible content for those who enjoy objective game types.
(SOLUTION) CTF, oddball, king of the kill.

4. More crucible content for those who enjoy HARDCORE game types.
(SOLUTION) Superless, realistic, MLG, clan clash.

5. HORDE/SURVIVAL mode, simply put these are really entertaining and can and a lot of energy to your game.

6. Ingame Leaderboards, Stats, Grimoire, the app idea is nice but it’s not appealing to a big majority of players. It’s a nice option but apps are not for everyone…… especially for windows phone users… im looking at you bungie make one!

7. Hard/ Near impossible strikes I want to struggle for hours not seconds, trying to be the best you can possibly be is kind of lackadaisical without hard tasks.

8. Hard Bounties, at this point you can see that in my eyes this game is far too easy at this point the hardest task is the hard raid which our team still completes in under 1 hour and 30 minutes post patch.


9. Seasonal events. make it snow, pop those pumpkins anything it just adds variety.

 
10. DON’T LET PEOPLE SPAWN ALIVE DURING NIGHTFALLS …… you find one safe spot and poof everyone has the blue flames simply quit and rejoin if you die.

11. Fix glitches such as “Atheon map fall” instead of letting everyone receive the best gun in the game and then nerfing it leaving it near useless.
(SOLUTION) add a soft kill barrier under the boss areas with a floor so if a boss lands there its safe and if you land there you die. Simply put play the game the way it was designed to work.

12. If you made it this far through the post feel free to express your opinions upvote/downvote im simply exprexxing my opinions as a player of 325 hours+. Thanks for your time let’s make this game of 10 years actually last 10 years instead of dying off its not to late bungie but come November when the new wave of games are released you are going to have to make an impacting change to keep a high player rate.

13. Fix the story, coming from the creators of halo it was pretty sad…. I’m all for letting interns help design games but don’t put them in charge of the main story. 
Cheers.

Right now I'm taking a 4 months internship in the States. I've dated a few girls before but never had a girlfriend.

The story: the girl said hi to me on a social app about a month ago. We chatted online for a week and she asked me out for dinner on the Saturday. The dinner went pretty well other than she was late for about 20 min. I paid for the diner even tho she wanted to AA since she was late. Then we went to a tea shop she bought me a tea and chatted some more.

I asked her out a few times the next week but she was ""busy"". Then she disappeared for two weeks. Just as I was about to give up and move on, she texted me about how sorry she was for disappearing and how busy she's got the past weeks and asked if I wanted to get dinner. So i went to the diner and a movie afterwards. And after that she disappeared again.

I kinda like this girl and i think she at least somewhat likes me. Otherwise she wouldn't have gone to the movie with me at midnight...
But because of all the disappearances i don't know to do now... should i just try to forget all about this and move on?

PS: since i'm new to the city she's the only person I know other than my coworkers... I tried to know more people on some dating sites but so far no luck

I found your stash.  

You come back to your dorm room, late one afternoon after a day of classes.  You are expecting some quiet time.  Maybe get high, watch some TV.

Not only do you want your drugs back, you don't want anyone to find out what you have been doing all semester.  

After some haggling we decide that a blow job will get you your stash back and keep you out of trouble.  Of course, when you are finished, I decide I want more.  How roughly do you want to be taken?  Will you give in right away, or struggle?  Do you want to be tied?  Gagged?  Cum in you?  On you?  Anal?  Maybe I take some pictures?  Call one of my buddies?

Let me know what you do or don't want to happen.


This can be played two ways.

1)  Your RA, if you want to play opposite someone close to your age.

2) The maintenance man, if you want to play opposite someone older.  (35 unless otherwise requested)


Holiday office party.  
Big office building.  Maybe you are the hot young intern?  Sweet married paralegal?  Or the hot shot lawyer that has aggravated every guy in the place.
Lots of options!
Drunk.  Slipped something.  Or just isolated and taken.








Rehab Stay
It is your first couple days in rehab, and you are in desperate need of a fix.  My character (doctor, orderly, another patient) can get you what you need, if you are willing to give him what he wants.

2jc9mv,4,2014-10-15,"Alright my fellow ents, I have something I want to get off my chest. Maybe you're experienced it?",Tpainguin,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2jc9mv/alright_my_fellow_ents_i_have_something_i_want_to/,"This is one of my first posts on trees, and I'm totally sober right now. Bout to take a rip from The Onion (muh bong), so we'll see where this goes. First off, I absolutely love the community here- best one on reddit by far. I hate to bring up something negative as a topic, but this has been bugging me for a while and I want to hear your opinions. Sorry if the story ends up being too long to hold your interest.

Short back story about me- I'm 20, a junior in college, currently pursuing a degree in Web Application Development- think Computer Science with more programming classes, less math and science. I have a 4.0, work as a remote software developer for a start up company, and I've been a daily smoker for about 2 months, but I've been smoking for longer than that.

It was a Saturday afternoon, and I had a party to go to, so I invited a fellow ent to come along. He happily accepted, and asked if he could bring an amigo along. The more the merrier, right? We decided we would rip 2 bongs, sit around for a bit, then head out. I asked if his friend, Alex, would be partaking in the smoking. He told me no, that Alex wasn't a smoker. Fine by me. Never judge someone for what they do or don't do.

My bud and Alex came over, I introduced myself, and we got to smoking. I asked Alex if he wanted any, to be polite, and he said no. No problems there. I got pretty high and my buddy and I got to talking about whatever. This is where things got a bit odd. For the entirety of the session, probably a good 45 minutes, Alex sat there on his phone saying nothing. Albeit a technology major, I'm actually pretty social and people tell me I'm easy to get along with. I tried the best I could to get him into the conversation, but he just wouldn't budge. Fine, fine, I understand. It can be weird when you're sober and others aren't. Didn't count that against him. After the session, I rounded up my roommates and we all headed out to the party.

We got to the party around 6, most people were already pretty buzzed. It was a triple kegger, so running out wasn't a concern. We all bought a cup and got to drinking. This my friends, is where the proverbial shit hit the fan. We had been there about 45 minutes, and I was just sipping on my beer, probably just starting on cup #3. I wasn't looking to get trashed just yet, I was going for a more casual buzz. All of a sudden Alex comes STUMBLING out of the house, barely able to walk. He came over to us and began rambling about how we were feeling, how much we had drank, etc. I looked at him questioningly, and asked if he had taken anything before drinking. He scoffed at me, and told me this was just alcohol, he didn't need anything else. Evidently not when your drinking tolerance is equivalent to that of a prepubescent teenage girl, but I digress. My other friends left to go get more beer, leaving me alone with Alex.

I was thoroughly intrigued by this young man. How do you get that drunk that fast when you're 20 years old? I asked him if he was feeling alright, and he said he was doing great, he hadn't eaten the entire day in preparation. I was shocked for a bit- 

""You didn't eat a single thing today? That sounds terrible man, you should really eat a sandwich or something to get some grub in your stomach.""

""Nah man, waste no alcohol! Gets me drunk right away!""

There was, as previously mentioned, a triple kegger, but I guess he just wanted to be REALLY safe- kind of ironic, no? The other party guests were getting obviously annoyed by his antics, so we moved further outside the party. It was here when we started talking about me and weed. He began talking to me about why I'd do something like weed. What was the point he asked? I found it quite humorous this was coming from someone drunk off their ass, but hey, I answered it truthfully.

Me - ""It just chills me out, makes ya appreciate the little things, and I have a great time.""

Alex - ""I don't like fucking with stuff like that man, way too risky for me.""

Me - ""Yeah, but you say that as you're drunk as hell...""

Alex - ""Well yeah, but it's just alcohol.""

Me - ""...you are aware alcohol is a drug too, just that its effects are different, right?""

Alex - ""Yeah but why would you want to do something that makes you like that? Alcohol makes you outgoing and fun!""

Me - ""Being honest man, you're outgoing right now, but not really fun. Weed is just a different feeling- it's nice to be able to take everything in and stay chill, rather than bouncing off the walls and pissing people off.""

Things continued like this for a while, until we began to talk about personal life. I told him how I was an intern, had my 4.0, and was waiting to hear back from a few global companies to intern with them. I wasn't bragging, he asked me what I did and how I'm doing in school and I was honest with him. When I told him this his eyes lit up with genuine surprise, which I expected from him. It was obvious he had already chalked me up to a stoner that did nothing aside from smoke and chill. This is how the conversation when I asked him about himself:

Me - ""So, what do you do?""

Alex - ""I'm an intern.""

Me - ""Ah, very cool. Best prep for the future. Where do you work?""

Alex - ""Well, I'm not actually an intern yet, but I'm looking for one.""

I shit you not. This kid started lying to me to make himself look like something more than he really is. I had completely read this kid and knew the exact type of person he was. We continued to talk about what I was doing until he dropped the bombshell that made me write this story.

""Wow, for someone who I thought was a total fuckup, you're doing pretty well for yourself.""

I just stood there. He was so trashed and he legitimately meant that, context and compliment alike. The weed had already worn off and the alcohol had began to kick in, and I was so close to knocking this kid out, but I just walked away, never to talk to him again.

Sorry for the long winded story, but I just had to share with you guys. Has anyone else ever been subjected to the stereotype that smoking weed = doing nothing with your life? It pisses me off to no end. I've worked my ass off to get where I am today. Sure, luck has a factor in everything, but I've already worked 3 software developer internships at the age of 20- that's work and dedication, not luck and chance. Never let those around you bring you down for smoking. It's a stereotype I'm hellbent on breaking, to prove that just because I like to smoke a bit of green everyday doesn't mean I'm destined to become a low life. Keep on tokin' my fellow ents, we all have an impact in this world- let's make it a good one.

P.S.
I lied to you guys. I didn't take a rip of the bong before I started. I'm about to right now. Hope some of you join me. :)"
2jcbht,5,2014-10-15,Internship in Iran?,Persiankingz,iran,https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/2jcbht/internship_in_iran/,"Hi /r/Iran

Im an 18 year old International Business and Management Studies student and I live in the Netherlands. Im also born here but both my parents come from Iran. I have gone multiple time to Iran and I speak fluently Farsi but I can not read Farsi..  For my course I need to find an internship somewhere in the world for 6 months, and I was thinking of Iran. To be more specific, Im looking for a marketing related internship.
So my questions are as following:




* Do you guys think the lack of reading farsi will become an obstacle for me in a company? 

* Do I have any problems with sarbazi because I want to stay in the country for about 5 months? 

* How is the 'quality' of the internships in Iran? I obviously want to improve myself and learn something from the internship. 

Or do you guys think it would be a smarter move just to find an internship somewhere else? The main reason I was thinking of Iran is because it would be cheaper for me (I can stay at my family) and because I ofcourse love visiting Iran.
Thank you!"

I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate. I currently have an internship at a local company. Its a small company, but growing fast! I was one of the first few to be recruited. They were barely a development team of 3. Now we're 11, and still growing. Anyhow, I've been curious about how a large company would be. I thought of going to a career fair and applying to any companies I'm interested in. But, I found out my current employer will be there. My boss jokingly mentioned how he wouldn't want to see any of us(interns) there, because then he knows we're looking for something else. What do I do? I don't want to jeopardize a good internship that is being offered during my school term. But at the same time, I want to look at my options. I am mainly looking for an internship for next summer.

certifications including: Comptia A+, Comptia Net+, Microsoft Technology Associate OS Fundamentals, Microsoft Technology Associate Networking Fundamentals, Microsoft Technology Associate Server Fundamentals, and Microsoft Technology Associate Security Fundamentals

My issue is unique as I live in the Louisville KY area but on the other side of the river in Indiana and am not allowed to travel to Kentucky(yes I can drive). I've tried applying at places like best buy on my side of the river but that fails(as their ""test"" they make you take is really to see if you ""strongly agree or not""), I'm just wondering if anyone here has advice on what I could do to not have to work at a minimum wage job that I absolutely hate, as I cannot find anything.

Long time lurker, this is my first post using a throwaway.

Long story short. Graduated from highschool, wasn't disciplined in college so I decided to take up odd-jobs. Saved some money, decided to go back to college at around 25. Got summer internships during college, saved the money and built up resume. Graduated last year, took an offer at internship company and has been working there since (started 6/2013). Paid off student-loan as soon as I graduated. Got married and bought a house. 


**My question is:**

1. How far behind financially am I when compared to someone who saved during their early 20's (everything I saved in 20's went to paying off college)?

2. Is it possible to catch-up on what I missed? I'm a computer-science major, love what I do right now so I feel like I won't plan on retirement until my 75-80 (or when I drop dead, whichever comes first).

3. Is our current financial health, good? bad? ugly?

4. Is 24k rainy day enough?


**About me:** 

Live in California, married, ~760 credit score (average of 3 companies). 


**Income/Savings:**

Combined annual income before tax: 147k, this is BEFORE all pretax deductions such as 401k, health insurance, company life insurance, espp, HSA.

Income into our pockets: 6500/month

Rainy-day savings account: 16k

My 401k: 14k (putting in 7% pretax paycheck)

Wife 401k: 12k (putting in 6% pretax paycheck)

ESPP + personal stock brokage: 14k



**Debt:**

Mortage: 370k @ 4.37%

Money borrowed from my brother: 65k (doesn't want the money back until 5 years down the road when he decides to get a house)


**Expenses:**

Utilities (Gas, Water, Electic): $100/month (1200/yr)

Mortage: $1909/month, I usually pay $2200/month just to put a little extra to paydown the principle.

Insurance (Car, Life, Home): 255/month (this is for two cars, one home, and life; all from the same company in order to get discounts)

Cable TV/Internet: $62/month

Hulu/Netflix/Amazon Prime: $20/month (I share the netflix account with a few other people)

Food: $600/month

Cellphone: $340/month (wife is paying some of her families plan to help her parents)

Property tax: $125/month ($1500/yr)

Gasoline: $200/month

Other/Misc: $300/month (eatting out, movie, things to keep us sane)


After expeneses there is about $2300 left. We're trying to reach 24k rainy-day and max-out both our Roth IRA contributions (11k for 2014). I haven't open the Roth IRA yet, but will.


Thanks for reading, any input/suggestion/advice is appreciated. 




EDIT: change formatting of post to make it easier to read. Some maybe wondering, with 2300 lefted over why haven't we saved more. This is because we went on a trip this summer 3200 plane ticket, 2500 expenses, dogs got sick 1400 vet bill, car repairs around 2000, there might be some other unexpected expenses."

Problem is, I'm still taking general and introductory courses and not anywhere near graduation, at least not in two years minimum.

Let me explain. I don't know how to manage stress. I form a big mental list of stuff to do for a day. Homework, papers, studying for an exam, reviewing stuff I don't know very well. But every single time, I can't follow through. I sit down in a study area, panic and stress over this mountain of stuff to do in front of me, and procrastinate. Video games, anime, cleaning, eating, pacing back and forth, taking a nap, *anything* but work.

And what does that result in? Nothing getting accomplished and a steadily increasing feeling of wanting to vomit, or run away, or die, or kill myself but not really because I don't think I actually want to die. Most of my friends have graduated, or are working already, or are in great internships. I'm just sitting here browsing reddit again like usual and wishing I was playing Street Fighter.

~~And my schedule isn't even that hard this term. Java II (failed in spring due to poor fundamental understanding, didn't take Java I), Calc IV (multivariate, already struggling and don't know how I passed Calc II), and writing (requires almost no effort for A's). But somehow, I feel like I can never overcome this mountain. And I feel like even if I do, something bigger is beyond it.~~

~~Will I find a job? Will I ever get back into a relationship? What about marriage? What should I name my kid? How will I avoid parental mistakes that my own parents made? How will I learn to maintain my temper so my kids don't follow after me? And so on, all of these trivial matters that just bombard me constantly while I'm struggling to even get started on school work.~~

~~Counseling is a joke, please don't recommend it. My university books appointments out for three weeks in advance due to high student demand, I guess everyone else has problems too. Who would've guessed, right. Outside counselors with ""sliding-scale"" payments just pay less attention to you because you're not worth their time. Already gone through four or five like this. Every time, ""Oh, you're just going through some college stress. You'll get through it."" The first time I heard that was three years ago, right before my first university told me not to come back due to ""abuse of services.""~~

~~Mom disapproves of me getting on medication because I'm not autistic like my brother. I picked up some pills last year and she found them while digging through my drawers for some reason. Got a scolding about ""getting pills and I'm not sick like my brother"" and ""you're not autistic or ADD or anything so why do you need pills."" So, I stopped taking them. Not sure if they really helped anyways, just made me feel sleepy all the time.~~

I'll stop here, I started ranting again. I can't ever concisely state what my problem is, and that's probably one of the reasons I can't get the help I'm looking for.

EDIT: Edited out ranting. I rarely ever open up, so when I do I can't really control(?) it."

So far it sounds like USAF is a big party, so that sounds cool but I'm really in it for a dependent addition to my technical skills as an engineer and a stepping stone to a bigger and better job outside of the military once I've fully experienced and enjoyed the military life.

So I've got a few specific questions.

1. Is a job (technical field, officer) as hard to find here as it is any other business? 

2. Is the USAF a good place to look for improving technical ability and develop my career, or is it a place where most people get stuck in a place they don't want to be?

3. Is it hard to leave and find a regular job at home? (Years of commitment?)"

2jcwkf,2,2014-10-15,How to spin business/IT degree into a software development career?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jcwkf/how_to_spin_businessit_degree_into_a_software/,"I am currently in school for a business degree that caters more towards information technology and general business courses. It is a fairly non-technical program. There are a few courses that teach us about databases (mostly SQL), systems design and analysis, enterprise architecture and beginner java coding. To me, that is more of an IT project management kind of deal. In addition, this program offers no technical stream. There is a beginner java course and it leads no where due to the student body. (There use to be a client-server application development course in Java). 

My dilemma is I realize I have developed an interest in programming and computer science. I mean just the other day I had a blast trying to figure out how to solve for a Taylor series up to a certain point as part of my beginner java course weekly problem sets. Anyways, I digress. I am currently finishing my 3rd year in this program with some internship experience (about a year developing and designing BI tools like Qlikview and Tableau). I am wondering if there is a way to possibly transition and spin this business/IT degree into a software development career? I mean the obvious thing to do is to switch majors, however that isn't a luxury I can afford anymore. I really don't want to waste my 3 years of my parent's money to switch and put myself in another 4 years of debt.

One option I've mapped in my head is to graduate and work in the IT field with one of my previous companies that I interned with while taking computer science courses in college (which is the equivalent to community college here in Canada) to fill in the knowledge gaps before making the transition. Does this seem feasible?  

Any advice, tips and stories are greatly appreciated.

**Suit:** Is the magenta suit I showed good enough? I'm afraid the color is too bright. I also think it might be too, ahem, figure-flattering. The blue dress I have more conservative (in more than just its color) but is it too casual?

**Shoes:** I own heels and flats--but I left them at home and didn't bring them to college with me. Would the black boots I listed suffice? Or should I get heels and tights? Also, am I supposed to change into heels once I arrive? How does this even work?

**Outerwear:** Again, I own a blazer--I just didn't bring any of them to college with me. :P Is the black jacket I linked to above too casual? It is a lot warmer, so will it be okay if I wear it to my interview since obviously a blazer won't be warm enough? Or am I supposed to wear a blazer and a coat, and just take off my coat once I arrive?

**Accessories:** I have one burgundy scarf, which I think is in a conservative enough color for me to get by but feel free to tell me I'm wrong. Since I live in California, I don't own gloves or beanies. I'm sure I could buy some cheapo knit crap but is it okay for me to show up to a professional interview with like, $1 knit gloves from Target?

**Budget:** I'd prefer to spend minimal money on this. I'd be open to buying tights or gloves or a hat, but considering my day-to-day lifestyle now and in the near future, I don't think I'll ever need to splurge on a nice professional attire or nice winter clothes. Even if I do get this internship I'll be a developer so my attire will be casual and not formal. It's just the interview I have to dress ""sharp"" for.

I think I'm mostly confused about how I should dress given the fact that every example of ""business casual"" I've seen definitely doesn't seem compatible with New York winter. Are you supposed to bundle up when you commute over and then leave your coat/gloves/etc somewhere and change from boots to heels?

EDIT: This company has some stuff up online about interview etiquette that says interviewees should wear a suit. However, when I contacted my recruiter she said that the dress code is loosened up for developers, but that I should still show up to the interview in ""business casual""."

2jddhy,5,2014-10-15,Late day at work. Ticket on the way home. Mom makes it worse.,TiredSon,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2jddhy/late_day_at_work_ticket_on_the_way_home_mom_makes/,"So a bit of background. I've had two tickets prior to this. The first one was for careless driving. It was totally my fault from a legal standpoint, although from a physical and emotional standpoint it should hopefully be obvious by end of this why at least a little sympathy from my own mother would not have gone amiss. I got distracted at a red light, after a week of hell caused by my grandma (my dad's mom) having a stroke that left her unable to speak and with half her body paralyzed, with mom making things worse by A.) endlessly going on about how this was how her own mother had died, and just generally making it about her and making the anxiety over the whole event even worse than the already awful best case scenario, and B.) working us (particularly my sister and I) like slaves to clean up the house and cook massive amounts of food for house guests that never came (and wouldn't have cared about the mess if they had). This left me massively sleep deprived, and my sister and I in particular, who had been eating on this one ham for every meal for what must have been at least two or three days straight (mom and dad, meanwhile, were getting fast food and stuff on their lunch breaks), really desperate for something that wasn't ham to eat. By Saturday we really were desperate for absolutely any kind of variety in our diet, and I let my sister talk me into driving out for taco bell. For some reason, when they called home, she lied and told them I was in the bathroom (it's been over a year, but I think it was because we were supposed to be cleaning while they were out shopping, and either asking for them to pick up food on the way home or just telling them where I was would have led to a ""no"" and punishment, respectively. For the record I was 23 at the time, and she was 17 or 18 herself). Well, at the red light on the way in, I got momentarily distracted (big surprise that, I was too exhausted to be walking, let alone driving), thought the truck in front of me had started moving, started going myself (at, like, 5 miles an hour), and crushed the front end of my car against his solid metal bumper. The car was totaled, not because the damage was all *that* extensive, but because the car was worth maybe $3000 retail to begin with, and body work is expensive. It later sat in the driveway until code enforcement put a sign up. which finally gave my mom some motivation to take care of it (it was in her name, I kept telling her I couldn't legally do anything more than the research I had already done, she kept telling me to call junkyards to see about getting them to take it away, which they couldn't, without the legal owner on hand to take care of the paperwork), but that's another story for another time. The truck, thankfully, wasn't even scratched. In fact, the other driver bragged that it didn't even *move*. This story ends with mom going there in an absolute foaming rage and screaming at me and my sister nonstop for over an hour that night, and generally giving me acute hell for weeks or months after that, and bringing it up any time she needed a weapon... oh gee, forever. No comforting words, no ""accidents happen,"" sure as hell no admission of how badly she had been treating me. No, just piling on to the stress I was already under, and the ticket itself had already piled more than enough extra on. This particular ticket ended in me taking a four hour course to avoid points on my license.

The next ticket was for speeding. Nothing much to say about it, it was a speed trap on an unfamiliar stretch of highway that suddenly dropped from 65 miles per hour to 50, with a single, easily missed sign to show it, and a state trooper hiding under an overpass, just waiting for someone to make that mistake. I was on my way to a job interview. Mom once again screamed at me for hours on end, bringing up the previous ticket as additional ammunition. This was sometime the spring after the first ticket. To make it worse, I didn't get the job.

Now we get to today. I have finally been hired at a local high school, and the hours do not agree with me. I'm just not a morning person, so even by halfway through the week, I'm bone tired. To make matters worse, I've had to stay late all but one night this week, and tonight was not that one night. So at almost 7:00 (and I need to be asleep by 9 to get a solid 8 hours) at night, I finally leave the school. I get to a red light at an intersection, where I can legally make a red turn. I do so, thinking I'm clear, but between the setting sun and some other cars making a left hand turn onto my street (it looked like they had a lead light, and they were blocking traffic in the direction I had to worry about, so I should have been fine), I managed to miss a car that changed lanes and honked its horn at me for pulling out in front of it. Honest mistake, I couldn't possibly have seen it, and this time I'm not even convinced I was at fault, I think the guy was driving into the sun and couldn't see where *he* was going. But you can imagine the reaction my mother had when I finally got home and told her why I was even later than she was expecting. At least I've avoided a multi-hour long lecture tonight (although only because I finally yelled back at her that I wanted her to drop it for tonight, because it's late and I've got work in the morning. Blessedly, she stopped yelling at me, although she's still yelling about me to my dad. Me doing that even a month ago would have just led to more yelling, I guess ""job"" is one of the few things she respects. She certainly never respected ""college"" or ""final internship.""). I'm sure it'll come this weekend, though. Because of course it will, she's not one to miss a chance to make a bad situation worse.

Sorry for the massive wall of text, I just needed to vent."

2jdsxx,2,2014-10-15,6 months Electrical Engineer recent graduate unemployed. What should I do? Air force?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2jdsxx/6_months_electrical_engineer_recent_graduate/,"Hi all,

It's going to be a long read, sorry. I will appreciate it though.

I have been unemployed for 6 months. I earned my electrical engineering degree back in April. GPA of 3.3, no internship since I had to work while in college to help my mother and pay my bills. Needed to focus on school after I left the job.Worked as a bank teller for 2 years.

 Electronics is a hobby of mine and i've worked on many projects, from RF jammer to autonomous car. I even learned how to crack WEP, WPA2, WPA router security. Hacked into my neighbors routers, free internet for life. I like electronics and really do think I chose the right major, just happen to live in the wrong place for it. Miami, Florida. Absolutely no electronic design jobs available, not even technicians. I have been getting interviews with big companies like Intel and Texas Instruments. Haven't gotten a offer though. In total, I have done 8 interviews, learning from mistakes. In regards to relocation, I can only relocate if the company helps me. Only $800 in the bank and parents can't help.  Loans are coming due in a few weeks, calling soon to defer. Another stress load.

I am in the application process to be an Air force officer but unfortunately I failed one section of the exam. Need to wait until March to retake, it's a long process. I was just thinking of enlisting, they have some cool jobs I am interested in.

I was also thinking about going into IT, just don't know where to start. Not fluent in programming yet, learning C. Did take a intro Java class that made it up to arraylists. Through that class, I have been able to teach myself C better. I have been messing around with computers since I was 15. I know how build one from scratch and can use google like a pro.

Most of my friends are doing something unrelated to electrical engineering. 

It's frustrating......."
2jdw9m,2,2014-10-15,Early 20's soon-to-graduate student with a job lined up and I'm getting cognitive dissonance about my starting salary. But I also feel like I'm being a brat about feeling this way. HELP!,andyetanotherkiwi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2jdw9m/early_20s_soontograduate_student_with_a_job_lined/,"So I major in finance in college and make pretty good grades. My school is a top uni for my major and I'd say I'm pretty good at finance for the most part. 

Personally, I don't love finance. I don't *mind* some aspects of it (like valuation or strategy) but HATED others (like investments). Seeing my older friends who went to high paying prestigious jobs (70k+ starting salaries) in ""safe"" cities (cheaper cost of living but not as much to do) complain about how they wish they were back in school or how soul sucking work was, I became terrified of being stuck in long hours considering I didn't even *like* finance as much as my peers. 


So I took a lower paying internship in fashion instead and LOVED it. I've always been more about shopping anyways and my study breaks were to read all the Vogues/ELLE's, Business of Fashion, and look at clothes. Like, even my friends teased me saying 'stop looking at clothes we need to finish this model"" and stuff. 

I got a full time offer, in my dream city (NYC!!!), in a reputable company, in a field I obsess over during my free time/not-so-free time. I accepted it it being all in the stars at first, but I'm now second guessing my choices. 

While my peers working in banking, consulting, etc. are making 60k-six figures in cheaper cities like Houston, Birmingham, or Minneapolis, I'm starting only with 50k. I feel like in NYC that's horrendously low and now I'm wondering if I should have sucked it up and gone the finance route. People with just as good or even lesser GPAs/resumes than me managed to get jobs in the field and I turned down a prestigious offer to pursue fashion instead. 

At the same time, I have my other spectrum of friends who don't even have jobs lined up or are still struggling to find jobs. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this since all my friends are in either extreme (and I'm embarrassed about my low salary with my big-shot friends and feel ashamed/entitled with my not so fortunate friends.)

Not to mention focusing on school is MUCH harder now. 

I think I need outsider perspective. 

Am I selling myself short? Am I being an entitled brat who isn't thankful I have a job in the first place? Maybe someone with more life experience can give me advice, I'd really appreciate it. "
2jdwgb,5,2014-10-15,Very specific housing search in Waukesha area.,[deleted],WaukeshaCounty,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaukeshaCounty/comments/2jdwgb/very_specific_housing_search_in_waukesha_area/,"Please forgive this post, I've done *some* research but nothing stands out. I have a dilemma and was wondering if Reddit could help me.

I am going to be an intern for GE in Waukesha. I'm from Northwest Indiana so its only about a 2.5 hour drive, but I'm definitely not commuting around Chicago every day. So I need a place.

* The internship will last between June 1st and August 21st so somewhere with a three month lease is a must.
* I get a stipend of $600 a month, I would like to not go over.
* I have a girlfriend and she has a small dog (&lt;10 lb). The point of this post is to have them with me, but I'll explain that more below. dog friendly is flexible.
* Commute is also flexible, but the apartments I found with the stipulations of &lt;$600/month rent and dog friendly are in Ozaukee/Milwaukee county and that seems like an excessive drive, like to the point where I'd spend more on gas than I'd be saving on rent.

I know this seems impossible. I was hoping someone familiar with the area could point in the right direction.

I can settle for not dog friendly, not even co-ed (Carroll Univ. Summer housing an option?) if worse comes to worse and I am open to sublets and things like that. Is there even an apartment with 3 month leases?

This next part is long so you can skip it.
The situation is that my gf is having foot surgery in May. She is graduating with an associate's in radiography a week before this surgery and is basically going to wait until recovery to look for a job. I got my offer and basically figured ""instead of me coming home once or twice a month, why don't you stay with me?"" and everything was optimistic. I was going to come home just once to get my 21 y.o. driver's license (I've hear Spotted Cow is amazing) and explore WI with her on the weekends. She'd probably miss her dog and we'd have to go see it so that's where that comes in, but it's also why dog friendly is negotiable. We're having a hard time finding the right place. I'd be fine spending out of pocket. *Except* my dad who loans me money interest free for school is opposed to me paying extra to accommodate my girlfriend and taking her responsibility away from her parents. Its a tenuous situation and going against my dad's demands is not the end of the world but I'd like to come out with a solution that makes everybody happy. A classmate who interned at GE in Waukesha last year said most students stay at the 2040 lofts in Milwaukee, and from the looks of it, that's only $300. 

I'd be very grateful to anybody that has even a suggestion or could point in the right direction. Thank you in advance."

Cons:   
No internship/co-op.   



I know I should have been able to snag a co-op or internship by now, but I just haven't been able to. I worked with a company called Inroads that helps with the resume and interview process and I applied online to many places locally, but I never landed one. 

I know my GPA is solid and that's probably the best thing I have going for me. I also plan to take the FE exam in the spring and like my chances. 

Is there anything I need to know besides applying to as many places as I possibly can? I am willing to move anywhere in the US so that isn't limiting me. Is getting an internship right after graduating if I cannot find a full time offer a reasonable option?"

I've worked so hard to get to where I am, but I'm just miserable. From the outside looking in I'm doing fantastic, but from the inside looking out, I've never felt worse.

I'm a recent graduate (September) with a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering. I'm interested in finding work in Portland or one of the surrounding areas because I have family located nearby. Unfortunately, the job hunt has proved more challenging than I had anticipated. I've been applying to different places, both large and small, for a few weeks now and haven't received as much as a single call back.

I'm pretty sure the single biggest thing holding me back is my lack of experience. I did not have any internships during my 4 years of school and it's killing me. Nearly every position I've been able to find requires at least some experience. I've applied to most entry-level position that I can find but clearly something is missing.

Additionally, I do not have a portfolio to speak of. I do not have a github account to document my projects through school. I just made a linked-in account today so that I have some web presence (I do not have a facebook/twitter/g+/etc.). So I fear that this is yet another (major) strike against me.

I'm looking for some suggestions on what I should do to either get a job or increase my value as a potential new employee. Hell, even the names of some hiring/temp agencies in the Portland area that I could get into contact with would be helpful at this point. 



In summary:

* Looking to work in Portland or surrounding area
* Graduated in September

* B.S. in Software Engineering

* 3.45 GPA
* No work experience or internships
* No portfolio
* Live in southern Oregon (but want to move to Portland ASAP)
* Starting to stress about loans

tl;dr: Need job in Portland as an entry-level software engineer because I have no experience. Should I keep applying? Should I just move to Portland and go to a temp agency? "
2jewiq,1,2014-10-16,"Unsure if I should continue on at my current college, transfer, or drop out entirely.",unsureofcollege,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2jewiq/unsure_if_i_should_continue_on_at_my_current/,"This is really long. I'm sorry. Any advice would be appreciated. 

I went to community college when I was 19 for 2 years, always intending to transfer to a good university. At that point, I was interested in psychology and perhaps a future in academia or counseling. I set myself up well (3.97 GPA, honors program classes, president of psychology club, tutored psych in the learning center, wrote for the school paper, completed a leadership seminar, won an award in psychology), but when transfer time rolled around, I was starting to feel like not only did I want to spend my twenties obtaining a PhD in psych, but I wasn't really that interested in learning about psychology anymore anyway -- I was disillusioned with the field itself. 

Then I made a huge mistake: I took ""a semester off"" to reevaluate. My dad was opening a restaurant at that time, so I started working there full-time. 

A semester off turned into 3 years off from school. During that time, I: 
- Worked at the restaurant
- Wrote two columns regularly for a high-traffic website (I have always loved writing) 
- Became a paid freelance writer for a local lifestyle magazine (unfortunately, this is only a once monthly contribution) 
- Obtained and completed two unpaid graphic design internships because I used to design blogs/websites/posters/etc. when I was a kid and teenager and enjoyed it 
- Quit smoking cigarettes (a year and a half ago after smoking for seven years) and started exercising 5x/week. I mainly run, lift weights, and practice yoga. 

Over the summer and after my 26th birthday, I started to have a major panic attack because I felt like I had completely fucked up my life by not completing college. The restaurant is also failing, mostly because of its poor location, so I needed to change something anyway. 

I applied to schools and got into some good ones, but although I got a decent amount of aid, it still wasn't enough to go. Thus, I ended up at a state university, which I hate. 

In my desperation, I decided to pursue a degree in communication design (also known as graphic design) with a concentration in interactive design because I already had some internships on my resume and a little bit of experience in the field. However, the program will require 3 years with no chance of acceleration to complete the Bachelor's, and I will be about $40,000 in debt and newly 29 years old by the time I'm finished. I'm not even sure if this is a smart degree to get based on the time, cost, and the fact that the average graphic designer only makes $50,000 with more probably making closer to $35,000 per year. I like the field, but I don't love it at all, and I'm feeling like I might be making a mistake by pursuing a degree in a low-paying, competitive field that I'm not extremely passionate about. I think I mostly jumped into this program because I was desperate to do something that wasn't spending my life waiting tables. I also now live in a small college town surrounded by traditional students all week, which is pretty isolating. I drive an hour and a half home every weekend to work and come back during the school week. This complete lack of a social life is killing me. I've gotten involved with some things and met people, but at the end of the day, my peers are 19 and I'm 26. We just don't have very much in common.

My other interests are writing and fitness. My ""dream jobs"" are book author, pop culture essayist, magazine writer and editor, or to be able to make a living helping people with their fitness and exercise goals. I'm not sure which of the following choices are best: 

- Try to continue landing freelance writing gigs and continue working in restaurants on the side 
- Obtain some personal training/group fitness/yoga teacher certifications and pursue a career in fitness and continue working in restaurants on the side 
- Transfer universities to a better school in a larger city and pursue a degree in English or journalism where a) the school's name will carry more weight, b) I can complete a degree faster due to summer/winter session support, c) I won't be as socially isolated 
- Stay here for another 2 1/2 years and finish the design degree 

I really don't know what to do. Nursing? Half kidding..."

I started with finance but picked up the double major two years ago (beginning of sophomore year). I have four more classes to go in computer science, among which I am taking two now. I have taken 7 classes in computer science major so far with a high GPA (~3.9) in them.

I was recruiting for fully finance industry positions up until this past summer, and I had a summer internship in finance. That was my first time working full-time in the financial industry, and it was kind of... boring. I didn't get the feeling this is what I could bear doing 60 hours a week for the next however many years, which is why I'm now looking to go into full programming roles.

My resume looks like a finance student's resume. I have had four internships in various areas of the financial industry. I currently have a TA position in an intro level CS course, and that's it for work experience in technology. Also, my finance GPA is lower than my CS GPA so my overall GPA looks not so stellar (still acceptable).

I am wondering what my next steps should be. I've been applying to jobs and getting some interviews, but partly due to my lack of preparation and international student status, I rarely advance to next rounds. I've sent my resume to some startups for part-time internships, but I'm not sure whether taking an internship now is a good idea. Due to visa restrictions, I may have to work unpaid (CPT dealine passed for this semester).

[Resume with some info blocked out](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqflbj37qb0anjk/Resume%28redacted%29.pdf?dl=0): I'm not looking for resume critiques, although they are welcome. This is for reference.

2jfo19,11,2014-10-16,Easily Modified Quick Mainstay Program: Beginners &amp; Up (Blueprint) for General Fitness,DPTFit,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2jfo19/easily_modified_quick_mainstay_program_beginners/,"**THE PROGRAM**

 * Just because formatting was giving me some trouble, I have a picture of the plan with the exercises I am currently using and a second picture of the list of exercises I chose from. Simply pick an exercise and fill it in. Add exercises you love that fit and remove exercises you dislike. (You will also see primers listed. These are simply options I used to include to start the workout. In effort to save time, I haven't been doing them lately. I don't recommend olympic lifts without some formal training/cueing first)

 * [**Program with my current exercises**](http://prntscr.com/4wqoln)

 * [**Exercise List**](http://prntscr.com/4wri99)

**Program Intro**: 

 * **Who's it for**: This program is very easily modified to fit most goals, though it is geared towards more weekend warrior, off season amateur athletes, and people who want a balanced workout in a quick amount of time.  *Read*: **General Fitness** It fits in the major movement patterns, allows for easy modification, and could be used as the basic blue-print for people wishing to change their routines. *Those looking to compete in bodybuilding would likely want to target specific body parts more, while powerlifters would obviously gear towards major lifts, and those looking to compete in higher level athletics would want to target movements for their sport more.* 

 * We read a lot of posts from people looking to grow huge muscles or lift huge amounts of weight. I assume many of you are just trying to stay fit, keep weight off, keep muscle tone up, and not spend hours in the gym. This program can be your building block.

 * **What makes it special?** It's not actually special. You can easily follow any of the major program listed on the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise) and make great gains. I see a lot of people ask about modifications to these programs which can get tricky for amateurs. This allows an easy way to customize your program towards what you enjoy, but keeps balance in mind. I believe most solid programs start with a base similar to this, then they make it more specific. It's simple &amp; easy to use. 

 * **The Details**: I follow this program as a two-day split. I typically complete 2-3 gym workouts a week, alternating splits. Can be broken down or built up to 1 day split or 3-4 day split as needed with ease. The split is broken down to a **Hip Dominant plus Push** day as well as a **Quad Dominant plus Pull** day ^1 . On each day a horizontal &amp; vertical push/pull is performed, as well as the main hip/quad dominant exercise and an accessory exercise. In addition, I include core work, shoulder prehab ^2 , arm work ^3 , and typically a finisher ^4 on the respective days. As you will see, I perform it with supersets, which allows a shorter time in the gym and increased cardio effect. It's possible total weight lifted goes down slightly in this fashion, but for general fitness this shouldn't be a concern. If it is, simply do straight sets.


 * **Progression**: Should be dependent on goals. Reps/sets are easily modified here. My favorite way to ensure constant progress and great way for weekend warriors to hit all there bases is a mix of reps/mass progression as described in [The Big Six Program by Multiyear Weight Training App](http://www.weightliftingapp.com/bigsix.html). I'll grossly parapharse for you here, though I know where close to do it justice. You focus on increasing reps with a given weight until a point (target rep range), then up the weight for a new target rep range. Cycling from high to low reps. Or you go into trying to add weight each workout until unable to hit target reps, then you change the rep range. In this way you are constantly changing weights and reps, so very quickly eliminate plateaus. (*Again, if you have very specific goals beyond general fitness, these scheme may not be ideal*)

 * **Progression Continued**: If your goals are more general fitness, weight loss, etc. vs mass/strength, I also find changing exercises regularly can help. As I've programmed here. I recommend changing some aspect of training every 4-8 weeks, whether that's built in just as the Big Six Program did, or you simply do low reps for 6 weeks, then higher reps for six weeks, that works too. But, another way is to change the exercise selection. This helps elevate some risk of overuse injuries as well as may keep things more ""exciting"" for some. Personally, I follow the big six method to some degree for 8-12 weeks, then change exercises. I may change the accessory exercises more frequently, and may keep my main exercises slightly longer.


**My Info**: I'm a doctor of physical therapy and a NSCA Certified personal trainer. I've worked with D1 college basketball team (intern for the strength &amp; conditioning coach) for a year and at the Official Olympic Training Center (primarily in Rehab, though I shadowed the coaches when patients cancelled or after work to see the athletes as they return to sport) for 6 months. Currently working in sports rehab for the more high school age or weekend warrior crowd. Honestly, even though my education and experience in athletics/fitness is likely a bit higher than many people posting here, I will never stop learning. It's commonly people who actually do follow more anecdotal evidence or ""Broscience"" or just people who've trained for years and found things that work for them that spark the most interesting conversations between my colleagues. There's a lot of evidence that has pages and pages of research, but really doesn't say much and it's common for some of us to get bogged down by that. I do all the time. Even some of the brilliant researchers I've had a chance to work with can be stumped when I quote people from this site; people who likely have no formal education and haven't ever read more than an abstract on PubMed, if that. *Basically what I'm trying to say is I think I am a smart guy and qualified to give solid advice, but I don't at all think I know it all. I don't at all think just because you do not have an education in biomechanics or human physiology that you can't make any number of improvements or suggestions to me, or people much smarter than I am.*  **I would love critiques to the programming, the exercise list, heck, even my post format**. I'm still young and growing and learning. 

**Additional**:

^1: using hip vs quad dominant is standard practice, though can vary greatly in individuals. Squats for example can be more hip or quad dominant based on how the exercise is performed, person's biomechanics, etc. I have consider scratching these terms and instead saying Deadlift &amp; Push or Squats &amp; Pull. Then have accessory exercises for each. Also, most people would call deadlift a pulling exercise. I put upper body pushing with for a couple reasons. Mainly, I don't use accessories like straps, chalk, etc. so when I do a lot of pulling, my grip gives out on heavy deadlifts. Also, figure the back gets some work on the deadlifts, so I'd rather come in more ""fresh"" for upper pulling, though it's really not a big deal to switch these around.

^2: I'm a Physical Therapist and see a **ton** of shoulder injuries. The typical plan doesn't address pre-hab enough in my opinion. I actually do more on other days, but like to make it a specific exercise to address either the lower/mid traps, rhomboids, or rotator cuff (specifically teres minor and infraspinatus) with external rotation work). 

^3: I did absolutely no arm work for ~2 years on a similar program and still had well built arms, though not *large* per our standards, I could definitely could wear tanks without being embarrassed. Though, my girlfriend loves arms (of course, not my PRs on deadlift or ability to maintain a stable spine in weighted planks, but my arms), so I added these in for vanity's sake. 

^4: Recent Addition. Just a more conditioning type move at the end of a workout. I skip it 50% of the time because am an avid runner, plus do circuits/metcons 2-3x a week as well so stay fairly conditioned. But it nice to fit some of these in while I have the equipment.

I guess I just have to go with the flow but I tend to get really nervous and will feel terrible if I need to follow around these busy people during the game asking them a ton of questions. 

Does anyone have any tips for a situation like this?

My plan is to accept this web development job, practice hard and brush up on my Java/C/C++ skills and possibly do a side project and then when I feel I'm ready I can apply for other jobs.

Is this a suitable idea?"
2jfx5t,44,2014-10-16,Testimonial: Half-Life is the reason I am where I am.,tgstine,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2jfx5t/testimonial_halflife_is_the_reason_i_am_where_i_am/,"Apologies in advance for the long post, but I have never actually told this story in full before. Not many people may see it but I hope you find it inspiring.

Right now, I am attending college, 2 semesters away from a Degree in Computer Networking. I have an Internship at a computer shop, and I am an avid gamer, and long time lurker of PC Master Race.

I grew up on Roller Coaster Tycoon (started when I was around 5 so technically it was my father playing it and me watching for a long time) and Pokemon on my Game-boy Advance. Until, of-course, my private school banned Pokemon because they considered it satanic (This was around 4th grade). 

Internet was a world I could not explore. Still the fastest internet in the area I grew up is 1.5Mbps, but until I was 15 we still only had dial-up speeds. I had to drive 25 miles to school every day, as the bus routes did not even go out to where I was. To me, YouTube was a myth, as back then 240 and 144p did not exist. The only Multi-player experiences I knew of were a Runescape that took ages to load a single area (I chopped a lot of trees…).

Somehow, I eventually survived until public high school, and discovered an Alpha Minecraft. Through this time period I had no access to Internet besides the school itself. Minecraft introduced me to the first-person aspect of games,  and just in time too. My sophomore year, I took a “Operating Systems” class. Basically, Using Windows XP, 101. 

This classroom had a separate LAN from the school’s network, and I was handed down a relic. A cracked version of Half-Life on a flash drive (The school had a proxy so you could not play a legitimate version). I quickly backed up the files on multiple sources, and began distributing it with my friends in the class. From there, every day after the class work was done, we would all hit the LAN and play for as long as we could. I caught on quickly and the games slowly turned from an even 8-player free-for-all, to a 7v1 on Crossfire with me holding a Crossbow and a Long Jump Module, in which the scores would be on average 127-17. The games did not last long, however, as the teachers began to catch on and confiscate the game files (aaaand I had lost some friends because of the game at that point…).

This is where it all went Italian Job style. My group of friends (that were left) would all meet at breakfast and distribute the copies. From there we would set a time to play (typically at the end of a period), and play across the network on different computers every day. This only work some of the time, and I could not figure out why, until I discovered subnetting and various security measures, like MAC filtering (why we could not use our own laptops).

Then it happened. Playing Half-Life after class one day, and I am approached by the Network Administrator. *gulp* Basically, I had to stop playing the game on computers across the network, but I also had to spend next semester working with him. Bam. Half-Life got me busted, and threw me into a world of Linux, Networking, and Coding *blech*. From there I discovered Steam, built the Desktop (without help) for under $550 I still have today (different video card), got A+ Certified, moved to the city, got 40Mbps Internet *Hallelujah*, attended college, got an internship, and am now writing this because I finished the work in my NET class and don’t have a copy of Half-Life with me.

In all seriousness, I owe the people that helped me get here everything, but without Half-Life I would not have been exposed to the world of Telecommunications, Information Technology, or Multiplayer games.

TL:DR - I got busted for playing Half-Life in Highschool, was thrown head-first into the world of Linux and Networking, fell in love with it, and am about to finish a degree in Networking.

I started out as a support main in season 3 since i played with 4 friends mostely and i always got the support lane, so when i played solo queue i went for the support role mostely since i had alot more experience in that role and i didnt want to fuck games up.
So i got into Silver IV, but now in season 4 i wanted to change my main lane and become either jungler, adc or midlaner so i played alot in teambuilder to get my skill up and i think im getting the hang of adc, and win quite some games. 

But ever since i started playing adc in ranked (pref. lucian) my wins dropped hugely and its even to the point im on a 25% winrate in my last 20 ranked games ( i played some jungle and support between the games to take a break or help out another player ) i think my adc CSing is fine atm, and i know i should buy more wards but is there anything else? i noticed my deaths are quite high overall, and noticed that my deaths mostely occoure in mid/late game while teamfighting and not getting enough protection or just fail to position myself correctly. 

Any tips on this? Thanks a bunch!

oh p.s. didnt drop from silver to bronze due to this, but due to inactivity (internship, school, work etc..) but i do lose alooot of games now."

I am scheduled to be there MWF from 8 to 4:30.  My supervisor never is able to plan anything, meaning if I need to meet her elsewhere besides the office, she will text me 15 minutes before hand or the night before.  She will text me about work related things on my days off, and at all times of the day.  Sometimes where I need to meet her will be 40 minutes away.  One time she sent me a text on a Friday night because she was bored.

She is a horrible supervisor besides that.  She never gives me opportunities to learn, constantly cuts me off in my interactions with patients.  She refused to stop so I could eat my lunch or go to the bathroom.  I am denied basic human needs since she gets paid per client she sees.

I have tried many times to discuss this with her and she complies for the day and then back to the same pattern.  She is constantly demeaning and tells me that I am not as experienced as her and don't know what I'm doing.  Obviously I am aware of this.  I have no problem admitting that.  However, This is my 3rd internship, after this I will be working, I feel that I shouldn't be treated as a 19 year old college kid.  Instead of her helping me incorporate my previous experience with this one, she acts as if I have no experience whatsoever.

On top of all of this, she constantly vents to me about her personal problems, including her divorce and her husband cheating on her.  She has actually cried to me many times in person and over the phone.  It puts me in such an awkward position because while I feel bad for her, I am here to learn on the job.  


Things I have done already:
- contacted my school liason who suggested I talk to my supervisor and remind her what is appropriate.
-talked to my supervisor and have told her the things I need to be able to learn in this internship.
-talked to my supervisor's boss and asked for less time with her/ another supervisor.


My question is what else can I do to fix this?  I am trying my best to learn but at the same time I am not an employee and I do not want to step on anyone's toes.  I cannot leave this internship, I am here until April. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.  "

2jgghn,3,2014-10-16,I [22M] am a bit concerned about my younger brother [20M] and think he may be mildly depressed.,r3dast3rik09,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jgghn/i_22m_am_a_bit_concerned_about_my_younger_brother/,"I'll try to keep this succinct but I do apologize in advance if it's a bit long.

My brother is currently a junior in undergrad majoring in life sciences, his goal being to earn his doctoral degree in physical therapy. He's always been athletically inclined and is interested in the biomechanics of the human body, so he chose PT as his goal because he can combine the two in an appreciable capacity. Overall, he's a smart kid with a good heart. He's a gym rat (5 days/week) and is relatively healthy. But this is where some of my concerns begin.

He was a pretty stellar student in middle school (3.9 GPA) up until high school, where his grades plummeted (2.85 GPA). My family was not sure why and attributed it to him being lazy or the amount of time he invested in basketball and volleyball, two of his favorite sports. For exams he actually studied hard for, he would easily clear those with A's but such instances were few and far between. There was much tension with my parents and him because he was very nonchalant about school in general. His standardized tests begat similar results and his college application process was pretty dismal in all honesty, but through some act of luck and my mom on his case, he was accepted from a pretty good school (top 75) and that too with a half-ride academic scholarship much to everyone's surprise, especially his.


He hated high school from an academic and social perspective, which I can understand. Where we went to high school was extremely competitive and socially, people were pretty bitchy; it was the same people you knew from elementary and middle school and people could be assholes, but that is the case at many other schools. I had a somewhat similar experience myself but I sort of figured I needed to work hard for 4 years and move on to a great college where I could have a new start, which I was able to do.


During these high school years, in light of grades and his nonchalance, family discussions about this were recurrent features. He's not one to lash out or react violently but it only seemed to be with us at home that while we were trying to have a constructive factual conversation, he would get violently agitated and storm out of the room. Slamming doors, punching tables, violent jumping, prolific cursing, panic attacks... you name it. My dad is not the best at dealing with this but thankfully, my mother knows how to try not to accidentally trigger him. Despite all that, he still finds ways to get upset. He takes criticism very personally even if it is honest and constructive, and he is very ready to pin the blame on something else.


He saw college as a way to get a new start, academically and socially,  and was prepared to make good on his errors and make the most of this second chance he'd been given to redeem himself. Socially, he's doing much better and is happier, which is very evident. However in two years of undergrad, he's back to the GPA he was at in high school.  He says he studies hard for his classes and spaces out his social partying life, which I do know to be true, but can't get the results he wants. Naturally, this has him dismayed and troubled. His tougher math classes, he's been able to excel in with no trouble at all. But as a science major, those are the classes which matter more and in those he seems to be struggling. And he keeps making the same pitfalls again and again.

He says he's tried everything and nothing is working for him, and he's been very upset. It's quite often he'll talk with my mother and I about his concerns and he feels trapped, like he's wasted 2 years of his life.  At the same time, he's also been very nonchalant about finding research, internships, and other related experience he needs if he wishes to apply for PT school. This is concerning to me because on one end, he claims that PT is what he wants to really do. On the other end, he's more than halfway through his college career and his activities section on his applications is pretty bleak which will not reflect well on his candidature.

Besides this, he's very quick to enter a self-deprecating mode which I think is self-destructive for him. In addition, he is very afraid of failure which I think is affecting his own ability to perform to the best of his capacity. He'll usually quickly jump to ""oh this is too hard, I can't do it"" even before he tries. If he was genuinely stupid and lacked all sense of application/critical thinking, I'd understand. But I've seen him excel in some extremely difficult classes because, as he puts it, he ""cares about the material even if it is boring"". 

Last weekend, my mother went to visit him for parents' weekend as a way to spend time with him and cheer him up, given that he had two weeks of midterms soon to follow. Apparently, he had a bit of a panic attack about some assignment because the online submission website was down. As per my mother's account, he got visibly upset as he chucked his reading material to the ground and she was concerned in particular by a statement he used **""It's all going to be over soon anyways.** 

She stopped him there and calmed him but was concerned by this, as was I when she told this to me last night over FaceTime. We discussed this between ourselves (I'm a neuroscientist, one of her masters is in psychology) and we think he has some of the signs of depression are naturally concerned about him. He does seem to have some of the signs:

- helpless/hopeless with his academic situation
- prone to over the top reactions over simple matters (yelling, crying, violence)
- feels trapped and that nobody understands what he's going through
- has had a few panic attacks here and there
- strong self-loathing
- binge eating
- has trouble sleeping
- making the aforementioned statement in bold
- consistent fear of failing even before an attempt at doing something

At home we've tried but I also know that sometimes, family can be useless in things like this. We sincerely try to be supportive, but we're quite concerned about him.  Personally, I think he should meet with someone to talk about what's going on and get some closure. I think that in doing so, he can hopefully get some mental peace and if he feels a sense of getting a weight off of his shoulders, this may help to reverse some the obstacles in his life.

I'm not qualified practitioner or therapist, but I truly feel that if he meets with a counselor or therapist and can work with them to figure it out, it can help him long-term. My mother and I have tried to mention this in a not so direct way, to avoid him reacting violently and us thinking he's mental. These behaviors/habits have gone on for the past 6 years and it's a bit alarming; we thought this was a phase he'd move past as part of growing up but it doesn't seem that way.

How is the best way to approach such a situation? Do we have a reason to be concerned? 

----------------

**TL;DR: brother feels he's stuck no matter what he does academically and not doing well as a result. Has a history of lashing out, shows some signs of depression, struggling to stay afloat. Us as a family want to help but not sure what to do. What to do? Should we be worried?**"

At big firms, it seems like I am not elite enough to get in and at small firms it seems like my skill set isn't developed enough as they are looking for specific talent to fit in their team.

My problem is that I am 20, a Junior in college, triple major (German, Finance, International Business), have spent one summer studying in Germany and the other interning in business development, and have even been cold calling and emailing CEOs to no avail. My GPA isn't amazing (3.5), but it isn't bad and I am even currently doing a semester in Germany where I am taking Master's classes and working on my fluency in the language. 

The thing I am unsure of is what the next step is. If all the effort I have put in hasn't worked what can I do? I come from a low income family and am the first to go to college and take every internship and resume padding opportunity I can, but what do I have to do to make it to the interview phase or even be attractive enough.

It has been a disheartening journey as I need an internship in Europe next year in order to stay and the options are looking bleak.

I very reluctantly agree to at least interview you. As the interview starts I don't show much interest but as it progresses, I realize just how weak and easily manipulatable you are and begin to use my leverage and intimidating presence to use you sexually and turn you into my personal and company slut.

2jgpg6,5,2014-10-16,[Advice] Reorganized with no way of moving lateral or up unless I try to leave,nangaho,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2jgpg6/advice_reorganized_with_no_way_of_moving_lateral/,"Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to summarize the long story the best that I can. The title is pretty much the TL;DR. 

I work for the Federal Government (US). The Agency I work for went through a reorganization of all of IT to form one huge organization. As part of the reorganization people were allowed to select where they were going to land, and as management put it, everyone got to where they want it. I landed in an organization that can be best described as the sales department in a company. We make sure customer relations are good and ""sell"" IT, services, support and start projects for agency customers. We take care of high level requests and are often in talks with agency executives and upper management. I was put here instead of selecting to be in it. Non the less I still do the job I'm assigned and I'm actually one of the best in the group. 

When I started one of the first things I did was to ask my manager about promotions and moving up. My manager tells me that as long as I had happy customers and did my duties that I would be promoted. Not long after a volunteering project came up and I took it. It was technical, and I did really well with it. 

By this time my manager tells my to apply to a position that was open in the group as it would guarantee me a promotion since the IT executives froze promotions indefinitely. The position was essentially the same job I did and had done for the past 3 years. So I applied. And the HR system rejected me instantly. It turns out that I'm 2 levels below it and you can only apply to one level above you. I let my manager know of this and I'm told that they'll just promote me.

Mid April, at this point the project I volunteered for ended and I was given another one. My manager tells me they'll promote me after it. This was a agency wide email migration and I was the team lead of support for HQ. This was the most stressful job I have ever been given. Not nearly enough resources to do half of what was being asked for and I had scheduling targets that were being moved around every few hours or so for whole the month prior to execution. It was very unmanageable. On top of this I was left sitting with the previous organization that I worked for and they decided to assign my cubicle to an intern. They told me to pack up and leave ASAP on the week before migration. So I was leading a large scale effort, shuffling around IT resources and packing my stuff into boxes. Only to do everything again the next day because some executive decided to make changes to the scheduling. The project finally ends in early June and everyone is praising me for the success of what was done. I even got 2 non-monetary awards for it. 

To this day I'm still taking on high visibility projects and doing well but I'm highly stressed by the whole situation. I even have Tier-1 and 2 Tech Support asking me for help on just about everything.

It is now almost a year after I started and I still haven't seen a penny more to my name. I'm told to apply to other openings IT has but they're all in management, I get rejected by HR every time. Every time I've asked my manager I'm told a different excuse. I've spent a good part of the year applying for jobs in public sector that got nowhere. 

This month I started applying to private companies and I immediately got an interview with a tech company, a highly technical entry level position but it seems far better than what I've gone through. I let my manager know about it and that I've been asked to go to a second interview and start what looks like an on-boarding process. My manager immediately tells me that other people will get involved to make me a counteroffer because they want to keep me in the agency.

I'm not sure what to do and what to pursue. Any comments or suggestions are well appreciated. This is my first post but I've been lurking for some time now."

2jh1im,1,2014-10-16,Advice on how to land a job in the footwear/apparel industry.,TegsCD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2jh1im/advice_on_how_to_land_a_job_in_the/,"I've been applying for jobs for sometime now and have been having no luck.  I have very little experience in this industry as I have mostly worked in bars/restaurants all my life.  I really want to make something I have a passion for my career and I know that I need to start at the bottom.  I worked for a local boutique for about 8 months being mostly a sales associate but I did help run the web store and did do merchandising for the store as well.  The problem was that job was 5 years ago and the business has now went under which to me makes the experience almost irrelevant.  I do have a degree but I got it in History so I feel that it doesn't help that much either besides the fact that I did get a degree.

The reason I stayed in the service industry was the fact that I was making a lot of money and became comfortable in that lifestyle.  But more recently I've just felt that I'm not accomplishing anything and not really moving forward with my life.  This is why I'm now trying to start a career in fashion.

I've been applying to mostly jobs that are mostly assistant merchandiser/assistant buyer positions since ultimately one day I would love to be a buyer.  I do have interests in e-commerce, marketing and design as well.  I honestly just want to learn everything I can about the industry and gain every skill that I can.  I'm open to internships but unfortunately most of them require being in school.  I did have an interview for a paid internship with Timberland for their marketing department for product launch and collaborations but unfortunately two days after the interview I found out that the position was suspended indefinitely.  I live in San Diego and we have a good amount action sports apparel companies in the area and Orange County and Los Angeles are only hour to two hour drives away which I wouldn't mind doing.  I have also emailed many companies in the area offering volunteered help in order to just gain some experience but only one, John Elliot +Co, replied back saying they love the enthusiasm but they aren't look for any help right now.  All other companies don't even reply back which is frustrating because most of them have only a few employees.

I'm trying to get my foot in the door where I can and it doesn't matter the size of the company.  I've expanded my job search and have even been applying for warehouse positions to just get my foot in the door and prove my worth but I don't even get responses from them either.  I just don't really know how else to put myself out there.  I see ""entry level"" jobs and I apply to them and don't get a response and a month later I still see that same position available.  I'm getting really frustrated and I don't want to give up but I don't know what to do.  I've talked to some people in the industry and they've been great with giving me advice but don't have any leads on jobs/internships.

I know that this is really long and I appreciate any advice that anyone has.  I don't want to start looking for a different career path but the lack of responses from companies has started getting me really down.

Thanks in advance"

2jh9k7,6,2014-10-16,"1st Semester MSW Student- Need advice looking for ""resources"" for clients (housing, medical assistance)",[deleted],socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/2jh9k7/1st_semester_msw_student_need_advice_looking_for/,"So I am a first year graduate student intern at an agency that does a ton of stuff. Right now, at this point in the year I am starting to receive my own clients, performing therapy, ""bio-psycho-socials"", and treatment plans. First, I feel like I am being thrown into a shark tank because my graduate class literally just learned about treatment plans for the first time last week. (Most of the class are psychology majors so very few know much about social work as an undergrad major).

Anyways, I heard from a second hand source at the agency I am interning for that I am doing a pretty good job, straight from the clients, in the actual therapy part. 

But the thing that is causing me the most stress, more than any of my classes even, are finding client's ""resources"". For 95% of the clients that I am trying to help right now, I have no idea what I am doing and my supervisors are helpful, but don't give me exact directions until after I submit a therapy note to them, which is kind of tough in my opinion because I would prefer to help the clients during our meetings.

Two examples come to mind. One client is trying to get medical assistance. This is an adult teenager with several diagnosis that warrant medical assistance but I'm not even sure how to go about finding out what he needs or how I get it for him. Where do I go? Where to I take this client? I think medicaid was mentioned at one point. Is there a specific place I should go that provides information on getting medical assistance to young adults?

The second client is an older client with lowered mental capabilities and needs resources on housing. Now to provide some context, I literally get a treatment plan from another therapist saying something like ""crossroads or PATH"". I'm not sure what those are but I assume those are housing resources of some sort?

I guess my main question is, when I'm just starting out with zero background in any of this and just expected to help out with providing medical assistance and housing, what do I do? Are there resources that you licensed social workers use to check to help these clients, and if so, what are they so I can begin to use them to help my clients.

Thanks!"

I'm a good programmer, but  I find all my classes in Comp Sci either boring or extremely difficult.  I can't stand math based classes, barely managed to pass Calc 2 and am struggling in Discrete Mathematics now.

The only classes I've enjoyed that I've taken in college are philosophy or sociology classes.  However my cumulative GPA is shit(2.1) so I can't really change majors to anything that requires grad school.  All the internships I've looked at for the upcoming summer have a requirement of at least 2.8, so I won't be able to get an internship in the coming summer.

I currently owe $21,000 in student loans.  I don't know what I'll do if I decide not to continue college, but I feel like I'm digging myself a deeper and deeper hole and not going into a field that I'll really enjoy.  I enjoy problem solving but I'd be more interested in a field with more creativity.

I feel trapped, I can't drop out and I don't even know if I'll even be able to get a job if I continue at college.  I wish I could just start college fresh again, but that's not really an option."

We were both undergrad students. Known each other for 4 years. My senior year, her super senior year (she's a few months older), we hooked up. Her relationship was in the final stages with her then-current bf. She cheated on him with me. First red flag, I know, but I believe in second chances. Cheating isn't really a deal breaker for me. She dated him for 3 years and it was her first relationship and nothing else, (like flings etc.). I had one relationship before in high school which turned into long distance into freshman year, then she broke up with me 3 months in. I had a few flings here and there. I took advantage of her when she was vulnerable and she broke up with her bf, and we become friends with benefits. Also, we're both really stubborn. She is more anti-social and I am more social, aka she doesnt have a lot of friends and likes her alone time and I am the opposite. But we have a lot of fun together.

Our Relationship:
6 months in, we both started to get attached (aug 2013 - dec 2013). but she didnt want to put a label on it. I pushed. She ran away (metaphorically). We ended it during winter break. But we were so attached we kept talking and got back together as FWB. Or even closer. Basically dating but no label. I wanted it to be official and I pushed for it again. We ended it during Spring Break. We got back together again and she finally said yes to being BF and GF.

When it was time to graduate (June 2014), she said that she didn't want long distance. She said she didn't see any potential in me because I didn't have anything lined up after college (aka internships or job). I was a slacker in school (I'll save you my reasons and stuff I went through). We ended it, but then she had a panic attack and I took her to the hospital and back. and stayed with her. I convinced her again that we should stay together and that I wanted to take care of her. I really couldn't leave her alone. I got into grad school and am working my way towards having a successful career and life, to become the all desirable life partner.

Summer started and she started to become distant. She was in Thailand (we're both Thai, fun fact) and I was being clingy because I was so scared after everything that happened. I expected her to text all the freaking time. Of course, very unrealistic. We broke up. A week passed, I thought that we can just talk as friends. and we did. Until we became friends with benefits again, albeit long distance ones.

August 2014, she had to come to my city to pack up the rest of her things in her old apartment. She stayed at my place. We hung out an entire weekend and it was so much fun. The morning she was supposed to leave, she woke up crying saying that she still loved her ex. We ended things because apparently, since she got back to the U.S. she was talking to her ex again, although she was talking to me more and vid chatting and everything. Basically long distance relationship in my eyes. She only talked to her ex a few times. Of course, we ended it. Next day, we say we're sorry and continue friends with benefits.

September 2014, 2 weeks after the events of the last paragraph, she comes to chicago again, and we hang out all weekend again, and I found out she's still talking to her ex. I finally say, ""talk to me when you're ready to get over your ex."" and I planned to move on. A week later, she calls me a million times and cries and says she wants me and my dumb*ss takes her back.

It was all good for a bit. And then she started to become quiet again. I find out she is depressed, diagnosed and everything. She isn't depressed enough for meds though. I was willing to go through it all for her. Wanted to be there for her. But she said that she wanted to break up. She had symptoms before. Frequent headaches and stomachaches and was tired all the time even though she slept 8-10 hours everyday. She didn't want to talk to anyone and just slept all the time. Fine. She's going through things and I should let her be. This was a week ago from this post. I haven't talked to her since then.

I find out just a few hours ago that she's in my city again. It's her fall break and it was planned for her to come visit Wed-Sun. I paid for half her plane ticket too. I didn't care about paying back then, but I kind of care now. I only find out that she was here because there was a Thai club reunion and I was invited.

I feel betrayed. What she did just doesn't add up. Maybe it was doomed from the beginning. Maybe I didn't know when to give up. Maybe I was too much of a romantic and believed that if we just get to a sweet spot that it would be all fine. Many couples are on and off until they work things out.

I am going to this reunion tomorrow. How should I act? I am seriously hoping she gets on her hands and knees and begs me to get back with her. But I know that won't happen. Will I take her back? Right now, probably not, but I do not know what I will do when I am actually there. My brain says I definitely should not take her back. I think we will be polite to each other. and then get on with our lives. But my heart will easily give her another chance. I just thought we would work out so well. 

But I deserve an explanation right? How can she say all the things about wanting to be alone, and then come to chicago and seeing all of these people. We were friends first and she didn't even want to say ""hey."" It just doesn't add up. I don't want to assume anything and go in angry to this reunion and just blow up in front of her face and all our friends. I tried so hard to give her the benefit of the doubt every single time. I always said it was my fault that things went to sh*t. I worked so hard and tried my best.

After writing all this, I don't even know why I wanted to write it in the first place. I guess I am so sad that I just don't know what to do and I am posting here to get opinions or just for someone to read and acknowledge what I am going through.

I thought it was all worth it, and to see it end like this, to see that we'll be strangers again, is so f*cking sad. What do I say to her? I definitely shouldn't even think of a relationship with her right?

I have always been an open book and been described as wearing my heart on my sleeve. I never hold anything back and just go all in. I've been hurt many times, but I don't think I should hold back just because of the fear of getting my heart sh*t on. But I don't know. Maybe it's wrong to think like that. Although, I have not said ""I love you to her yet."" That has been impossible to say to anyone after my first breakup (which was through a text from my first ex btw so kind of scarring).

I thought the only thing was that we just had communication issues. She doesn't like to open up, but I do. I like to talk to her every second of the day whenever possible, but she doesn't. It's probably because I like her more than she likes me. I don't know. I have tried to come up with every reason possible why everything turned south. Maybe we were too different. Maybe she was too immature. Maybe I am immature as well.

What happened? What do I do? What do I do in general and what do I do at the reunion?

I am sorry if there are any spelling errors. Please let me know if you need clarification on anything.

2ji38c,1,2014-10-17,Just screwed up one of my first job interviews,dolfjewolfje,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ji38c/just_screwed_up_one_of_my_first_job_interviews/,"Just came back from one of my first job interviews ever. Had to look for a company to do an internship at and found a neat looking company, somewhere in the neighbourhood. 

Called me yesterday, said I could go on an interview today to see how things would go. Bit late, but whatever. 

Shit went horrible. It was IT related for the record. Favorite programming language? Dunno the ones I know are all pretty neat I guess. Favorite framework? See answer A. Got any projects you did on your own recently? Nope, did em all for school or work. Lots of plans, but nothing accomplished. Familiair with our technologies? Err little bit.  Why did you choose to do programming in IT? Cause it seems pretty neat to me and I enjoy it, I guess? Why did you go to a psychologist? None of his damn bussiness, but I gave him some vague answer. Got any friends you could do this internship with, as it's a job for two? I'll ask around, but probably not. 

*sigh* 

It really made me feel like a huge loser to be honest. One of my professors at school is frigging enthusisastic with this shit. Loves the idea of making little apps, he's ecstatic when he can make his apps that little bit smaller. I'm honestly jealous. I wish I could be as motivated in my job as he is. That I could transform my hobby into my job, to find something I'd shit my pants in excitement for. 

Ugh, this is one of those moments where you feel like doing off with yourself. It's difficult for me to see myself ever rise beyond what I am right now.

Some people want to relax and think about their problems. I don't. I just wanna forget all about my problems right now. "
2ji3t7,73,2014-10-17,Trends I have Noticed on GetStudying Thus Far and My Tips for Overcoming the Typical Issues,ArthurAardvark,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/2ji3t7/trends_i_have_noticed_on_getstudying_thus_far_and/,"Taking a break from a lousy study session, funnily enough. 

- ""I can't find the energy to study""
You should study in the morning. Take a hefty dose of caffeine and fuel up with a good breakfast and get going. Just do it. 

You aren't going to magically find intrinsic motivation after a certain amount of time, even if you are decently passionate about said subject.

You will lose focus a little still, but if you had a good night's rest, to add, and manage to do the following tip, I think you'll generally stay on track.


- ""I procrastinate and/or get off track during studying or doing homework""

Always comes back to ""just do it."" Do it early enough and you'll only have to do 15 minutes at a time. Reward yourself for that work and move on to whatever other homework you have to do after rewarding yourself for 15 minutes. Think about your small attention span...at least if you are doing a different subject you'll be a little more interested.


- ""I am taking a class that I have no interest in, how can I possibly stay motivated?""

You won't. At least if your motivation is ""I need to get a good grade."" You have to start thinking about it a little more deeply...that class is a stepping stone to whatever goal you set. Sure it may not be your choice that you have to take women's studies to get your comp. sci. degree but you'll inevitably have to sacrifice to get what you truly desire in life. If you also follow the tips above, you will manage to have a little more energy and discipline in getting the work done for the class. 


- ""I don't have any discipline."" 

Public setting and a motivated study buddy would be my best recommendation. Furthermore, don't deny your temptations, let them simply pass over you like a wave. Tell yourself that you'll reward yourself with 15 minutes of Reddit or whatever after you do 15 minutes of work.


- ""I am easily distracted.""

Realize how silly the thing is that is distracting you. Be mindful of what generally gets to you. You'll begin recognizing the causes of your desire to indulge on your distraction(s) and slowly but surely you'll be able to avoid the triggers in the first place. 

I also recommend minimalism. Keep a water bottle, some good protonz filled food and a couple pencils in front of you. That should be all that is on your desk besides your work. 

Put your phone on airplane mode. If you absolutely NEED to use your computer, use an extension to block Reddit etc.. If it is writing something down in Word...actually write it first, then transfer it onto Word. That'll also make you proofread it. 



Little tidbits I'd also like to add:

- Start small BEHAVIORS that you can say ""After I [existing habit], I will [new tiny behavior].""

     This is something that is difficult for me because I don't set incredibly specific schedule/goals for myself (nor do I recommend doing that). So I lose sight of how it'll actually help me. 

     Once again, you need to remind yourself that it is a stepping stone to achieve your goals (and you NEED to achieve your goals for X reason...X should be to give back to your parents or for some greater cause above yourself). 


- If you are struggling so hard to stay focused/stay awake then drop down and do some push ups or whatever exercise you enjoy most. What I used to do at my internship was go to a stairwell and go up and down the stairs twice, do push ups to failure and sit ups to failure. This way no one will know you are that weird because, if you are a 'Murican, everyone is too lazy to take the stairs. 


- The greats/successes we all know didn't have some incredible passion that they just felt all the time, they just did it. So once again...just do it. You may need to even find a way to motivate yourself by having something tangible in front of you that you only allow yourself to take after you do X amount of work. I.E. a gummy bear at the end of each page. 


- Utilize flashcards. Whenever you are waiting for class to start, take a look at 'em. Whenever you are taking a deuce, take a look at 'em. And so on and so forth. Everything in short bursts. Except your deuces I hope. 


- Don't make an incredibly super structured schedule. It's time consuming and you won't always be able to finish the amount of work in the allotted time. Time and time again studies show setting goals that are wayyyyyy too specific is counterproductive.

- This one may only apply to tech majors, but I find studying for a test much easier by just doing similar problems to the ones on the homeworks. Pick ones with a step by step on Chegg or at least has an answer in the back of the book. This way you'll at least feel like you are doing something new/challenging. It'll also require you to actually know your shit rather than relooking over your homework and going ""Oh, this was so easy! No reason to really look over this one!""

Hope covering these typical tips organized by the hot topics of this sub makes it easier to connect the dots so you can solve your dilemma with studying. "
2ji5h6,1,2014-10-17,[Advice Request] Experience as a Trader and Developer - Help me define my next step into an Algorithmic Trading Position,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2ji5h6/advice_request_experience_as_a_trader_and/,"Hi everyone, French dude, 30 yo with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics.

I started working back in 2009 as a Junior Derivatives Trader in a Top Tier Investment Bank (18 months fixed term contract).
It ended in December 2010 when the job market was still really hard, so I had to make a career change and work as a front office developer, mainly in VBA and C# for the past years.

Today, I want to switch back to an algorithmic trader position in an Investment Bank or a Hedge Fund, and I am wondering how can I find my path to this role.
Money is not a problem, so I am thinking about going back to school, for another Msc or an MBA, or even a PhD.
I am also considering applying for an internship in an algorithmic trading desk or any other entry role.

Anyway, If you have experienced a similar situation or you have a deep knowledge of the current job market in the US or London, I'd really appreciate it if you could comment and give me your thoughts and advice =)


**TL;DR :** 

I'm 30 with a Msc in Math, and experience as a Trader and Developer (C#, VBA, SQL).
I want to work as an algorithmic trader. What should I do ?

1. PhD

2. Another Msc, MBA and start over with an associate Program in an Investment Bank
3. Learn R language, Machine Learning, etc... then maybe start with an internship
4. Anything else ?

Your help is greatly appreciated ! =)"
2ji5pz,3,2014-10-17,Me [22/F] with my BF [32M] for almost two years- He is suffering from depression and I am not sure how to help him.,The_Specialist_says,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ji5pz/me_22f_with_my_bf_32m_for_almost_two_years_he_is/,"I would love to hear from people who would be my boyfriend in this instance but here it goes it might be really long sorry in advanced.

Background: I met my boyfriend Derek in January 2013 on OkCupid. He is my first serious boyfriend. When I initially met him I was hesitant because he was so much older than me but I was horny and he seemed nice enough. Anyways he is a generally awesome caring guy-very attentive, very calm, cool, and collected. He always has a smile on his face. Because of his encouragement and support I am currently working on getting in medical school- this kind of important later. 


Anyway when I met him he was working on getting his AA in Mechanical engineering so that he can transfer to a four year. He has ADHD. When he was my age- hehe- he decided that he wanted to make money instead of going to school to help out his mom. He worked in sales and then went back to school in 2010. 


He was motivated, focused and loved all he was learning. He moved back home with his mom to lower costs and also to get in county tuition. 


So Fall 2013- he did not do well in one of his classes and failed which lead him to not getting financial aid or something like that. When all this was happening he was very sparse with the details even though I asked him extensively. He didn't want to be depressing.
So he ended up withdrawing that semester. Then next semester he appealed the financial aid board and was half time taking auto cad classes. 


I learned during the summer of 2014 that he stopped going to one of his autocad classes ""because he did not feel it was worth it???""


So it brings us to today. He has not been full time since Fall 2013. He has not been working since January 2014. He is not in school now and basically does nothing all day and his mother basically provides everything for him.


I just graduated college and I am working to finish my unpaid internship so that I can start getting paid a reasonable amount- about 50-55k. 


When I have confronted him about it. He tells me he needs time to mourn. He says that he just needs more time to sort himself out. He says that he feels like a failure and that he thinks he has no future. 
He doesn't want to see someone because 'because he is too fucked up'. He has started to not take of himself and has been smoking more. Initially he was cutting back and did not smoke when I was with him.


I will be moving for post bac school next year and I love him so much and want to help him. I don't know how. Before he met me- he had a job, an apartment, and independence. Now he is not in school, at home with his mom, and has no real motivation. Depression is crippling him. Also he has made comments that I am the only source of happiness in his life. He keeps saying that he wouldn't be surprised if I left him soon. He keeps saying that he doesn't deserve me and all that. 


Unfortunately for him I love him and I am not ready to abandon him but I feel like there is a time limit on him getting help before I would have to leave him. 

How do I deal with a depressed partner?

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend used to have a job and go to school but since his financial aid problems in fall semester 2013 he has been in a rut- I feel like I am surpassing him lifewise but I desperately want to help him. "
2jihat,16,2014-10-17,My experience/advice,sparcespade,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/2jihat/my_experienceadvice/,"Hey r/Geologycareers I wanted to write this out because I see a lot of different and mixed information being spread around about what is needed/required to get into O&amp;amp;G so I though t I would toss out my experience/opinion. This is a little long and feel free to ask me anything you would like to know.

I work as an Ultra deep water exploration geoscientist at one of the major international oil companies (&gt;75,000 employees, 79 countries). My day to day is seismic interpretation , depositional studies, volumetric analysis, well panning etc.. Basically working prospects from a new venture idea to completed well.
There are a few things people should know about how to get to where I am at:

Education:

You really need a MS to become an exploration geologist at one of the majors. You will always come across that one guy that is there with a BSc or knows a friend of a friend whose cousin works for Exxon that only has a BSc. They are the exception not the rule. Do yourself a favor, get a masters.  Most of the jobs in O&amp;amp;G with a BSc are usually mudlogging, Geotech, Geosteering, LWD… rig jobs. Pay is good (40-60 starting afterter everything), life is hard.

GPA: I graduated from undergrad with a 3.1 accumulative,  sub 3.0 geology… still got into Grad School got a 3.8 and got a job that my friends envy.

You don’t have to get a masters from Mines to end up at a major. If your GPA is not stellar look into the smaller programs as well as the larger. UTA, UTPB,UTSA, UTEP ( I am in Texas so I really only know Texas schools off the top of my head but you get the picture)
Write a thesis. This is very important. I have only had one interview where I did not present my thesis to the company, to name few I have presented to include companies such as BHPB, Chevron, Anadarko, and EnCana. The only one where I did not have a formal presentation over it we talked about it in the interview. Most to all companies want you to have a thesis to prove you know how to conduct a research project and come to a logical conclusion and then present your findings in a way that could be understood by some one that knows nothing about the subject. (You will do this all the time in your career). For the topic of your thesis. Who cares. Write about something interesting that is new. I have had two responses to my work. This is very interesting and they want to know more or my equation is complete bullshit and will never work (was told that by a guy in an interview once). My thesis had to do with mathematical prediction of fractures within a rock unit using accosting properties.


Applying :

Apply for internships now.  Most of the larger companies are looking for interns that have started or are about to start their Master’s degree. Some will take on undergrads they are just a little harder to find. Send out resumes to everyone who cares if you meet the “minimum requirements”  those are usually set up by HR not the Geo departments. Recruiting for the summer intern is done in the fall so get your resume out now and go to the AAPG student expos in Houston, Wyoming, LA, Ohio and Norman, get your name out there.
You do not need 3 or 4 internships to get out there. I only had 1, there is more to it than the amount of internships you have. I strongly recommend having at least 1 and if you can intern with the same company again if you liked them  rather than hopping around. But that is your choice.

Using a recruiter: This one is a little tricky. Use them, I did and landed this job straight from grad school. However, find a recruiter that works for the companies not you, in other words you don’t pay them. Some take a cut of your salary, don’t use these guys, they will find you a job but you will pay a lot for it 10- 50% of your yearly take home. You want someone who the company pays a commission to. 

Edit: For a starting salary as an exploration geologist at a larger company if you are getting offers for less than 95k you are being low balled and should look else where.

2jivzx,1,2014-10-17,I [F/22] think my SO [M/22] and I are having trust issues. How do we get over them?,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2jivzx/i_f22_think_my_so_m22_and_i_are_having_trust/,"I just entered into a LDR about two months ago after a crazy summer and now I think my boyfriend [M22] and I [F22] are having trust issues. I’d really like to know how to work on them or if the relationship can be saved. 

So the trust issues stem from this summer were I had an internship in his city. At the time he was in a committed relationship for 2 years, but they had some issues. I had also met another guy who was also in a relationship. We hung out as a trio for a while, but I started developing feelings for both of these guys (I had stronger feelings for the guy who became my bf). But because they both had girlfriends I figured my feelings would go nowhere and failed to keep myself in check. I thought I was just being friendly but I guess my feelings/biology over-rided and I was more flirty than I intended. Both of these guys ended up getting feelings for me and I didn’t really know what to do. These guys were my best friends but I didn’t know how to end things properly so that we could all still be friends. 

Our lack of experience got the better of us and things escalated, and both of these guys came clean to their girlfriends. One was able to mend it with her, but broke things off with me (friendship included); but the other (the guy I liked more) ended things with his. He and I then entered into a quick fling that we decided to try and take long distance when my internship was over. 

We’ve had some bumps in the road since, like when his ex came back begging for him to give them a second chance and he took it. He realized his mistake right away, but the girl fights dirty, saying things like “you never loved me” and “you’ve waisted two years of my life” ect. I understood, I mean, you can’t just end the feelings you’ve had for someone for two years. They ended things again quickly and he and I started rebuilding. It took about a month for things to go back to normal-ish. 

Now, I feel like I’ve moved on, like I’m done re-hashing all this stuff out and ready to move on and start enjoying our time together; but, I find that he sometimes has trust issues with me and we often rehash the details and our conversations get really serious. The other night he got defensive when I didn’t tell him I had a few shots in my iced tea and just told him I was having tea. I didn’t really want to tell him about it because I’m a little ashamed of the fact that I needed liquor to relax since I’m under a lot of stress from school and work. Now, I’m not sure what his hang up was about it; is he upset that I didn’t communicate that I was drinking, was it the fact that I was drinking with him (I wasn’t drunk, just relaxed), or does he think it’s like a gateway lie and that I’ve been lying about other things too? 

I understand that he only has a few months of my personality to go on, and that we’ve had a complicated past. Most of his friends only know me from stories, and some of his friends are friends with his ex (who probably doesn’t have the best opinion of me). I don’t know how to overcome these things. I’m a trustworthy person, I really am; I’m really ashamed of what happened this summer and I learned a lot from it and NEVER plan on making that mistake again. I don’t know if he doesn’t trust that I won’t, or his friends don’t trust me and he listens to them. 

I need some advice, can we and how can we work through trust issues in a LDR and start having fun with each other again? Is his reaction and our conversations just the result from the distance and our past? And when the distance is gone, will those still be the topics we discuss (I plan on moving to his city in May, it was a F@*ing awesome city!)? "

I recently interviewed and got an internship offer from a company that is far better than where I co-oped but it is for Q&amp;A testing. Should I accept the offer, even though it is not really what I wanted to do, at this better company? They'll be paying me almost double the hourly wage that I was getting for my co-op. 

If I accepted this position, that'd be two software testing positions on my resume. Does that put me at a disadvantage when I graduate in a year and a half and want to apply for development positions?

I worked as a software dev intern for the last two years of my schooling and have been a developer since.  I had very strong references from my employment and wrote excellent essays.

Its surprising that they overlooked the low undergrad gpa.  Judging from the last year it seems alot of people who were very qualified and despite my expectations I applied anyways.  This might signify that they are trying to expand and therefore allowing more people to matriculate."

I've been on a few interviews since I was fired with startups in my area for accounting and non-accounting jobs. I'm now focusing on non-startup companies and I'm having an issue. I have a nontraditional background in that I graduated in finance. I don't have public accounting experience nor a CPA. 

Many corporate staff or senior accounting positions that seem a match want a CPA or public accounting experience. It seems almost a default. I don't want to consider bookkeeper, AR, or any other junior roles because I believe they're below me.  I had experience in handling our financial model, prepared presentations to the board, and worked on our daily forecast for a period of time. 

Any advice as to whether I will have issues? "
2jjp8s,12,2014-10-17,Tired of parents telling other people lies about me and making me feel like dog shit,VampiricPadraig,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2jjp8s/tired_of_parents_telling_other_people_lies_about/,"So I come to you reddit to express my anger at my parents (more so, my father). 

Just some background on me. I am 22, I work a 9-5 M-F job with a high interest in Computers (Web Technology, Hardware Building etc) and video games.

Just like most teenagers, I grew up with video games and it's now my main source of entertainment. There is nothing wrong with playing video games right?...right? 

My father said to me ""You are getting to old for games"" when I was around 13 or so as it was ""for babies"". I ignored him... He is old fashioned and thinks they are a waste of time. 

As I got older, I started to get into computer more and working with servers and learning different technologies. To this day, I still love it as well as Video Games.

Anyway, fast forward to about June of this year, I got a internship at a shop where I am working Monday to Friday, 9 till 5. While, I absolutely love it...I fear going home now. Every evening when I get home, is just misery, negativity and I just need away from it all.

I will admit, I play video games in the evening for a while, while also working on computers (I do a small bit of freelancing) and managing a couple of websites. 

Tonight, a carer for my grandfather (Who has Motor Neuronopathy) was talking to my father and I about a trip that I am about to go on.

I explained to him that I was going over for my birthday and a games festival (Specifically, Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest). The carer asked me if I was ""into video games"". I didn't have time to respond quick enough for my dad to jump in and say ""He plays all the time. From the moment he gets home from his so-called job, he plays games all night and maybe decides to go to bed for a couple of hours and then goes back to his ""job"" (finger quotes here). He is never fucking off it"".

The last thing that I do is ever argue with my dad because ""He is always right"". He would have embarrassed me and make fun of me in front of the carer.

I have had enough! (Wow, I am even tearing up writing this post). I am not going to London on Monday just for my birthday or JUST the festival...but to get away from him. He is driving up the fucking walls. 

He is only fucking worried if he has enough of cigarettes in the house.

I am really considering making the London trip a ""one-way"" and never come back to Ireland again! 

:(

EDIT: I never really explained about the lies part, but he has a tendency of lying to me, to family and friends about me and make me feel like shit...."
2jjs3r,238,2014-10-17,So I`m 6 months into my first programming job,eriken,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2jjs3r/so_im_6_months_into_my_first_programming_job/,"Hello.

This is a post about my background and the lessons I have accumulated over the past 6 months. It might be abit lenghty, but it´s friday and I´ve had a few energy drinks.

Two years ago I was in a job I hated. I worked as a social case worker. I had a bachelors degree in social science, a degree I realised had been a huge mistake. I had just turned thirthy and I felt I was far from where I thought I would be at thirthy.

Up to this point in life I had never made a true concioucs choice about what I wanted to do in life, everything had sort of just happend. Atleast that´s what it felt like. Anyway, I needed a plan. A plan that would please me and not everyone around me. What did I really enjoy apart from sex and basketball? Well I was allways good with computers. I used make money helping people in my neighbourhood fixing computers. I even made a cataloging system in Access 97 for a friend of my mothers.


Actually I had done more than that, I had made a few web sites with php &amp; mysql, I had made a Quake 3 server browser with Visual Basic and I took a intro course in Java at my University for extra points. 

It became surprisingly obvious that I should just become a programmer. Ofcourse! *But, dude, you´re gonna be that old creepy guy at the University..* Oh shut up!

So I quit my job, best day since my first blowjob, enlisted at the University and got a parttime job that didn´t suck too much. You guessed right; psych ward assistant. 

As I had made my desicion over the summer I was too late to apply for the degree programs so I just picked courses as they became available; Intro to Programming and Intro to databases. I was top in my class, I was motivated and I didn´t party. Next semester I picked Intro to programming part 2, annother database course and some descrete mathematics. Smooth sailing. But I soon realised that since I was not on a degree program there were certain obligatory courses I did not have access too. Hence it would take 3 more years before I could finish the degree. I would be 33 years before I was done. I knew I could get through the curriculum alot faster if it wasn´t for the god damn bureaucracy.

One of my closest friends is a programmer. He told me to drop out and study for myself, he said as long as I had a portifolio that was all that mattered, tech companies care very little for degrees. We made a curriculum and a time frame and I made my living room into a study hall. 

Over the next year I made a podcast manager in Qt, hello pointers. I made a chat server and client also in Qt, hello socket programming. I made a backup system with sync, written in Python and Go. The last project was not a coincidence, my friend who helped me out works for a backup company. And one day his boss told everyone to keep an eye out for an intern, they needed a monkey for all those small tasks that were piling up. 

Apart from fucking up the algorithm task at the interview, it went quite smooth, I kept pushing that I had a passion for this and that this was basicly what I had done the last two years, sitting in my living room coding. 3 days later I got a call, I was given a 60 % postion with little pay. I screamed yes.

My first task was to fix a legacy system for resizing image files. It was roughly 3 000 lines of python. I implemented a new processing library for more functionality, an integration to their new filestore, statistics through Statsd and Graphite and logging through Logstash and Kibana. I worked 60 hour weeks in a 60 % position for 2 months. New task; make our task scheduler modular. Here´s Quartz and Spring, you know Java right? Sure.
1 month later, done. Boss says; ""good, I think we need to bump you to a 100 % position, also here´s a a few more dollars per hour, good job so far"". Next project; a distributed checksum checker for corrupt files. Here are sharded database clusters and Redis, have fun with Go routines en masse.

Today, I commited my last set of code before release on monday. And tomorrow I´m buying myself a brand new MBP 15 inch. I have earned it.

So, do I have a lesson? If you have passion, if you have dedication, if you have a sense of desperation and if you have great friends and contacts you can make your life alot less sucky. 

I also want to thank this subreddit. It is an awesome place for anyone trying to master this profession. My favourite subreddit."

2jkczw,2,2014-10-17,"My [22 F] just broke up with me [24 M] after 6 years, right as I reached the point she had been waiting for me to.",Thisismypseudonym,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jkczw/my_22_f_just_broke_up_with_me_24_m_after_6_years/,"We started dating right after I graduated highschool (2008) she was in her Jr. year. The first two years were amazing. At first she was depressed and had little confidence but we got her over that together. We were infatuated and playful and totally in love. There were some arguments here and there, mostly about communication but we were always open and talked through it.


 When she went to college (2010) she was a 3 hour train ride away and I could only see her every weekend or two. It was the first time we had been apart and I developed trust issues and became depressed. For two years we seesawed back and forth one of us depressed the other trying to fix the problems. Then after a really good few months I went away for a 3 month internship in summer (2012) . We had been doing well recently but I felt myself drift away from her fairly quickly. Then one day in a bar a girl kissed me after flirting with me and I kissed back. I became unable to communicate with my girlfriend due to guilt and I convinced my self that I wasn't in love with her and I  took a 350 dollar 24 hour long bus ride to give her a breakup letter and say goodbye.


 We sat for hours and cried and talked and laughed and when I left all I wanted to do was turn around. The next morning I met her and told her about the girl I had kissed and how I had convinced myself that I didn’t deserve her. To my surprise she took me back and the of the internship I couldn’t have been more excited to get home and spend time with her. When I got back we spent several months talking about  what had happened and where we went wrong. It always boils down to communication . 


For a short time we were happy again but I became depressed again with lack of a job and an ability to make her happy. In 2013 we reached the breaking point again after months of arguing and poor communication and this time she broke up with me. I went to see her and we talked and laughed and cried again and ended up having a totally honest conversation and giving it another go. Again we were happy for months but this time there weren't really any arguments we drifted along happy, content but without any zest or passion.


 She graduated college and began to think about her future. She was looking at internships all over the country and I didn’t want to move. I was to insecure in myself at the time. Summer 2014 I got a job and she got a parks and rec internship  in New York where we live.  Part way through the internship, she was living in my room with me at my parents home and we had a bad fight about sharing space. She decided to take a break from me for a while after that and we didn’t talk for weeks. I convinced her that I was worth it I promised I was changing for her and I made impressive strides forward in maturity but we still didn’t have the spark we had at the start. I was still not ready to commit and she was not able to trust that I would not hurt her again like I always had in the past. 


We had a good summer despite her breaking down and saying she didn’t want to continue the relationship again I was numb at that point and told her she had to do what was right for her. She came back to me right after and everything was going really, really well it seemed like everything was improving . I got a raise and she got an amazing internship in Frostburg Maryland which might as well be California as I don’t drive or even have a car. She got a car and we planned to alternate traveling every two weeks  so we could see each other twice a month. 
I went to see her for the first time 20 days ago and I can genuinely say it was the happiest time of my life. That is when everything began falling into place. I got my act together and did some soul searching and found that I had been holding back because of my insecurity in myself not in our relationship. I stopped being afraid to commit and to grow up and immediately began planning for our future. 


I was supposed to see her again in about a week. I planned to talk to her about my changed feelings and outlook.  But she broke up with me over the phone a few days ago. She said she had realized that she wanted to separate a year and a half ago and she only now realizes just how much  her wanting to keep me happy caused her not to go through with it. We cried and talked and laughed but we didn’t get back together.  


Devastation doesn’t begin to cover it. From very early in our relationship I was adamant that I didn’t want marriage and she was clear she did I didn’t want kids or to settle down and she did. We haven't talked about these things in a year and a half and our different visions of the future left us floating in a grey area. She saw marriage and forever and I just saw nothing changing because I was too scared to dream. A few weeks ago I had an epiphany and I realized that I wanted to give her exactly what she had been hoping and wishing for. After so many years of me holding our relationship back and refusing to grow up and accept the responsibilities of an adult and a partner in a relationship it clicked for me and every fear and doubt was washed away. I matured overnight and realized how childish I had been all these years. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, I want to quit my job and move in with her , I want a wedding and a honeymoon and I want to build her a home for our children. But I waited to talk to her in person and I never got the chance.


--   
**tl;dr**: After six years refusing to grow up and open myself to my girlfriend emotionally or to the concept of marriage I had an epiphany and realized what my true feelings were. She left me just weeks before I was going to open up to her about how I felt.


 I will do anything to prove myself worthy of that perfect love we once shared. I may not have deserved it for a good portion of our relationship but I'm ready to heal the hurts and make amends and return the feelings I couldn't in the past which caused her to close herself off. How do I show her that I am a new man?  How do I get her to open her heart and her trust to me again?"

2jkkgn,21,2014-10-17,TIFU: INFP Edition,ticklemelucky,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/2jkkgn/tifu_infp_edition/,"(The following story happened a week ago, but I only now feel compelled to share.)

So I recently went to an engineering panel hosted by one of the clubs at my school. A couple of engineers came in to talk about their college experience, internships, jobs, and so forth. I went more so because the club hosting it (a women in engineering club) seemed really nice. I'm a sophomore and I was hoping to finally make some friendly acquaintances.

So after the panel, the attendees all mingle with the speakers and each other. I get swayed into talking to some other engineering female students and we all just talk of simple nothings.

One girl then asks me about why I chose engineering. And I kinda stumble.

It wasn't even a rude question or arrogantly phrased. It's just that when she asked, I got reminded of when I was in high school choosing a college major, and my parents telling me they hate their jobs, but at least they can pay the bills and have health insurance, something that artists and writers don't have evidently. So they basically convinced me then that even if I hate engineering, its a better major to get than English or Art for job reasons.

That day hurt me because it made me feel inadequate a person. Was I raised the wrong way if I liked art and writing? Was I just not shown how ""fun"" engineering could be in elementary school? Ever since that day I felt that society doesn't care about artists and writers, and that's why they make so much less and have a harder life than engineers or other tech majors. I have more worth if I'm something I hate, which bothers me immensely.

So back to the engineering panel: I kinda calm myself down in the corner with some music. Not really, because I haven't answered that one girl's question and I don't know how to go about wording it.

I didn't word it, because I end up crying even harder.

I felt so fake right then and there. It reminded me of my engineering orientation when I cried most of the day, or the second week of college when I had a panic attack studying for chemistry, or the morning I cried in bed and missed my chemistry final because I knew I wasn't passing the class and only stuck with it (and calculus) because becoming part time would have taken away my scholarship.

One of the club members had to take me out and for a good half hour I cried and told her how engineering bored me and depressed me but I had no better plan. Other students came and had to help calm me down and hold a mini therapy session.

I think all the club members were very nice, but ever since I broke down in front of them I feel I can't get a ""real"" friendship with them now. You know, because I was emotionally vulnerable in front of them when we had only talked once before. I feel that on their part, our correspondence has now become a ""pity friendship"", because they feel bad, because they think ""oh, I don't wanna make ticklemelucky upset, lemme just be nice to her.""

I don't want that kind of relationship, but I guess that ship has sailed. And now I'm even more afraid of trying again because other students will inevitably ask me why I'm in engineering and whether I lie or tell the truth I'll be upset.

tldr; I wanted to try and make some friendly acquaintances, I went to an engineering panel because the club members were nice, someone asked me why I chose engineering, I got sad because it reminded me of the fights my parents had about engineering being more useful than art and writing, I cried in front of a club and the speakers, and I probably have been labeled as a basket case. Which is probably true..."

First year I just stayed in my room playing video games.  I never went to class and was not part of any extracurricular activities.  It wasn't that I hated accounting, it was just I had not interest in succeeding in life.  I just wanted to play video games.  This left me with a 5.8/10 CGPA (high 60's average) and a C+ in Financial Accounting and a B in Managerial Accounting.

Over the summer I decided to step up my game and took summer courses and worked part time.  I applied and got a executive position for a business club at my school and did a simple Bookkeeping Internship in August.  I recently started volunteering at a non profit organization preparing taxes for low income individuals.  

However I can not undo first year.  My first year marks have made it impossible for me to get in to the co-op program at my school and my GPA is pathetic.  I sign up for networking events but never follow through because I feel like I can't compete with other students who are in co-op and have strong GPA's.  I can not even be a teacher assistant or research assistant because of how low my GPA was from first year.

Depressed would be a strong word but I feel like all this effort I am putting in won't even matter and I find it increasingly harder to stay motivated when a lot of my classmates are receiving co-op placements at the big accounting firms and I am stuck with nothing.

I have been doing a lot better so far in my second year courses but ***my big question is how can I be better than my classmates in co-op and find opportunities for myself?***  Especially for next summer a job in Toronto or Ottawa that would give me some kind of relevant experience would ideal.  The jobs that are posted on the career centre are mostly for students that are graduating soon.  Also a lot of companies will not even give me an interview because I am not in the co-op program.  Would it be appropriate to directly contact recruiters for accounting related companies on LinkedIn asking for opportunities?  My last question is I am taking Intermediate accounting I next semester.  Is there any advice anyone could give me about this course?  I have heard the drop out rate is 60% and I really want to do well in this course.

Thank you for reading this extremely long post and please comment with any helpful advice. "

My girlfriend and I have been dating almost a year, we've known each other for a few years and there was always a tension between us that we both had felt but other relationships were happening and whatnot and eventually after a few years when we both were single decided to give it a go. (not that we were avoiding each other or anything, just people/situations prevented us from getting really close)
After a slightly rocky start (ex's, amiright?) we came into the best relationship I've ever had. I was shocked at how normally, I'm terrified of the L-bomb but after a few months, I knew I was in love with this girl. A while after that she had admitted that she felt the same.

Well now she's in her senior year at uni, and I just left about a month and a half ago for my masters in Asia. Leaving her was the hardest thing I think I've every done in my life but I love her dearly and want to do everything in my power to keep her in my life (if it works through this 2 year long distance part then I will intend on proposing).
I know she's loyal and loves me, but I also know this long distance thing is a huge burden on her. She's young (21, and I'm 26) and I know she wants to go have fun and she's also getting ready to do an internship and graduate so she's pretty stressed. And I know that me not being there is taking a bigger toll on her since I can't be there to help her de-stress and whatnot.

We skype pretty much everyday (it's a 12 hour time difference so when it's 8am here it's 8pm there) and when we're not skyping/busy/asleep we're texting pretty constantly. But I want to do more.
I've already arranged to have an extra two weeks for winter break so I can come back and see her, but (originally it was only two weeks) but I won't be able to leave until the first week in January. And I plan on staying a majority of the summer as well.

Has anyone here been in a long term relationship? What are things that worked for your relationship? Even if you haven't been in one, any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I love her and really see myself being with her for the long haul, and anything I can do to help that I will."

She is a graduate student and I have done some internships at our department for the last couple of summers as an undergraduate (Junior and Senior year). We went to a conference back in April this year with some other graduate students and that's where I really got to know her. I definitely felt something there, but since then we've kind of been doing our own thing (I dealt with graduation and spending the summer studying for a Medical school entrance exam).

Well, since I wont be starting my graduate studies until next Fall, I accepted a full-time job working at that lab to save up money and gain some more experience in the biomedical field. Since I have started, I've definitely noticed some interest again from her (taking time to see what I'm doing, eat lunch with me just the two of us, talk to me everytime she gets the opportunity). I really want to ask her out sometime soon but I keep thinking that a workplace kind of environment is a bad idea to try to form a relationship that's past friendship/professionalism, but I still think she is really cool and want to give it a shot. Unfortunately, I am very conflicted.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I would like to give it some time since I recently started at the lab and use this time to keep building on this relationship before taking it any further. Any advice? Thanks guys."

So last night, my friend and I hung out to have my ""last smoke"".

So I bought some, and my friend(call him  Jules)  and decided to smoke. I went to his apartment to meet up with him. Who also happens to live with him? Two straight edge people, one of which I've had a crush on since I met him second year. He's gorgeous and nice...a tad weird, but I can't really talk. 

So they leave for some thing and my friend and I stayed at their apartment. We packed a bowl and went out the apartment to the back near the woods, because we are not stupidand weren't gonna smoke iin his apartment. Especially if he lives with straight edge people. We come back in, we eat and watch stupid videos because well yeah. We then decided, hmmm, mayve a nother bowl. There was still stuff left from the last bowl. So we went outside to finish it off. WE were in the back and we here someone yell ""SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY"". We of course start to fucking freak out. It was one of his rooommates voice and they just pulled up in the drive way.

At least I do. We're like HE KNOWS!!!! and we freak out. And then we realized, well fuck we don't know if we smell. We don't know if they're apartment smells just from us having walked in their earlier. So had opened the windows right after the first bowl. After the second bowl, we finaly went inside. And in my pocket was a bowl that was lit not too long ago, and I wasn't sure whether or not they smelled it...probably. And If they had not smelled anything before when we aired out the room, they did now. I wanted at that point to just get into my friend's room and pick up my shit and go. We had a quick conversation and left. And I found out that the guy had told Jules that they needed to have a talk. 

Now I'm freaking out. He had that voice when we got in there of being a bit upset(I've heard that voice before from another situation that my friend and I weren't really apart of). I was also quite gone a bitand starting to get paranoid my crush knew I smoked. ALthough this is my last smoke for a very long time, and possibly forever. I am not drinking heavily for a long time also. We didn't drink at his apartment, but we probably should have not gone back in there after we smoked. And I""m upset. I just lost any chance I had with my crush.

I feel stupid. I'm checking on my friend right now. To see if all is good. I could have made all that shit up being paranoid, but IDK. I'm just a bit upset. THat was my last smoke and he may have caught me. GOt damn, he's gonna think I'm regular smoker(which I wasn't before either, I smoke maybe once a month or twice a month, and other than the last 3 times(about a month apart) I had taken about a 6 month break fro it. I justwanted one last hurrah before I hadto get all serious and shit.

2jlrie,0,2014-10-18,Is codeacademy sufficient enough to learn a language for an internship?,le_velocirapetor,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2jlrie/is_codeacademy_sufficient_enough_to_learn_a/,"So I am a CS major and I am currently a Junior at a university and I have just started taking my programming classes(I'm still in intro C++). My step-father has gotten into contact with some guys at a local software company who are now looking to take on a paid internship. The current opening needs for the intern to be confident in javascript and jquery. Though I don't know these languages, I have started the javascript course on codeacademy and I feel pretty good about it because it's fairly similar to c++. would it be wise to take the internship having only codeacademy under my belt? They apparently want interns to help update some older code that they have.

**TL;DR:** Would the completion of javascript and jquery course on codeacademy be sufficient for landing a software internship?"

2jlziz,0,2014-10-18,Just got a big4 offer as a Senior with no prior networking. Ama?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2jlziz/just_got_a_big4_offer_as_a_senior_with_no_prior/,"**Good morning everyone!**

Before we go on I must state a few points of understanding. 
1. I am a horrible writer and this will not flow well. 
2. This will be pretty long.  
3. I’ll try to keep my ideas from bouncing back and fourth too much. 
4. It’s okay to say Fuck. 
5. I just read this before posting and I will edit it to read more like a guide and not like a pile of shit. It’s a pretty big pile at the moment.



**What motivated me to write this?**

I have been subbed here for about two years now and like clockwork the same questions are asked. 
“Halp! How do I get an interview for big 4!?” 
“Is a 4.0 GPA too low to get into Big4?”
“Is Becker a good CPA Review?” 
“Didn’t get into the Big4, should I commit seppuku?” 
You get my drift.
Now, don’t get me wrong I just went through (still going through it) my first recruiting season and participated in my first meet the firms event about a month or so ago. I had all of the commonly reposted questions and more. They are recurring for a reason. To those who are going through the process it feels like the most important thing that is happening. Maybe being a few years out and more experienced we forget how big of a deal recruiting season is to students. Who knows? 



**About me:**

I subbed when I knew I was going to major in accounting while I was still attending community college.  I didn’t know anything about accounting except for that it was what I was going to major in. I found accounting enjoyable (It was also my 3rd year at a 2 year community college). Anyway. I got accepted into a decent college (my CC GPA was about a 2.4) and decided that I will do school correctly this time around. My first year (Junior) at university I didn’t network with anyone really and just focused on good grades because I didn’t know what else to do (GPA is now around 3.6-3.8). This year (Senior) I figured that its probably too late for me to get into the Big4 since I am a senior with no internship, networking, or mentor experience while I am competing with students who have all of this. 

As an aside I must admit that during my Junior year one of my teachers recommended that I participate in some volunteer work over the summer so I did. I must also admit that I go to school, work, and partake in hobbies (construction usually working with my hands is satisfying). 

Now lets get back to senior year (this current academic year). I went to my first meet the firm’s event and talked to two of the Big 4 and a smaller firm. I left after about an hour because I was completely unprepared and felt like shit being there around what I thought was a group of killers (killers are other students who are good at that they do with a good GPA, good resume, and good backgrounds, some already know the recruiter ext.).  Fuck it shit happens. I was pretty down about it at this point. I still send emails to everyone I talked with thanking them for their time and mentioned something we talked about. I mean everyone; I talked with a risk advisory manager and am interested in audit. Still thanked her for taking the time to talk with me ext.

Over the next couple of weeks I attended random networking events for the Big 4 (big 4 was always my goal), I joined BAP and talked to some of my accounting professors about what to do. I applied to all of the big 4 for an internship and the smaller firms that I talked with as well. 

After I sent out applications one of the Big 4 sent me an email back within 24 hours stating that I was declined. I laughed, as this is what I expected. Within the week another Big 4 declined me and two gave me interviews. The smaller firms all gave me interviews and so did one industry. Sweet, I thought to myself. 



**The First Round Interview:**

I have never been interviewed before so I didn’t know what to expect. I asked around between my professors and did a lot of searching on /r/accounting. I came to the conclusion that it will probably be a normal conversation with behavioral questions thrown in. 

This was correct. 

During my interviews we talked about, my volunteer experience, my hobbies, my experiences, and the general behavioral questions you can find on here. I also asked the interviewers questions about them, what do they do for fun, why are they in public ext. genuine questions. Yes you will be stressed out but they expect you to be stressed out so don’t worry about it. As long as you can hold a conversation under stress and not panic you’re aces. You got an interview so you’re here for a reason. Also, your GPA is the same as everyone else’s all it did was get you this interview, talk about what makes you interesting; I like to build shit so I talked about how I like doing that. When you work together you will be around these people for many hours and will need to talk about something this is when you talk about that. 



**The Second Round Interview:**

If you got this far it means they like you. You’re done selling yourself to them for the most part the fish is on the line, you just need to guide it gently into your net now. Don’t forget that the firms also want to sell themselves to you too. Have some fun. I had three interviews with managers and partners; they had a list of behavioral questions to ask me. I answered them truthfully and rebutted with questions of my own for them.  The conversations usually progressed to talking about random things that we both enjoyed (this is anything, sports, cars, life, travel, ext.). 



**My results:**

Both of the Big 4 gave me 2nd rounds and so did the smaller firms. 
My number one called me back as I was walking back to class within the hour. I still have more interviews but I really like that firm. 



**My advice to you:**

Do your research. (How to dress. Read some case studies before the interview. Do you really want to work for the firm? Do you really want to do audit/tax?) Ext.
Do talk to everyone.
Do have fun. Don’t forget while you want to work for them they are also trying to sell themselves to you too. 
Do have confidence. You’re here for a reason. 



**Summary:**

I just re read this and its going to be heavily edited a few times to make more sense and flow better. Also, ill add bullet points and advice.  (dress, email curtsey, ext.)


**TL;DR**
I'm trying to answer all of the commonly asked questions on here since i have had all of them too. So let me know how to make this better?

1. Wash with Cetaphil.
2. Apply Aczone.
3. Wait ten minutes.
4. Apply random moisturizer I have laying around (It usually has sunscreen, for what it's worth).

I don't usually wear makeup, though I remove it before washing my face (Otherwise it doesn't come off, seems straightforward to me).

Info on me:

1. Caucasian female, 30 years old, fair skin with some faint olive undertones, starting to get some fine lines around my eyes but nothing major.
2. Have a skin condition that results in super dry, dry skin. Aczone actually made my skin less dry, so that's a plus.
3. Hormonal acne (Helped by Aczone), lots of white heads on chin (Not helped by Aczone).
4. I live in the Midwest, it gets cold and dry where I live.
5. Oftentimes if an ingredient says ___ acid, it will make my skin dry, peel-y, and cause me pain. I've never tried hyaluronic acid or even acid in a more skillful way, so I'm not ruling it out.
6. Budget: Low as you can get, I'm on an unpaid internship at the moment.
7. No sea creatures. I keep them as pets. :( 

My struggle is finding products that won't dry out my skin or cause extensive blackheads and whiteheads (clogged). It feels like there are a lot of products out there that are to battle acne or wrinkles through acidic means, which makes sense but my skin isn't a fan. I've tried using products for ""mature skin,"" but those tend to be too heavy. My skin looks pretty good, but I think it could look *better*.

As a kid I liked climbing them while my dad was always coaching basketball. (He was not coaching at a very high level until I was much older).

Much later I started to appreciate bball myself. It wasn't until I was 12 when I started! (I played baseball and did jiu-jitsu up to my 12th)

At 19, a weak back had put it on hold again but I started to enjoy it later on again. I was the most active along 2003-2004 when I was abroad. First I trained in Costa Rica with the Uni team of UNA (Heredia) where I did an internship of a few months.

After that I went to Sydney as an exchange student where I played in the 2nd squad of the UNSW (Uni New South Wales). Where my ankle was busted the very last training day (new students coming in were tested on their skills for the teams the coming season) when some motorically broken idiot pushed me hard, busting my ankle.

Took a looong break, started to play again but moved in between jobs and cities. Two years ago, in a very bad physical shape, I joined the local club, twisted my knee which is still busted to date. Docter says 'it's just the ligaments that are stretched a bit, it will heal'. Two years.. right ..

I wanna play ball again :("

Hope you all are having a pleasant day! Due to extenuating circumstances, I have to move to Calgary post-graduation. I also have to be at Calgary for a few months starting January, and am graduating from college at the end of summer (hooray summer school!). I'm a senior, majoring in finance. 

Because of my situation, I need to get an internship in Calgary. My interests range between corporate finance, to investment banking, to private equity/hedge funds.  However, knowing I'm a US student, this will put me at a disadvantage when competing with the fellow Calgarian students. 

My question to you all is that how can I make this process easier on myself? I've been sending out several emails to companies, yet, not getting many responses back for these internship opportunities. In all honesty, I'd consider myself one heck of a competitive candidate when compared to others. 

Anyone here have any tips/tricks, or possibly even know someone, that can help me attain an internship for January? Any help would be appreciated!"
2jn2bp,1,2014-10-18,"I [22 M] had an amazing, caring [22 F] girlfriend. I broke up with her and I'm worried I made a mistake. Was it?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jn2bp/i_22_m_had_an_amazing_caring_22_f_girlfriend_i/,"My girlfriend and I met our Junior year of college.  I was in an athletic team at D1 and she was a cheerleader.  We were the first to do this from what I've known and I felt like a badass trailblazer.  Everything was great and she was the most caring, loving, girlfriend I've ever had.  Everything seemed perfect, except I wasn't really sure of my investment.

Here was the problem.  We met at church, she's a very strong-minded Catholic, and I (still) am not sure where I am with faith in general...but that's another story.  Point is our core values weren't matched up (she wanted her kids to go to catholic school, raised catholic; I wanted my kids go to public school, and this is just one example or mismatched core values).  I'm more laid back and outgoing, and she's more firm and speaks her mind easily, but has a different kind of personality.  She was so forward-minded and I just wanted to have everything be in the present moment.

About 6 months into our relationship she went to a different city for her internship, and I began talking to other girls in a flirtatious way.  I was adding stress to the relationship because I was acting distant, and as a result, she began to talk to other people on the internet.  I know this because months later I looked through her phone messages and emails that were questionable.  She was talking to people on craigslist, on fetish websites, and started frequently emailing a random man and sent him hundreds of naked selfies and suggestive content.  I was heart broken.  However, there were multiple issues here from both sides (I shouldn't have even looked at her phone).  I confronted her about it, almost broke up with her then, but decided to stay.  I'm not sure if it was out of convenience or I still had commitment at that point.

Fast forward a little bit and it's after graduation.  She has a job and I don't.  I start to get depressed and emotional, and I become emotionally abusive to the people around me. She has a car, I don't.  She has money, I don't.  Basically she's providing everything and I feel like a weak helpless person.  I get to the point where I actually demand money from her.  

Fast forward even more.  Throughout our entire relationship, we did things sexually except for intercourse.  We try a couple times in the past but it hurts her/I sometimes can't get it up because of issues with porn-induced erectile dysfunction.  Basically now we're stressed that we can't have sex, and worried about being married to someone who doesn't have a sex life.  I'm miserable and sad and so is she.  I find out she signs up for a dating website, probably to help with lack of emotion or just to get complimented, because she is pretty.  

This brings us close to now.  I have a job, she does, and the only time we see each other is late at night.  We're both exhausted and we usually watch TV for an hour, then I leave her apartment and sleep at mine.  There's a small amount of excitement, but nowhere near what it used to be.  During this entire time she still says she loves being in the relationship, but I'm just so apathetic, and because this is the longest relationship I've had **I'm not sure if I always get lazy and not care about my girlfriends after a while.** 

She's planning on all these things like when **we** are going to Law School (I'm not going back to school...), and when we are going on vacations months in advance.  I don't care and I feel uneasy, it just seems so boring and not right.  I hang out with a girl I knew a while ago, and she gives me the best blowjob I've had in years.........Holy crap, I'm still in a relationship, I know I've messed up big time.  I go through self-hate and I'm convinced I'm a terrible human being.  

Now we're at last week.  I tell her all these things and how I'm not invested and how it feels like I have to will myself to do anything with her, even though she's gorgeous and a great person.  We decide to take a break for a couple weeks and we can re-evaluate.  I'm very on and off talking to her and she is being strung along a little bit because I'm decisive.  I have a pretty good week and find a little bit of fire in my life, catching up with old friends and doing fun things at work.  We get to last night, and she needs an answer and to not be strung along.  It takes **everything** I have in my body to tell her that I can't be with her.  I feel so unattached to her in a significant other way.  

She flips.  She says that she's an amazing catch and I'm an idiot.  She says ""good fucking luck finding one HALF as good of a relationship in the future.  I'm confident that this is a huge mistake on your part.  Best of luck.  Let's exchange belongings and then kindly exit my life...don't change your mind."" I know she's hurt and upset but now I'm regretting making that decision because I am afraid of not finding a girl like that again.  I know I'm 22 but she did seem like the one I was going to marry.  

Now today she apologizes for her behavior.  She and I had plans to go to an amusement park and now she wants to go as friends.  She tells me she *already* has a date tomorrow night, and that she really wants to work hard on being my friend.  I'm kind of happy but now I'm also envious and worrying if I just made a huge mistake.  She gets over things pretty easily, so I don't think she's trying to make me jealous.  She said she told me because she wants to show me that she's moved on.  

During this entire time we also didn't have many friends.  Is the sudden switch for her because she's found another person who's interested in her?  Was the relationship ""so good"" in the start because neither of us had a best friend or group of people who were close to us?

Will I regret this?  I want to date other people and whore around but it all seemed too good to be true at one point, I thought I was going to marry her.

Please....help.

2jn3j9,8,2014-10-18,Me 20 F with my ex 20 M 2.5 years. Think our break up was because of new contraception. Should I tell him ?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jn3j9/me_20_f_with_my_ex_20_m_25_years_think_our_break/,"Things with me and my boyfriend went south in mid July (at least from my standpoint, I was considering breaking up with him but didn't) We broke up maybe a month ago now.

I am trying to piece together what really happened with me this summer mainly with me which I realise also affected me and him. I was not the person I normally am. This summer I felt like a crazy lady. I remember 3/4 scenarios in particular:


1) Being on holiday with my boyfriend and getting really depressed all of a sudden on the last day when I realised I had to go back to the country where I was interning

2) Nearly being hit by a car at a zebra crossing in the country where I was interning and flipping off the driver. I DO NOT do that kind of thing ever. I started swearing a lot this summer a habit I am aware I now need to kick.

3) Constantly complaining about how much I hated different little things at my internship mainly the food. 


I also remember that the first 2/3 weeks of my internship weren't good but I wasn't complaining as much. I became aware of the fact the only difference between the two times were I changed the pill I was taking from the mini pill to the combined pill. I've done a lot of research and am aware that it can cause mood swings and that the hormones can change the way you think (The second one being an obvious given, its chemicals in the brain!). 

A month and a half ago I told my boyfriend we need to talk via text. After a bit he said let's call it quits. I came over, had been crying and he was aware of that, and told him that I'm aware of how I've been this summer and its not me and I am ashamed of it, let's not let it get in the way. We spoke a bit and he said ok we can give it one more shot. I told him if he changed his mind tell me. Two weeks later we broke up officially again. We hadn't seen/spoke to each other much in between those two breakups because of work etc... 

I realised this may a week after the break up and stopped taking the pill because I thought it could be clouding my judgement. I finally feel like its out of my system because I'm back to being me, the me I remember before this summer. 

I am in a really good place with my ex. We are friends and hang out and get on well, we go to uni together and spend some time together because of group projects and mutual classes. I know that I will always have feelings for him but if he's happy not being with me then I can kind of be happy with that. (Yes I'm upset I don't get to be with him but he's happy and is a good guy and going to do some amazing things so I want him to be free and be all he can be, I don't wanna hold him back) 

We broke up because of me and our relationship over the summer. (Take full responsibility there) and also because he had time to think and decided he didn't want to be in a relationship. When we broke up the second time he said he just didn't feel the same way and how he knows people say that and he never understood it until now because now he doesn't feel the same way. 

I am 95% sure that the pills screwed with me this summer. He was willing to work things out again and he tried with the person who WAS NOT me maybe with this knowledge he'd actually want to try with me. Is it worth talking to him and explaining this to him. It is kinda embarrassing for me that contraceptive pills changed me emotionally and reduced my rationality over the summer.

Should I talk to him and see if things can work or just keep things as they are and be friends? 

---   
**tl;dr**: 

I switched contraceptive pills at the same time my relationship went south. I've stopped taking them and feel like I'm ME again. We broke up and I think they played apart (85% of the breakup) Should I mention this to my ex or just stay in the happy friend zone. Always will have feelings for him but if he's happy without me I can live with that. (will suck but can accept it)"

I was adding stress to the relationship because I was acting distant, and as a result, she began to talk to other people on the internet. I know this because months later I looked through her phone messages and emails that were questionable. She was talking to people on craigslist, on fetish websites, and started frequently emailing a random man and sent him hundreds of naked selfies and suggestive content. I was heart broken. However, there were multiple issues here from both sides (I shouldn't have even looked at her phone). I confronted her about it, almost broke up with her then, but decided to stay. I'm not sure if it was out of convenience or I still had commitment at that point.



Fast forward a little bit and it's after graduation. She has a job and I don't. I start to get depressed and emotional, and I become emotionally abusive to the people around me. She has a car, I don't. She has money, I don't. Basically she's providing everything and I feel like a weak helpless person. I get to the point where I actually demand money from her.


Fast forward even more. Throughout our entire relationship, we did things sexually except for intercourse. We try a couple times in the past but it hurts her/I sometimes can't get it up because of issues with porn-induced erectile dysfunction. Basically now we're stressed that we can't have sex, and worried about being married to someone who doesn't have a sex life. I'm miserable and sad and so is she. I find out she signs up for a dating website, probably to help with lack of emotion or just to get complimented, because she is pretty.


This brings us close to now. I have a job, she does, and the only time we see each other is late at night. We're both exhausted and we usually watch TV for an hour, then I leave her apartment and sleep at mine. There's a small amount of excitement, but nowhere near what it used to be. During this entire time she still says she loves being in the relationship, but I'm just so apathetic, and because this is the longest relationship I've had I'm not sure if I always get lazy and not care about my girlfriends after a while.


She's planning on all these things like when we are going to Law School (I'm not going back to school...), and when we are going on vacations months in advance. I don't care and I feel uneasy, it just seems so boring and not right. I hang out with a girl I knew a while ago, and she gives me the best blowjob I've had in years.........Holy crap, I'm still in a relationship, I know I've messed up big time. I go through self-hate and I'm convinced I'm a terrible human being.



Now we're at last week. I tell her all these things and how I'm not invested and how it feels like I have to will myself to do anything with her, even though she's gorgeous and a great person. We decide to take a break for a couple weeks and we can re-evaluate. I'm very on and off talking to her and she is being strung along a little bit because I'm decisive. I have a pretty good week and find a little bit of fire in my life, catching up with old friends and doing fun things at work. We get to last night, and she needs an answer and to not be strung along. It takes everything I have in my body to tell her that I can't be with her. I feel so unattached to her in a significant other way.



She flips. She says that she's an amazing catch and I'm an idiot. She says ""good fucking luck finding one HALF as good of a relationship in the future. I'm confident that this is a huge mistake on your part. Best of luck. Let's exchange belongings and then kindly exit my life...don't change your mind."" I know she's hurt and upset but now I'm regretting making that decision because I am afraid of not finding a girl like that again. I know I'm 22 but she did seem like the one I was going to marry.




Now today she apologizes for her behavior. She and I had plans to go to an amusement park and now she wants to go as friends. She tells me she already has a date tomorrow night, and that she really wants to work hard on being my friend. I'm kind of happy but now I'm also envious and worrying if I just made a huge mistake. She gets over things pretty easily, so I don't think she's trying to make me jealous. She said she told me because she wants to show me that she's moved on.



During this entire time we also didn't have many friends. Is the sudden switch for her because she's found another person who's interested in her? Was the relationship ""so good"" in the start because neither of us had a best friend or group of people who were close to us?
Will I regret this? I want to date other people and whore around but it all seemed too good to be true at one point, I thought I was going to marry her.



Please....help.

tl;dr: My gf and I meet in college, seem like a perfect couple and everyone tells me to never lose her. We go through a lot of crap and I freak out that she is talking to people online and sending naked pics for a while. Things calm down, it becomes boring for me, and I lose a lot of interest. Things feel forced. She signs up for a dating website, I'm hurt. We recover? I finally break up with her, then she goes crazy and makes me feel like the biggest idiot in the world. Today she seems content, has a date with another guy, and has apparently moved on. Wants to be friends. I don't know."
2jna55,1,2014-10-18,"I've lost the majority of my sex drive in my LDR (of 2+ years, 27M w/ 28F), and I know if things continue down this path, I might cheat on her.",onthevergeLDR,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2jna55/ive_lost_the_majority_of_my_sex_drive_in_my_ldr/,"Hiya. I’m having some trouble in my long-term, long-distance relationship that’s wearing me down.

The main problem is that in my long-distance long-term relationship, my thoughts are drifting towards making choices that would make me an asshole cheater scumbag. I have done zero actions on this path, but I don’t like the magnitude and frequency of these thoughts, and I’m beginning to lose sleep. My gf’s a fantastic match but my sexual drive for her has decreased for a little while which apparently opened the door for temptation.

Jamie (not her real name), and I dated for half a year living within a couple hours of each other. For the next six months, she moved a few states away for an internship and we tried long-distance. At the end of our first year dating, I moved from MD-&gt;CA chasing my graduate studies adviser and she moved from ID-&gt;Ontario, chasing a different internship which later became a residency. I broke the relationship off at this point because that long of a distance was too much for me to handle at the time. I have no doubt that was the right thing to do. For the next little over a year, I dated several girls, and had several relationships that became physical. However, I found that once the glitter phase of dating waned, there wasn’t much of a foundation and usually both parties agreed that the brief relationship should end. None of these women could match Jamie in my eyes. Jamie’s all sorts of smart, spunky, sarcastic, and she’s always up for an adventure. So, about two years ago, I asked her out again and we started dating again. Long-distance is hard, but we talk every day for a bit and we don’t play games so that makes communication easy.

We’re both in our late 20s, and we don’t know what will happen once we graduate with respect to our relationship. We’re not solidly the two-body problem yet, but are trying to coordinate looking for jobs together. If we both don’t find jobs that land us in the same house/apartment, we very well may break up. She finishes her residency in a little under two years, I finish my program in a little over a year. Our fields are pretty restrictive geographically, and this is a major concern which comes up more and more these days.

The sexual part of the relationship has dropped off on my end the past half year or so and I’m noticing that I’m looking at other women moreso than I feel comfortable with considering I’m in a relationship. Jamie and I have noticed that past couple of times we’ve been together (out of the whopping 5 times a year), I've initiated sex less and less. My sex drive in general has also dropped during this period. We’ve spoken about this, and recognize it to be my problem. However, now I feel tempted to go back to my old bachelor days despite knowing how unfulfilling that story ends. Jamie’s my best match I've found in my life, end of story.

FWIW, I haven’t told her I love her, and the only time she’s said that to me was during the breakup. We really don’t say “I love you” or talk about getting married, having kids together, or the like; it’s our mechanism for dealing with the long distance and the great uncertainty in our future. We have open communication lines about the health of our relationship and figure that since we feel confidently committed to each other, there’s no need to change anything. 

I’m looking for general advice from anybody that’s been in a similar situation. My current strategy includes utilizing campus counseling services (starts next week), to see what I can do to get some clarity and asking all you armchair psychologists for any advice. I’m talking to reddit now because I’ve really struggled for a few days and writing to your guys is far more constructive than setting up a dating profile behind her back, joining the douchebag club, and throwing myself into the dating pool.

**tl;dr**: Halfway into a 4 year LDR, been losing sex drive for several months, afraid I might go down a cheating path."
2jny2u,1,2014-10-18,[23/m] Trying to figure out the near future with long distance girlfriend [21/f]. Any advice?,11ththrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2jny2u/23m_trying_to_figure_out_the_near_future_with/,"My girlfriend and I were introduced to each other just over three years ago by a mutual friend. In the months before that, I had been dealing with a breakup that I took exceptionally hard (another story for another time). I thankfully realized that I couldn't, and didn't want to be, depressed about it forever, and after tackling some of my emotions head-on, I felt ready to move ahead. Enter my friend's set up.

There was something different about this girl. She was intelligent in ways that my other exes weren't. That isn't a knock on my exes, who are all wonderfully intelligent in their own respective ways. It just seemed like a very refreshing change of pace. In addition, I found her to be beautiful, funny, interesting, driven, and a great listener. We hit it off, but in an odd, distinct way. It didn't help that I was still definitely reeling from the previous breakup. Although I felt ready to move on and had gotten over the last girl to a large degree, there was still a lot of emotional damage that needed repairing. This caused me to act like a somewhat different person for the first 3 1/2 months that we hung out, which includes the first month and a half of our technical relationship (when we made it official). For whatever reason, I just struggled most of the time to communicate with her in certain ways. Sometimes I talked too much, sometimes not enough, sometimes about all the wrong things. On her end, she had also just recently dealt with some things in her life that effected her greatly, and seeing as she hadn't really been seeking out a relationship to begin with, I think it was a little hard for her to balance these things with a relationship she never planned on having.

On top of all this, we struggled a bit with our different levels of emotional and physical experience. I personally had dated quite a bit from the time I was 13 up until we met, when I was 20. This includes three girls whom I would say I had ""serious"" relationships with. Despite of that, I wasn't very physically experienced, as previous girlfriends were only so comfortable doing certain things, and I would never want to push someone I cared about to do something they didn't want to. However, I would be lying if I said I wasn't totally sexually frustrated. One ex in particular I had dated close to two years, and there was *very* little progression in the physical department. Combine that with the fact that I was never one to hook up with girls I wasn't in a relationship, and that I was fast approaching 21 and still a virgin (which I know now in retrospect was a stupid thing to care about at all), and the frustration was unbearable. On the flip side, she was very experienced physically (including that fact that she was not a virgin), but had never had a real relationship with anyone. There were guys that she liked and was emotionally invested in to varying degrees, but she had never committed herself to being with one person in particular. She found it slightly intimidating that I was so experienced with it, and I was probably 10 times more intimidated by her physical experience. It's pretty embarrassing how, in my head, I made it such a big deal that she had slept with one guy one time. Attempting to make any move on her physically was nearly impossible, and when they did happen, it couldn't have been more awkward.

Still, there was a weird spark there that led us to keep seeing each other and establishing a relationship. We liked a lot of the same things, we were interested in each others' hobbies and passions, and we were open to learning new things together. Just before Christmas, a month and a half after we had made our relationship official, we confronted our issues head on, addressed the strangeness, and talked the whole thing out. Suddenly, we clicked, and everything came into fruition. Within a couple weeks, our relationship was absolutely fantastic, and it only got better as time went on. Now that we had gotten everything out, we were even more open with each other. Our senses of humor began to come out more. We began to have a lot more fun with each other. AND...(*drumroll*)...we established a great physical relationship! Everything was awesome, and has remained awesome for the most part. We celebrate our three year anniversary next month, and we're still completely in love.

Before I had even met her, she had made the decision to go to school far away from home (1300 miles away, to be exact). This obviously wasn't something I was going to talk her out of, because even if I wanted to, it would have been futile. She has always taken her school and studies incredibly series, and she was going to do what she felt was best to get the education she wanted. After our relationship had kicked into full gear, we decided to evaluate where we were at shortly before she left. Once the time approached, we made the decision to stay together, as we figured out ways to see each other at least 2-3 times each semester, and we were still very invested in our relationship.

She is a few months into her third and last year there (she had enough college credits from high school to graduate early), and we've made it work pretty well for the last 4+ semesters. We communicate daily, mostly by text, with 1-2 phone calls a week, and a Skype session every now and then too. Sometimes, we talk all day, and sometimes, we just end up catching up at day's end. We've always maintained our own lives outside of the relationship, so we're very comfortable not smothering each other all the time. Some days are incredibly hard; anyone who's been in a long distance relationship can attest to that awful feeling of wanting nothing more than to hold your significant other, and knowing there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. That's the absolute worst. And we've definitely hit a few small rough patches, but there's never been anything we couldn't solve. In general, we're happy with our decision to keep this relationship going, because regardless of how hard long distance is, it's worth it if you're with the right person.

She will be graduating in May and, if all goes according to plan, she will be getting a job very soon after. She has absolutely made up her mind that she will be working in a very particular city, and I don't blame her. Firstly, the job market is best in the city. She most likely would not find anything as good or as well paying in another city. Secondly, she loves it there. Thirdly, and arguably most importantly, she would not be happy living back in our home state. She has been working for a long, long time to get to where she's going to be, and I want her to achieve her dream. I'm also in the process of working towards my dream of being a professional musician.

Since the age of eight, the only thing that has rivaled my passion for music is the love I feel for my girlfriend. Besides that, and my friends and family, I can't say there's anything else in this world I care about half as much as music. Any attempts I've ever made to convince myself that I could do anything else with my life have been for naught. If we are all put on this earth to do something, I am here to create music. It's far more than a far-fetched childhood dream of being a rock star. Obviously, I would love to make millions of dollars traveling the world and making records, and I'll certainly work towards that, but I'm also realistic. I understand what it takes to make a living as a musician. As long as I can put food on the table doing what I love, I will take whatever level of success or fame I can reach.

I currently play in two groups that have both developed somewhat of a name within our home state. Both groups have recorded, toured, and worked our asses off playing local shows here. And at the moment, this is where we need to be based. We simply cannot afford to relocate ourselves at the moment, and I can't fathom the thought of leaving what I've started to build here. I do not want to live in my home state forever; I love it here, but I can think of two or three places off the top of my head that I'd like to experience living in when I can afford to. But for right now, this is where I have to be.

Just as I support her dream, she supports mine. That means the world to me. However, in addition to deciding that she's going to be in the city, she's also decided that she won't want to be in a long distance relationship anymore after her next semester, and I have to say that I'm inclined to take this side too. She's ready to be with me, and I'm ready to be with her. Six semesters of being 1300 miles away, even when the relationship is worth it, is grueling. She also had an internship in the city this past summer, which further cut down the amount of time we got to spend together. By the end of this year, we'll have probably spent no more than 6 total weeks together. This past summer, we hit the only small rough patch so far in this relationship, and we both acknowledged that it was due to not getting to spend quality time together. We're ready to spend that quality time together now, but we're not ready to give up on our dreams, nor do we want to be selfish and ask each other to make major compromises.

With her living in the city, she'll be much closer, only about 200 miles away. But even if we were able to visit each other more, it would be just as maddening. Seeing each other once a week, wishing you had more time together, tacking it all on to three years you just did of long distance...it would be doable, but not ideal. I'm a little more open to the idea of this than she is, but not by much. I think I only feel that way because I just want to be with her so badly. We just don't know what to do, and I don't want all these unknowns to drive me crazy for the next seven months.

So, what should we do, Reddit? I love her so much, and she loves me. She has given me strength and confidence in ways that no girl ever has before. But we're also driven and determined career-wise, and we know what we have to do to succeed. I'll answer whatever questions I need to if you think it may help you give me a good answer.

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I have been long distance for three years. Trying to figure out what to do when she graduates. Career paths seem like they might tear us apart. This has been eating me up for the past few weeks, so I'd really appreciate it if you did take the time to read this, despite the length. Maybe I'll make you brownies if you make it through the whole thing. I usually put chocolate chips in them."

2jo0ug,2,2014-10-19,What is the best way to go about a job I really want that I have connections to?,onyxques,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2jo0ug/what_is_the_best_way_to_go_about_a_job_i_really/,"So I am just wrapping up my degree in marketing and also just got done interning at a very large video game publisher as their marketing intern where I made loads of connections. 

A job has now popped up at another video game studio for a position that really want and need.

My question is how should I go about this to really stand out? So far I have 4 options in mind. 


1. Apply normally.

2. Call, ask to speak to the HR person handling it to and ask some questions about the position to try and ''stand out'' (which I did for my internship to show I was/am really passionate about this)

3. Get in touch with a contact person from this company, which is one of my mentor from my internships ex coworkers from when he worked at there and ask him who to contact about it/his advice on how to apply to the position. 

4. Get in touch with the dude I would be working under, who is friends with both my mentor and another close coworkers from my internship and send my CV and stuff to him. 

5. Ask my mentor and coworker who know the guy I would be working for/a lot of people at the company to use them as my references, apply for the job, then call and ask some questions about the position such as when it starts and so on. 

Or maybe something else?

Maybe I am over thinking it, but I really need and want this job so I want to go about this in the best way possible since I have connections for the first time in my life. 

Thanks!"

So these past few weeks have been probably the best and worst I have experienced. Lets start with the worst, I got back together with my girlfriend for a third time after explaining to her that the reason I wanted to break up was because I was headed into Junior year and wanted to focus on school, reasonable right? Sure! But recently she told me she drank with her friends which I really look down on. So the next week or so on the one year anniversary I originally asked her out, she was getting really clingy before this and it was just too much for me so I said I needed to go, she told me it was going to be our last time every talking to each other again and I basically said okay, well thanks for the past year of my life and everything, being completely serious and she told me to ""Go fuck yourself MrFluffers_."" That was the last thing she said to me. Now that's not so bad, bad breakup, it happens. But my 3 close friends started to hang out with other people and do illegal things (smoking, drinking, etc.) regularly after I stopped giving them rides to school. I am not the type to do this and I rarely see any of my close friends at school, so the next term comes by and me and one of my have lunch together so I can actually talk to someone and he always talks about how he's going out so much more now, smoking and all these attractive other girls wanna smoke with him and stuff. So just right now, I found out that my ex-girlfriend told my friends that her and her friends want to smoke with my friends. I'm mad at this point, completely mad. So I tell them that I hope they don't smoke with her and that would be messed up if they did cause she hates me and no guy friend would do that to someone. So basically the bad side has been my ex hates me and goes to my friends which I have recently been drifting apart from. Now onto the good part, I am going to head into a internship program my school offers with a big technology company which is huge for me. I like to work with computers and this PAID internship program will look so good on college applications and I'm really trying to nail the interview and keep my grades up throughout the year, my high school career would be set. So, I just don't have anyone I can actually talk to now, I have other friends but they are just acquaintances, you know? Plus, I deleted Instagram and Twitter cause I just don't want to see my ex's face again, and they were just a distraction anyway. So /r/teenagers, that's my situation, whats yours?"
2jofwr,3,2014-10-19,"Me [26 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] of about close to a year, Need help with long distance.",WhiteDragon9d,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jofwr/me_26_m_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_of_about_close_to/,"So I'll do my best to keep this short.

My girlfriend and I have been dating almost a year, we've known each other for a few years and there was always a tension between us that we both had felt but other relationships were happening and whatnot and eventually after a few years when we both were single decided to give it a go. (not that we were avoiding each other or anything, just people/situations prevented us from getting really close)
After a slightly rocky start (ex's, amiright?) we came into the best relationship I've ever had. I was shocked at how normally, I'm terrified of the L-bomb but after a few months, I knew I was in love with this girl. A while after that she had admitted that she felt the same.
Well now she's in her senior year at uni, and I just left about a month and a half ago for my masters in Asia. Leaving her was the hardest thing I think I've every done in my life but I love her dearly and want to do everything in my power to keep her in my life (if it works through this 2 year long distance part then I will intend on proposing).

I know she's loyal and loves me, but I also know this long distance thing is a huge burden on her. She's young (21, and I'm 26) and I know she wants to go have fun and she's also getting ready to do an internship and graduate so she's pretty stressed. And I know that me not being there is taking a bigger toll on her since I can't be there to help her de-stress and whatnot.

We skype pretty much everyday (it's a 12 hour time difference so when it's 8am here it's 8pm there) and when we're not skyping/busy/asleep we're texting pretty constantly. But I want to do more.
I've already arranged to have an extra two weeks for winter break so I can come back and see her, but (originally it was only two weeks) but I won't be able to leave until the first week in January. And I plan on staying a majority of the summer as well.

Has anyone here been in a long term relationship? What are things that worked for your relationship? Even if you haven't been in one, any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I love her and really see myself being with her for the long haul, and anything I can do to help that I will.

it has gotten harder and harder to trust her recently which is why I've gone for asking reddit. It's just she used to make time to skype and whatnot and whenever she could she'd be texting me, but the past week or so it' seems like she's just trying to avoid talking to me. For example when she's gone out to some parties recently, I'll be completely ignored instead of the usual at least occasional text. and I try not to spam her and to let her let loose and have some fun. But she used to at least text me occasionally, and is sucks because she's not the type of person to put down her phone, and i've seen her tweet and whatnot while my texts go unanswered. Even in the mornings and before bed she would always text me first thing. Over the past week I'm lucky if she remembers to text me at all without me initiating it. And avoiding Skype calls for almost a week doesn't help either.
Also I asked her before if we could update our facebook profiles to let people know we were in a relationship, and she said she wasn't a fan(which we talked about it before and I didn't mind since I was there and living with her) but she said she would if I wanted to, which I told her would just make me feel better knowing dudes would be deterred by it. She said that's fine. I pop on her page to post a link today (being about a week after updating it) and now it doesn't show on her profile anymore.

Little things like that are making me worry more. I want to talk to her about it but I know she's busy sometimes. But it really sucks to know I've been canceling many plans and hangouts to talk only then to be blatantly ignored.

Well **update**, we talked. She cheated on me last night. She purposefully took down her fb relationship status when she met the guy then the next night had a one night stand. She was shit faced when she did it. She talked about how if i had shown i was serious by proposing or something then things would've been different. We spoke about real stuff, she has realized she's too dependent on people and is going to stay single because ""I don't deserve a bad person like her"". I hate this, but I still love her and she still loves me, **Am I insane for trying to make is work still?**
---   
**tl;dr**: In a long distance relationship, she's having a really hard time and has taken to pretty much ignoring any interaction with me. Nevermind i guess, she cheated on me."

2jokj9,4,2014-10-19,[M37] attempting to work out if previously great relationship with [F33] is over.,throwaway140598,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jokj9/m37_attempting_to_work_out_if_previously_great/,"We met via an online dating site about 18 months ago and immediately hit it off. We share many of the same interests, have similar views on so many things. A good circle of friends, both of our own and as a couple. Sex has been great. Everyone compliments us on how well suited we are. Have talked about the possibility of getting married and having kids.



The problems started when she had the opportunity to work a paid internship in another country. She was anxious about it at first as didn't want the 4 month placement to put a strain on our relationship. Neither of us liked the idea of spending 4 months apart but I saw what a great opportunity it was for her so we discussed it and agreed that our relationship was strong enough to bear it. That was 3 months ago and I now have major doubts about it.



We've always stayed in daily contact via IM, email, Skype never had any major arguments until these last few months. I'm not the particularly jealous or possessive type, she's never given me any reason to doubt her before. I've always been happy for her to have contact with exes, even for her to go out for a drink with them when I'm not there. She has shown me the same courtesyi too. A few things have happened whilst she's been away that have concerned me though, I'll list a few of them.



On arrival at her new place, she went out for a drink with the guy she is renting a room from plus his brother and another male friend of theirs. She told me about it and I was totally fine with it. She would describe herself as a feminist and told me about how disgusted she was with these guys behaviour that evening. She said they were leery, objectifying women, made lots of cheap comments about how some women were dressed as ""sluts"" and those who didn't were ""frigid"". I was concerned for her, whilst aware she can handle herself I did worry a little that if those guys were to get drunk would one of them try and force themselves on her or something?



Next day, she goes off to the beach with them. She told me one of the guys in particular was keen to go to a nudist beach, mostly so that he could ogle the women. I asked her if she went topless, she said she did but only because she'd had a few drinks, would have done so ordinarily anyway and was being egged on by the guys. She also said that later in the day, the guy who she is renting the room from got a bit out of hand with some physical horseplay and had at one point pinned her onto the ground. I was pretty pissed at this, not with her but with the guy. Who is this arsehole pinning her to the ground against her will? Is my GF going to be safe living with this guy for 4 months?



Sometime a few days later, she has gone out for drinks with the guys again. My girlfriend had let them know she wasn't happy for them to keep up with all the misogynistic talk. She wasn't particularly happy with them as drinking buddies but they're the only people she knows in this new city and going out with them gives her an opportunity to get out and practice the local language which she is trying (and struggling to learn). That evening I get a text from her saying she's having a pretty good time, they're being a bit better behaved than before. I'm obviously pleased to hear that so tell her to have a good night and please just let me know she got back home ok. I didn't hear again from her that night, tried messaging and calling her a few times the next day, didn't get a response til 4pm which I was rather upset about as really worried about her. A similar thing happened back in our home country a few months previously, her going out and not letting me know she got home safely til late in the afternoon the next day. Her excuse on both these occasions was that she got so drunk she just collapsed into bed asleep.



Being as this was the second time it had happened I expressed my frustration with it and why it upset me so much. She did say she was sorry and promised not to let it happen again, she just got so drunk on those occasions she got forgetful. I did question if she was drinking to the extent that she couldn't remember when or what she was doing she had self control issues.



Next thing to happen that upset me was we had  been talking on and off via IM through the day. It got to evening time and I asked her if she wanted to Skype, she said she would like to but had been invited out for drinks with her landlord again. I got the inkling that she'd prefer to go out and was, in a way, asking for my blessing. I said obviously I'd prefer to chat to her on Skype but hey-ho, I know she liked the opportunity to get out and practice her language skills so if that was her preference to go for it, maybe we could catch up later when she's back. So she goes out, messages me at about 11pm and asks if I still want to Skype. I said sure but its getting late and I have work the next day so don't leave it too long. I waited up til half midnight, IM'd her that I couldn't wait anymore and was going to bed. Got a message back around half an hour later apologising she got dragged into another bar by her landlord on the way home. Speak tomorrow? So I'm like, huh, yeah, I guess. I did feel a bit rejected by it and I am growing increasingly concerned by how much and how often she's drinking.



This is starting to get pretty long now, there is quite a bit more to add but I'll post this as is for now and ask what people have to say at this point.  Am I being unreasonable in expecting her to let me know she gets home ok from a night out? I do have a lot of faith and trust in her, some other friends I've asked say there's no way they'd be happy for their GF to go out drinking with other guys. I really just like to know she's got home alright, do I have a right to be concerned about the amount she's drinking?

Tl;dr: Girlfriend is going out and getting drunk quite a lot. Should I be worried about this and should I be concerned she sometimes doesn't let me know she's safe til late the next afternoon."
2jokz0,1,2014-10-19,Getting over my ex,Pandabol,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2jokz0/getting_over_my_ex/,"It has been more than half a year. She broke up with me on a most romantic date of the year, valentine's day. 3 days earlier was my birthday, she didn't had a chance to celebrate my 21st birthday. We are both same age. But my birthday come first

I am busy with my school work, she just ended her internship. At night she wanted to give me a surprise but fail because my friend make some a mistake, I don't blame anyone and we end up didn't celebrate my birthday. We quarrel in the end. I can't really remember what is the reason. I thought that the relationship is very stable. I was wrong. 

On the valentine day, we plan to have dinner together and catch a movie later on. During the dinner, she told me she had something she want to tell me when I send her home. I thought it was something about her school or her friend, so I didn't bother much.

When I send her to her house downstairs, she drop the ball to me. Saying she wanted to break up with me because she like someone else.

Now it has been more than half a year, I thought I had get over her until when I suddenly remember her and take a look at her whatsapp profile, she change to the profile picture with her current boyfriend. My heart race when I look at the picture, realising I haven't move on.

I am not very sad. But I hope I shared this will make me feel happier about it.

2jonfn,4,2014-10-19,"Me [22M] my [21/F] girlfriend doesn't want to try ""us"" for now. I don't know what to do.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jonfn/me_22m_my_21f_girlfriend_doesnt_want_to_try_us/,"Last year, I graduated college in my homecountry, the Netherlands. I was an IT student and got the opportunity to move to Silicon Valley for a 1 year internship. A dream come true! 

The first few months were rough. Adapting to life in the States wasn't easy. I loved it there, but I felt like I was missing something. I lacked companionship, friendship, someone to share my experiences with.

So I decided to sign up on OkCupid. I had never dated before in my life. Never had a girlfriend. But I figured me being abroad, i had nothing to lose.

The first few dates were bad. I was too new and unexperienced to it, wasn't compatible with the girls, or wasn't attracted to the ones that were attracted to me. I got my first kiss and lost my virginity during those dates, but I never felt in love. It got to the point where I got obsessed with OkCupid and found it hard to continue motivating myself to go on dates.

But then, at some point, I met up with a girl I was really excited to date. It blew my mind, we made out on the first date. Had sex on the second that date. That date lasted 16 hours culminating in some amazing brunch. I fell head over heels for her. Those were an amazing 3 weeks.

But I got scared. She told me she had to go home for summer break and would be back in August. My visa was expiring September 20th. I felt like timing took everything I loved away from me. I was scared.

The day before she left on summerbreak, I broke out in tears and told her I'd miss her. Right before she left I told her I loved her, it was only 5 dates in, a huge mistake on my part. She didn't know how to reply and left.

However, over the summer we started Skyping again. She told me she loved me over Skype. She flew to SF and we met up for a weekend, it was great! We talked almost every 3-4 days and time flew by.

I fell in love. And I started to panic. I got scared, US immigration law is really strict. There was no way for me to extend my visa. I tried to find jobs, I got stressed. I spent entire days reading on Immigration forums trying to find a solution. Why? Because I liked the US? Yes I did, but mostly because I was too scared to lose her.

I got stressed because of it, couldn't focus on work. Thought about immigration all the time. I started becoming whiny about taxes and what not. I forgot to enjoy my last months in the US.

The summer continued and we met again, everything once again was fantastic. It was the greatest weekend.

2 weeks later she came back to the city to continue her studies. At that point I only had 3 weeks left on my visa. Things kind of coincided. My roommates left the country earlier, so I was alone. One of my friends decided to go no contact with me because she had feelings for me and I told her I loved the girl that just returned from summer break.

Things just weren't the same. I put too much pressure on her. I only had 3 weeks left so I wanted to spent every waking moment wit her. She was the only friend that was still left in the US so I suffocated her with attention. Apart from that I also cried and whined about my immigration status, how it was ""Unfair that American laws were about to separate us!"". 

I applied to grad school, I figured I might as well continue studying, I have a part time job lined up which would cover the costs of grad school. And I'm only 22, I figured why not? I liked the US. And it would mean I'd be back in January to continue our relationship.

She told me she didn't want me to come back just for her, because it would put too much pressure on her. I spent the last 2 weeks being extremely stressed. I forgot to enjoy her company while it lasted.

I asked her what we were gonna do once I left the country. We said we'd take a break and see where things are when/if I got back. I mean, my admission to grad school is still not a certainty.

We got into some fights over the last weeks. Something felt off. I was so stressed I wasn't myself anymore and it hurted our relationship. It was just so hard to ""just enjoy the time left"" knowing that I'd have to go home in 2 weeks.

The day I had to go home was the hardest day in my life, we hugged each other one last time, cried in each others arms and parted ways. She sent me an e-mail that night telling me that she loved me.

I went home, expecting to keep things alive of Skype and continuing our relationship when I got back in January. However i now realise that was unrealistic. I wasn't even sure if I was gonna come back! We were on a ""break"".

We talked over Facebook and Skype the first weeks, but she got more and more distant. Last night I told her my application was moved on to the grad division and I was about to be admitted, that I was excited to see her again.

She told me she was happy for me. But told me she wasn't happy anymore the last 2 weeks. She was seeing someone else right now. She told me to only come back if I really wanted. She told me she missed me but no longer loved me. I cried as my heart broke. She said I had moved to fast during the relationship and I had put too much pressure on her. She couldn't handle it. She didn't want to be ALL I had. She said she'd talk to me if I was less hurt. Didn't want to try ""us"" again right now, because I'm not even in the US. She said, ""things might be different in a few months, so we'll see."", and wants to continue dating the other guy for now.

So here I am, sitting at home. I don't like it here anymore. I live in a rural village and I'm bored to death. I miss the US. But I'm not sure if I'm going back for the right reasons. Part of me wants to go to grad school abroad, spend another 2-3 years there, enrich myself in another culture and meet amazing new people. I'd make friends in school, have things to do, wouldn't have to worry about my immigration status for years so we could finally get to know each other.

I am also kind of relieved. Now I can make my choice of going back to the US unbiased. I wouldn't do it for her. I would do it for me. It wouldn't put pressure on any of us.

The problem is that she gave me a final straw of hope. I realise she has a new boyfriend, she is probably over me. I realise the chances of us dating are really slim. But I can't help but thinking about her and that straw, I keep thinking things will be allright. I secretly wish that she and her boyfriend break up before I'm back. I still think about her all the time.

I will now know whether I'm admitted or not in the coming weeks. So I'm going to have to decide. I'm torn. I'm scared of going back and having her hurt my heart again. But I also want to go back to meet new people.

I check her Instagram/Facebook/Reddit account all the time. It's unhealthy, I feel addicted to her. I need to move on but I don't know how. She also give me a final strand of hope by saying ""We'll see where we are in a couple of months.""

Part of me wants to talk to her again, ask her whether she meant that, but I told her I'd be no contact until New Years and we'll see from there.

I just keep thinking of her, I masturbate to her Instagram pictures and then cry knowing that some other guy is having sex with her and it could have been me if it wasn't for the fact that I HAD to move home.

Now I'm thinking I should not visit her Instagram, Reddit, Facebook or anything. Make a decision whether I want to go back to the US in a month, at that point I might have moved on a little bit. And if I decide to grad school I would then talk to her when I get back to the US and see where she is in life. Maybe she would like to date again? If not, I think it will be easier for me at that point for me to move on. Does that sound like a reasonable plan? Am I having Idle hope and should I just move on right away and not even consider that ""final strand?""

---   
**tl;dr**: Moved to the US, fell in love with someone. Got scared to lose her because visa was about to expire. Applied to Grad School so I could come back in January. Was so scared to lose her that I got overly attached. Back home now, about to be admitted to grad school and she told me she met someone else. Said she felt sad but also relieved, because I was overly attached the last few weeks. when I was gone and wasn't sure if she wants to try 'us' again when I'm back but definitely wants to be friends. I'm not sure whether I should pursue this straw of hope, move on, or go no contact for a few months and figure it out from there."
2jonzg,24,2014-10-19,Planning surprise trip to Orlando for girlfriend of 3.5 years; proposing at the fireworks. (x-post /r/disney /r/orlando),[deleted],WaltDisneyWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/2jonzg/planning_surprise_trip_to_orlando_for_girlfriend/,"Hi all, as the title says I'm planning a surprise trip for my girlfriend and I to Orlando. tl;dr she had a really rough childhood and has never really been on vacation let alone a theme park let alone disney world. I love her to death and want to marry her. I've thought that I might give the impression that I'm throwing money at her before proposing, but making her happy makes me so happy and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. 

Nobody has ever really cared much about her or given her much guidance, and I've kind of guided her through college so she can have a good life in the future, with or without me. At this moment I'm not too well off, had some savings from a recent well paying internship but I'm currently getting gouged at $10/hour to be an associate consultant for an IT consulting firm because they know the experience is great + they hire year round. I'm kind of strapped for cash between rent, paying my tuition, giving her a better standard of life, so help with the price of this trip would really be great (anyone in the IT industry hiring in Houston? shameless self plug i've got experience in business intelligence and SQL Server/Databases )

It all started when I got a timeshare email from Marriott Rewards offering a 4 night 5 day stay at the Orlando Grande Vista. I honestly had no idea that Orlando was theme park capital of the world, so I got really excited about the trip once I googled ""what is there to do in Orlando?"" (if google was a guy he'd think i was an idiot).

I've already done considerable research into this topic and I've spent so much time that it's really getting to be a huge headache...I guess this post will also serve as a journal for my vacation planning. Even if nobody replies (which I hope isn't the case), I will probably keep updating it just to keep track of all the information I've accrued. Please comment on any topic that you have knowledge or advice on :)

I need some help from you all in several different areas and have sectioned my post like so:
1. Getting to Orlando

2. Where to stay

3. How long to spend at each park **MOST IMPORTANT PLEASE HELP ME.**

4. Where to get tickets

5. Wtf are we going to eat?

    **Getting to Orlando**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several days ago I saw a deal from Southwest doing one way flights from $49 to $99. I messed up and didn't know it ended 10/17 at midnight and missed out. However I have 53k points saved in Chase Ultimate Rewards and saw that I could use 35k points for two round trip tickets to Orlando. The cash price is approximately $650. I asked some friends who are consultants (read: mileage rewards experts) and they told me that was a decent use of my points. Any other input? I was hoping that Southwest would have that sale again but I really don't know when. 

If I flew, then I would need to get a rental car. I plan on spending ten days in Orlando (arrive at 9:30 AM 1/6, get to the airport at 5:45 PM 1/15). A did a search with my AAA membership just now and they said it would cost $383 for that duration. Factor in maybe $60 for gas and it appears my total transportation costs for the trip would be $1100.

I've also considered driving. google maps says it's a 15 hour drive from my house to the Grande Vista. I figure if I got really good rest the night before I could make it in a day. However, I've never done a drive like that and I've read that doing a drive like that will really knock you out for a day. My car is relatively new and is rated for 37mpg. I think it's conservative to assume 30mpg and $3.50/gal median price, so for the 1000 mile trip it'd be $117 in gas. If I need an extra day to rest then perhaps I get a hotel room for an extra day and my total ""transportation cost"" will be $234 in gas + $200 for two extra nights on either end of the trip + wear and tear on my vehicle.

Getting to Orlando: $1100 flying and renting a car vs $434 + maybe 33 hours of driving.

**Where to Stay**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I mentioned that I have 4 nights at the Grande Vista ( http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mcogv-marriotts-grande-vista/ ). As it's from a time share offer, I just sit for 90 minutes in a sales meeting and in turn get to pay $300 for 4 nights there. I'm questioning the quality of the resort and have spent a lot of time looking into this itself, but at $75 a night (tax and fees waived) I'm sure it'll be ok. However, if anyone has stayed there I would greatly appreciate input.


I also went crazy on priceline name your own price trying to get the Four Seasons (http://www.fourseasons.com/orlando/). I bid up to $275 and still couldn't get it. I ended up accidentally adding the region that had the Waldorf Astoria (name your own pricer's will get it; http://www.waldorfastoriaorlando.com/) and got two nights there at $230. With the price being $330 normally I guess that's alright. I would appreciate comments about this hotel or the nightly rate if anyone has stayed here before.

I will attempt to get two nights at the Four Seasons for around $250/night. Might not be possible since it retails at $480 a night, but I figure being low season they're burning money whenever the room is empty right? If not, I will maybe get two nights at some cheap Disney resort to offset the costs of Waldorf. 

I'm looking at 4 nights at the Grande Vista, 2 nights at Waldorf, maybe 2 nights at the four seasons, and 2-4 nights at another area hotel....There are SO many 3-4 priceline-star hotels in Orlando and I'm really hesistant to bid NYOP asides from the 5 star hotels because the 4 stars retail from $120/night to $300+/night. I'm almost guaranteed to get a really bad hotel if I do that. How else should I go about getting cheap hotel accommodations? Thinking about applying for a second card for more points...

**How long to stay at each park**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So this is probably the area I need the biggest help in....advice I get for this section will probably affect every other section. I've been looking at reviews of the parks on http://www.themeparkinsider.com/reviews/ and it looks like I will want to hit up 10 different parks, basically all of the ones in Orlando and Lake Buena Vista (minus Blizzard beach because it's closed for maintenance at that time.) Do you guys think 1 day at each park is going to be enough? My Mom went to Universal recently with my niece and said that we could probably do both Universal parks in a day since ""there's not really anything to do at Universal."" However I've heard good things about Harry Potter so I'm curious if I could do Universal in 1, 1.5, or 2 days. A plus to driving would be the flexibility to do a repeat day of a park I suppose.

**Where to get tickets**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've basically googled around and I don't really think there are ways to get cheaper tickets to Disney, Discovery Cove, and Universal. Is there a secret underworld of theme park tickets I can be introduced to to get some reduced prices? I'm looking on Orlando craigslist but it really seems like no way to verify those tickets. if anyone has got an in, please PM me.

I've also read about things like Universal annual passholders getting cheaper tickets elsewhere, but I kind of did the math and it doesn't benefit me to buy an annual pass just for a discount. Any help here guys? I saved up several weeks worth of a paycheck for a ring and my wallet and I are not really on speaking terms, although my bank will probably like me much more after this trip.

**What are we going to eat??**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've heard the disney dining plan is not a good deal (although convenient?) and room service at any of these places is going to require my first born child. If I ask her to she'd be more than willing to do dollar menu for 10 days but I absolutely don't want that for her. I figured I might upgrade my hotel room for the 1st, 4th, and 7th night to have a kitchen so I could cook a bunch of food (She was severely underweight when I first met her, now it's basically datass all the time) on those days for us. It seems like this is probably the most economical method. However, does anyone know of any good eats close to hotels and themeparks, or do they basically have that on lockdown?


Thank you all for reading this in any portion. I'm kind of pooped after typing this but again I would appreciate any help in making this trip as good of a value as I can get while still blowing her mind. "
2joo10,81,2014-10-19,I didn't get offered a job at the end of my internship,cantresistmylumps,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2joo10/i_didnt_get_offered_a_job_at_the_end_of_my/,"I graduated from university last year and since then have worked in a few stopgap jobs and internships with no real future. Recently I was offered a 4 month internship at a medium sized company, expenses only with a heavy implication of a full time position at the end (quotes like ""we're looking to train someone for a long-term position"", ""need someone on a permanent basis"" etc) I was SO excited and felt like I'd finally been given a big opportunity for my first real job. 

I've enjoyed it immensely - the people are great, the work is great and I've been treated like an employee rather than an intern. Last week, I set up a ""progress meeting"" with my boss so I could ask whether there was potential for a full time job. At that point, whenever there were talks about future projects I was always included in those plans even if they were after the end date of my internship. 

Before the meeting she announces to everyone that they're hiring someone for a position which has responsibilities similar to my own. I was completely shocked, as before hearing this I genuinely believed I had a real chance of being offered a job. Later on, my fears were confirmed that although I've been doing a great job and they'd love to hire me, they're unable to take me on. Nothing personal, they just can't afford two new people. 

I'm crushed. I was so hopeful that after all these months of stress I was finally going to land a job. It's been a very difficult year as I've moved thousands of miles away from my family whom I miss everyday. I've had to move house twice in very last-minute stressful situations and I spent most of this internship working two jobs which took a big toll on me emotionally.

I know that as an intern I'm not entitled to a job offer. This post is just to vent because I felt completely blindsided. I had no clue that they were hiring someone else (apparently it was already decided before I even came along), and I have the impression that if I'd never approached them they would have waited until the very last day to tell me I didn't have a job. 

I've already started job hunting and I'm really grateful for the experience that this internship has given me, so it's not as if all hope is lost. I'm just feeling really upset, and I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced this situation, and how it turned out for them?"

Nobody has ever really cared much about her or given her much guidance, and I've kind of guided her through college so she can have a good life in the future, with or without me. At this moment I'm not too well off, had some savings from a recent well paying internship but I'm currently getting gouged at $10/hour to be an associate consultant for an IT consulting firm because they know the experience is great + they hire year round.

2jos8w,1,2014-10-19,I realised why I was gaming...,ThunderShadow,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2jos8w/i_realised_why_i_was_gaming/,"[Remorse]
OK some background about me:
I am a 20 years old and in the 3rd year of college. I have been playing dota 2 for the past 1 year like mad. I was seriously addicted to it. When I was not playing it, I would be thinking about strategies, betting etc. Till now, I thought this was normal. I used to play video games when I was young. I loved playing them in school. But at that time, it was healthy. Just a few hours a week.

But this past month has been very difficult for me. I hit a new low. I could not get up in the morning. I remember one day I slept for 16 hours. The next day I slept for 12 hours. The thing is I didn't even feel like playing games. The thought of getting up from the bed, switching on the laptop,*sitting* on the chair and playing, felt very tiring. I didn't play. I didn't feel like going to classes. But I did go.

Before coming to college, I was very passionate about computers. In school, I was one of the best students in the subject. My teacher was really impressed with me. In my school finals, I was one of the highest scoring student in CS. I even got a certificate(official) saying that I was one of 0.01% of students who got the highest marks. My country has a different education system.

So I was really excited to go to college. I was finally going to be independent, and going to follow my passion. Well things started going bad at this point.

You see, I had this dream of meeting new people. I wanted to talk with different people. I searched about colleges in the US, Europe, Japan, and south america. Initially, I thought that I just wanted to go to a US college... but it turns out that I wanted to go to any college that was not in my country. It was about travelling, visiting new places. I even researched about going to Nairobi in kenya in the first year of college (to transfer). Well, I finally applied to MIT. Yeah. Only that.

As you would guess, I did not get in. Instead, I came to a shitty college here, in my country. But I did not know that this college was this bad before I came here. None of my peers had any interest in their majors, all of them were just studying for grades. This attitude was also reflected in the teachers. We had a meeting with the college officials about changing the curriculum and all... nothing happened.

None of this would have been a problem. Because I thought that I need not rely on my college for learning. I would learn about computers on my own. I learned about OpenGL in the first year. I was able to make small programs about it. At this time, my college was taking a OpenGL course for the 2nd years. I asked the CS department if I could join thm in their OpenGL course. I was not allowed. :) cheers.

Then I learned about app dev, and then about programming the raspberry pi. Unfortunately, no one knows about this. Except my parents and friends. What I means is, if I apply for a job, then I don't have any proof that I know all this. There are absolutely no opportunities in my college. No good company would ever come to my college for recruitment. I will have to apply on my own.

But that is not a problem. Getting a good job is not on the top of my list... something I realised recently. I just want to go to an interesting job. Something that will be involved in robotics, computers, programming, game dev...

The real problem is this:
I have no way to meet new people. After finishing school, I thought that I would go to a international college and meet new people. *Have friends there*. That I would be surrounded with people of different ethnic groups, interests, cultures etc...
Not that my present friends are bad... They are awesome and I feel really lucky that I have them. But the problem is, I won't be able to make new ones.

I have really shitty grades. So even if I apply for some post graduate programs, I won't be able to get in. Even if get an awesome job and travel the world and some how find friends there, I won't have that *thick* friends. I won't be close to them. They will be workmates or something.

So where does gaming come into this?
I guess that last year was the time when all this finally hit me. That I had no hope. That I could not change my situation. To get away from it, I started gaming. I wanted some distraction. It came in the form of dota 2. I don't regret playing dota.

On top of all this, the financial situation in my family is really bad. I would have to go to a shitty job to support my family. I feel like now I realise why some people take some decisions. Till now, I was living in a fairy tale. Everything was provided by my parents. Seriously, some people say that money is not everything. Follow your passions without the thought about money. Well fuck them. Money is really important. If we had it, I would have been able to go to a better college. I would have been able to go to the south african internship or the scuba diving internship or the internship in antarctica. I wouldn't have to study all these stupid courses. I could have learned something that I wanted.

Well I just wanted to share this with the world. My friends know everything about me after coming to college. My parents know everything before coming to college. No one knows the full story. I feel better after writing this. Though it does not change anything.

-I've been sexually attracted to my mother since I was 12 years old. I have never told anyone and never will. It's always made me feel like a bad/disgusting person and I'm not a psychiatrist but I would guess that this is the main reason why I don't have the ability to start a relationship with a woman. When you have a stigmatized perversion like this you never truly fit in anywhere and feel like an impostor. I have friends but they don't really know what I am. 

-A big reason why I have not committed suicide already is because my older sister already did. She was bipolar. It crushed my parents and my younger brother so badly that I promised myself that I would not do the same. That was 5 years ago. I still think about her all the time. Her death permeates every facet of my life. 

-A year ago I found child pornography on my dad's computer accidentally. Internet connection was slow, so I go onto his laptop and up pops this site of ""non-nude child models"". It was some brazilian site with scantily-clad little girls in risque positions. I closed it and never said a word. Until that point I had had a wonderful relationship with my father, which was good since I'm all fucked up when it comes to my mom. My dad was my rock and always supportive and I loved him dearly and now that image of him as become tarnished and rocked my world even further. 

-I finally graduated college and got an internship but I hate it. Everyone there is much older than me. I fucking hate sports and think they're boring 90% of the time so I have fucking NOTHING to talk about or connect with anyone except very superficial stuff. The job is mediocre at about $48-52k/year, has bad hours, weekend work and people in my department are looked down upon. Morale is bad in by department with the poor management. Many people I shadow don't bother to cover up their jadedness and openly whine to me all day about how much they don't like their job. I don't know what to do about grad school/finding a better job since I want to move out. I think moving out could help some of my problems but frankly I cannot find anything feasible to pursue in grad school that I would enjoy. I stumbled into this career path on accident in the first place. 

I look forward to nothing in my life right now. I try to numb myself with books, movies, and video games and only further isolate myself apart from hanging out with my 3 friends here and there. I cannot imagine starting a family since I don't how the fuck I'm gonna find a girl that's okay with dating a 28 year old virgin who's never been in a relationship. People online say virginity isn't a big deal but that's only because they're on the outside looking it. It IS a big deal at my age. It's an immediate redflag that I'm fucked up, socially retarded, impotent, or just a flat-out loser. 

I'm completely alone, unable to confide these things in anyone. Not that I ever would. I could not bring myself to even tell a professional about these things. I don't want to kill myself but I fucking hate my life right now. It just gets worse every year. 

I'm starting to get to the point where I won't even care if I hurt people by offing myself. So what if my pedophile dad mourns me? Do I really have a great enough relationship with my friends that they wouldn't be over it in a year or two? 

I just have a knot of hatred, humiliation, fear about the future, debilitating self-pity, and despair lodged deep in my fucking guts. This is why people put shotguns to their face and make themselves unrecognizable. I get it now. 

But I'm here. I don't just want to wallow in self-pity forever. I made it through college, I got a job even if it's shitty, I've had a good friendship with my 2 buddies since middle school, I love my pet even though she's getting old and won't be with me soon, there are books/movies/video games I want to enjoy even if they're a childish waste of time, I think I can someday put all this pain into my art for other people and I still want to find someone I can love. 

But I don't even know where to start right now. "
2jp4f2,12,2014-10-19,It started with a spider,CindySilver,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2jp4f2/it_started_with_a_spider/,"It started with a spider. A spider on the wall. A spider on the curtains. A spider on my shoe. One tiny, black spider. I wasn’t afraid of spiders, I never was. Until I started to see them everywhere. My world was made out of spiders. Some were bigger than others, some had a different colour. I saw the spiders everywere. I thought I lost my mind. I’ve told people, that I saw spiders. No one else saw them. No one. They looked at me like I was crazy. They’ve asked if I ever killed one. I told them I didn’t. But I have killed one. Once. I’ve had nightmares for a week, involving spiders.
It started with a spider. Then I had to visit a doctor. The spiders were crawling out of my skin. I could see and feel them. Sometimes I could even hear them. They started talking to me. They told me that everyone was after me. Everyone wanted me dead. They told me to do things to other people. Horrible things, like tackling an old lady or punching a kid  in the face. 
The doctor was very worried. He asked me for how long this has been going on. I could feel that he didn’t believe me. The spider behind him on the wall was huge. Almost the biggest one I have ever seen. Only the spider from my nightmares was bigger. I wanted to ask the doctor if he didn’t see the spider behind him. The spider told me to shut up. The doctor wouldn’t believe me. He thought I was insane, just like everyone else. The spiders were my only friends.

The doctor gave me some medicine. He would send someone to my house everyday to make sure I took them. Elise came. Elise told me she was a nurse. She was sweet. She believed me. I told her that I was afraid of the pills. How much I distrust the world. She told me I should take a pill. She told me how they worked. That they started working within half an hour. That she would stay that long. Elise stayed half an hour. I took the pill. When I noticed my fear for the pills was unnecessary, I was relieved. Elise asked me  if she could leave. She told me her colleague would come this evening, because I have to take a pill every twelve hours to keep the spiders away. She would come back the next day.

Elise came back the next morning. She asked me how I was, if her colleague was nice to me. I told her everything was fine. Then I saw him. The man. On the other side of the street stood a man. I had never seen him before in my life. He wore sunglasses and a black suit. His head was bald. He shouldn’t have worn those sunglasses. It was a very cloudy morning. Elise could tell that I was feeling uneasy. She told me I should take  my pill. Then I noticed. The mark on her wrist. Elise lied to me. She was one of thém. One of the people the spiders warned me for. Théy wanted me dead. I started to scream and pushed Elise away. She tried to grab me but I pushed her away from me. I locked my door and flushed the pills. That I could be fooled this easy. I sat down in my kitchen, underneath the window. Shortly after, I heard voices. They came for me. The man with the sunglasses stood near the window. I could feel him. He was talking to someone. Then they opened the door.
Two men came in. They had a stretcher with them. They told me they were nurses. They would like to take me with them, because they didn’t think I was safe here. They were very calm and polite. Until I noticed the mark. I stood up and wanted to flee, but they were faster. They gave me a shot.

Now I am here. In this house, or whatever it is. There are all sorts of crazy people here. They kidnapped me. They want to turn me into one of thém. One of the people the spiders warned me for. 
I haven’t seen a single spider since I’m here. I kind of miss them. They made me feel safe. Now I don’t know who to trust.
They made me talk to a shrink. The lady only looked at me and nodded. After three times I stopped talking. I don’t speak to anyone anymore.

This morning there was a new girl. Her name is Susan. She has blonde hair and blue eyes. She has an ugly skin. She told me she was an intern. Susan doesn’t have a mark. Everyone else does. I talk to Susan. I tell her to be careful, to trust no one. Everyone wants to harm her, and she has to watch out for the man with the sunglasses. Susan listens, she believes me.

Until one morning. Susan doesn’t show up to me. Tanja does. She starts to ask about all the things I told Susan. I trusted Susan. I get angry. I get so angry and start to scream. I see the man with the sunglasses standing in front of the window. He smiles at me. It is not a friendly smile. I start to scream louder. Tanja walks away. Soon she returns with a man and a woman. The woman pulls out a syringe and a bottle.  I try to hit it out of her hands but Tanja and the man hold me tight. The woman empties the syringe in my arm. I go limp and can’t stand anymore. My voice won’t work either. 

They drag me trough the hallway. I see Susan. She looks scared and upset. All I can do is look at her. I want her to feel guilty. 
Suddenly, I see a giant spider showing up from behind the wall. He walks towards Susan. She doesn’t see anything, she doesn’t notice. The spider opens his jaws and bites of her head.

I’m not scared. I know the spider is my only friend. The spiders have always been my only friends. 
While they drag me trough the hallway, I feel nothing but satisfaction. They open my cell and drag me to a bed in the middle of the room. There are thousands of spiders. They are everywhere. They all watch silently as they put me on the bed. There is a small smile on my face when I notice the giant spider in the doorway.  He smiles at me. Then he spits out very familiar sunglasses. He walks over to Tanja and the man. He opens his jaws and crushes their heads. I can’t do anything but smile.
I hear someone scream and close my eyes.

It started with a spider. It also ends with one.

Is this true and, if so, what the hell do I say in the message?

If the profs at my school are any indication, they would just be annoyed at receiving an email from some random person.

What do you think?

Keep in mind that I've done my homework with respect to the faculty, labs, and programs to which I am applying.  I have an excellent GPA, a couple of good research projects, and a couple of semi-reasonable internships.  In case its relevant, I'm CompE from Canada.

Thanks in advance! Also, if you have any other advice, I'd love to hear it.

[These are my github repos for reference](https://github.com/dkanellis). 

The main way I preferred acquiring knowledge was through books since I found them to be extensive and providing more than beginner knowledge.

Specifically I have read these books thus far:

* Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
* Java A Beginner's Guide
* Some of: Pro JPA 2
* Some of: Cracking the Coding Interview

My goal is to acquire as much professional knowledge as I can. I want to make my projects look professional therefore allowing me to have a better chance at job interviews for internships or even graduate jobs.

What I want is to acquire very good knowledge in making efficient, professional and clean code. *Clean Code* provided me with very good tools but now I need something more oriented towards Class Design.

**My question is:** How should I go from here? Is there any good book that you could recommend me to help me with good class design or is there something entirely different that I should be doing. Personally I was thinking of starting to read *Java: The Complete Reference*."
2jph9d,4,2014-10-19,"My boyfriend [21 M] of 6 months broke up with me [31 F]. First time being dumped, how to deal?",i_love_playdough,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jph9d/my_boyfriend_21_m_of_6_months_broke_up_with_me_31/,"First relationship after a rough split from my husband of 2 years. I thought he was a lot older, he thought I was a lot younger. I was interested in exploring my sexuality and just having fun, so the age difference wasn't enough to deter me from dating him. The young man has an old soul, and an emotional maturity that exceeds most of the men I've dated. 

We had an understanding in the beginning. This wasn't going to last, but that didn't mean we couldn't enjoy each other and have something fun and meaningful for a time. I told him a dozen times that I'm not interested in or ready for anything long term. He was fine with this and more or less on the same page in the beginning.

Our connection was really deep from the start. Let me just say that I have never experienced the kind of chemistry we had-- he blew my mind. He was the most attentive, sensual, confident, affectionate lover I've ever had. Things that came naturally to him drove me WILD, and vice versa. It was a phenomenal summer. We went on trips, we met each other's families, made new friends, volunteered together, explored the mountains and the city, spent many nights talking about dreams and life and how we might better the world.

As I said I was guarded in the beginning, not wanting anything serious. But he was persistent, and amazing. So I let him in a little bit. And then over the weeks and months, I fell in love with him and everything changed. He convinced me that he wanted me, the real me… and that he wanted a life with me. Life, babies, a home, the future; together. For the majority of our time together I refused to think about it. I didn't want to, and I told him so a dozen times or so. Then he went and wooed my heart and filled me with love and hope and goo and dreams of forever.

Six month mark came around and I started feeling the flight or fight urge... get out before it gets too hard, or stay and fight for it and go deeper. I decided I didn't want either, and was just going to stay in this happy place for as long as possible. Then a week later he came over and we had dinner and lovin' as usual, only this time he wanted to have a chat before he left. He told me through tears that he feels like he's holding me back, and bringing me down to his level in some way. In short, he said that he feels that I'm ready to pursue certain goals and build a life, and that I deserve to have someone who can give that to me. He said that he can't, he's in school and hasn't built anything in his life. The thing is, I just went back to school and won't be finished for 3 and a half years, and after that I plan to do a 6 month internship in S. America. I am in no way ready to settle down and start a family, as I said in the beginning.

I can't believe how heart broken I was. I've never been broken up with, but I don't know how much that's contributing. I've dated and been with a lot of men, and haven't experienced this kind of compatibility and happiness in a relationship before. I had my concerns about our age difference of course, and was afraid that if we did get serious he'd be missing out on a lot of experiences. Deep down I know that this is probably right, but I am having such a hard time letting it go. Getting a divorce was the most painful thing I have ever been through... but this is pretty close and I don't know why. 

He wanted to be friends and talk every day, text throughout the day, call me before bed and hang out as usual. So he came over two days after the breakup and I had to have breakup round two and tell him that it's just not possible. I can't flip a switch and stop loving him, and we need time to separate from each other. He didn't want to accept that, but I think he understood. It's a bit naive to think you can just continue on as usual, but this is his first serious relationship and break up so I can't blame him. He said he feels ""lost in the woods"". We both cried again.

I almost broke down and called him last night. It's been a week since breakup round two. I miss him so much. I went out on with a cruiser club in my neighborhood on Friday. Had a lot of flirty fun, and the attention felt good. But overall it made me feel hopeless, like I'll never find someone as amazing again. I couldn't stop thinking about him. I'm having a hard time focusing. We go to the same school and have mutual friends. I want to be on friendly terms and reach out eventually. He said he'd be waiting on me to contact him when I'm ready, and hopes that it's soon. I'm a damn mess, and I don't know what to do. 

---   
tl;dr: My boyfriend [M 21] broke up with me [31 F] and really wants to stay friends. I told him it's not possible, but we go to the same school and have mutual friends and I MISS HIM. What to do?"

29M here looking for a long-term roleplay partner who enjoys detailed and descriptive roleplays. New to reddit but an experienced roleplayer. Kinks, dislikes and a few story ideas below. If interested, PM me with a bit about you, your kinks, dislikes and the stories below or ideas of your own that you would enjoy playing.

Kinks: Curvy girls, Group Sex, Ageplay, Interracial, Anal, Manipulation/Non Con, Humiliation 

Dislikes: Extreme Ageplay, Pets, Watersports, Extreme Violence

Example Story Ideas: 

**Chaperone on a Class Trip**
I am an adult chaperone on your high school class trip. While walking past the hotel pool I see a couple of the male students on the trip laughing outside of the girls locker room door and holding what appear to be a girls swimsuit and clothes. I go up to them and see what they are up to, realize they have taken your clothes and bikini while you were showering in the girls locker room. I take the clothes and send them away, handing them back to you around the locker room door. However, while you're changing in the locker room, I notice a baggie of pot fell out of your clothes. I question you about it when you come out of the locker room, fully dressed, and tell you I have to search your room. Once we're up in your room I search your things and find a lot more contraband. Enough to call your parents and send you home...

**Job Interview with Friend's Dad**
I am a powerful lawyer, used to getting my way and walking all over those I view as weaker. You would be one of my daughter's friends who is looking for an internship or full time job. You've had a great deal of trouble finding work and, out of desperation and even though my presence has terrified and intimidated you ever since you can remember, you ask your friend if she will ask me to at least interview you. I very reluctantly agree to at least interview you. As the interview starts I don't show much interest but as it progresses, I realize just how weak and easily manipulatable you are and begin to use my leverage and intimidating presence to use you sexually and turn you into my personal and company slut.

**TV Audition with Famous Lead Actor**
I am a famous movie star actor who has agreed to do an HBO or Showtime TV show but only under the condition that I get the right to reject any of my co-stars. You are a young teenage actress, just moving from the midwest to pursue your acting career. Against all odds you've landed the part to play my daughter on the TV show. Now, the only thing standing in the way of a part on this prestigious TV show that could make your career, is your interview with me. You come to my trailer on set, nervous and anxious, knowing this is your one chance at the career you've always dreamed of. 

**Prospective Student on First College Visit**
You're the naive prospective college student making her first college visit. I am your tour guide. I notice you are by yourself and seem a bit shy so I make a point of walking with you on the tour, acting very personable and charming. Helping to ease your nerves about being on your own and visiting colleges. After the tour I invite you to a party that my friends are having later that evening. I tell you it will be good for you to make some friends before you start so you have a leg up on all of the other freshman. You hesitate but eventually accept, telling yourself that you really have to put yourself out there now that you're about to be in college. You arrive at the party later that night and...

Just a few ideas. Many more and interested in scenes and roles you would like to play.

Look forward to hearing from you."

Next summer I'll need to be renting out an apartment.  My question is how should I prepare for this?

I'm not necessarily worried about paying for it as I will be given a relocation stipend (...and pay).  What I'm curious about is how will I actually get the apartment in the first place?  I've never had a job or a credit card.  Should I try to get a credit card to establish some credit?  Is the fact that I will have a paying internship enough of a backing to get an apartment?  Is there anything else I should be considering/worrying about?

As far as getting a credit card, here's a few (possibly?) relevant details:

-I go to an instate university and live with my family

-they cover the expenses of tuition/housing/food/gas/insurance

-the only regular expenses I cover are my phone/car maintenance/eating out with friends

2jpzla,36,2014-10-19,How to Succeed in Undergrad: A Brief Guide for Freshmen and Prospective Students.,dat_cake,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2jpzla/how_to_succeed_in_undergrad_a_brief_guide_for/,"Hello all, I am a graduating senior and would like to share my knowledge of how to be successful in undergrad. This comes from my own personal experience and the experience and advice of my peers. This is intended for prospective engineering students and freshmen. Hopefully this helps you plan out your classes and long-term goals.


__Freshman Year:__

Make friends! Come to class with a positive attitude every day, and have an open mind. Join clubs, and try to get involved with a long-term extra curricular (music organizations, professional societies, etc) to increase your chances of having leadership positions further down the road. 

Study hard. Freshmen with high GPAs have substantially better chances of getting early internships and research positions. Freshman year is really the only time GPA alone matters, because you likely don't have any experience yet.

Summer after Freshman Year:
Internships are unlikely at this point, but by all means pursue one. If you can't get real world experience like this, then take a summer class or two at a community college to get ahead. Each class you take over the summer is one less you have to take during the year, which means you have more time to devote to your extra-curriculars. Try to work a part time job too, even if its delivering pizzas.



__Sophomore Year:__

Continue to hit the books and stay involved. By now you will have a better understanding of your skills and interests. Try to get involved with research or a part-time job relevant to engineering, such as doing drafting work or tutoring.

This summer your priorities are:

1. Internship

2. Studying Abroad

3. Doing research with faculty (if you have high GPA and interest in research)

4. Taking Classes.

Options 1 and 3 will greatly increase your chance of landing an internship next summer.



__Junior Year:__

By now you should be prepared to take on leadership roles in your extra curriculars. Junior year is also the hardest in terms of coursework for most disciplines. You need to land an internship or more formal research position in the summer, so make this your first priority.

Junior Year summer:
It is pretty much expected that you have an internship or some other research experience if you want to be a competitive applicant for a job or grad school after you graduate. Make getting an internship a top priority during the school year. If you can't land an internship, its not the end of the world. Try pursing volunteer activities or continue working your part time job if you have one.

(By research I mean formal programs like NSF Research Experiences for Undergrads, NIST, etc.)



__Senior Year:__

Very open-ended. Many people take an extra semester or two because of co-ops or wanting to space out their class schedule if they can afford the extra tuition. Taking an extra year is perfectly fine just so long as its not because you were failing classes (but you gotta do what you gotta do). Focus on your senior project (if you have one) and networking for a job. If you want to go to graduate school, be aware that most applications are due mid-December and require a great deal of preparation.


Hopefully this helps those of you who aren't really sure what it takes to be successful and helps to filter out any bad info you may be getting. Feel free to comment or PM me with questions.

EDIT - 

This is by no means a list of requirements! Like I mentioned in the comments, this is a sort of ""best case scenario"" of what an undergrad engineering experience would be. I've combined and summarized everything I've learned from professors, advisors, and recruiters on what an outstanding undergraduate career is.

Thanks for reading, and best of luck!"
2jq31m,1,2014-10-19,"High school drop out, I found a job at a corporate environment. I'm missing out on college life, fuck me.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2jq31m/high_school_drop_out_i_found_a_job_at_a_corporate/,"For the past five years I'd work as a summer intern at this local company, and I'd always make a good impression. Since ""going to school"" was the criterion for the internship, they never asked whether I was a good student or not, and so they never found out I would always hang by a thread every year because of really bad grades. Well, last year was -the- last year and I failed most of the exams. Now in the autumn I failed most of the repeat-exams again.

I'm not getting through this, I've accepted it, and it kinda sucks, but I never cared for education anyway. The thing is, I was offered a job at the company, and a pretty nicely paying one too - it's mostly administrative stuff, and it's long hours and... well, less than ideal conditions (I'm getting an underground office, goodbye daylight), but the pay is way more than people my age (18) would ever hope for, all because of my past ""achievements"" at the company. I'm looking at a huge disposable income since my family doesn't mind me staying at home. I'm learning how to play the piano and I'm in fantastic physical shape.

I'm also a virgin, depressed, sad, angry and I feel like there is no need for it to be this difficult. Because, while I'm going to be getting huge (relatively speaking, of course) paychecks, I'll be missing out on college life. A few of my friends already are in awesome relationships, many of them are having daily sex with awesome girls (and boys, I guess), I keep getting told from my classmates what a shame it is and how much I would love college, how much more I'd enjoy it than high school, how much fun there is to be had.

And that kills me. This education system has stripped me of a life of fun. I wouldn't be miserable at my job, by no means. I don't regret a single thing that I did, I don't regret not doing all those stupid homeworks or listening to my retard teachers. Fuck all of that, I can't stand shoving information in me that I care nothing about, and I can stand maniacal adults with superiority complexes even less, but they're in control. They're in control and they love it and all is well with them, meanwhile fuck me - if I don't conform to the bullshit, I lose.

My days are filled with this emptiness - the realization that I'll be spending my life away from things that would enrich it so much, because of my inability to pass a simple (to 99% of the modern world) exam, and I keep getting told from fucking everybody that I'd be the best college dude. ""Duuude, you'd love it here"", ""Woah, the parties are so different to what we'd have in school, it's amazing!"", ""Aw man, there was an opening for a part time job for two people at this such-and-such place, we woulda killed it together!"". These are word for word (almost ;D) messages I keep getting on Facebook...

I hope I haven't offended anybody, I mean no disrespect to -your- teachers, I just feel like mine all hated me and I don't really know why. ""When you need to make a post for yourself, not necessarily for advice, or to answer questions, but to get it off your chest, we'll be here to listen"" is what it says in the side bar, please don't be cruel, I just want to tell somebody about this, even if it is just some internet strangers. I can't afford to let on that I feel this way to.. well, anybody, actually ;D

Fuck.."

How do I support her?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2jq3yq/i_got_an_intern_how_do_i_support_her/,"I work in the gaming industry, in a startup.  We got a few great candidates, but one young lady stood out.  She has a great resume, great attitude, and will be a great fit.  Even though there are only six people working at the company, the hiring of and managing of the intern was designated as my duty.  I am the marketing director, and she is interested in marketing, so it makes sense.

My company is in a shared space with about four other gaming companies.  When I was hired (less than 6 months ago) I was the third woman in the space, and my intern would be the fourth.  There are about 30 people working in the space.  The ladies don't really all talk to each other, we pretty much keep to ourselves and our work.

I want to make sure I do a good job of offering the support she needs, while giving her room to grow.  So, ladies who have had interns, any tips and tricks so I can do my best?"

I just got done with my second attempt at the GRE, and my scores are really starting to concern me. I have a 162 verbal and 162 quantitative. The rest of my application is fairly strong I believe.

Context:

- Strong LORs (including one from a leading researcher in my area of interest)

- Decent research (~7 publications with lead authorship)

- Some industry (internship at Microsoft, upcoming internship at Google)

- Decent GPA from state school (3.73)

I'm planning to apply to the top 5 CS grad schools for a PhD in Computer Science/Robotics.

Do you think I should invest the time and money to take the GRE again? I'm willing to take it a few more times if necessary, but there may be diminishing returns at this point. What do you think?"

I'm a college student, trying to find summer tech internships in Seattle so that my boyfriend and I can spend another summer together. 

But I haven't been getting any responses back, and I began to realize that I've been passed over despite all the work I put into trying to connect with recruiters at a job fair and such either because I'm not good enough or I'm a year younger than what they're looking for. 

A semester away is already tough enough, but a summer apart is even worse. So he and I came to the same conclusion last night that if we can't be together this summer, we might as well just end it for our own sake. 

But you know what? I don't want it to end that way. And even if he weren't my boyfriend, I at least want to stay friends with him, but that's a paradox. How can you stay friends with somebody you've liked so much for this long?

I've been trying my hardest shooting resumes to places that would work out for me. I'll keep my fingers crossed, but I don't feel hopeful at all. I think the saddest thing is that I've been dreaming about the day I move to Seattle ever since I began dating him about a year ago. Kinda sucks to see that crumble.

But what can I do now? I really don't know. I feel so lost and sad

My CS friends were getting summer internships but I didn't have enough time. I didn't really think anything of it though; once I was done with school I would just get a software engineering job like everyone else - maybe not at the big tech companies, but somewhere worthwhile.

But I failed to realize the enormous impact that an internship makes in terms of skill development and networking. Everyone I talk to in career fairs either has had at least one internship or is an underclassman looking for one. I went to a resume workshop, and the recruiter I talked to was visibly dismayed by my lack of experience. He said that beyond a small personal project I was working on (and class projects, some of which I'm not too excited to show off), I didn't really have any ""cards in play"".

So with that in mind, is it appropriate for me to search for a full-time software engineering job? Or should I search for something smaller-scale? Alternatively, would it make sense to apply for internships this late in my studies? (I'm set to graduate Spring 2015.) Or should I look for other ways to develop my skills?"

So I've been dating my boyfriend for a year. We met when we started working together and after about six months we started dating. From Sept until June we saw each other almost every day and were always sleeping over with each other. I went out of state in June for an internship and moved back to our home state in July, but since then due to family medical issues I am still living an hour away from him.

I'm finding that I'm not taking this whole long distance thing very well at all. We just cancelled plans to get together tonight and into tomorrow and I'm devastated. I am just so disapointed. 

Let me try to explain myself. It's not that I need to be with him every waking moment, it isn't that by any means. But when I fall asleep, I want him to be next to me. I want to wake up to him every morning and I can't stand feeling so alone while in a relationship.

He's a wonderful boyfriend. Neither of us are perfect but we don't fight, we talk things out when one of us gets our feelings hurt over something. Honestly we are best friends and I love him with all my heart. 

Moving in together is not an option right now. I just started a new full time job in the town I'm in and it's great and I can't give that up. Not just that but we haven't really sat down and really discussed this, even though both of us readily show interest in moving in together one day.

But right now I'm alone. 

I know so many other people are states or countries away and have it worse off than I do, but I can't relate to that because that is something I would never do. I never thought I would have moved away from the city we were both in together. 

I feel like my disapointed feelings are childish. I also feel like he deals with this so much better than me, like he can live without me while I'm here struggling with being lonely every night.

Tonight all I can think about is ending it because I just am not able to handle this and I can't imagine being apart from the one I love for a year or more. It's not fair to me, or him. But I keep thinking to myself ""You love him, do you throw it all away because of that?"" 

We don't have any issues other than the distance. :( "

Should I tell my employer to lower their expectations of me?,drizzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jqlai/im_a_new_cs_graduate_feeling_very_overwhelmed_and/,"Hello everyone,
 
I’m currently an new iOS dev with a top tier mobile shop in North America. I started about 6 weeks ago and have been deathly worried about my performance. Currently they have me on one project where I’m working with 2 other guys that work on the app from home. The first month was okay, as I was assigned pretty simple tasks that I could handle. However the last 2 weeks have been brutal. My project manager (one of the 2 guys) assigned me 2 issues that I’ve struggled with a ton. About a day or 2 into getting into them, I voiced my concern to him that I was pretty lost. He gave me a brief rundown of what “could” be going on, and then left me to figure out what was actually happening. So then over the next week and a bit, I went down a few routes that lead to no where, and chewed up a lot of time doing so.  

Then came the bombshell that freaked me out. One day I got into the office, I had a message from him telling me to “Pick up my pace” and that I should have both solutions done for by the afternoon. I ended up missing that deadline, submitting my buggy partial work and re-assigning the issues for him. This crushed me, as in both of my previous jobs as a dev intern I’ve never missed a deadline and was praised for my work. 

All of this being said, what do I do now? Should I tell my PM to lower his expectations of me (as I’m very new to this job, and no in-office mentor to go to)? Or should I keep quiet and keep struggling. I was thinking it might be a good idea to go the president (she was the one who interviewed and hired me) and explain my anxiety, but I don't know if that would help. 

I would love to hear what you guys think.

Thanks"

Hopefully it's not just me since I've heard it becomes harder to make friends once you graduate from college.

Realizing my current small group of friends are not really friends and fair weather friends which has me looking to make new friends.

Granted I'm a bit introverted and shy but it seems everyone's always working, running errands or tuned out to anyone not on their FB friends list but still when I go around I see people or groups of people out and about.

The thing is a lot of place aren't conducive to meeting new people. I do go to the same cafe every weekend but most other young people who are there alone are either zeroed in on laptops or occupied with something else and have a ""don't bother me"" aura they give off....

Work is always the obvious option but the majority of people at work are older than me. The few my age are summer interns.

There's Meetup which I've gone to and had a neutral experience with but many of the groups I'm a member of have switched over from being free to attend to costing money. I'm fine with low admittance fees but it starts to add up after a while. (Part of me thinks the money goes to paying part of the organizers rent) I have met a few good people when I went but I'll send them a message offering to hang out and don't get a response...

There's gay pickup sports leagues I've looked into but there's try outs and entrance fees. I'm just looking to meet like minded active people, aren't there any free gay sports leagues in this city?

I talked to my roommate about this and she says there's a lot of ""flaky losers"" who go to them and recommended I hang out at bars instead since after a drink people's defenses start coming down and they start opening up more. Not really sure going to bars is a way to make quality friends and she's had some bad Meetup experiences. Especially gay bars.

Feeling a bit frustrated since I know everyday there's people moving here who don't know anyone and we'd probably get along if I could just find them but they're scattered all over the city. "
2jqvd0,13,2014-10-19,I think my [28M] girlfriend [24f] of a year thinks of me as a temporary fling while she's working away from home?,edtownthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jqvd0/i_think_my_28m_girlfriend_24f_of_a_year_thinks_of/,"Pals, I'm in a bit of a shitty jam I think.

Background: We live in Edmonton which is a city in Alberta of a little under a million people. It's a prairie city built on oil so it's not, like, fancy or anything but it's, you know, a city. Employment is fantastic. Like... The Canadian equivalent of North Dakota but with legit cities. As such it attracts a lot of people who are young and can't get good jobs in their own cities.

Enter my girlfriend. She's from Toronto and went to McGill and ended up here for work because the only offers out east were more unpaid internships. She's a city girl.

We were introduced by a friend of mine who works with her. Their company has an unofficial policy to try and throw newbies into the scene here to help get them established, make friends, make ties, whatever because they want them to stay (retention is hard - people get experience and then want to peace back to where they come from).

I met her and it was instant for me. Cupid - bam. Love. She's smart, she's funny, she's sexy. And physically it's good. The sex is fantastic.

She had a boyfriend (of 3 years) living in Montreal but after two months of long distance they split because long distance was too hard. I admit I kind of positioned myself strategically to benefit from that. And eventually she agreed to go out on a date with me. And then another. And now 13 months later we're still together.

But she's kind of resistant to upping our commitment level. And she's really resistant to adopting to local life. 

Like. Really resistant. 

I own a townhouse. It's on the southside of the river (city is cut in two by the North Saskatchewan river) in the sprawl-y section and it is I guess kind of suburban. She won't stay overnight at mine. 

It is about about a fifty minute commute via transit from my place to her office and only 10 minutes from hers walking and 2 by bus. I'd drop her off at work but I have to go in the opposite direction and I have to be out earlier than she does. It would only be about a 20 minute drive for her but here's the other factor: she doesn't own a car. And doesn't want one.

I admit I don't get it. Edmonton's the kind of place where essentially five kinds of people take public transit: the elderly who've had their licenses revoked, kids, people with DUIs, the homeless, and people who moved here from Vancouver or out east and either aren't committed to staying or just haven't got one yet.

We had a fight about it last night. I told her I found it really annoying to have to pick her up and drive her everywhere and she said I didn't have to. She got around town fine before we started dating and she's fine getting around now.

I asked her why she wouldn't get a car (she is fully licensed btw) and she said she didn't want one. She's not too nervous to drive - she drives my truck sometimes if I have some beers while we're out. So why won't she just get a goddamned car. She says they're expensive - insurance, gas, parking, purchasing. Yeah, it's expensive at the start but if you get a decent used car it's not that pricy and you drive it for years. 

She makes decent enough money that she can afford it. If she's having trouble saving up for one I told her she could move in with me. She lives downtown and pays downtown rent. She has a 1 bdroom for 1.1k/month. Obviously not rent free but I figured something like 300-400$/month. With those savings she could afford a pretty decent car in no time.

She says, you know, she doesn't want to live outside the downtown area. She likes being close to work, she likes being close to bars and restaurants and stores and stuff. I wouldn't pretend to get it - I think living downtown is pretty shitty. You get ripped off, you live in an *apartment* and it's loud.

And then she dropped the bombshell that she just doesn't want to spend the money on *something she won't need when* **she** *moves back to Montreal or Toronto*.

I was a bit stunned. I know she loves those cities - we went to visit them this summer because her brother was getting married and she was excited to see her friends again so we hit up both and it definitely brought out a different side of her. She was ... like herself but more. If that makes sense. I'm shitty with words.

But I didn't know it was her long-term goal to move back there.

She said it was money she was saving to move back there once she's got her 3 years experience to be competitive there and it will help soften the blow when she probably has to accept a pay cut (??????!! WHO DOES THAT?!) and it will help her save for a downpayment on a condo (have you SEEN the prices of those condos?! AI!)

It's really hard for me to know what to do. Because I love this woman but I don't know if she sees what we have as a long term thing.

I'd have trouble going with her. I own my house here. I have a great job. It's not really transferrable and the industry I work in doesn't really have a strong presence in either of those cities. But also I don't know that I'd want to live there anyway. Visiting was interesting but I won't lie and say it made me want to live there. They're incredibly expensive. And cramped.

I don't know what I should do. I don't know if I should try and show her what a great place it is to live here and what a wonderful place it would be to settle and raise a family. Or if I should try and free myself up to go with. Or if I should just let this one go (NOT REALLY A FAN OF THIS OPTION). I realized last night she doesn't think of our relationship in the same way I do - I really think she's content to think of me as the guy who she was dating to pass away the horrible time she had to live in *Alberta*. I'm not sure how to change her perception or even if I should?

---   
**tl;dr**: realized in a fight last night over my girlfriend refusing to get a car that she's planning on moving back east about 18 months from now and I'm a bit bewildered over what to do about that revelation"

Throughout college I have been extremely career oriented, I've worked very hard and my social life has taken a toll. I have also experienced a lot through multiple trips abroad and internships. Because of this I feel I am more mature than a lot of my peers (I am not trying to sound conceited). I am also extremely independent, I have been on my own so much throughout the last 6 years that I have no issue doing everything on my own, even though I enjoy spending time with people.

In the past I've struggled with self-confidence, but I have been working on it for about a year and I am at a point where I am confident, happy with who I am and who I want to be and enjoying life. I've also been the nice guy and I am learning how to treat people right without them walking all over you.

That said, I am looking for a relationship. I want intimacy, I feel like everyone my age is all physical. I have a strong religious background, so I constantly struggle with this. I've messed around with a few girls, nothing serious, but I feel like my religion is always nagging at my conscience when it comes to getting physical which I also want in a relationship.

High school was easy for me, I got attention from girls, had fun hanging out with them and went on dates. But then whenever I got close with a girl and we both acknowledged liking each other, I freaked out and that was pretty much the end of it. 

I haven't had anything serious with a girl in college, my engineering major surrounds me by dudes all day everyday. I don't even interact with girls on a daily basis, it is terrible. I think I have some anxiety because I don't have much experience dating, kissing, and getting physical and I feel like at this point everyone is way ahead of me.

I have a few questions below, please help me understand how this all works. Yeah it is a bit ridiculous that I am 22 and struggling with this, but I am trying to make myself a better person. 

1. I have been out of the game for so long, how do I start dating again when at this  age everything is so different?

2. How does modern dating work? I am not looking for hookups, I want to have fun dating people and if something serious comes up then that's great.

3. I travel a ton, previously for school, in the future for work. How can I make this work out in a relationship?

4. I am looking for someone who is driven, seeking to be a better person daily, lives an active lifestyle, and is a christian. Where do I look to find this girl?

5.  What is the deal with opening up emotionally? I always hear that girls want you to open up to them and tell you what you are feeling rather than keeping it to yourself. But, this is contradictory to traditional gender roles, men are not supposed to show weakness. How do you balance this?

TLDR; High school dating was easy, I haven't dated or interacted much with girls in college. I am confident, happy with who I am and moving in a positive direction in life, but I am looking for a relationship and I am so far out of the loop on dating and game. Help me understand how this all works.

2jr0uz,40,2014-10-19,Still looking for a development job 6 months after school and getting killed by structures and algorithms among other things,upshaw87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jr0uz/still_looking_for_a_development_job_6_months/,"So I graduated from computer engineering back in April and I'm having a hell of a time finding a junior developer position. It's not like I'm not getting any interest from the applications I send in. I wouldn't say I have a crazy amount of callbacks, but, unless job postings slow down, I can get at least a couple calls a week usually. And the stereotypical HR or ""getting to know you"" interview is usually something I can get through pretty easily as well. 

The things that always trip me up are the technical interviews, specifically data structures and algorithms. To put this in context, I only took one class for those in my entire degree and never really touched them ever again in any other class or my internship. I don't know how if it's similar for software engineering or computer science majors, but I don't feel like I know a whole lot in that area. I can be presented with a problem that is probably pretty basic, but it will take me forever to find a solution if I ever do.

For instance, in one interview I was asked to check the number of unique characters in a string without using any other structures. I came up with an initial solution in short enough time but then realized that it wouldn't work. Took me another 5 to 10 minutes to realize the actual solution. I got to it myself, but it still took me way too long. On top of that I completely borked the other producer-consumer question.

In another interview I was asked to do a code review on a C# class that essentially searched through a bunch of text files for occurrences of a certain string. The code they gave me searched every single file character by character for matches to the input. While it would work, it's obviously woefully inefficient as the amount of data increases. They asked me to suggest some optimizations though and I had no idea beyond ""you may not need to search the entire file"". There was another question where I coded a search algorithm, they again asked for optimization suggestions and I again had very few suggestions when I should have. After the interview I tried thinking more about the optimizations and came up with way better answers, but that doesn't really matter because I couldn't do it in the moment. I ended up getting called in for a face to face interview with that company this week so I must have done something right, but it's still bothering me a lot and leaving me nervous that I'm going to get hammered in what's going to be a 2-3 hour interview.

In the last two weeks or so I've really started working through some Project Euler and Cracking the Coding Interview problems when I finally realized this was a huge problem. I'm not sure that it's enough though. I feel like I've got these huge holes in my knowledge and where there aren't holes there's rust or inexperience. With CTCI, for instance, I'm currently stuck on binary trees. I've used BSTs before, but it's been almost two years and I have to do a lot of refreshing. We never even touched Red-Black, AVL etc. though, so I haven't a clue about them. I'm not bad with worst case time complexity of algorithms, but average case just eludes me because we never really practised it. Those are just a few examples.

I'm not trying to say that I don't know anything about programming at all because I'm well aware that I do. It's just that when I look at other people they generally seem way more competent than me. The worst part is that there is a certain amount of truth to that and I don't know how much. I have no idea if I'm actually a terrible developer given my lack of knowledge in certain areas or not and if I'm fucked for finding a decent job in this industry.

Throughout college I have been extremely career oriented, I've worked very hard and my social life has taken a toll. I have also experienced a lot through multiple trips abroad and internships. Because of this I feel I am more mature than a lot of my peers (I am not trying to sound conceited). I am also extremely independent, I have been on my own so much throughout the last 6 years that I have no issue doing everything on my own, even though I enjoy spending time with people.

In the past I've struggled with self-confidence, but I have been working on it for about a year and I am at a point where I am confident, happy with who I am and who I want to be and enjoying life. I've also been the nice guy and I am learning how to treat people right without them walking all over you.

That said, I am looking for a relationship. I want intimacy, I feel like everyone my age is all physical. I have a strong religious background, so I constantly struggle with this. I've messed around with a few girls, nothing serious, but I feel like my religion is always nagging at my conscience when it comes to getting physical which I also want in a relationship.

High school was easy for me, I got attention from girls, had fun hanging out with them and went on dates. But then whenever I got close with a girl and we both acknowledged liking each other, I freaked out and that was pretty much the end of it. 

I haven't had anything serious with a girl in college, my engineering major surrounds me by dudes all day everyday. I don't even interact with girls on a daily basis, it is terrible. I think I have some anxiety because I don't have much experience dating, kissing, and getting physical and I feel like at this point everyone is way ahead of me.

I have a few questions below, please help me understand how this all works. Yeah it is a bit ridiculous that I am 22 and struggling with this, but I am trying to make myself a better person. 

1. I have been out of the game for so long, how do I start dating again when at this  age everything is so different?

2. How does modern dating work? I am not looking for hookups, I want to have fun dating people and if something serious comes up then that's great.

3. I travel a ton, previously for school, in the future for work. How can I make this work out in a relationship?

4. I am looking for someone who is driven, seeking to be a better person daily, lives an active lifestyle, and is a christian. Where do I look to find this girl?

5.  What is the deal with opening up emotionally? I always hear that girls want you to open up to them and tell you what you are feeling rather than keeping it to yourself. But, this is contradictory to traditional gender roles, men are not supposed to show weakness. How do you balance this?


TLDR; High school dating was easy, I haven't dated or interacted much with girls in college. I am confident, happy with who I am and moving in a positive direction in life, but I am looking for a relationship and I am so far out of the loop on dating and game. Help me understand how this all works."

How do I deal without it? I've gone to bars/dancing/get togethers and stayed sober and it sucks.

I really liked them, they were awesome and I got invited to come back. My only issue is that I was a Test intern last year, and I would like to have a chance to explore the Dev side of things. I applied to a Dev position online, and survived the initial screen. But now I have to wait, because they aren't doing interviews yet.

Enter Company B, which I am currently in the middle of one interview process with. I got invited to another round of interviews with Company B, assumedly for a different position. Company B is a big, popular company and their screening process takes forever. Interview is for non-Test position.

Company C, cool company as well. I also appear to be caught in a lengthy interview process. Interview is for non-test position.

Here's the catch, my original return offer to Company A lasts until November, at which time I need to reply. I like Company A the most, I'm just really afraid of the saying ""Once in Test, always in Test"" and I don't want to box myself into that role before even entering the industry full time.

What's my plan of action here? Bother Company A, again? Bother Company B and C and tell them to move faster? I am so lost, and ultimately want to just do what will give me the most versatility in the future."
2jrf3c,22,2014-10-20,Is it typical for small startups to only hire new grads and students and not have a single senior dev or architect?,deadeyedcat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jrf3c/is_it_typical_for_small_startups_to_only_hire_new/,"I got a full-time junior developer position right out of school at a small startup, and when I started I was only the second developer there. I've been working here for a little over three months now. (Prior to this I'd only had one three-month internship during college.) Before I came along, the other junior dev was tasked with pretty much everything and had to work with a codebase that was written by another junior employee who, it turns out, had quit not too long ago. And recently our boss hired two new devs, one of whom is still in college and the other with less than a year of schooling and maybe the same amount of experience time.

The project we're working on is poorly documented and architected, which drives me NUTS, and every time this comes up in meetings the boss kind of just dismisses our concerns and says we'll refactor stuff later. Of course the priority is to get the app out the door as soon as possible, and I get that, but I feel like not addressing maintainability issues while we're already aware of them is gonna backfire on us later. 

My main concern is that I don't feel like this is the best environment for me to get better as a developer. I don't have much confidence in the boss or in the product and it's kind of worrying me. Our boss/project manager works on something totally different and outright admits he doesn't really know how to help whenever we come to him with a problem. The developers I work with aren't that much better either--I mean, most of us are relatively inexperienced, and one of them tends to code solo without any regard for how his features are going to get integrated into the app, i.e. his code isn't modular or even readable at times. And he works so fast that he just goes from feature to feature without any review because the rest of us are too busy with our own work.

Wouldn't the boss benefit from hiring someone more experienced to sort of rein everybody in and guide the project, since he himself doesn't really know anything about the stack we work with? Right now it feels like the blind leading the blind and it's a total motivation killer. Is this actually normal for small companies? What's the best thing to do in this situation?"

* Country of purchase: Canada
 
* Budget range: 1000$, give-or-take $150
 
* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming and university. I do programming as well as things like AutoCAD and Blender on the side, but nothing too intensive. 
 
* Screen size preference: 15.6''
 
* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows 7 preferrably, but I can live with 8/8.1, really doesn't matter
 
* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Skyrim at least 30 FPS or above, Minecraft (heavily modded) at 60 FPS or higher, + shaders at 45 or above. League/DOTA/SC2 at 60+ FPS.
 
* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): None worth noting.
 
* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): 
 
* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): Already mentioned: Lenovo and ASUS.
 
* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): No particulars.
 
* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)
 
* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Balanced
 
* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build Quality
 
* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Balanced, unless high performance can be met with tolerable heat.

On one hand, I'm very enticed by the specs and design of the Y50, and ESPECIALLY its reported cool temperature even when gaming. However, I've heard nothing but horror stories about its apparently piss-poor non-IPS display. Is it truly that bad, such that I'd have to shell out an extra 90$ for an IPS display? Or are there newer Y50 builds with IPS screens?

On the other hand, the ASUS one has a whopping 16GB of RAM (not like I'll ever use all that much), and a better screen. However, it is reported to be rather uncomfortably warm while gaming. I don't always have access to a desk (long trips to internships and back, as well as habit), so I usually work on my laptop upon my lap, on a train or bus. Is the heat intolerable, by anyone's experience, or can it be ignored for the most part?

2jrnfb,1,2014-10-20,I'm planning it.,justathrowaway90890,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2jrnfb/im_planning_it/,"I feel like my life is empty ... everyday all the time. Since I was young, It was very hard to make friends, because I was bullied and made fun of at a young age. So naturally, that kind of made it hard for me to trust people, or connect with them somehow, at least. So growing up, not so many friends. I'm 23, and have none. none ... and I'm over it. I have put myself out there. I have called people who I've worked with and tried to set up times to hang out. No one calls back, no one texts me, nothing. This has happened for years. I've just accepted that I'm somehow meant to be a lonely person. That naturally, I've got some sort of essence that subconsciously tells others to not hang out with me. 
Next, my ex-boyfriend is toying with me again. We broke up over a year and a half ago, and he contacts me every couple months to say hi. We end up talking for a week on average before I come to my senses and tell him to go away forever again. He doesn't though. And it hurts every time because he just wants to talk. Just talk. And it's like- I'm not here to be your friend. I wanted to be your GF, but you proved way too irresponsible and didn't have the same priorities as I did. He's 8 years older than me, and still lives at home. You read correct. Some parts more than other parts of me want to be with him still, and it kills me inside. Because despite his extreme short comings- he's the only person I've ever gotten along with so well, who can make me laugh, and who can actually want to ' hang out ' with me. I kind of adore hearing about his day and care about whats going on in his life. Does he for me ... I'm not sure. Sometimes I barely get a word in before he cuts me off to make a joke. I'm making him sound like some pathetic jerk- which he can be sometimes. 
Next, after four years with my ex, I broke it off for good ( we broke up once in between those four years for 4 months ), and moved away to go to school to pursue a field I want to work in. I've finished school and too totally complete it, I must do an internship. I moved again to another city, and it's been 3 months since I moved and I still have not found an internship. This worries me greatly. If I don't find an internship soon and complete my hours, I can kiss my degree goodbye. School was expensive, and I've struggled in school for years, but I worked hard and got through the school work and tests and proficiencies and presentations and blah blah blah. Should I have moved to this city? I don't know anymore...There is work - but it's tough to burst into. Only because it's professional city, where they want the best of the best. Not some out of school intern. 
Next, I'm rooming with 3 other girls in a house. I had my own apartment before - which I was grateful for having - but I'm not adjusting well to having to share a room with one of them. The three of them share the same religion, and I'm the odd one out, they don't know that of course. The one I share the room with is the overly extremist religious girl. Everything is about church, "" Heavenly Father"", and all her friends that are also overly religious. I. can't. stand. it. Lately I have just been ignoring her all together- which yes- makes it a bit awkward but I don't care anymore. She runs her mouth like she's on speed. And it's all about her of course. It all goes back to her and God and blah blah blah. GAH.... So I'm having a very hard time adjusting. 
Next... Guys are always complaining about how they can't get a girl. Well ... I can't seem to get a guy. I have never been asked out, never been told I'm pretty or attractive, and I barely get glanced at. It. Sucks. I want to be with some one I can hold, and make happy, and have deep conversations about life, and share passion. I crave it. It makes me sad- because I feel like- who wants me...?
Theres more to it though. 
Next, about a year ago I got diagnosed with a well known disease. I won't say what it is, but there is no cure for it, and basically, the quality of my life is just slowly deteriorating. I have not fully accepted this and am still in huge denial. I have to remind myself that I have this disease if I have a symptom occur. It goes back to finding a partner... who wants someone who has a disease that eventually will over come them? No one wants that.
I have no friends and have a very hard time making them if I ever do. I still love my ex, but know he's not good for me, and yet my emotions still get in the way of wanting him back ( even to the point of considering moving back to my home town to reconcile with him), internship is rough...I have not found one yet and am getting worried school might just buckle for me, and I have no one to love... and a disease that I shouldn't have to deal with.

All this sound temporary except for a few things I know, but I don't know how much longer I can take of it. My life is so empty... there is no fun or joy in any activity that I do. Even if I get motivated to do something, after a while I just stop caring about it and ditch it. Like... there is no point almost. No matter what I do... I'm still sad, unhappy, gloomy... And it's been like this at least since I was 15. I've been to therapists and psychologists, I've gotten ""help"" ( AKA been on pills and talked to therapists before eventually dipping out because they weren't really helping me). I hate to sound like nothing is good enough for me, but that's basically what it's coming out to be like. And it's not that at all ... I just want purpose. And I've been searching for it for years now.

I'm planning on driving out to the ocean and taking my gun. And if you read all that... thank you... "

I'm actually a student in IT security &amp; administration, and I have to achieve a big project for the end of the year.

This project involve building from scratch the whole network of a university, which means - among others - to determine the adressing plan for the campus and his remote sites.

My team is facing an intern schism, and we all have a different opinion on the subject. 
Actually, we have multiple equipments to adress, here is the non exhaustive list :

- PC (installed in classrooms for example)
- BYOD PC (brought by teachers for example)
- Printers
- TOIP terminals 
- Servers
- Wi-Fi hotspots
- Management network (for switch &amp; routers)
- Security equipments (fingerprint access reader, security cam...)

So as you can see, our question is, what is the best way to determine our adressing plan? 

If we take a /8 for example ;

10.0.0.0

The second octet would be for the localization of the equipment, the third would be for the type of the equipment ?

Or should we use a more generalist adressing plan, without localization distinction ?

In terms of sizing, we aim for a total of 5k students/teachers on site, which mean we will have to think about the future and the growth of the campus...

We just wanted to have your point of view on the topic, and if already of you have already been concerned by this kind of problematic. 

Thanks !

TLDR; We need a professionnal point of view on a school project topic"

**''Hey Phil can I get a picture please''?** and he smirked and totally ignored me looking around like he was spacing the hell out. I didn't say anything else so he didn't think I was a crazy fan but dude has punk always been like this in public? It seems like hes got a stick up his ass and doesn't even want to acknowledge his fans that spent lots of money to get him super famous and rich. But at the same time I understand because I am sure he is totally sick and tired of always having people wanting photos with him and talk to him and asking him about coming back to WWE. I wasn't going to ask him that but still he should've at least said hi or sorry not.

* My GPA hasn't been great. India uses a percentage system so I have a 60% over the past 3 years. Problem is I have to re-appear for the finals of both my Microprocessors and Advanced Microprocessors classes. **Edit: For reference, the highest percentage (for the class of 2015) is 75%.**


My explanation for my GPA is that the entire curriculum here is based on rote memorization. I don't know how this comes across as but I feel rather strongly about this. It doesn't feel like anybody is ever actually learning anything.


* I've been conducting various workshops and seminars in college over the past 1.5 years. Webdev basics, Basics of Game AI, Introduction to Git etc. Does this add to my application significantly?


* I expect to get good recommendation letters from my college professors. One of the professors whom I've approached expressed his surprise that I hadn't been doing well in my exams because he considered me to be one of the best students in his class. But he's still more than happy to write a letter for me.

* There's some other stuff that I have. Personal projects, project head for a CS committee. Participated in a bunch of hackathons, managed to secure a college-high rank (300 globally, previous best was 650) just this past weekend. A remote internship.

---------------------------------


**TL;DR:** 327 GRE, academics aren't great (according to the Indian grading system), teaching experience, a bunch of personal projects, hackathons participation. Can manage funding by myself. Chances?


---------------------------------

Questions:

1) Should I mention the reason for my poor GPA in my statement of purpose?


2) Should I email any professors from universities that I plan on applying to? Does this benefit my application?

---------------------------------

**Edit 2:** Read previous posts about this but we use a different system here (the highest anybody has ever gotten in the grading system's history is probably an 80%) so I don't know how to judge those posts."

Thank you so much for reading.

Well, everyone, this is a throwaway, because I rarely felt that embarassed with myself. 


Let me tell you a short story short:

For the last four nights I went to the Alkaline Trio Past Live shows in Chicago. They’ve been my favorite band for a long time, I always wanted to see Chicago and I saved up quiet some money over the summer, so I flew over here from Germany. 

Until yesterday everything was fine. 

Chicago is a great city. I love the wind and the general freshness that seems to be everywhere. I am actually thinking about doing an internship, maybe even a part of my residency here and my stay motivated me to do the American Medical Boards as well as the german ones. 
And the concerts were just awesome, I’ve seen Alkaline Trio twice before, but their play was never as good it was during the last four nights. 

----

So far so good. 



Yesterday after the last concert, I felt really happy and even though that is typically not my style, I wanted a photo of myself with at least one member of the band to make this memory more real. So I waited in front of the concert hall for them to come out. I already felt kind of ridiculous doing this. My presence there is not going to change anything about their lives and if I was famous I’d be creeped out by strangers that wanted to get close to me. 
But I figured that it was okay to wait because it was a once-in-a-lifetime-night and that I might be happy about having a memory photo later.

After more than one hour in the cold, two of the three band members (Dan Andriano and Matt Skiba) came out and started to take photos with the  fans. I already felt pretty ridiculous and stupid, so I waited, didn’t really say anything to them, besides mumbling to myself that I do not have friends and took my photos 

-	well sort of. 

------

When I was standing next to Mr. Skiba, I started to feel funny. All of a sudden I became aware of his body next to mine. Not in a I-am-standing-next-to-someone-way, but in a there-is-a-big-MALE-body-close-to-your-small-female-body-way.  A tension built up inside of me, there was music in my head, a heartbeat in my thighs and my bowels kind of danced.  
I don’t really remember how but the person who took the photo gave me my phone back and I said thank you. 


I put my phone in my pocket and looked up. 


Mr. Skiba still stood next to me and I stared directly into his eyes. I must have looked as if I was thunderstruck or maybe my face was not readible at all. I feel like a complete idiot writing this, but I actually felt like I didn’t look into his eyes, but instead stumbled right through them. 
I couldn’t even smile, I couldn’t react.


I stepped away. 
Feeling completely naked, childish and stupid.


I took my photo with Dan and then left. I talked to people on the way home, I made jokes and I laughed, but there was a hurricane going on inside of me.

----

Back at the hostel I couldn’t sleep and tried to look up stuff about Mr. Skiba that would make him appear smaller, more human, less admirable. I hoped that I would find out that he was 20 years older than me or tortured animals in his free time or was just stupid. Too bad I didn’t find anything. I found a history of substance abuse and psychiatric problems. I do not romanticize drugs, I am a med student and I work in a methadone clinic part time, still my findings only nurtured my helping syndrome and my heroine (read as hero not as the drug) fantasies.


I’ve had crushs on people before. I am a pretty distanced person, but I know how it is to fall for someone. 
Usually I just talk to the people I like and after a few seconds they do not appear as supergreat anymore. I am confident with what I have in my life. In fact, I like what I study and do so much, that I sometimes feel kind of indestructible, because I have this one big thing in my life that I love and that I am good at. If I have a crush one someone and he does not like me back it wouldn’t fit anyway. It might hurt for a few moments but I really do believe that if you really get each other, you will be crazy about each other. Easy as that.

But now? What am I supposed to do? I cannot talk to Mr. Skiba, I cannot just start to see him differently again, I am lost. I feel so ridiculous, so small and stupid. What does one do in such a situation? 

I wish I could just meet him, I guess I would need five minutes to stop my crush (or to totally fascinate him, so the crush would be mutual (at least this is what my stupid head tells me), but let’s be honest that would not happen anyway.)

Does anyone have any idea how I can handle this? I am used to obsessing about my studying, about my dissertation, about a good story, about ideas, but not about people, not as headless as I am right now. Help me. Please.

Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: Yesterday I crushed on a famous person. My usual uncrush methods are not available. I have never done this before. I am feeling stupid, really really stupid. Help me.

Please let me know if I chose the wrong sub.  I wasn't sure and thought this would give me the best luck.  

I am heading in for an interview on Friday to a Distribution Center for a transportation and logistics company.  This is my second and last interview with them.  I'm a new Supply Chain major, so i'm not very well versed on it and i've never had a Supply Chain internship prior to this (it isn't expected). 
I was told that the interview would consist of a site tour and operations tour, where I would learn about how the center is operated.  It will last roughly 3 hours, including lunch.  I understand that I should be able to develop questions to ask during the interview, but I was wondering if anyone had some questions that I could develop beforehand that I could ask during the interview?

I'm just worried that I am not going to be able to generate questions fast enough during the interview/tour and that i'm going to struggle.  

To sum it up:
 - Interview at a distribution center
 - Inexperienced Supply Chain major
 - Interview is ~3 hours and consists of a DC tour and operations tour
 - what questions should I ask?

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!  "
2jt3nf,3,2014-10-20,Confused about ex [M22] behaviour [me F22],throwaway28ogram,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jt3nf/confused_about_ex_m22_behaviour_me_f22/,"Backstory: R/S lasted 2 years, broke up in August, ~8 weeks of no contact. 
Reason of breakup: healthy and mutual, the months leading up to the breakup were lacking in quality and we decided that we wanted space to do our own thing. On his end, he wanted to spend more time with his friends and his hobbies. During the r/s I felt uncomfortable that he wanted to maintain close friendships with his exes (especially ""B"", who basically took it upon herself to be the third person in our relationship). During our relationship, for my sake he kept his friendship with B as superficial as he could, but constantly resented me for having to do that, and all of our major fights centered around this sacrifice. Finally, the state of our r/s got to a point where he favored his friendships and his exes (especially B) over our r/s, which I accepted - at that point - I gave up and thought constantly fighting about B wasn't worth trying anymore. I feel satisfied with the decision, in the n/c period I have done my own thing, tried my best to get over it, have busied myself as a full time student (and intern!) AND am currently casually dating other people. I really have had no time to mull/worry about him :)

Issue: A few days ago he called me to apologize for being a ""jackass"" (he wasn't, we had both agreed and committed to no contact, and I was quite happy). He felt remorseful for not being in my life anymore, and told me about how much he missed me and how lonely he was. He said he had ""traded one void for another"". He told me that ""the thought of me with someone else keeps him up at night"" and was curious about if I started moving on yet. I very politely but directly told him that the latter was none of his business (truth is I have, but I don't want to hurt his feelings because I know he hasn't yet - he's not the casual dating type). Throughout the conversation (and the texting that ensued after) he would lightly flirt with me (at some points he would revert to how he was back when we were dating) and at every single instance I did my best to deflect it. Finally it got to the point where I had to say ""sounds like you're still into me"", and he said he wasn't - yet his refusal does not reflect his behavior at all. 

The kicker: He told me that he had been talking to B frequently since we broke up, deepening his friendship with her. Initially, I thought this was great, and was feeling justified about our breakup and happy that I had made the right decision. 
Then he told me that she has apparently been trying to convince him to talk to me and to get back together with me this whole time, and that he told her that I had an issue with his friendship with her. Though I know at this point I am not entitled to be, this really pissed me off because of the obvious lack of loyalty towards me. I expressed frustration at him for telling me this in the first place (though I know that's not what he intended, it almost seemed like he was rubbing it in my face/baiting me) and told him that our relationship is none of her business, and that I'm not even sure why he is contacting me if he's over me. 

Of course, given that it was the reason of our breakup, I'm hurt that he instantly runs to B and just spills everything to her, then comes back to me and spills everything back. This is nonsensical. He obviously wants to have us both in his life, which I am not really ready for.

Later on he apologized for telling B about the reasoning behind our breakup and he admitted that it wasn't his place to do that.

This whole conversation was strange and I am trying to make sense of it

- He is acting really melancholy and overdramatic (not like him at all!) He says he wants ""something to remember me by"" - I asked him for clarification (like what did want, a gift?) and he said he just wanted a token of our relationship - wtf I don't get it at ALL.
- He would go on and on about how much he misses me and how unsure he is of finding a new person, how he doesn't think he will ever find someone who understood him like I did etc - nothing I say will convince him that YES, he can and will move on.
- He tells me about how he can't sleep at night because he sees fog and clouds in his brain and that has been going on for ""roughly 8 weeks now"" 
- He tells me he is constantly questioning himself if breaking up was the right thing
- After telling him that he should go for B, he then tells me that he friend-zoned B a while ago and he doesn't even see her that way, and that it's always been myself that has affected him profoundly/no one knows him/understands him like I do

Clearly, he is confused. I feel that he does have residual feelings for me but does not know how to deal with them. I am concerned about him, and I am concerned that overthinking this will send my mind into overdrive (I was doing fine until he called me! Now of course I keep replaying this conversation in my head and wondering what is going to happen next!) 

What do I say to him/How should I behave towards him?/How do I conduct myself?

2jtcec,1,2014-10-20,Kid on my Facebook posted this,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2jtcec/kid_on_my_facebook_posted_this/,"The original intention of creating a new Facebook page was to re-brandish my social media image, to remove all those undesirable, raw moments that compose so much of myself lately. One thing I've never been able to be is inauthentic. I wish I could be at times, it would be convenient. There's a vulnerability and a weakness that is constantly apparent when one is truly their self. It's why most people remain hidden, almost all of the time. Myself,  I am eagerly and openly myself at almost every moment, helplessly so. I've learned to embrace it, but when the darker parts of you become deeper than the desirable parts, it's no longer something you wish to broadcast. 

It was a prolonged moment of naivety to believe just by wiping the slate clean, developing another Facebook profile, and taking a prolonged break from social media, when I got back to it, I still wouldn't run into the same problem. I'm going to be myself on here, I can't be anyone else.  Still, I don't wish for it to become apparent, or the constant cryptic theme of my posts in this profile, so I'm going to spell it out here, in explicit detail. And maybe, I can keep these demons caged here, as my public persona makes a positive shift.

----
There are moments I just want to call bullshit on the entire thing.

More than that, I feel it's an obligation. 

It's what I did initially. When my therapist, turned to me, gave me one of her 3-seconds-too-long glares, and said slowly, but perhaps a touch too loudly, ""I think you may be suffering from depression.""

Immediately I spat back ""I don't have depression.""

But God, I knew, somewhere in the back of my head, that I would take that diagnosis and run. I always loved being dramatic.

I needed some reason why, all of a sudden, I couldn't even hold onto a part-time job. Why I fell off the ladder at my job so fast, it hardly seemed I climbed it to begin with. Why I was now sleeping 14 hours a day. Why I was abusing drugs every night. Why I no longer gave a shit. 

There was something indefinably off. It seemed that way.  When days weren't grey and monotonous, they were oppressively heavy. I wasn't sad, that's why I never identified it with depression. I was burdened, by something that wasn't quite reachable.

I couldn't quite put a finger on when that feeling started. I think it was about two springtime's ago, working a long day in the office, a friend asked me how I was doing.

""You know the kind of tired that sleep doesn't fix?"", I said. 

He nodded.  I thought it was that I had 12 articles that week, with a number of term papers, and an exam to study for.  Every week had looked like that for months at that point. All I needed was a break. 

But, here I was, absolutely ignoring all my classes, working on absolutely zero articles, and I was more tired than ever.

Or perhaps it was that summer, where an internship which started off as something so exciting and profound, turned into something I no longer even cared about. I blamed it on all the hick summer festivals I had to cover. But that wasn't it. I knew that.  It would change when I got back to the school newspaper, I thought. I would have the freedom to focus on material that interested me.

But nothing changed there, either. 

So depression worked. Depression was a dandy diagnosis. I wasn't completely weak. I could at least be some kind of martyr.  That was something at least.  If not dignity, than pity. 

After all, if I wasn't depressed and I was just making it all up, than I'm still fucked in the head anyway, aren't I?

----
LSA, a precursor to LSD, is a peculiar psychedelic. A catalyst for extremely introverted deep thought, it has few visuals, is only occasionally euphoric and is also accompanied by an unavoidable deep surge of nausea. 

I was on my knees, violently heaving. Think of it like a purging process, drug gurus often urged. Bullshit like that only worked half the time. Other times you're wondering why escaping reality was worth 30 minutes in front of your apartment's toilet. A voice rang out behind me.

""It's going to get worse before it gets better, but you'll be ok.""

""How much worse can it get,"" I replied aloud.

A month later, a two-year relationship I was in ended. She was the most important person in my life.  I should have seen it coming. In fact, I think I did.  It was sitting right behind me, as I puked my guts out.

---

It got better before it got worse, too.

Tillman (the therapist) gave me one of her hard incredulous glances, and said ""Why are you being so hard on yourself.""

In all seven of her appointments, it was the most helpful thing she said.  It was okay I was depressed. It was okay I lost my job. That I was failing school. That I had formed a drug habit. What would have happened if I didn't form a drug habit? Left to my own devices to cope with a realities I might not have had the tools to cope with.  It took me an entire semester to accept that I had something like depression. It got better after that. This was a part of life. For some reason, I'm going through things I needed to go through.  Good days came more often, bad days came less. Things weren't as desperate.

I sent my parents an email a week and a half later explaining why my grades looked like they did. I had depression, I told them. I got into drugs. I told them that also.  But, I broke out of the depression, I was doing better. I was doing alright, I was healed. I was doing better, that was truth. But breaking out of my depression? Well, white lies have there place.

----

It wasn't every day now. It was more sporadic. Maybe once a week, twice a week, or only three times a month. But there were still nights.

I'm drunk off lukewarm cheap vodka, because if not that, than it's a drug that's harder. The kitchen knife is in my hand. The edge is on my skin. I can see it make white lines against the palm of my hand, reacting subtly to every line. If I press hard enough I'll bleed. If I press hard enough, it'll cut through. It'd just be a gash, I could wrap it up tomorrow. It'd be an accident. I just needed something tonight. Something. Something. 

I could never apply enough pressure to break the skin. I always was a coward.

----

""Broken heart"" was a cliche until she broke up with me. To be clear, breaking up would imply that some kind of process took place. That didn't happen. She just stopped talking to me one day, and didn't talk to me again for seven months. I was amazed to find it actually hurt. Not even emotionally. It seemed physical. It hurt more than pretty much anything else. More than my depression did.

But it wasn't my depression. It didn't even feed into my depression. It was separate. It was something different. It was more pure. It felt right to grieve. It felt like what I was supposed to be doing.

My depression wasn't pure. It was gritty, It was dark, it was grimy. It smiled with chipped gold teeth. It was a trickster. It twisted things into forms that looked identical to what they were, but in their core, they were essentially different.  It tempted me with suicide if I'd let it. Briana never did that.

---

I used to get excited about things. 

Earnestly, helplessly, ridiculously, excited. For weeks and months. 

When I was a kid, I jumped up and down, flapping my arms. An expression of the energy that just couldn't be contained. In that brief moment, I would entirely forget that I was public, and I'd let it out, shamelessly. Until I realized it happened, and twelve people were staring at me.

Journalism was like that. I fucking loved it, and I was excited for every story I did. But the ones that were good, the ones that would land me on the front page, or hell, dominate an entire issue. Those would excite me for weeks and months. There were nights where I couldn't sleep, because I see could see a story forming, and I couldn't wait to call that first source the next day.

I still get excited about things. For days at best. Sometimes hours. Often minutes. And then, it fizzles out, before it should, and I'm staring at something I was so emphatically excited about just hours beforehand, and now, I'm just entirely indifferent.

That's the hardest thing. I'm not used to that. I don't know how to handle it.

---

I'm running again, now that I'm putting my life back in order.  I'm running a lot.

I used to run in high school, because running was hard work, and putting a full days amount of work into an hour run, that was a good feeling.

Now it's different. I run to get exhausted, because that often seems like a better place to be. I run to get high, because most of the other ones, I've given up. I run because it creates endorphins, and colors are more vibrant when I run. Things seem like they used to be, most of the time, for that brief hour. 

I run because it burns calories. I didn't care much beforehand, but it's nice to focus on my physical appearance. It's something in my life I can control. It's a physical manifestation of the better man I'm becoming.

---

It was one of those nights again tonight.  My first in at least three weeks, I think. My parents medicine cabinet has 650 milligrams of Benadryl.  Benadryl, at high doses, becomes a deliriant, creating illusions which one can't distinguish from reality. It's more akin to schizophrenia than psychedelics. It's a dark, brutish trip. Reports say the first thing that hits you is a sense of impending doom. Hallucinations consist of giant bugs and shadow people. Euphoria is generally impossible. 

I'm hoping one of those shadow people is my depression. I want to sit it down. I want to talk. I want to know why I let it in. I want to know why I needed to. 

A quick text to a friend quickly demolishes all of those plans. An awkward preamble about why I'm about to take a drug that'll make me miserable, and then a request, ""text me late tonight, make sure I don't."" 

So I'm drinking and writing instead. I'll talk to it another time. Hopefully not though. It's been months since I've taken anything like it.

Maybe I won't talk to it at all. Maybe it's not even there.

Maybe I've been talking to it this entire time. "

I’m trying to decide on a good path to move forward. I feel like my biggest challenge is that even though my engineering fundamentals are strong, I have no domain experience. I want to participate in the field at a high level, having a deep understanding of the different science and technologies involved to help push the industry forward. I don’t want to just be a code monkey crunching somebody else’s data over and over.

I’m open to anything, whether it be teaching myself the necessary skills, starting my own company, going back to school, trying to get an internship or job where I can learn, doing volunteer work, etc.

The tentative plan I've come up with at this point is to try hard the next couple months to get an internship or job where they’re willing to train me in big data analytics, then harness that experience to move into something specific to bioinformatics then work my way up. If I can’t find something that’s a good fit, I’ll go back to school. I still have a couple years until I finish my bachelors. I’m planning to do a computer science or computer engineering degree, with some biology classes on the side (possibly try to minor). After that I would go to grad school for biotech or bioinformatics.

I’m looking for any general advice or suggestions. Thanks!

2jtdno,2,2014-10-20,Should I transfer back from UT Austin to UT Dallas?,dumebringer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jtdno/should_i_transfer_back_from_ut_austin_to_ut_dallas/,"Hey everyone, I've got a bit of a dilemma. I'm currently a CS student at UT Austin, and I really don't like it here.

For my freshman and sophomore years, I attended UT Dallas. I loved the classes, the location, and just the atmosphere in general. All of the professors that I had were very enthusiastic about teaching their students, and all of them really seemed to be striving to make UTD better. The classes were smaller, and I had a personal relationship with several of my professors.

This semester (first semester junior year), I transferred to UT Austin because I heard the degree holds a lot of weight. The thing is though, I really don't like it here. I don't like Austin, I don't care for the culture, and the professors and administration all have pretty much exact opposite attitude that the ones at UTD had. Here, it's more like a ""fuck you, you're lucky to even be here at this prestigious school"" attitude. My advisers haven't been helpful, and none of my professors really seem to care all that much about students on an individual level (in their defense, the classes are massive). To top it all off, they didn't even count a lot of my credits, so I'm retaking multiple courses here and my graduation has been pushed back by one or two semesters.

At UTD, I had a 3.87 GPA. Here, my GPA won't be terrible, but it won't be great. It's not that the classes are harder, it's just that they're more work, I'm less motivated because I'm constantly feeling down, and I'm even less motivated to be retaking classes that were difficult in the first place (I pulled off As initially, but I'm not sure if I will this time around).

At UTD, I'm closer to home, traffic isn't nearly as bad, and my fiance is there. I'm trying to make this decision without that in mind though, because I want what would be best for the long term, not just right now.

If I transfer back, I'll have wasted most of this semester, but I'm OK with that, because I'm gonna graduate late here anyway. I honestly feel like I was getting a better education at UTD, and I've never been happier than when I was there, but I just don't know what to do. I know UTD is well respected in the area, but I have no idea how everyone else sees them.

So basically, I don't know if a degree from UT with so-so grades would be better than a degree from UTD with great grades, and if so, then by how much. I know I'd be happier back at UTD, but I don't want to mess up my future. I also don't have very long to figure this out.

Also, money isn't an issue: I attended UTD with a full ride, so if they'd give it back (doubtful) that would be great, and if not I'm lucky that my father was in the military, so I'll have the Hazlewood Act to pay my way.

Anyway, I'm kind of rambling now, if you guys have any advice I would greatly appreciate it.


Edit: I just looked up some statistics, and it seems as though UT's starting salary is around $63k for new grads, and the average for UTD's engineering and computer science school (can't find just CS) is around $61k. I'm not sure about employment rates of UT's grads, but UTD's is around 89%. I guess UT could land me a more ""prestigious"" job, but I think there are more than enough opportunities for me at UTD (they helped me get an internship last summer and a research position during school as well). I'm *really* starting to lean more to UTD. And thank you guys for the responses, any feedback is still welcome."

I have a few questions about doing freelance work and would like some advice about it.

First I will explain a little about myself and situation. I worked full time as a front end intern at a studio and ended up getting hired on as a part time junior developer. The job is great but I am finishing school next year and want to spend more time on school (work is very demanding). I am planning on quitting the end of this semester, but still want to have some source of income, and continuing to build my resume. 

I am planning on redoing my portfolio site (it's a bit outdated) and updating it with the new skills and abilities I have learned.

So some of my questions are:

How to find freelance jobs?
What to charge hourly?
Where/how to write a contract?
What to do if a client doesn't pay?

Any other advice would be awesome as well.

After my freshman year I realized the science courses were becoming harder and harder for me to understand and I knew that path wasn't for me. I decided I wanted to try business out, and again, realized I didn't belong there.

I finally decided to switch into computer science and minor in business this year and I'm loving it. Most of the courses I'm taking are introductory but I'm excited about what I'm learning and I get a huge feeling of satisfaction when a program I'm working on runs well. I applied to a few IT internships and Chick Fil A replied to me and said they wanted to speak with me over the phone tomorrow morning. GE also expressed interest and I'm meeting with a recruiter on campus Wednesday morning for an interview.

I'm pretty nervous about them though, since I just recently switched into computer science. I'm hoping the questions are mostly behavioral because I know I'll get tripped up on technical questions... 

Anyway. Just wanted to share some of my good news with you guys. Hope everyone's week is starting off as well as mine :)

2juftq,2,2014-10-20,Me [24M] can't get over my ex [24F] of 18 months in college from almost 2 years ago,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2juftq/me_24m_cant_get_over_my_ex_24f_of_18_months_in/,"Two years ago, I made the hardest choice of my life and broke up with my girlfriend. We had graduated college and things were going so well for her but I couldn't get my shit together. She had a long-term internship, was planning to move home from college (approx. 30 minutes from campus) and was so happy with life. My world was crumbling, I couldn't find a job, didn't know if I was going to need to move home (1000 miles away) and couldn't seem to get anything together but our relationship. I felt horrible and felt like I was dragging her down but didn't know how to tell her. I ended the relationship thinking that I was saving her pain and deciding to take my troubles on by myself.

After I ended things, I ended up finding a job that required me to travel quite a bit and things were seeming to look up. The issue was that I still couldn't get myself together inside and my personal relationships were deteriorating. In hindsight, I was going through deep depression and was hiding it through my terminally ill grandmother's situation and my family's need for me. In all actuality, I had an addiction to marijuana and couldn't handle the responsibility of drinking. Things would never be perfect in my mind and I didn't know what to do and so I hid away.

Things finally started looking up and I felt like I had things in control, I felt like I could start looking again but I kept thinking about her and what I was missing with her. It was impossible for me to get her out of my mind and I couldn't talk/flirt with other girls because I kept thinking about what I had lost with her. I went back into my shell and continued on with myself and the destruction of social life while trying to keep my grandparents and family happy.

My grandmother passed away a year after I broke things up and had graduated; my ex sent me a text telling me how sorry she was and it was one of the few things that brightened my days. Things at work were chaotic but it was a shining light. At the conclusion of the summer, I moved in with two buddies that were fed the marijuana addiction and helped me forget about things.

No matter what I did though, I couldn't get her out of my mind and one of my roommates was toxic for me and the potential rekindling of my friendship with me ex. We talked a bit but he ended up being a jerk and I let it get to me.

Come the start of 2014 and I decided to start dating again but I couldn't get happy with my relationship because of what I was missing and I called things off. I went back into self building and improving and felt so much better. I met a girl that I had known and crushed on in college and we started dating at the beginning of summer. It was a quick relationship though and I ended it after a horrific trip back home and realizing that she had no place in my life and couldn't fit in with my family.

While back home, my sister apologized for how she had treated my ex and let me know how truly sorry she was for everything that she had said and done that might have drived a wedge between us.  It got me thinking about my ex again and I haven't been able to stop.

She is in my dreams and there are so many coincidences in my life that make me miss her (I had to travel to California for work, somewhere that she always wanted to travel to and so many other small things). I still miss her and everything seems to make me think about her.

I know that I am overthinking things, but I just don't know what to do. It hurts to think about but I don't know what to do. What can I do? Is it worth letting her know or do I need to suck it up and move on? I have girls that are interested but I still can't stop thinking about her. These girls are gorgeous, they're everything that I thought that I wanted... but I only want her back.

---   
**tl;dr**: broke up with college sweetheart to save her the pain that I thought I was going to bring. No matter what happens in my life, it feels like I'm always missing her though and I don't know what to do."

We stole each others hearts and have had a long distance relationship since then. We spent the school year apart except for Xmas last year, which I spent with her family, her in the UK and myself in Florida. This summer she is returning to camp and I am not, and my only possible time to visit her for Xmas this winter. 

Unfortunately making this trip would at the very least, a plane ticket there and back, would knock me out a third of my savings, but train tickets and expenses would probably take me even another third, leaving with not that much money left. 

That being said, I want this relationship to continue after college. She graduates this year and wants to continue her education course taking a year long course. I still have a year of school left ( due to a transfer) and would then find a job where she is. I'd probably have to travel and join her somewhere to work because she cant work here in the US until she reaches certain qualifications. This would too cost money. 

Depending on what we decide to do, if she comes back, or stays in the UK then I could possibly find a internship somewhere. My course is that which places or business would POSSIBLY have internships. POSSIBLY

What should I do? I am so confused over everything. I want this to work so bad.

2jv6cb,2,2014-10-21,Just need some feedback on guy crush drama,Kiffjedentag,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2jv6cb/just_need_some_feedback_on_guy_crush_drama/,"OK so this whole situation will probably make me sound like a goddamn moron, but I need to get this shit off my chest and find some closure. So our story begins late September 2012, not long after my senior year of high school had  begun. I was 17. I was in a special Culinary Arts career pathway class in high school. Part of this class included going out and catering local events. One night I went out on a catering to a winery, and there I met a boy. We'll call him Brandon. He was in the same class, but in the period just before mine. He was a sophomore, 2 days from his 16th birthday. We just started talking out of the blue, and the conversation flowed like it never had with anyone I'd known before. (I'm not much of a talker). I thought about him all the way home. My heart fluttered. A couple days later we both signed up for another event. From the very start we were talking and carrying on like we'd known each other for years. After that event, the two of us hung out together. We smoked some weed (his first time, I had done so for several years) and drove around town all night, running through sprinklers, wandering through the woods behind my house, and listening to lots of music. When I finally dropped him off and got home the sun was rising, on a school day, but I didn't care. It was the most magical night of my life at that point. For the next several months until the end of school, we hung out frequently, so much that my other friends began getting suspicious and soon realized how infatuated I had become with Brandon. We both would hang out together in the kitchen of the culinary classroom during break and lunch every day, often just the two of us. I'd ditch classes I found boring to join him in the culinary class (the culinary teacher had an extremely lassez-faire attitude towards student conduct) On school nights we'd sneak out after our parents had gone to sleep to meet up, drive up to the top of the hill overlooking our city, and spend hours talking about life and our dreams and music and what the future held and all those sorts of spacey things people want to talk about until 3 in the morning. We could just talk and talk and never run out of interesting things to say. It was like we both saw the world through the same lens. He told me he only ever smoked pot with me because it was our special thing and he didn't' want to feel it with anyone else. He told me I was the most important person in the world to him. I told him I felt the same. I really did.
 This pattern continued through the summer, at a pretty steady rate. We knew I'd be moving two states away (California to Colorado) and resolved to enjoy the time we had while it lasted. We had a lot of fun that summer.
 After I moved to Denver for school (JWU) things started to get strained. He had never been super great at phone communication/texting (which hadn't been a problem, most of our texting until that point had been simply arranging meet-ups) but it now seemed harder than ever to contact him. Sometimes I'd get a message back from him six days later, sometimes he wouldn't reply at all. It was frustrating. When I came back for winter break he was overjoyed, as was I, and we spent every single night with each other until I had to go back. On the final night, when I dropped him off around 4 in the morning, he hugged me and wouldn't let go for a long time. I thought about kissing him then but I didn't. i truly do not know how things would have panned out had I done that. Anyway, I went back to school and the communication issues persisted. It felt like he had forgotten about me after I left. I felt very lonely, having few new friends at college and not many people to talk to. I did end up getting into a gay bar wing-manning my fresh-on-the-rebound lesbian friend, which was an interesting experience to say the least, but I still spent the rest of the year missing him deeply. 
 During this time, Brandon began spending a lot of time with a friend of his that I never particularly liked who we'll call Asshat. He and Asshat had been friends about as long as I knew Brandon, but they had never gotten so close. They were spending multiple nights over at each other's houses and going to high school parties and all that jazz. I was jealous. 
So I come home to California for the summer. My stay here is six months instead of three because the first semester of my sophomore year was designated as my internship term, and I decided to seek an internship in California. Back to the story.
 When I came back for the summer we still hung out the way we used to, but nowhere nearly as frequently. He was spending a lot more time with Asshat because Asshat was moving to the east coast soon (good riddance, fucker) and suddenly, even though I was home I felt like I did back in Denver. I remember one night as I was driving him home, It felt like the exact perfect moment to tell him how I felt. I was about to spill the tea when Asshat called Brandon, extremely drunk on champagne, to tell him he didn't know what part of town he had wandered into, and asked him to find him a ride. He remained on the phone with him for the remainder of the ride while I internally questioned if he cared as much about me as I did for him.
 After Asshat moved away, we began to hang out more frequently. He told me during our long talks that he had become closer to Asshat while I was away because he was so lonely. I made a point of reminding him how lonely I was in Denver. He acknowledged that he had spent way too much energy on Asshat. We were back to where we were, hanging out all the time, all night long, talking for hours. He was still hard to get ahold of but would actually make an effort to contact me first, something he hadn't done all summer. 
 Fast forward to about a week and a half ago. We drove up to our spot overlooking the city and sat in my Jeep, smoking a joint and looking down at the city lights. It was all so perfect, and when the song I had decided would be my 'coming out' song way back in 2008 (Believe Me Natalie by The Killers, in case you were wondering) came on my iPod, I just straight up told him I was gay. He smiled, said ""I knew that"" and gave me a hug. It was the best reaction I've had from anyone. I cried just a little out of joy, as he was the last of my friends I had to tell. He hugged me again after dropping me off at my house, just the same way he had when I had to leave for school again at the end of winter break. 
  Several days later, after once again being unable to get in contact with him, he calls me at midnight asking to hang out. I of course say yes and we go sneak into a park near my house and sit on a bench staring at the lake. Out of the blue he tells me he's lost his virginity. I'm completely floored by this and ask him the details. He (just turned 18) went to some 27-year old coworker's house and got drunk and had sex with her. They apparently were at it for about an hour and a half before they stopped. He didn't come. I just felt so overcome with disappointment and disgust I couldn't even speak. He hadn't shown any interest in girls for the two years I had known him and now suddenly he was fucking some 27-year old bitch. It was like I had suddenly woken up in a nightmare. He could tell I was extremely upset, and asked why, which I brushed off as me simply being sad that everyone I knew but me had someone (which was true). When we walked back to my house we were silent for a large portion of the trip. As we approached his car we talked about my depression (kinda glossed over that but basically I had been telling him about being depressed for months and attempting suicide in Denver) and I said that nobody made me happy. After a few moments of silence he asked me ""Do I make you happy?"" and I replied ""You make me happy, but not in all the ways I need to be happy."" He was silent after that. We hugged once more outside his car, then I watched him drive away. I haven't said a word to him in six days, I don't even know if I should. Am I right to be upset that he had sex with someone else, despite there being no solidly defined romantic relationship between us? What should I do? Am I a dumbass for going through al this? Any and all feedback and advice is welcomed, as are PMs. Just give me some things to think about, everything is so murky and unsure to me.

TL;DR boys are complicated and will ruin your life and sanity.

I'm a sophmore studying CS at a pretty prestigious university in the US. I made it to the final round of interviews for a company I'm extremely interested in and have it scheduled or thursday. I feel pretty prepared so I don't feel too nervous. However, I'm curious what the general rule of thumb is for how likely you are to get an internship if you make it to the final round? The recruiter said the final round is more to see if you fit personally and even a little business, less of the programming aspect this time. Therefore, it seems I passed the programming aspects of their test. So, is there a good chance, unless I say or do something stupid, that I get this internship?"

Now, I won't say the name because I'm not a complete douche bag, but I'll just say this was one of the ""specialty stores"" located in the next state over.

My friend's and I have not been able to find the styles and sizes we wanted at the authorized seller in our town, so the bride decided that making an appointment at the specialty store would be the best route to take. Makes sense, right?

Well she calls to set the appointment, OVER A MONTH IN ADVANCE, and mentions that her girls are looking for specific styles. They tell her that that would be ""no big deal,"" and that if they got the style numbers and sizes that we were looking for, they could get them in the store from the warehouse in time for our appointment. The bride asked if that would cost us anything, to which she was told it wouldn't. Everything that we've been told so far seems like a fair and legit deal. We get the style numbers and sizes to our bride within the next 2 days and she sends those digits to the store. Again, it's ""no problem.""

Fast foward to Tuesday of last week. My friend decides to check in with the store, re-confirm that we have an appointment on Friday, yada yada yada. They tell her it's all good to go.. until she asks about the dresses. The lady on the phone tells her that they haven't come in yet, but she's sure they'll be in by Saturday. My bride is slightly panicked, but has faith in the store.

I should mention that she had bought her dress from these exact same people. A whopping $1000 after alterations. She had literally not a single issue with them and was absolutely in love with the idea of her bridesmaids wearing their stuff as well.

Friday, October 17th: Because of the time difference between us and Indiana, we're all up at 7am, on the road at 8am, for our appointment at noon. My one friend already had to drive to our town from her internship over 3 hours away.. The specialty store is a little over 2 hours from us. That is 10 hours of driving she's going to be doing this weekend (keep this in mind when the shit hits the fan in a little bit). So we're all in good spirits and ready to try on these dresses!

We're about 30 minutes away and the bride's phone rings. It's the store. They inform us that the dresses haven't arrived yet.. 30 MINUTES BEFORE OUR APPOINTMENT THEY TELL US THIS. Now the bride is freaking out. Seriously?! Now because we're only 30 minutes away, we decided we're better off keeping the appointment than turning around. While the bridesmaids are gonna see what the store has in stock, the bride's going to have a little conversation with the employees. Brides strolls in 3 steps ahead of the bridesmaids and hops in line. We, however, weren't even greeted.

While we're looking at what they have in store, bride's chatting with the employees about the situation. One where a manager needs to be the one handling it. Did she? Nope. She avoided us at all costs. What this says to me is that someone fucked up and someone's not wanting to deal with the consequences. So what the employee who decided to take the bullet tells us is this: They aren't actually able to acquire merchandise from their warehouse. Only items purchased come from the warehouse. What they do is call surrounding stores and see if anyone has the styles and sizes they're looking for and have them delivered from there. So basically, someone, somewhere dropped the ball. What I don't understand is that the follow up calls kept confirming what we were originally told, and all of a sudden the day of the policy has changed?

So whatever, we're hella annoyed, but we all find sizes that are close (but not nearly close enough) and about 25% of the styles we wanted. While we're trying on, my one friend (the one who drive 5 hours to get here) starts angry crying because she was missing a few important meetings to be here and she drove FIVE FUCKING HOURS. Not a single employee was even the least bit apologetic to any of us about the great inconvenience their lack of communication has caused.

As we're trying on dresses, the manager and her Kate-Gosselin-hair-do stroll over with the biggest bitch face I've ever seen. This woman was nasty and condescending. She had the nerve to say, ""I'm sorry that you guys are angry."" That's not an apology for screwing up on their part! That's a ""these girls are mad at me and I don't want to take the blame"" apology. And once we started talking about alterations and what not, she decided to pull out confusing within-the-industry lingo and have the nerve to follow up a majority of her sentences with quips like, ""but I don't expect you to know what that is.""

Here's the kicked, my best friend and fellow bridesmaid is an ASSISTANT MEMBER OF A BRIDAL SHOP in our hometown. Holy crap did the gates of hell fly open. She puts on her boxing gloves and decides to do a couple rounds with Miss Manager. This was the most glorious moment that I had ever witnessed.. After putting her word in, the second associate helping us pipes up wanting to know if we would be ordering today. That's it. We're done. My best friend says, ""we are going to go to lunch, and think about this, we are not purchasing any of these dresses today.. Thank you for your time.""

We leave, my one friend is still tearing up, the brides is the most angry I've EVER seen her, my best friend is fuming with rage.. I am silently scanning the parking lot for what I guess is Miss Manager's car because I would LOVE to slash a tire or two... I'm just kidding about that last part.

We go to lunch, my best friend and I have some wine and she decides she really wants to give the manager a piece of her mind. She confirms with the bride that she has all her wedding dress items and as soon as lunch is over, and we're in the car, she gives them a call.

&gt; ""Hello, my name is ____ ____ and I was just in your store a part of ____ ____'s wedding party. Yeah, you guys will not be getting our business. I am appalled at the lack of professionalism and tact your store has to offer. Not only we're we lied to, but the fact that not a single person in your store decided to assist us in any way but to still expect a sale is absolutely disgusting. I am a manager at a bridal shop as well and I would NEVER have allowed myself or my associates behave the way your establishment has. Believe me when I say this: You have a hell of a lot to work on if you expect to stay in business.""

And she hung up the phone.

I don't condone being the angry customer.. but sometimes it's necessary.

My friend who drove the 5 hours ended up calling her mom, who called the authorized seller in the town she's currently living in and she was livid. She had NEVER even heard of such policies about ordering dresses and she is going to do everything within her power to make sure my friend can try on the dresses she wanted to in her town. All I'm going to say is at least someone cares about their business."

I am a Macquarie University student currently studying Professional Accounting seeking an accounting internship in Sydney.

I do have experience working in accounting firms. My most recent accounting internship was January of this year, where I was placed in the Audit department (Assurance) as well as the Tax department where I assisted my colleagues with external audits and tax files. I did pick up many things in my time there as well as personally travelled to a client's firm to assist with the audit. 

I have good written and oral communications skills and think of myself as a quick learner and well as someone who wants to absorb as much knowledge as I am able to so that I properly understand what exactly I am doing.

I have used MYOB, Xero and also UBS accounting software packages and I am proficient with Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. 

Experience is my primary concern and would love to develop my accounting skills so that I can better my future career in the role.

Please get in touch if you have use of my skills in your organisation or know about any other opportunities. I greatly appreciate it.

2jvflo,12,2014-10-21,Made a huge career mistake - Need advice (xpost /r/advice),[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2jvflo/made_a_huge_career_mistake_need_advice_xpost/,"I don't know where to start with this, but I'm going to try my best.

I am currently 28 years of age. I am an American citizen (male) who spent two years in a foreign country getting a master's degree in an engineering discipline. My undergraduate degree was pre-medicine and engineering, but I hit a few bumps along the road during my undergrad career (mainly family issues), and as a result things didn't go as planned. Originally I wanted to go to medical school, but when it turned out it wasn't an option I had to explore other options. I wasn't completely sure if I even wanted a M.S. in the first place, but since jobs were a bit hard to come by, I applied, and when I got into one of the top universities in a particular country, I decided to just go for it.

For a number of reasons, after about a year, I started to have second thoughts. Maybe it was the fact that I was far from home, or maybe it was the fact that I just found my projects boring (my undergrad institution had delayed sending my transcripts, which made it impossible for me to enroll until halfway through the semester - funding had dried up and I was stuck on the sidelines). I considered quitting a few times but I either was afraid of facing ""failure"" or would figure that I was in too deep to quit and tried to force myself through it. Ended up being miserable and depressed for about six months, but eventually got my degree. The thing is that my thesis was pretty much half-assed and cobbled together from really shoddy data. To this day, I never felt that my thesis was all it could have been had I worked a bit harder.

During the following months, my advisor allowed me to return to the lab as an intern if I wanted to fix up my thesis.  I had the choice of leaving and returning to the States, but I felt that it would be an opportunity to redeem myself. Unfortunately, I couldn't really find the motivation to continue my work. Every day I felt apathetic and depressed going into the office.  My work was basically stalled for months, because for one reason or another I couldn't bear to see it anymore, but because I was at the same time kind of afraid to quit. Long story short, when about five months ago, my advisor called me up to provide a manuscript for a conference, I ended up making up quite a substantial amount of a data. More recently, my advisor tried to encourage me to turn the conference manuscript into a journal article, and even had one of the other professors in the department collaborate with it. Essentially I was forced to keep on perpetuating the made-up data.

Now, I know that this is quite a serious thing in academia. I deeply regret all the academic misconduct that I've done.  I had never really intended for it to turn out like this, but at the same time I was afraid that quitting prematurely would be admitting defeat or failure. Recently I quit my research/internship just because I felt burned out and couldn't deal with it anymore.

For the record, my advisor and my immediate supervisor haven't had the chance to go over the actual data and results, but now that I'm quitting, the project is getting transferred to one of my supervisors for further work.   They don't know that most of what I've done for about 6 or 7 months is essentially a lie, but still, I can't emphasize how sad I am about what I did.  Originally, I had planned to get a PhD, but this is going to be out of the question now.  I don't know what to do from here. I feel pretty bad having to come to terms with the fact that basically more than a year of my life has been a waste of time. 

I don't know what my choices in academia are at the moment.  If this path is totally gone for me, or if there's some way I can pick up the pieces again.  Perhaps I would like to begin by confessing what I've done, but even that, I just don't know how to go about doing it. I realize that I should have held myself to higher standards or even just had the guts to quit after the first year, but like I said, I was afraid of what other people would have thought of me. I've let a lot of people down and have wasted time, money and resources and not just my own. To be honest I'm afraid of what is going to happen to me if I do confess, but also find that it really troubles me if I don't.

Can I get some advice here? I really feel stuck and don't know what to do.

Thanks to everyone who read this."

2jvs6e,125,2014-10-21,Becoming the expert on handheld scanners,RandomPullOutGuy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2jvs6e/becoming_the_expert_on_handheld_scanners/,"This story starts, May 3rd 2014. My 3rd day into my internship that has become a career. I have been ordered to go pick up a handheld that needs a certain application installed on it. This application is a mobile retail application that is used for inventory control.

Week 1: the files i have been given are four .cab files and an installation booklet for a different model scanner, but it all ""should just work"". I cannot get the scanner connected to my computer, which the instruction say should just connect. along with the dinasour that i am using, a Dell Optiplex GX520 (produced in 2005, Lets run WIN 7 on it). i finally find that the mobile application needs to be downloaded, but is the wrong application for in 7 WMDC needed.

needless to say i get everything installed and to no avail, nothing.

Week 3: I contact support, they send me a whole new batch of files. I get these installed and nothing. I end up getting really busy because my main project is a Win7 upgrade for the whole company, they haven't started the upgrade yet 2 months after xp support has ended.

Late june/ Early july: I finally get to pick the gun up again. I contact support and get a WHOLE NEW set of cab files, no instructions, just ""use the files that are new but closely named in the order that the original files are listed"". These files install, but i am still getting issues. I contact our level 2 guys about server config and they never get back to me. The program will open but is throwing a weird error. I finally figure out the config file is caty wompus and just try to copy the config file from an old gun and rename as the new gun config file. Low and behold, it works. 

I contact the program support again and they tell me that the config setting that is throwing an error is not need just comment it out.

Aug 1 10:00am: More time to work on the sore that has grown on my desk. The program opens and i can log on. I take it to be delivered to the Inventory manager. I drop it off and RUN away smiling because well, that gun is off my desk. 

Aug 1 11:15am: I get a call. ""hey uhh, the program is working, but i can use the scanner to scan UPCs i can only enter by hand. So i fire up the googles. It turns out this gun is shipped WITHOUT THE GODDAMN APPLICATION TO ALLOW THE GUN TO SCAN!!!!!!!!!!!! So i run back over, new 3 year old laptop in hand, still better than the GX520. I find the program to install, install the program, and blind someone with the laser.

At last the gun is working fine.

Fast forward 1.5 months, i am back in school for my last semester working remotely to my job 3.5 hours away. When a bing sounds from my laptop. 

New Email: ""we have 3 guns that are having issues. please help""

O so descriptive. I call the guy and ask what is going wrong and what the model numbers on the scanners are. 2 different problems on a different model gun, but as you would expect, I am the ""Expert"" at these guns, because i got one to run. So i contact the programs support line, and these guns are no longer supported. 

guess its time to shoot from the hip.

First gun: No laser. I talk to the on property inventory manager and i  have him install the laser program, teaching end users to install something on windows CE is painful.

Second and third gun, no program installed. No problem, i will just follow my instructions from the other gun. Program installs, but wont go online due to sql error. I figure out that an old sql object is causing the crash. 

But now, the whole program can't be seen, only the top 2/3rds. I look into my pile of files and find the old file they sent me. the old file was WeaponX.cab and the new file was WeaponXVGA.cab. I have the guy i am talking to my boss on property, who has never worked on this guns through the uninstall, and re-install of the WeaponX.cab file and finally all guns are working fine.


TL;DR: Doing something once makes you an expert forever, on everything closely related."

I'm currently in the process of migrating a server 2008 file/print server to a server 2012 at my internship. Before I migrate however, I ofcourse want to prepare as much as possible.. now I've got almost everything sorted out except for the printers.

I have exported the current printers on the 2008 server to a printer migration file, and I was wondering what is going to happen when I migrate everything over to the 2012 server and import the file there while the old server is still running. I've done my research and tried several things on a test box, but I don't know what is going to happen when there are 2 print servers with identical printers and share names on the domain.

[These are my github repos for reference](https://github.com/dkanellis). 

The main way I preferred acquiring knowledge was through books since I found them to be extensive and providing more than beginner knowledge.

Specifically I have read these books thus far:

* Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
* Java A Beginner's Guide
* Some of: Pro JPA 2
* Some of: Cracking the Coding Interview

My goal is to acquire as much professional knowledge as I can. I want to make my projects look professional therefore allowing me to have a better chance at job interviews for internships or even graduate jobs.

What I want is to acquire very good knowledge in making efficient, professional and clean code. *Clean Code* provided me with very good tools but now I need something more oriented towards Class Design.

**My question is:** How should I go from here? Is there any good book that you could recommend me to help me with good class design or is there something entirely different that I should be doing. Personally I was thinking of starting to read *Java: The Complete Reference*."

Antibiotics, insecticides, pollution, immune-suppressing vaccine campaigns and the poisoning of Africa.",axolotl_peyotl,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jwk26/jon_rappoport_on_the_ebola_hoax_the_feared/,"From Jon Rappoport: [Ebola hoax: the feared “bleeding” symptom](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/19/ebola-hoax-the-feared-bleeding-symptom/)

&gt;As I’ve demonstrated in [several articles](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/the-ebola-test-let-the-tests-inventor-speak/), the diagnostic tests for Ebola are [unreliable and useless.](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/ebola-the-us-diagnostic-test-is-utterly-ureliable/)

&gt;What does this mean?

&gt;It means that, for any patient labeled “Ebola,” there is no verification. No confirmation. None. Zero. Asserting the patient “has Ebola” is meaningless, because there is no concrete evidence.

&gt;Once you remove the Ebola virus from the equation, all you have left is symptoms. Symptoms in West Africans, and in those few people in the US and Europe who are labeled with “Ebola.”

&gt;Symptoms like diarrhea, fever, cough, fatigue, vomiting, bleeding. Obviously, these symptoms can result from a number of different causes, none of which needs to be a virus.

&gt;Let’s take bleeding, for example. This is the hyped symptom that evokes the most fear, and convinces people that these patients “must be different and unique. They could only be bleeding because the Ebola virus is causing it.”

&gt;Not true. Consider antibiotics.

&gt;Here is a quote from a study, [“Potential for bleeding with the new beta-lactam antibiotics,”](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3535606) Ann Intern Med December 1986; 105(6):924-31:

“Several new beta-lactam antibiotics impair normal hemostasis [body processes that stop bleeding]… These antibiotics often cause the template bleeding time to be markedly prolonged (greater than 20 minutes)… dangerous bleeding due to impaired platelet aggregation requires treatment with platelet concentrates.”

&gt;Here is a summary from MedlinePlus:

“The Clostridium difficile bacteria normally lives in the intestine. However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotics. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon… Any antibiotic can cause this condition. The drugs responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins…”

&gt;So let’s look at the level of antibiotic use in West Africa and the Third World.

Voice of America, February 26, 2014, “…antibiotics have become the automatic choice for treating a child with a fever.”

AAPS (American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists): “For instance, in most areas of West Africa, antibiotics are commonly sold as over-the-counter medications.”

TWN (Third World Network): “…a survey carried out in 1999 showed that nearly one out of two antidiarrheal products in Third World countries contained an unnecessary antibiotic [and chronic diarrhea in the Third World is a leading cause of death, so you can be sure that these antidiarrheal drugs are consumed in great quantities].

“…75 products (including some antibiotics) which had been pulled out or banned in one or more European countries were identified in the Third World in 1991.”

&gt;Of course, banned antibiotics would be exceptionally toxic. In West Africa, antibiotic use is sky-high…and antibiotics do cause bleeding.

&gt;Bleeding where? In the digestive tract.

&gt;In light of that, consider the following excerpt from the healthgrades.com article, [“What is vomiting blood?”](http://www.healthgrades.com/symptoms/vomiting-blood)

“Vomiting blood indicates the presence of bleeding in the digestive tract…Vomiting blood may be caused by many different conditions, and the severity varies among individuals. The material vomited may be bright red or it may be dark colored like coffee grounds…”

&gt;Yes, it turns out that any source of internal bleeding in the digestive tract—such as overuse of antibiotics—can cause a person to vomit blood. “The uniqueness” of “Ebola-blood-vomiting” is a fairy tale.

&gt;What else could cause the “Ebola” bleeding symptom in West Africa?

&gt;We have the fact that organophosphate insecticides are being widely used for indoor spraying, in West African homes and, surely, in clinics, to kill mosquitos. 

&gt;One study reports: “With high DDT resistance present throughout much of West Africa, carbamates and organophosphates are increasingly important alternatives to pyrethroids for indoor residual spraying (IRS).”

&gt;Among the effects, from severe exposure to organophosphates: diarrhea, tremors, staggering gait, blood disorders, death—all of which have been described in reference to Ebola.

&gt;And then there is this: 

“In nine patients suffering from organophosphate intoxication, platelet function and blood coagulation parameters were investigated…In five of nine patients a marked bleeding tendency was observed. The bleeding tendency in organophosphate intoxication is probably mainly caused by the defective platelet function.” (Klin Wochenschur, Sept. 3, 1984;62 (17):814-20, author: m. Zieman)

&gt;Bleeding. Not from a virus.

More info on pesticides in Africa: [Another missing “Ebola” factor: pesticides](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/another-missing-ebola-factor-pesticides/)

&gt;Here is another vital observation: “The distribution and sale of pesticides in West Africa is not effectively regulated. Multiple channels of supply commonly include the repackaging of obsolete or illegal stocks [extremely toxic] and the correspondence between the contents of containers to what is stated on the label is poor…”

&gt;Pesticide suppliers conceal banned pesticides—which they are taking a loss on, because they can’t sell them—and put them inside containers labeled with the names of legal pesticides.

Carborfuran, chloropyrifos, dimethoate, methamidophos, endosulfan...

&gt;These pesticides can and do produce a number of the symptoms called “Ebola:”

&gt;Bleeding, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, stomach pain, coma. But all this is swept aside in the hysteria about The Virus.

&gt;Once you put the virus hypothesis aside—because the standardly used diagnostic tests are useless in determining the presence or quantity of Ebola virus in any patient—you begin to look for other sources that explain what is happening to people in the area who are suffering and dying.

&gt;Combine what I’ve described above with other chronic conditions in West Africa—severe malnutrition, starvation, lack of basic sanitation, grinding poverty, severe overcrowded living conditions, prior immune-suppressing vaccine campaigns—and the result is an ongoing catastrophe.

&gt;A catastrophe that can produce all the symptoms of “Ebola” or a dozen other diseases, without the need of a virus to explain them.

&gt;The “virus” becomes the cover story, used to conceal and sustain what is really going on.

&gt;And at the highest level of control, what is going on is the continued invasion and capture of the land, the resources, and the people."

&amp;gt;Let’s take bleeding, for example. This is the hyped symptom that evokes the most fear, and convinces people that these patients “must be different and unique. They could only be bleeding because the Ebola virus is causing it.”

&amp;gt;Not true. Consider antibiotics.

&amp;gt;Here is a quote from a study, [“Potential for bleeding with the new beta-lactam antibiotics,”](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3535606) Ann Intern Med December 1986; 105(6):924-31:

“Several new beta-lactam antibiotics impair normal hemostasis [body processes that stop bleeding]… These antibiotics often cause the template bleeding time to be markedly prolonged (greater than 20 minutes)… dangerous bleeding due to impaired platelet aggregation requires treatment with platelet concentrates.”

&amp;gt;Here is a summary from MedlinePlus:

“The Clostridium difficile bacteria normally lives in the intestine. However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotics. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon… Any antibiotic can cause this condition. The drugs responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins…”

&amp;gt;So let’s look at the level of antibiotic use in West Africa and the Third World.

Voice of America, February 26, 2014, “…antibiotics have become the automatic choice for treating a child with a fever.”

AAPS (American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists): “For instance, in most areas of West Africa, antibiotics are commonly sold as over-the-counter medications.”

TWN (Third World Network): “…a survey carried out in 1999 showed that nearly one out of two antidiarrheal products in Third World countries contained an unnecessary antibiotic [and chronic diarrhea in the Third World is a leading cause of death, so you can be sure that these antidiarrheal drugs are consumed in great quantities].

“…75 products (including some antibiotics) which had been pulled out or banned in one or more European countries were identified in the Third World in 1991.”

&amp;gt;Of course, banned antibiotics would be exceptionally toxic. In West Africa, antibiotic use is sky-high…and antibiotics do cause bleeding.

&amp;gt;Bleeding where? In the digestive tract.

&amp;gt;In light of that, consider the following excerpt from the healthgrades.com article, [“What is vomiting blood?”](http://www.healthgrades.com/symptoms/vomiting-blood)

“Vomiting blood indicates the presence of bleeding in the digestive tract…Vomiting blood may be caused by many different conditions, and the severity varies among individuals. The material vomited may be bright red or it may be dark colored like coffee grounds…”

&amp;gt;Yes, it turns out that any source of internal bleeding in the digestive tract—such as overuse of antibiotics—can cause a person to vomit blood. “The uniqueness” of “Ebola-blood-vomiting” is a fairy tale.

&amp;gt;What else could cause the “Ebola” bleeding symptom in West Africa?

&amp;gt;We have the fact that organophosphate insecticides are being widely used for indoor spraying, in West African homes and, surely, in clinics, to kill mosquitos. 

&amp;gt;One study reports: “With high DDT resistance present throughout much of West Africa, carbamates and organophosphates are increasingly important alternatives to pyrethroids for indoor residual spraying (IRS).”

&amp;gt;Among the effects, from severe exposure to organophosphates: diarrhea, tremors, staggering gait, blood disorders, death—all of which have been described in reference to Ebola.

&amp;gt;And then there is this: 

“In nine patients suffering from organophosphate intoxication, platelet function and blood coagulation parameters were investigated…In five of nine patients a marked bleeding tendency was observed. The bleeding tendency in organophosphate intoxication is probably mainly caused by the defective platelet function.” (Klin Wochenschur, Sept. 3, 1984;62 (17):814-20, author: m. Zieman)

&amp;gt;Bleeding. Not from a virus.

More info on pesticides in Africa: [Another missing “Ebola” factor: pesticides](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/another-missing-ebola-factor-pesticides/)

&amp;gt;Here is another vital observation: “The distribution and sale of pesticides in West Africa is not effectively regulated. Multiple channels of supply commonly include the repackaging of obsolete or illegal stocks [extremely toxic] and the correspondence between the contents of containers to what is stated on the label is poor…”

&amp;gt;Pesticide suppliers conceal banned pesticides—which they are taking a loss on, because they can’t sell them—and put them inside containers labeled with the names of legal pesticides.

Carborfuran, chloropyrifos, dimethoate, methamidophos, endosulfan...

&amp;gt;These pesticides can and do produce a number of the symptoms called “Ebola:”

&amp;gt;Bleeding, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, stomach pain, coma. But all this is swept aside in the hysteria about The Virus.

&amp;gt;Once you put the virus hypothesis aside—because the standardly used diagnostic tests are useless in determining the presence or quantity of Ebola virus in any patient—you begin to look for other sources that explain what is happening to people in the area who are suffering and dying.

&amp;gt;Combine what I’ve described above with other chronic conditions in West Africa—severe malnutrition, starvation, lack of basic sanitation, grinding poverty, severe overcrowded living conditions, prior immune-suppressing vaccine campaigns—and the result is an ongoing catastrophe.

&amp;gt;A catastrophe that can produce all the symptoms of “Ebola” or a dozen other diseases, without the need of a virus to explain them.

&amp;gt;The “virus” becomes the cover story, used to conceal and sustain what is really going on.

&amp;gt;And at the highest level of control, what is going on is the continued invasion and capture of the land, the resources, and the people.

Only about 20 companies were offering positions in my field(s), and about ten of those 20 were offering internships. I will only look into a full time position if I could start the job after I graduate next spring, and I have an exam the same day in a class that I have no idea how I am doing in (the professor has yet to start grading assignments, I got a 63 on the first exam, but it only counts for 15% of the total grade, and I know I clearly did not do my best on it due to blanking out). This brings me to the question: should I go to the career fair, or spend the day studying?

Not to mention that I'm going to have $900/month student loans kicking in, and I recently had to file bankruptcy to get out of my mortgage here. (the loan was upside down)

I've been googling around here and other sites, and it seems like most of the info is dated. curious to hear first hand accounts of folks trying to save money.

2jwvjs,9,2014-10-21,Extending an offer deadline ~3 months? (but hear me out..),csoffertaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jwvjs/extending_an_offer_deadline_3_months_but_hear_me/,"**Current situation:** I'm interviewing for an an internship at 3-4 well-funded startups in Silicon Valley. The internship would be 4 months long starting in May of next year. The interviews have all gone extremely well, and I'm anticipating at least one offer. I got all of these interviews through a conference I attended a couple weeks ago.



**Some background:** the University I'm attending offers one of the best internship programs in the world, and nearly every big name in tech hires a ton of interns from us every term. This upcoming term is my 4th co-op term, and I was aiming to apply to Google, Facebook, and I have a friend recommending me for a position at Microsoft. I think I have a pretty decent chance at landing one of these. All of these interviews would take place through my school.



**The issue:** if I do receive an offer from one of the SF startups, it would probably be within the next couple weeks. However, the internship process at my school starts January and ends in February, meaning if I do happen to land an interview and offer with a big name, it would still be several months away. My preference would be working at a big name company as opposed to one of these startups.



So my question, is there any way to delay the offers from the startups until I find out if I get an offer from a top company?


Some additional points I'd like to emphasize, illustrating that my circumstances are somewhat different:


* The internships are all starting in May, which is still 7 months away... The reason they're interviewing so early is due to the conference I attended
* They are startups, and don't have a quota of X amount of interns to fill. This is why I believe, if they want me now, they'd be willing to wait for me

EDIT: Another alternative I could do is apply to the top jobs now, outside of my school's system, and hope for an interview soon? "
2jwykj,1,2014-10-21,Recruiter communication problem,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2jwykj/recruiter_communication_problem/,"So, I'm applying for CS internships for next summer. Toward the end of last year I interviewed with a company on-campus. It went well and I got an email from a recruiter a couple of weeks later saying my interviewer was impressed but unfortunately all spots were full for summer 2014, and they would put me on a fast track in the fall for final round interviews on-site in September.

Well, August came and the recruiter didn't answer my emails asking about next steps. He finally answered one in September and said sorry and asked for an updated resume. Then no answer. Two weeks later is our campus career fair. I go and talk to him in person. He apologizes profusely and says he will email me in the next couple of days. He doesn't. I email a week later and ask what's up. Never answers. I email again earlier today. No answer. 

This seems extremely unprofessional to me. All other recruiters I've talked to are really good about answering emails and making me feel like the company actually wants me to work there. I would just give up, but this is a place I really want to work and I feel like I already have a foot in the door since my first interview went really well.

I know there is another recruiter at the company for my school who a friend is talking to about a similar position. She is apparently much more responsive than my recruiter.

What should I do? Just keep emailing my recruiter? Give up? Try contacting my friend's recruiter? I'm becoming extremely frustrated. 

Btw I know this guy still works at the company because I know someone else talking to him who emailed him last week saying he had an offer deadline, and the guy actually got back to him to schedule second round. "

I wanted to thank you for your help and input in my search for an apartment in Tampa, I am finalizing my lease this week. However, I am turning to you guys for some help....again.

I was fortunate to be able to find good work down in Tampa and I am wanting to assist my gf to find a job here as well, so she can be able to move down to Tampa once she is done with college in May. She has applied to multiple places where she found openings online, but I was wondering if anyone here works in a accounting firm that is seeking a tax associate to join their team. She has great experience in both public and corporate accounting and is a straight A student, double majoring in accounting and finance. Upon graduation, she will have 150 credit hours which means she is able to sit for the CPA. She is working as an intern for a fortune 200 company doing sales and use tax, and has a tax internship lined up with a top 10 public accounting firm this upcoming winter. Her dream is to work in tax for the bigger firms. She has opportunities back in Chicago, but we want to move to Tampa together so she is looking for the same opportunities here. I think the best opportunity that she has found so far is with Grant Thornton in Tampa. Since we're not from the area, I believe that a reference from within the company can be a big influence when it comes to getting a job there (I know this from personal experience) or anywhere else.  

I can provide more information such as a resume, cover letter, etc. via PM. If you are able to help, please let me know! We would greatly appreciate it.

I'm a fairly recent graduate from a decent school with a Ph.D in math (analytic number theory). I'm interested in data science from what I've seen- finding patterns in data is something I've been interested in for a long while, and I'm really enjoying the (online) courses I'm currently taking on machine learning and mining massive datasets.

I've taken a smattering of statistics and done a bit of programming in python, though nothing terribly impressive. I'm hoping my mathematics background is enough to make up for deficiencies in programming.

Am I hireable as a data scientist? Should I be looking for internships or something similar (and if so, any recommendations)? I found the Data Incubator and requested an application, but haven't received one (it may be too late for the next session).

And if not, what would you recommend I work on to make myself hireable?

I had an IT internship phone interview this morning and for the most part, I think it went pretty well. One part where I stumbled a bit was where I had to explain my changes in major while in college.

I was a biomedical science major as a freshman, then business in sophomore year and finally in my junior year I decided to go to computer science and minor in business. It sounds so horrible typing it out like that, but that's essentially what I did. I know I'm going to stay in computer science because I'm loving the courses I'm taking and I am just itching to get experience in a professional environment.

But I'm a junior taking introductory courses right now. I have basically all of my core requirements completed so the rest of the time I'm here I'm going to be taking CS related courses. I clarified that in the interview. My experiences in internships/organizations on campus are pretty good too but none of them are focused around computer science (until I joined our computing society the beginning of this semester.)

How can I make myself a strong candidate for my next interview tomorrow morning?"

2jxg8h,3,2014-10-21,Credit score question for a soon to be engaged college student,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jxg8h/credit_score_question_for_a_soon_to_be_engaged/,"Hello all!

Me and my girlfriend are currently working towards being engaged at the end of this upcoming school year (May 2015). I came from a family that didn't believe in using credit cards growing up, so I never had one. I received a full tuition scholarship towards engineering school and haven't paid anything to go to college. Soon I'll be graduating with a bachelors in Chemical Engineering and applying for jobs this winter.

My girlfriend is also an engineer. We met at the same school and she currently has a job at UPS as an Industrial Engineer. She has a credit card and uses it currently to build her credit score by buying things like groceries, etc on a regular basis and paying the full amount off at the end of the month with her checking account.

Since we're getting married soon, neither of us want to be reliant on our parents for cosigning for larger purchases (houses, whatever). I have no clue what my credit score is (I assume it's 0 since I haven't had a credit card). What I do have is a year's of job experience from an internship at a large chemical plant where I made a large sum of money. I've been living self sufficiently from my job paying off my lease (that me and 2 other guys that I'm currently living with cosigned together on) with that money I made. Currently I am not working at the internship, but I'm still living off that money. We're pretty cheap when it comes to buying things.

My real question is what's the best way to build up a credit score? What steps do I need to pursue to make sure me and her don't have any problems with larger purchases (cars, houses, yachts, multi million dollar helicopters, etc) down the road?

Any other recommendations would be greatly appreciated. I'm a very stingy person when it comes to money, so I really don't spend much. I always figured that was the smart way to manage my finances, but apparently not having a credit score is worse than having a low credit score. Please help Reddit!"
2jxhax,16,2014-10-21,It's time to leave,Notorious_PUG,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2jxhax/its_time_to_leave/,"I'm really glad this subreddit exists. I just want to get my story off my chest and hopefully it'll help with the process (and perhaps give you all something to relate to).

I started smoking seriously about two years ago, as a way of coping with some serious emotional pain. In April 2012, I was on top of the world. I had just been hired for an amazing job at the London Olympics. I was back together with (what I thought was) the love of my life and I'd be moving to Amsterdam after the games where we would both take our masters degree in law together. And, to top it all off, I'd be going trekking in Vietnam for a month before my job started.

Then, as soon as I landed in Asia, things started going wrong. My grandmother, whom I was incredibly close to, suddenly got ill and died. I could only say goodbye to her over the phone, which I will always regret. I flew home for the funeral, and I hadn't been home a week before my girlfriend told me she wanted to break up. That week, which I can only hope was the worst one I will ever go through, broke me.

I was still madly in love with the girl who ditched me when the uni course started, and we were reunited in class. We sort of hung out again, even had some fun times, but jealousy drove me half insane. I was so tense whenever I had to sit through a lecture with her next to me that my heart was still pounding for an hour afterwards. Being in Amsterdam, where there are dispensaries on pretty much every fucking corner, I started smoking weed after lectures to help me calm down a bit. 

Weed was a great escape. It allowed my mind to fly up in the sky and not worry about all the misery I was going through every day. I never smoked during the day, but I'd spend all day looking forward to lighting up around seven with a beer, eating a munchies dinner and watching netflix in bed all night long. It was my safe haven.

However, 'one joint after lectures with the ex' (twice a week) started turning into multiple times a week, then every night, then two to three joints a night at my worst. The haze came into my brain, and slowly  became a veil of emptiness. I was no longer sad all day. I was no longer anything. I couldn't feel much unless I'd had a joint. I was still nominally on my uni course (you can pretty much study for as long as you want in Holland, it's very cheap) but I wasn't taking any classes and I basically spent the second half of 2013 doing nothing all day except play video games, surf the web and toke up. 

I did manage to pull myself together this year. I managed to reduce my habit to 2-3 joints a week and I'm now down to very mild hash instead of super-strength haze. I got an internship at an awesome law firm, I kicked ass at it and they hired me to stay on for most of the year. I wrote my thesis and started my first 'real' (full-time, long term) job today. My (new) girlfriend is an amazing person, beautiful, smart and so very sweet; and also someone whom I know will stand by me no matter what. On the surface, life is great.

However, I still feel very numb inside most of the time. I'm very scared that it will never go away, that I will be forever stuck in weed limbo, where nothing is ever good or bad or happy or sad or fun or normal. I long so much to feel normal again, and I feel the only chance of normal I have is to quit smoking entirely. 

So, let this be my declaration, Reddit. I will not smoke any more weed in my life. I am DONE, and I cannot ever go back or I will hate myself for it forever. If you have any stories of kicking the habit and coming out stronger afterwards, I would love to hear from you. And I want to support you too, because we are all in this together. Wish me luck, as I do to you.

I go up to them and see what they are up to, realize they have taken your clothes and bikini while you were showering in the girls locker room. I take the clothes and send them away, handing them back to you around the locker room door. However, while you're changing in the locker room, I notice a baggie of pot fell out of your clothes. I question you about it when you come out of the locker room, fully dressed, and tell you I have to search your room. Once we're up in your room I search your things and find a lot more contraband. Enough to call your parents and send you home...

**Job Interview with Friend's Dad**
I am a powerful lawyer, used to getting my way and walking all over those I view as weaker. You would be one of my daughter's friends who is looking for an internship or full time job. You've had a great deal of trouble finding work and, out of desperation and even though my presence has terrified and intimidated you ever since you can remember, you ask your friend if she will ask me to at least interview you. I very reluctantly agree to at least interview you. As the interview starts I don't show much interest but as it progresses, I realize just how weak and easily manipulatable you are and begin to use my leverage and intimidating presence to use you sexually and turn you into my personal and company slut.

**TV Audition with Lead Actor**
I am a famous movie star actor who has agreed to do an HBO or Showtime TV show but only under the condition that I get the right to reject any of my co-stars. You are a young teenage actress, just moving from the midwest to pursue your acting career. Against all odds you've landed the part to play my daughter on the TV show. Now, the only thing standing in the way of a part on this prestigious TV show that could make your career, is your interview with me. You come to my trailer on set, nervous and anxious, knowing this is your one chance at the career you've always dreamed of. 

**Prospective Student on First College Visit**
You're the naive prospective college student making her first college visit. I am your tour guide. I notice you are by yourself and seem a bit shy so I make a point of walking with you on the tour, acting very personable and charming. Helping to ease your nerves about being on your own and visiting colleges. After the tour I invite you to a party that my friends are having later that evening. I tell you it will be good for you to make some friends before you start so you have a leg up on all of the other freshman. You hesitate but eventually accept, telling yourself that you really have to put yourself out there now that you're about to be in college. You arrive at the party later that night and...

Just a few ideas. Many more and interested in scenes and roles you would like to play.

Look forward to hearing from you."

2jxpon,3,2014-10-21,"Starting IT career, should I take the offers I have or hold out?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2jxpon/starting_it_career_should_i_take_the_offers_i/,"Hello r/careerguidance! I am happy to see this subreddit exists! I am stuck trying to make some really big decisions in my new fledgling IT career and really need to know if it is the right thing to do.


Background, current skills:
I am 28, and have worked in restaurants for the past 6 years. I am in my second quarter at a local community college going for the ATA in IT. I only have a single MTA cert under my belt but to finish school I will have the A+, Net+, Sec+, a handful of other MTA's, CCENT, and CCNA. I will have all of these within a year of now at present speed. Straight A student currently, and volunteering to help the Center for Disability Services for IT on the side, and helping the community college to set up a SAN in the near future. Given the opportunity, I want to work with virtualization or networks (ambiguous I know, I haven't truely decided but definitely not geek squad!). I live in Western Washington where there are a lot of industry related jobs.


The questions:
I have 2 current opportunities; one is an unpaid internship in computer hardware repair and the other is a paid internal position with the restaurant chain I work at as IT (90% hardware, minimal skill). The catch for the paid position is I have to stay at my current restaurant gig on the weekends for the 1 year commitment this job requires. Neither are really ideal or relevant to what I am trying to do. I dont want to keep working in the restaurant as my position has made me develop hip problems that have caused major pain on my back, hips, and legs. Physical therapy says I have to quit that job to get better. Do I take either? Do I hold out for something better? If I take one, my fear is I will be unable to grab a better job if it comes along. 


Another question is how can I be proactive in being more visible to prospective employers? I've made a website documenting all my recent endeavors that are relevant. It would be nice to get a possible employers perspective to see if this is worth maintaining or even a good idea. Here's the link: http://stevenbaron.net


Long winded, yikes! Got a lot on my mind here. Any input or advice is appreciated."
2jxw03,1,2014-10-21,Help Marketing an App Specific to my College Campus? Specifically Bar-Goers,LousyIntern,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2jxw03/help_marketing_an_app_specific_to_my_college/,"Hey r/marketing!

I am a college student in a college town where every major bar charges a cover charge ($5).  This cover charge is cash-only, and many of us students have to go to the ATM (usually the night of) just for cash to pay our cover.  Between the inconvenience and the huge fees, I became very frustrated.

So I created Gulp, the easy way to pay your cover.  Simply scan a personalized QR code on your smartphone at the door and you are charged to your credit/debit card!

Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/gulpcomo
(Started a week ago, I think I'm doing well)

Website: http://www.getgulp.com/
(Threw this together, temporary)

So far, we have most of the major bars signed on and word seems to be getting around campus quick.  People are excited.  However, I am really trying to ensure that EVERYONE is aware when it drops mid-November.  If there aren't enough patrons using it, bars will see no point in continuing with the hassle.

I think I'm on the right track with social media.  On twitter and instagram I am simply mass following the people following the major bars in the area, then a few days later I unfollow those who didn't follow back and rinse/repeat.  I post about 4-5 entertainment pieces then 1 post relevant to my app.

I also brought on 3 ""unpaid interns,"" cute girls who like the concept and are willing to help in whatever way for free dinners, drinks, and trips to other campuses when we start spreading.  We've been going out to the lines to get into the bars and just striking up conversations about our app.  That has gone surprisingly well.

We will be passing out flyers around the bars/ATM's at night and intend to have some stands around campus with a local root beer company, having a big sign that reads ""free beer"" then giving out cups of root beer for downloads.

That's the plan so far!  I'm not too great at this.  Luckily word seems to be getting around rather organically.  Any advice would be much appreciated!"

African-American male.
Born in South Africa (Maintain South African Citizenship).
Junior at small liberal college (Linfield College).
3.2 GPA but will get it up to at least a 3.3 and most likely 3.4(Still have 4 semesters to work extremely hard).
Interning at Amazon for 6 months as a Financial Analyst.
Started  the Entrepreneurship club at my school.
Developed a website for my school that helps students find internships.
Developing an app that will be on the app store in 2 months.

I plan on doing more side projects and most likely will work corporate for a brand named company (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc) then pursue an MBA. I am currently studying for the GMAT and doing as much preparation as I can. I know that my GPA is my weak point because I have focused on extracurricular activities instead of school, but I have switched my focus towards academics. I am on track for a 3.8 this semester, and plan on doing well for my next 4 semesters. With all this being said, what are my chances of getting into a top MBA program? What advice do you have other than high GMAT scores and a higher GPA?

2jy8hh,192,2014-10-21,Layer what? I don't see that on the OSI model...,jwhardcastle,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2jy8hh/layer_what_i_dont_see_that_on_the_osi_model/,"I was waiting for /u/thefultonhow to post this, but he seems to be otherwise occupied.  Could be he's wallowing because our intern quit today.  Something about her driving 100+ miles one way every day just to get to work was driving her crazy, I guess.

This is sort of a two-parter, in that yesterday's ""oopsie"" led to today's phone system outage, but they are seemingly unrelated at first.

Yesterday morning I'm sitting in the cafeteria with our **Assistant Director** enjoying a delicious cinnamon walnut sticky bun  (*mmmmm!*) and waiting for a presentation to begin when my phone starts buzzing with a message from **The Network Guy**.

&gt; TNG: What's going on there?  Monitoring things remotely.  Massive slowdowns on the network.  Equipment flapping, up and down.

This happens maybe once a year and we all know immediately what the likely culprit is: someone somewhere on our 50+ building K-12 campus has created a network loop.  Housekeeping will ""bump"" something with a vacuum cleaner and then try to plug things back in, not realizing the cable they just plugged in on one side of the classroom is plugged into the network drop on the other side of the room too.

&gt; Me: AD, can you head back to the office and man the phones?  Let folks know we are going to be slow until we find the loop.  TNG is debugging remotely, and I'm going to go check some likely culprits.

Luckily TNG still has enough bandwidth on his remote desktop to get into the network core, and I start checking the new mini-switch on the printers in the admissions office, the old lab that's been converted to a study hall, and other places with networking equipment that isn't secured in a locked closet.  Meanwhile, /u/thefultonhow is just arriving on schedule.

&gt; TFH: I'll head down to the data center to start physically unplugging buildings from the core if that is deemed necessary.

After 15 minutes, as I'm becoming increasingly insistent that TNG let TFH start chopping our network into smaller pieces, TNG finally narrows down the problem to a brand new building, the central plant, where our facilities director has been struggling with the **HVAC** contractor to get our heating and cooling under control.  HVAC had insisted that our new $75 million buildings come with a fancy new network-connected system, and had promptly provided a ""server"" (chintzy $400 workstation-grade tower squeezed into the dustiest corner of the new central plant) that was supposed to monitor the buildings and the HVAC equipment.  TFH and I rush over to unplug whatever nonsense HVAC has created.  I arrived last.

&gt; TFH: You shouldn't just start randomly plugging things into a network that isn't yours, especially if you don't know what you're doing, and especially 10 minutes into your first day on the job at a new site.

&gt; HVAC: No, you don't understand, that wire needs to be connected or nothing works.  All the heat in the buildings shuts down.  If 3 isn't connected to 15, nothing works.

HVAC, who is a third-party vendor to our third-party vendor, tries to explain how connecting port 3 on our Cisco switch to port 15 is the only way to make his system come online.  Sure enough, when we pull the 1-foot cable out of the switch, all the little lights on his screen go dark.

&gt; Me: No, **you** don't understand.  What you're describing is impossible.  It cannot be necessary that this cable be plugged into both locations at once.  Something else is wrong, and in the meantime you've taken the entire campus offline, including our phones.  We have no 911 right now.

After a few minutes on the phone with TNG (which was tricky because you have to prop the doors to the building open to get even a single bar of cell service in there) we figured out what was going on.  Port 3 on our fancy Cisco switch had gone bad, died a tragic death, likely because of the dirt floating around in the environment.  Port 3 was earmarked for the HVAC ""server,"" and so someone (neither of the two gentlemen who were standing before us, they claimed) had moved the ""server"" from port 3 to port 4.  Of course the two ports were on two different VLANs, as we had segregated all of the HVAC crap into their own network segment.  When HVAC arrived on site, he saw a loose wire, saw an empty slot in port 3, and connected port 3 to the rest of our network.  This injected all of the HVAC traffic into our network (where the server was now located), but also created a loop on the voice VLAN, which knocked out the phones and created a broadcast storm across all the Cisco gear on campus.

When we got back to the office, we were discussing the issue.

&gt; TNG: It's layer 2 or 3, the packet layer.  This is why we having spanning tree, but portfast sort of kills that.

&gt; TFH: Naw, it's layer 1, he screwed up by wiring two different pieces of the network together.

&gt; TNG (joking): What we really need is layer 7 monitoring of every packet on the network.  We should be able to filter this out.

&gt; TFH (joking): No, layer 8!

&gt; TNG: What's layer 8?

&gt; Me: The human.

Part 2 tomorrow, in which TNG spends 7 hours on the phone with VOIP vendor support trying to convince them to take responsibility for the gear we paid them for."
2jyb7i,36,2014-10-21,"Graduation coming soon, feel like I am stuck or under-qualified for entry level development work.",brandtb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jyb7i/graduation_coming_soon_feel_like_i_am_stuck_or/,"I realize my question is a little general, so let me get into specifics:

I'm 32, and I am in my senior year at my university, completing a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I have 8 classes left, and since I have to attend part-time, this means I roughly have about a year and a half to go. Currently I work for a very large health system; one that has a large hospital at it's core, and various clinics spread throughout the towns around it. My current job role is as an Analyst for the Help Desk that supports the main software that the health system uses for charting. It's entry level IT work, but my starting salary for this position was a nice bump from my previous career choice (I started at 40k).

I've got a family (wife, 2 young children) that rely solely on me for financial support. This whole trek back into college has been an effort on all our parts to make it work, and the end is on the horizon. I've never regretted the choice to go back, especially now that I am almost done. Needless to say it has been a challenge.

I read a few posts on here about students that have attended Job Fairs, found gainful internships through the summer, and were either called back to work at those companies on graduation or had sufficient experience that they gained an entry level developer job shortly after. I constantly browse through the career portal of my current employer, looking at jobs that are available and some times I do see posts for entry level positions. As my date for graduation closely approaches, I feel that my choices and options are pretty limited, for a couple of reasons:

1. Internships don't normally come with benefits, and usually the interns are paid less than what I am now.
2. Most entry level development jobs still require some form of hands-on experience, and I do not have this experience.

Obviously the statements about internships are based on hearsay; I can't very well ask each company I see post an opening for one what they pay and how their benefits compare to my own (unless I interview I suppose). But then there is the issue of it possibly being temporary as well.

I've worked with the languages that my university has taught me all through my 4 year college career (Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I am far from a master, but I think I have a really good grip on them. But I feel that this isn't the type of ""experience"" that is being sought. I've only ever used my own code, individual work, and my projects have been completely based on assignment requirements, so there really isn't anything to show for that work. Plus I have no idea where the development cycle starts or ends for a piece of software.

Expanding on my initial question, *What sort of job should I expect to be qualified for after graduation?* Am I being too hard on myself with my exposure to development, and am I being too close minded about what could be available to me? Is a campus career fair still the best start at this point (or maybe closer to graduation)?

Always appreciate the advice that is given here, there has been a lot of insight shared. Please feel free to ask any questions if something seems too vague, I lurk here often. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Wow thanks very much for all of the comments, and fanning the flame of my confidence. It has been rough not being around the family as much as I'd like, and I was starting to dread graduation simply because of the possibility that I hadn't been on the right path near the end. Now I'm looking forward to it even more!

2jysnu,4,2014-10-22,"I'm a perfectionist, and it's slowly ruining me.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2jysnu/im_a_perfectionist_and_its_slowly_ruining_me/,"I had a really fun first date last Sunday. I met her on Tinder, and believe it or not, she goes to the same college that I do. Conversation flowed like water from a spigot. This girl had a lot going on, and seemed really passionate about her life goals.

I left the date feeling refreshed, and I always enjoy that feeling. So as these things usually progress, today I decided to ask her out again. I shot her a text to go to a local museum this Sunday around 10 AM this morning. It's now been almost twelve hours, and there hasn't been a response. I know she saw it. How? Obsessively checking my phone, and then checking Tinder and seeing she had been active. After the umpteenth time I checked my phone, I mentally decided to write her off. She was interesting, but I guess she didn't feel the same way about me. I was, of course, disappointed, but life goes on.

*Realization: I care too much about this.*

One date with one girl is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. I could meet many other girls here at college, and see where things progressed with them. Rejections are a part of life, and eventually I'll meet somebody who I truly click with, and who truly clicks with me.

But it's really difficult to meet people when you're a busy college student. I'm a sophomore, so cliques have already been generated and solidified. Either I'm too busy to introduce myself to others, or I'm too uncomfortable to do it, because I'm afraid of breaking the social norm. I know, people naturally enjoy meeting others, and a friendly conversation wouldn't be turned down by the average person, but it doesn't help that it takes a significant amount of effort to break the social barrier.

I beat myself up over not meeting new people. Almost every morning, I wake up and think, ""I'm going to meet somebody new today!"" I try to energize myself, in an attempt to radiate my good vibes to people sitting around me. But nope, as soon as I enter a classroom, my mind shifts gears, and I end up talking to the one person I know in that class, or as with most of my classes, nobody, because I don't know anyone. It's already week ten of a sixteen week semester, wouldn't it be weird if I introduced myself to people now? When I leave the classroom, I end up thinking, ""you could have done better.""

*Realization: I care too much in general.*

This self-deprecation doesn't stop with just my social life. If I don't receive perfect marks on my tests, I bring myself down into a downward spiral that doesn't motivate me to do better, rather it makes me think, ""why try?"" I'm currently looking for internships in the summer, and each email rejection is another blow to my ego.

But the fact is, I'm not doing too bad for myself from an objective standpoint. I'm maintaining B+ to A- level grades. I just passed two phone interviews for a software company, and I'm being flown out on their dime for an in-person interview. And just two months ago, I got out of a six month relationship, the breakup being initiated solely by me, because I wanted to play the field. And I've successfully done that at some parties, getting the occasional drunk hookup.

But it's not good enough. I could do better in school. I could have more interviews, so I can have a wider range of offers. 

I could lose more weight.

I could start working out.

I could put more effort into my part-time job.

I could tell my friends I care about them more.

I could educate myself more on political issues.

I could join a club on campus.

I could be going on that second date.

*Realization: I'm a perfectionist.*

*Realization: It's slowly ruining me.*

My life is becoming an obsession with any and everything. If any facet of my life isn't going perfectly to my standards, I become extremely disappointed, and start thinking about how I'm useless, how I'm a failure, how I could be doing better if I just tried more. Could I stand to lose more weight? Sure. Is it so important that nothing else matters? No.

My fixation with that second date prevented me from focusing on my homework, and as a consequence I might have to skip some key items, meaning I won't meet my standard for homework either. It's all a balancing act, and my multi-faceted obsession prevents any sort of balance.

I can't truly say that I'm an unhappy person, because I wouldn't be pursuing such ambitious life goals if I wasn't optimistic about my ability to reach them. But the stress of my constant self-pressure is beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I need to inject some balance into my life, and learn the essence of prioritization, or things will just get worse.

*Realization: I need to let go.*

Things in life don't need to be perfect. It's great to strive for success, but letting the goal of success take over every fiber of my being just drains my willpower to do anything at all. I have to learn that the little things in life really don't matter that much, and I should take joy in the fact that I can even experience them, rather than let myself be consumed by the constant buzzing in my ears, ""you could do better.""

But it's hard. Unlearning a constant lifetime of perfectionist goal-setting is going to be a process. Letting go of my impossibly high standards feels like letting go of a child that I've raised and cared for into a dark, murky ocean, not sure whether it'll sink or swim. But I have to do this. It's for the better of my daily and overall health.

2jyu76,2,2014-10-22,Pursuing second degree in CS. Currently senior in Biology major.,dats_cool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2jyu76/pursuing_second_degree_in_cs_currently_senior_in/,"Hey all,

I'm a Biology major on the pre-medical track but I'm having heavy doubts about medical school. I've always been interested in CS but never seriously entertained the idea until recently. I can complete a second bachelor's degree in CS from a state university in 2 years directly after graduation (I would start the program Fall of 2015). Most of the pre-requisites for CS aligned with the pre-medical track; I would only need to complete Intro to Programming and Calculus 2 which I can take this summer (I graduate in spring with a B.S. in Biology). I will graduate with relatively little debt (&lt;10k) with my current degree. 

Does this seem like a wise decision? I'm worried about the job market in a few years as some speculate that an over-saturation of CS grads will make salaries fall and jobs more difficult to obtain. What can I do to maximize my chances for success in this field aside from obtaining internships and working on side-projects? Would pursuing an M.S. in CS be worthwhile? I'm also not interested in pursuing Bioinformatics as some have already suggested this career path to individuals that are in similar circumstances as I am. 

Thanks!"
2jyucn,14,2014-10-22,The Summer Slave,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2jyucn/the_summer_slave/,"In the mid-seventies I found myself away from home and living on the campus of a large university. My first semester was spent focusing on academics and trying to maintain a straight A average. It was during my spring semester that I met Michael, and my life changed for the worst. But first a bit of backstory...

I loved to read anything science fiction, and my favorite author was Isaac Asimov. My love of reading was satiated by monthly trips to a flea market where I would buy a box of books from a certain guy with whom I became friends - as much as a man three times my age and a sixteen year old girl can. We had an arrangement. He would sell me a box of science fiction and fantasy books for a fourth the price that he would sell them to anyone else. I would read the books, keep the ones I liked, and return the rest. On one particular Saturday he was overwhelmed with customers and told me to grab the box in the back of his booth with my name on it. The box had come from an estate sell, and he had not yet sorted the books. Since the box was not guaranteed to contain only science fiction, he let me have it for free as long as I promised to bring back the books I did not want.

It was in this box that I would discover books that would change my outlook on life forever.

Within the box I found old favorites from Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. Yet most of the books were westerns or mystery novels; nothing that I wanted to read. But there were other books that caught my attention. Books by John Norman. The Gor series. And among them a single, well-worn novel that still rests on my bookshelf today by Pauline Reage. The Story of O.

Until that moment my fantasies of romance were created by Harlequin novels bought by my mother and stashed in a box in her closet. I would sneak one out at a time and read it while giggling under my bedcovers. My dreams consisted of bare chested princes rippling with dark muscles who rescued me from evil captors and took me to live on lush estates in the country. I would spend the rest of my life happily married with dozens of children.

But these new books gave me a glimpse of other possibilities. Instead of a life as a princess I could be a slave. I could be chained and made to serve. Whipped for the smallest infractions. And my body taken whenever my owners so desired.

Once in college and away from the eyes of my parents, I wanted to explore those ideas. I wanted to be dominated. I wanted to be made to submit. I wanted to be taken.

After a few false starts with guys who were turned off by even hints of what I wanted to try, I met a guy named Michael. Michael was a junior majoring in business administration. He was handsome and self-confident. Most of all he displayed interest in me; it was not something I was used to.

A few weeks after our first date he took my virginity. Not long after that I hinted that I would be interested in his tying me up, and to my delight he was enthusiastic about it. Then we tried blindfolds. And then gags made of a sock stuffed into another sock and tied around my head. I was giddy with excitement! I had found someone who understood me!

By the end of the spring semester I gave him my copy of The Story of O to read and explained I wanted to be like O. I wanted to submit; I wanted Michael to dominate me.

That summer I did not return home; instead I moved in with Michael despite my parents’ protests and threats to not help pay for my following school year. But I loved him. And I was going to be his.

Michael bought me a dog collar which I wore any time I was in the apartment regardless of who was there. I was so proud at first and acted as if it were an engagement ring. He had claimed me! I was his! We began to explore setting rules and punishments. I worked part-time on campus over the summer which allowed me to be back home when Michael was there so that I could serve him.

More times than not that service took the form of sex. At first the sex was your typical intercourse. Very soon I was introduced to the chore of giving oral sex; it was not something I enjoyed but did because I was commanded to. I cooked and did much of the cleaning around the apartment. In retrospect I was indeed his slave.

Then, about mid-summer, the girl came. Cynthia was gorgeous. She was the kind of girl that turned men’s heads when she walked into the room. Michael introduced her as a coworker, a fellow intern; he had an internship that would eventually turn into a full-time position when graduated. It quickly became clear there was more between them than just friendship.

It was three weeks before the fall semester when I began to question where this relationship was going and if I truly wanted to be in it. Cynthia and Michael were sitting on the sofa making out while I sat nearby trying to read. This had become a regular occurrence, but I suffered through it as Michael would have sex with me once she left. At least I still had that part of our relationship.

“Come here,” Cynthia told me. Michael had told me I was to obey Cynthia as I would him.

Closing my book I came to stand before the pair. I was all too aware of the leather encircling my neck.

“I want you to give my boyfriend a blowjob.”

The words stung like a slap across the face. Her boyfriend! He loved me! We had been together longer!

I looked at Michael and saw the eagerness in his eyes. Hurriedly he unzipped his pants and retrieved his erect manhood. Swallowing what little pride I had, I knelt between his legs and took him in my mouth. Cynthia leaned over, and the pair continued to kiss while I gave him a blowjob.

In moments he cum, and I swallowed his seed as commanded. Then I saw the glint in Cynthia’s eyes and felt my stomach drop.

She kicked off her shoes and stood. In moments her jeans and white panties lay on the floor next to the sofa, and she sat with her thighs parted. I was staring at a bush of blonde hair.

“Eat me.”

I looked up at Michael in hopes he would put an end to this. I felt tears form in my eyes when I saw the opposite; he was excited to see what I would do.

I loved him so much. He was the first guy to show interest in my kinky side; previous guys had acted like I had a disease that was catching or a mental illness. I had dreamed that he and I would be together forever. But now… I saw the truth of it in his eyes.

He was looking expectantly at me. Cynthia sat waiting with her thighs apart and here bottom on the edge of the sofa. I felt the black leather collar around my neck. I thought of the harsh words I had exchanged with my parents. Not knowing what else to do, I leaned forward and kissed Cynthia’s pussy.

“Shit!” Michael exclaimed. “Oh shit!”

Cynthia gasped and closed her eyes; her fingers clutched the edge of the sofa as I pleasured her. In the end she cried out as she orgasmed and clutched my head. When it was over she exclaimed in an awe filled voice that that was the best orgasm she had ever experienced. I suppose it was meant to make me feel good about what I had just done.

Twice more before the fall semester Cynthia asked me to pleasure her. Once Michael was there, and the other time she stopped by in the middle of the day on one of my off days. Both times I knelt before her and brought her to a climax.

Yet the final straw came two days before the fall semester began.

I was excited about the prospect of moving out of Michael’s apartment and back into a dorm. Cynthia had become a regular in the apartment, and she and Michael were no longer content to limit their physical contact to kissing. On the nights she stayed over I slept on the sofa and listened to them have sex. On the other nights I slept with Michael and had sex with him, but it was not the same.

Michael told me that he was having a few friends over after work. I ordered pizzas and cleaned up the apartment while he was at work so that everything was perfect when he came home. That evening four of Michael’s friends arrived, and the five of them settled down to play poker. With nothing else to do, I retreated to the bedroom to read.

After an hour or so I heard Michael call my name. I walked from the bedroom to find five sets of eyes on me.

“Take your clothes off,” Michael said.

My cheeks reddened. “Please. I really…”

“Take your clothes off,” he repeated firmly. “Or I will have to spank you for disobeying.”

My face turned beet red at the snickers around the table. With everyone staring at me, I stripped down to only my collar. The guys stared openly at my nude body with a hungry look.

“I told you so,” Michael bragged.

“Shit! My girlfriend would cut my dick off if I told her to do that.”

Michael nodded to one of his friends. “Steven has won thirty minutes with you.”

I was speechless. He had bet me like some whore. I was furious. I was hurt, but I was burning with white hot anger.

“Fine. Let’s get this over with.” I turned and went back into the bedroom.

There were hoots and jeers made as Steven came in the bedroom and closed the door. I stretched out on the bed and waited for him to climb atop me.

“I’m guessing you don’t want to do this,” he asked.

“It doesn’t matter what I want. Michael told me to fuck you. So let’s get it over with. I want to finish my book.”

Steven sat on the bed. “What are you reading?”

I blinked. “What?”

“What are you reading?”

Not sure what to think I held up the book Second Foundation. I was rereading the Foundation series.

“What’s it about,” Steven asked. His eyes glanced at my naked body before returning to my face.

When I didn’t answer, he sighed. “Look. I get thirty minutes with you. That doesn’t mean we have to have sex. We can just talk.”

And we did. I pulled a sheet over my nude form, and we talked about the upcoming fall semester. I felt myself relax and enjoy myself as I had not since moving in with Michael. Steven glanced at his watch, and my heart began to sink knowing our time was up.

“Look Jane. You shouldn’t let Michael treat you like this. You’re obviously a smart girl. Your pretty. You have a lot going for you. You can do better than him.”

It was the nicest thing anyone had said to me in months. “Thanks,” I replied. I leaned up and kissed him lightly on the lips.

Twice more Steven won me. The second time we lay on the bed talking about whatever came to mind. Our goals for the future, our families, our friends, our past, and so on. It was on the third visit that I asked if he would like to have sex. In the end he agreed to let me give him a blowjob, which I happily did. He had made me feel good about myself and see the situation I was in.

Once the night was over, it turned out Steven had won most of the money from the group. Almost two hundred dollars. As the group was dispersing, he caught me alone.

“Here,” he said and pressed something into my hand.

Before I could say anything or ask, he hurried out the door. In my hand were his winnings. I broke down in tears.

The following day I went to campus and paid my tuition, and with the money Steven had given me, I paid for a dorm on campus. Two days later I moved out of Michael’s apartment and never spoke to him again. There is a box in the attic that contains that dog collar that I wore for over three months. It serves as a reminder of the lowest point in my life."
2jyz3y,2,2014-10-22,Me [21/M] need advice to ask her [22/F] out. Met online. Lives in same city,taking_it_forward,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2jyz3y/me_21m_need_advice_to_ask_her_22f_out_met_online/,"I met this girl online on Twitter back in April. I was quite surprised when she found me on Facebook and added me and started getting chatty with me. Initially, tbh I didn't have any feelings and was just friendly with her (I mean she was just a random stranger I met). I was in another city during the summer for an internship and soon, we exchanged numbers and we used to chat a lot on WhatsApp.

She passed out of UG and had some time before she joined a job. As we talked and talked and got to know each other, I started liking her. There were qualities in her which I really appreciated. I'm quite a honest guy when talking to people and I give *in-your-face* feedback and she actually liked that and thanked me for not mincing words. 

Once I came back, I tried to tell her come to my university (I'm in final year) so that we could meet. Before you judge me, the reason I can't go is because I'm in a wheelchair and Mumbai isn't a very accessible travel place plus I stay with my parents and I don't want them to know this. Not so early! But the thing is, once I came back, she joined her job and quickly got very very busy.

Now, the problem is this. Through the course of one conversation, she said she doesn't like dating guys younger to her. She also doesn't like guys who drink, smoke or do drugs. Now, I don't smoke or drink or do drugs but I'm 15 months younger. I want advice from you guys on how to change her mind and make her more open to the idea of dating a guy younger to her.

She generally seems very open and keeps telling about her problems at work and asks me for advice and all that. I feel I can make this work but I have this big age barrier in front of me. Also, she has had 2 relationships before and I have had none (just crushes, nothing more). After her 2nd breakup (happened after I met her but I didn't know at that time), she asked me my views on equal rights for women and all and I told of course, both genders are equal. Turns out she dumped that guy because he told her he won't treat her equally after getting married. She said she liked the way I think.

So now, everything seems to be in place except this age barrier. We are trying to fix up a date to meet but she has been very busy at work and I haven't pushed her much as she hasn't been very free. Please help me Reddit! This is my first crush which actually seems to have a chance of going forward and from whatever I have analysed till now, she seems a pretty good human being

2jz0f4,1,2014-10-22,What to write to learn?,katzee,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/2jz0f4/what_to_write_to_learn/,"I'm really sorry if this is a recurring question, I couldn't find evidence. 

I am new to python but not COMPLETELY new to programming itself (I'm definitely bad though). Years ago I joined a company as a sort of intern and they decided to have me programming their Web application on .NET even though I had no idea how to program at the time... Boy that was fun. Even though Visual Studio helped a lot, I had to learn from the ground up by googling, reading, thinking and I was motivated by having to create this application. The day I got it working (even though badly) and the company started using it for business was amazing. I really felt like I had created something. 

Now I work on Linux only and I'm not involved in programming for a long time but I want to include python in my skillset but that's my problem: I don't have something to code to motivate me. I have looked for open source projects small enough for me to be able to contribute but I can't find any. 

Does anybody know anything like that? Or has some idea? Or, as a last choice, a good website with a list of exercises? "
2jz3dk,65,2014-10-22,I might not be leaving yet...,myuppvoteaccount,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2jz3dk/i_might_not_be_leaving_yet/,"I took the advice here and went for an ultrasound.

To be honest, I had a hunch that something wasn't quite right. 

* The sac came out so fast with no cramping and the bleeding stopped by morning. This was *very* different from my first miscarriage two years ago. 

* The sac (which included an umbilical cord) was much larger than I thought it should be based on my estimate of the pregnancy at 4-5 weeks.

* I still felt pregnant.

But I didn't tell the nurse on the phone that I wanted an ultrasound based on a ""hunch."" I told her that I previously miscarried triplets and that I was worried that this miscarriage was incomplete despite the bleeding having stopped. 

I had to explain to the nurse on the phone that I'm transgender (my gender is marked as male in the e-journal system) and she had a positive but inappropriate response. No, lady, it's actually not nice to tell me how ""cool"" you think me being a man with a uterus when I'm telling you about my miscarriage. 

The way the hospitals are set up here in Stockholm, there are different emergency rooms for different problems. Sure, there's a general one, but if one has a miscarriage that's not where one goes. One goes to the gynecology emergency (I live in a major city, this probable not the set up in rural areas). So I go there with my partner and take a number. 

I see a nurse and explain everything again. She has me pee in a cup and wait for the doctor.

My doctor ends up being a young guy fresh out of med school. Seriously, this must have been his first year of residency or maybe even his internship. The kid is not older than 25 (Swedes finish med school at 24). Adrian swears he was smirking and thought it was funny that he was meeting a male patient in the gynecology emergency room. I dismissed the initial attitude as him having just left a conversation with colleagues and hadn't put on his professional face yet (ie I didn't take it personally). While this might be fascinating and funny for the healthcare professional, it's kind of, you know, a horribly tragic time for me having just lost a baby.

Anyway, he snapped out of it and was very kind and gentle about the exam which involved an intravaginal ultrasound. So in the middle of the ultrasound he asks me to repeat the size of of the sac that came out and tell him about what it looked like agian, so I did, qualifying it with how I hadn't had a menstural cycle so I could only guess at the age of the pregnancy. Honestly, the kid had to stop himself from chewing his bottom lip. He turned the screen toward us and said ""Well, here's the pregnancy.""

And there was a pregnancy! Measuring a little past 4 weeks. 

There was also a massive cyst on my left ovary (5 cm diameter). Those suckers I used to get all the time before I started testosterone. Tesosterone, thankfully, put an end to that while I was on it. I once had to have one removed because it was painful, but they usually go away on their own. They happen with the developing follicle keeps expanding instead of releasing an egg. It's quite a common problem and only require intervention if they cause pain or twist the ovary. In the later case they can be a big problem and must be removed or the ovary will die and bad things will happen.

So he decides he wants a second opinion on the pregnancy and goes to get a specialist.

The specialist is 30-something woman who is incredibly professional and pleasant. She was able to spot the yolk sac right away and confirm that it was a pregnancy and not a remnant of the pregnancy that I just miscarried. However, it's too early to be able to tell how it's doing.

They take some pictures and some blood samples and I have to go back in a week for more of the same to see if the fetus is growing or not.

If it is a healthy little bub, I'm going to become a nervous wreck about the cyst seeing as if it takes a turn for the worst and needs surgery, how will that effect the fetus?!?

My personal bizarre little theories about this pregnancy are

 a) I conceived twice because my ovaries are weird, and the older fetus didn't make it, but just kind of hung out in there for a while after it died

b) I conceived the twins at the same time but one of them was not normal which lead to its odd size and demise.

 c) there was a bloodclot attached to the sac that I passed so I thought it was larger than it actually was 

d) One twin died at 4 weeks and the other lived a couple weeks longer before dying and the one that died earlier is still there.

Clarification: when I talk about twins, I'm talking about the fraternal type not the identical ones. Two eggs/two sperms, their own sacs.

**TLDR; I miscarried a twin and the remaining twin may or may not be okay. I will find out in a week.**"

I feel like my life is falling apart right now. All my life, I have been taught that education is the way to go if you want to get anywhere in this world, and I have also always believed this. I feel no regret when I say I feel that shop clerks are wasting their lives. I've done nothing but study my entire life, straight from school, to what amounts to a Danish version of college, to what's essentially university, and I am now studying Computer Science with only half a year left in the classroom before I go to my dream internship at a company who's making the video game version of my favorite tabletop game. Heck, since this is Denmark, I don't even have to pay for my education and I get a small scholarship for the entire duration, and I don't even have to pay it back! Everything seems perfect on the surface, right?

Well, I've recently been feeling... I don't know, like there's no point to it all, I guess? It feels like I'm just going through the motions, I can barely get up in the morning, I feel no excitement for software engineering any more (I used to be so excited I could barely sleep), and worst of all, the creativity I used to have in my spare time has been dwindling for so long it's barely even there anymore. 

I've been searching all over the place in my mind for what could be the cause, and a few things have come up, registering as slight possibilities, but I really don't know if that could be it. One of the things I feel like is a problem is that I'm offered no creativity in my education what so ever. In college I majored in Technology and Innovation, which allowed my creativity to flow free as well as challenge myself, and I loved it. But again, I really don't know.

Truth be told, I don't even know why I'm confessing here, it feels like it's something I should talk with my university's guidance councilor about, but I just can't bring myself to do it. 

Any advice, tough love, questions or whatever you can think about is greatly appreciated."

I wanted to know would there be any negatives to transferring into computer science as an incoming junior. I have been looking a the flowchart and it has me doing taking two courses in the summer. I know internships are crucial in your later years as an undergrad computer science student and they seem to be mostly in the summer. I see traditional 4 year students have one course in their later years and according to the flowchart it is recommended that it be a gen ed. So am I gonna have a more difficult time being a transfer and working an internship? Also any other cons will be greatly appreciated. BTW im going to Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, FL."

So I'm currently working for a software company doing a mix of developing internal web applications and some scripting, and some QA. I was initially hired on as QA, but annoyed them enough until they gave me some programming projects. I've been there for almost two years now, and have been treated very well. I've gotten 10 dollars in raises, from 15 to 25 dollars an hour, freedom to work from home, and to make my own hours. It's really awesome after working retail for the 5 years of my young adult life.

I am currently now a super senior at my university, and am guaranteed a full time position at my work (not exactly sure what position they want me in, i'm assuming the same thing just full time) but am feeling incredibly jaded. I talk to a lot of my cs friends and a lot of them are doing really cool projects but, making exceptionally less money (probably more in the 12-18 dollar range). 

My question is, with my experience, is it worth me trying to find a new job while working at my current one, to find a job that interests me more and gain what could potentially be better experience. Or, should i stay with the company i'm at until i have a diploma in my hands? I do have a lot of expenses so the money is nice at my current job, but i much rather have a true software engineering internship alone than it plus some semi programming semi quality assurance. Also, maybe i could ask for a higher salary at the other internships since i do have more experience than many other college students.

TLDR: Should i stay at my high paying low expertise internship that is very relaxed, or find a more intensive internship where i can truly put my education to work but sacrifice money?"
2k0ko4,0,2014-10-22,Girlfriends dad is at least 27% a psycho. (and not because of our age gap) [19/M][16/f],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2k0ko4/girlfriends_dad_is_at_least_27_a_psycho_and_not/,"Before you judge, yes- I know the age gap is a little much and you may or may not think it is okay, but to clarify I am very outgoing, fun, somewhat irresponsible and she is smarter than I have or ever will be in my life and very mature (outgoing and fun also). 

You may or may not have read one of my more recent posts where I talked about wanting to break up with her. This was mostly because of her very anxiety/ emotional personality lately.

What I did in the other post was come up with 3-4 things that may have been fueling this new development and what I could come up with off the top of my head was her leg issues, her dad, her big school work load, and maybe some stuff that happened in the past.

Now I realize that I was right to say all of those things were causing anxiety but about 90% of the problem is her father.

Basically take a REALLY crazy bitchy women (we have all met at least one) and put her in a man's body. That is her dad. The guy yells at her constantly for stuff that she didn't even know was a problem, oftentimes in front of friends, just last night in front of a new friend she just met for needing $12 for Starbucks and ""CAUSING A GIANT INCONVEINIANCE OF HIME NEEDING TO GO TO THE BANK' *storms out of house slams door*. 

He puts her down really hard nearly every time she goes to see me or anyone else, claiming that she is ""selfish because she doesn't want to spend time with the family"" even if there were no plans at all, or at least plans she was never made aware of. 

He constantly makes these weird obscure comments about me behind my back or during an argument with her- about how I somehow disrespected him. For example, I ""disrespected"" him a few days ago and both her and I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how I ""disrespected him"".... we couldn't. 

The other odd thing he seems to do is set traps. By this I mean emotional traps for whoever he can get his emotional claws on, just to rile himself up and rattle the other person. 

For instance, I am a broke ass college kid, I have no cash, my parents are wealthy, but I am at cash level 0. I have told him this many, many, times whenever she asks for a few bucks for us to go see a movie or go get fast food or whatever. I even make a point of saying my paid internship is starting up in a few weeks so I will be able to pay. My car is also considered a company car of my dad's (he owns a small business) so I drive her wherever without asking for a penny in gas money (happily). 

One day I over hear him while I'm on the phone with her, mind you after everything I just said and him saying ""no, its fine! Don't worry about it!"" every time he gives her money, just roasting me and saying shit like ""A real man pays for your dinner"" (angrily towards her).

I confront him on it and he acts like it's a big joke, (He won't talk bad about me to my face 90% of the time.) and that it's ""a shame how after all this time we can't joke with each other"" 

He seems quite riled up still so I ask ""is there a problem"" He then proceeds into saying how I'm always late. I look him straight in the eye and go ""I don't recall ever being late to your house with her"" He turns it around onto her and starts yelling things like ""no it isn't the guy's fault, if I ask you to be home at 5 YOU BETTER BE HOME AT 4:25, SHOW ME SOME RESPECT. At this point she is crying and he's just standing there practically smiling and asking ""what's the big problem, why are you over reacting?""

Unfortunately those little clashes often lead to an hour long screaming session at her after I leave and she is now begging me to just do everything I can to make him happy (which is impossible). I often wonder and sometimes ask about physical abuse and she sites small examples from her child hood that don't necessarily qualify (I think). Grabbing her hair and throwing her to the ground, pushing her into a cold shower, grabbing the back of her skull and yelling at her really close like a drill instructor. Basically just really weak, mean things that most men would never do to a female, let alone a daughter.  

I don't know what to do about it. At first I tried to reason with him but the guy isn't really very human. Unless I say something to please him like ""yes, it is your daughter's fault we don't have marshmallows at this camp out because she didn't automatically call you on her way from home like she is apparently expected to so you could have told her to stop by the gas station"" then there is no way to get him to like me or be nice to her. 

The only other thing I could think to do was advise her to just not take him seriously anymore, but obviously that's hard to do with your own dad, and sometimes I think it just makes him act even more extreme to insure he puts her in her place. 

So, advice- What can I do? is it a lost cause? Do you think I am mostly right about him being nuts or am I in the wrong? Please just be honest. I am not the type to bow down and kiss his hand. I rarely shake his hand anymore and I end any conversation he starts with me. I want him to know that I'm not a pussy like all of her past boyfriends that were obviously pushed away by him.  "

Devastated and stressed sophomore year,gwkuser,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2k0p7d/help_devastated_and_stressed_sophomore_year/,"So I'm an ECE student who's taking Signals and systems, as well as this discrete math proof course with topologies (Ugh, even typing this makes me feel stressed and depressed). I currently have a C in Signals and Systems and have a B in my discrete math class (Mind you, this is a top engineering university). On top of that, I always seem to flunk all my software development internship interviews because they claim they'll let me know in a week, only for me to never hear ANYTHING.

So predictably, I'm feeling hopeless especially with the fact that I understand the basic concepts in the class (At least I understand what the entire point of a Fourier Transform is, but I can't memorize the specific things like how to translate a time shift on the frequency domain in terms of exact math), yet I always magically end up doing some math algebra wrong on tests, and the points just fucking add up. So then I don't know how I can improve other than practicing, but I literally don't have time to practice problems with my 100+ hour homework+class weeks. If I can't get an internship this summer, then my chances of getting a good one next year is next to none, then my chances of getting a six figure salary soon after college is also next to none. This vicious cycle is also stressing me out and I really need some help because I literally don't know what I can be doing differently."
2k0v9v,28,2014-10-22,Venezuelan students in U.S. (including me) are being abandoned by our country.,gsebas18,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2k0v9v/venezuelan_students_in_us_including_me_are_being/,"I am a Venezuelan student in the U.S. (international student on F1 visa) and I have been abandoned by my country.

Background: If you have read the news or you know anything about Venezuela you would probably think it is something that came out of The Onion. In my country there is no law, no justice and no well being. The worse part is that you don't have to be in Venezuela to starve and to be poor. 

Venezuela has had a currency exchange policy since forever, if you don't know what it means I'll give you a quick version of it: Basically Venezuelans have to go through a process to have access to external currencies, for example, to pay for my University tuition I have to start an application months before the semester starts so that the agency that controls the currency exchange (CADIVI) can authorize a bank to complete a transaction at a stable exchange rate from Venezuelan Bolivares (Venezuelan currency) to US Dollars.

It doesn't seem too complicated right? Well, unfortunately it is.

1. CADIVI can decide to approve or reject your application based on many factors, to mention a few many: In order to get approved you have to be coursing a Major that is from an ""area of priority"" for the country, for example, If you are not studying an Engineering Career that is not Law or Medical then forget about studying in the US because they will never approve it.

2. CADIVI is extremely important for Venezuelan students financially: Since the exchange of currency is limited, the demand for them have increased to astronomical levels from 10 years ago. At the official exchange rate, 1 USD = 12 Bolivares. This official exchange rate although it has varied in the last few years, it is considered the most stable currency exchange rate. Now since there is a high demand, Venezuelans that have savings in USD in the United States and cash, they decide to ""sell"" these at exorbitant amounts. In a year, the ""parallel"" or ""unofficial"" USD has gone from 20 Bs. to 100 Bs. approximately. Can you imagine that one day you have $10,000 and then a year later that amount is worth only $2,000 ??? Well that's a reality for all Venezuelans.

3. CADIVI has made possible for students, companies, industries, etc to get USD at a stable exchange rate. But now they are not giving any more, at least for students outside of the country. They argue, according to the email that you get when you get rejected that there is no availability for funds to allocate for the international students.

So now lets get into personal stuff:
I am 20 years old, I live by myself in a $1500 dollar apartment, I have been in the US for about 2 years, but now, it seems to be coming to an end. CADIVI has rejected my application for the first time ever, along with every other Venezuelan I know, and not only in the US. So now I am stuck in this country, without money, without food, at the brink of getting kicked out of the country because I can not afford to pay for college. Quick math. my tuition is around $9000 dollars per semester, without CADIVI, and using ""unofficial"" USD rate, I would be paying around $75,000 dollars. Yeah, you read it right. so now, where am I supposed to get $9000 dollars in 2 weeks? (Last date to pay for tuition is November 3rd).

I am depressed, tired, hungry and extremely discouraged, my grades are taking a hit for this and the thoughts of losing my girlfriend of 2 years just makes everything even more bitter...

I recently got an internship in a small tech company and I have been let know that I could have a future in the company. So I would also be losing this chance as well.

Just thinking of coming back to Venezuela and live in that shithole of a country, where crime rates exceed cities like Juarez, where there is no law, no justice and all you do is survive. 30% - 40% or annual inflation, and 40% of unemployment... I just can't...

If you want to help. Spread my story and every Venezuelan's.

Thank you for reading."

Alright so here's the deal. I've been at my job as a Junior .NET Developer for 3 years now. I started out the job as an internship, then quickly progressed and got a job offer to work there full time. This was my senior year in HS and I'm now a Sophomore in college. I took the job over from the 2 other developers that used to work where I do, and then just recently, a 2nd developer was hired to help with the workload. After 3 years, my pay amounts to $12/hr. I construct full size web applications and manage and create SQL databases.

So I'm in a different position from most. I was a Psychology undergraduate who picked up an interest in programming the summer before Junior year but it was just a passing interest. I start doing silly little programs in C, but nothing more than just a side hobby. Senior year I had some openings in my schedule so I took the intro sequence at my school for computer engineering (Basically intro to C, ""advanced"" C and abstract data structures) and I did really well. My professor noticed and mentioned going into the grad program after I graduate.

Fast forward to now: I am in the graduate program starting this quarter (I graduate in May) and enjoying it a lot. I have a lot of prerequisites to make up (mostly surrounding math, a couple simple stats classes were all that were required for my Psychology degree) but I'm trucking and making projects as I go to teach myself languages, technologies, etc. Among other things, I've almost finished the calculus series at my university and am taking my second algorithms course.

So now that you have some background, here is my issue: I want a job in the field. I feel like I'm at a place where I could do well in a junior dev position somewhere, whether it be a coop, internship, part-time job or whatever. I want so badly to be working on something more substantial than my little projects for a couple reasons: I'm afraid that the way I've taught myself has lead to bad habits and I want some guidance and I want to know what it's like to work in a legitimate production environment with deadlines, requirements to meet, etc.

I've applied to A LOT of places online, I've talked with professors about their opinion on what I should learn in my spare time, I've had professors and friends in the field look over my resume, I've talked to recruiters at job fairs, I've interviewed for 2 jobs. And nothing has come of it.

Whenever I talk to anyone (friends, family, professors, recruiters, interviewers) they always tell me that I look like a great candidate, that it is cool that I've switched from psychology and that it could be an asset, that they respect my courage to switch what I want to do so late, that my resume looks good (well, given my late jump into the field), that it's cool that I've taken time to progress on my own with projects, that I did really well on the algorithm questions that have been given to me (both at career fairs and at the 2 job interviews).

If all of this is true, then why the fuck have I been denied from so many fucking jobs? It drives me insane. Are all these people just kissing my ass to make me feel better? Where can I go to have someone rip me a new one so I know what to do in order to be a hireable candidate. I'm fine with being told that I'm delusional and that I'm nowhere near to hireable and that I suck and my code sucks. At least then I would know how to change!

TL;DR: Everywhere I go I've gotten nothing but positive feedback, but I don't have a job to show for it after talking with recruiters at job fairs and interviewers at 2 companies. How can I figure out what's holding me back? Who can I talk to? Do I just simply not have enough to prove myself? Do I just need to do more?"

I was thinking about pursuing an internship (possibly abroad), however, I have a few questions about it.

**1**. I'm 25 now (will be 26 by summer, probably 27 by graduation). Is this too old? Are people only interested in younger graduates?

I'm older because I did 5 years in the military with a very technical job including a lot of leadership/supervisory work. It's solid experience, but not directly applicable to Computer Science (involved no programming, lots of hands on troubleshooting on aircraft). I could leave it off my resume, but then I don't have a lot of applicable/formal Computer Science related experience.

**2**. My resume right now has a lot of military awards because I don't have many from my University. If I leave out my military experience or awards, my resume looks bare, but if I don't, my age is easily guessable.

A quick note – I’ve changed the names of people and locations in this story to protect identities. All occurrences are real. I will be as detailed as possible.
***
I work as a hiring manager for a hospital in Queens, NY. It’s not exactly the job I had set out for, but I like it. I have full hiring authority for all the healthcare workers in the hospital, aside from my boss occasionally pulling some strings for people and maybe reviewing a few of the candidates I approve of. Otherwise I coordinate with the nursing department to determine when we need to bring on more staff and how many people they need. Until recently, this job has been relatively worry-free.

I received a call about a month ago from a former employee, Suzette White. She had started working at the facility as a Registered Nurse long before I came on board. Earlier this year she retired, not because she was too old, but just because she had enough of the job. I believe she had worked there for 23 years where she had been a valuable member of the team. Everyone had the highest praise for her and her efforts. It was sad to see her go.

During my 5 years doing the job, I had gotten to know her fairly well. I usually don’t warm up to people, but there was something so warm and nurturing about her. She was a pseudo mother-figure to me. 

She had called to tell me that her daughter recently graduated from nursing school and was looking for a job. I had never met her daughter, but without hesitation, I told her that she’s more than welcome to come in and fill out an application and I would gladly interview her for an upcoming orientation I was planning with the nursing department. I typically don’t entertain new graduates since the numbers indicate they don’t always perform up to expectations. I guess their first taste of the real challenges of nursing in the field overwhelms a lot of them, and they quickly throw in the towel before I can even show them where the bathroom is. This is common throughout the industry and new graduates will usually go months, even a year sometimes, without landing their first job. But for Mrs. White, the pleasure to accommodate her daughter brought me joy. 

“What’s her name?” I asked.  
“Jane. Jane White.”  
“Ok. Tell her to come in tomorrow morning at 11:00.”  
“I will. But please…I know it’s difficult to bring on a new grad, but…*help her.*”  
Her pause and tone caught my attention when she said it. It didn’t sound like *“help her, no one will give her a chance to prove herself.”* It sounded more like *“she needs guidance. She’s troubled.”* I brushed it off; a simple case of a loving mother wanting the best for her daughter I concluded. 
“Don’t worry about a thing Suzette, I’ll see to it she’s taken care of.”  
“Maybe I should come with her.”  
“Oh, Suzette you shouldn’t do that. She’s a big girl and can’t have her mom following her on job interviews.”  
“I know, you’re right. Just give her a chance.”

I set the interview on my outlook calendar for the next day. I interview a lot of people, but I was really looking forward to this one; to meeting Jane. If she was anything like her mother, her employment at the facility would have a tremendous impact on the day to day functions of the facility.
The next day at 9:15am, the front desk pages me in my office. 

“Good morning. I have a Jane White here to see you.”  
*9:15?!* This is a huge pet peeve of mine. While you certainly want to look punctual for a job interview, showing up too early makes you look over-eager and desperate, while it also makes me have to juggle my schedule around to keep you from waiting for too long. The unspoken rule is to arrive 15 minutes before the appointment. No earlier, no later.   
“She’s here now? Her appointment is at 11:00.”  
“Yup. Do you want me to send her in?”  
“No, I can’t right now, I have a 9:30 meeting with the Chief Physician. Tell her she has to wait or come back.”  
I hang up the phone and ten seconds later I get a call back from the front desk.  
“She said she doesn’t want to wait. She wants to see you now.”  

Have you ever heard that employers know if they want to hire you within the first seconds of meeting you? Yeah, this is 100% true. Most of my interviews are determined in the first few seconds and the rest of the time I’m just being polite. And even though I still haven’t technically met Jane, I already know I don’t want to hire her. That is, if she was anyone else other than Suzette’s daughter. That’s the only thing keeping my mind open at this point. If it were any other candidate I’d tell them to get lost at this point.

I figured I could squeeze the interview in before my meeting. Even though I’m already skeptical on Jane, I reminded myself that there could be potential in her.   
“You know what, fine. I’ll be right there.”  
I walked out of my office towards the front to meet Jane. As I turned the corner I had a full view of the reception area and I noticed a young girl sitting on the couch adjacent to the front desk. The receptionist discreetly pointed towards the girl, indicating it was Jane. I observed her briefly before walking over to her. She sat there staring blankly ahead, the only movement coming from slow, blinking eyelids. She had long, bright blonde hair that covered a significant portion of her cheeks.  
I walked over to her. “Jane?” She looked over towards me without getting up from the couch or moving any other muscles. “You’re a bit early, but thank you for coming in. I’m Alex, nice to meet you.”  
I extended my hand to her as I introduced myself. She reached up and shook it with a weak grasp. “Hi,” she said, slightly above a mumble.  
“Please, come with me to my office.”  
As she stood up I noticed how short (I guessed her to be around 5’ tall), and heavy she was. I never measure someone’s value based on their physical appearance, but I always take notice to overweight nurses. It’s always baffled me; how nurses can be overweight when they’re on their feet all day running from patient to patient, and most don’t have the time to eat their lunch. It’s a question I’ve always wanted to ask, *“How can you be overweight when you’re doing cardio all day?”* Of course, that would be rude.  
Jane looked relatively young, maybe early 20’s, but clearly did not take very good care of herself. Aside from her weight, her skin looked greasy, like she hadn’t showered in a few days. She was dressed in all black; black khaki pants that looked about 2 sizes too small for her, black ankle-high boots with heels that I could have sworn I’d seen her mother wear before, and a black button-down shirt which appeared to be turned inside out. I guessed she did not have a solid set of interview-clothes and this shirt had some sort of print on the front that she was trying to hide and pass off as professional. Fine by me. 

As we walked to my office I tried to carry a conversation with her. “Did you find the facility alright?”  
“Yes.”  
“I know sometimes people who have never been here can get lost in this area, but I bet you’ve been here before since your mother worked here for many years.”  
“Yes.”  
“When was the last time you came by here.”  
“I don’t know.”  
“Did you come by here a lot when you were younger?”  
“No.”  
I couldn’t get more than a couple of words out of her. The only steady sound coming from her was the chorus of staccato as her boots walked across the tile floor. I tried to lighten the mood a bit. “Congratulations on finishing nursing school. Now you can actually have a social life again!”  
“I guess.” Still hardly anything from her.  
We entered my office. “Please, have a seat.” She sat in the chair opposite my desk and immediately adjusted her hair so it covered most of her cheeks again. She was obviously shy and a bit insecure, but it didn’t seem like she was making any effort to interact with me. I was starting to understand why her mother wanted to tag along.  
“So, Jane, tell me about yourself,” I said as I sat down.  
She stared blankly at me with dead, apathetic eyes, her face lacking any emotion or personality. “What do you want to know?”  
*I’m not going to tell you how to tell me about yourself*, I thought. “Whatever you want.” She sat pondering for a few seconds, her dark pupils looking upwards as she thought of what to say. After a few awkward seconds, I tried to encourage her a bit. “Why don’t you let me see your resume.”  
“My what?”  
“Your resume.”  
“What’s that?”  
Did she really not know what a resume was? I wasn’t even sure how to express the definition of ‘resume’. “It’s…um, well you put your professional profile on it and hand it to prospective employers. Your education, work experience, skills, things like that.”  
“Oh. I didn’t bring it.”  
*Seriously?* “Okay. Well, where did you go to school?”  
“St. Vincents.”  
“They have a great program. Where did you do your clinicals?”  
“…Elmwood Hospital.”  
“Oh really? I know the Director of Nursing there. Ms. Thomas, right?”  
“Yes.”  
“She’s an excellent teacher. I’m sure you can attest to that.”  
Jane fell silent for a moment… “Don’t ask her about me.”  
“Excuse me?”  
“Don’t ask her about me.”  
Sometimes I get this sort of response from people currently employed, and understandably so. It would be an inconvenience to call someone’s boss if they didn’t know they were looking for work. But she only did a clinical internship at Elmwood. There’s no reason for Jane to tell me not to contact Ms. Thomas unless she did something completely wrong. I decided to press her on the matter. “Why shouldn’t I?”  
“She didn’t like me.”  
*That’s not a surprise*. “Why didn’t she like you?”  
Her blank face suddenly turned into a piercing stare of hatred. Her eyes widened, “Stop asking me about this.”  
Whoa, red flag! She had said this so forcefully, I was taken aback. I was already well aware that something was off with Jane, but this look she was giving me sent chills throughout my body.  
“Ok, we don’t have to talk about that.” I was trying to be polite, but I realized there wasn’t much more I could take of this girl. I had to cut it short. “Well, I’m somewhat pressed for time since you came in early, so I’ll have to end things here if that’s alright with you.”  
“When do I start?” Did she really think getting a job would be that easy?  
“I’m still interviewing candidates, Jane. I’m scheduled to meet with other people later today and tomorrow and after that I will be making my decision.”  
Her face saddened and she looked down at the floor. “You won’t call me. No one ever does.”  
Now I actually started to feel bad for this girl, she must have interviewed at a few other places with no results to show for it. Someone needs to give her something positive to walk out with. “Listen, I won’t lie, you could certainly brush up on your interview skills, but all I care about is whether you’ll be able to do the job of a nurse. It’s tough work, and if you went to school at St. Vincents I’m sure you can bring a lot to the table. I’m sure you’re just as qualified as the other candidates I’ll be meeting with.”  
“So, I’m hired?”  
“I’ll let you know. Thank you for coming in.” I extended my hand to shake hers again, and again, she shook it with a frail, weak grasp, only this time her hand was shaking as it approached mine. She stood up and I caught a glimpse of her eyes. They were filled with tears. I felt horrible, but I can’t give her a job just because felt pity.  
As she turned to leave, she stopped short and froze. Something had caught her eye, and as I followed her gaze, I noticed that she was looking at my signed Derek Jeter baseball that I had on display. It sat on a shelf on the wall next to my desk. “Do you like baseball?” I asked, hoping she would leave me with something positive to end this encounter.  
And that’s when my uneasy suspicion about Jane was confirmed. Without warning, she lunged at the baseball, grabbed it and threw it across my office at a framed picture of The Vitruvian Man I had on the wall. The glass shattered into pieces as I stood in shock. Before I could look back at Jane, she was bolting for the door and running out of the facility. Everything happened so quickly I didn’t realize that a small crowd formed outside my office door. I gathered myself and tried to shake it off. “So **that’s** why my mother always told me not to play ball inside the house.” Everyone outside laughed and walked away. I quickly looked out my window to see Jane getting into a black sedan parked on the street outside and drive away. She was gone.

I cleaned up the mess left in my office thankful that Jane had not thrown the ball at me and that my ordeal with her was finally over. After she had shown me her destructive behavior, I certainly didn’t feel bad about not hiring her anymore. I generally try to give every candidate a fair chance. I always think of what Jack Nicholson said in The Departed:

*“The point I’m making is – a man could look at anything, and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think ‘what could I use you for?’”*

That’s always been my hiring philosophy. With Jane, there’s nothing I could use her for. Clearly this was a person who has no place working in the healthcare industry, or any industry for that matter.
***
Later that day Suzette called me to follow up on my meeting with Jane. I told her what happened and how I really did not feel comfortable trusting her with the responsibilities of a nurse. “I see. I’m sorry to have wasted your time,” was all she had to say. I could hear the disappointment in her voice. “I wish her the best of luck, Suzette. She just needs to find the right place.”

A day goes by, more candidates come in, some better than others. I eventually settle on a class of 6 RNs to attend our orientation on 10/06/14, which was about a week away at the time. I ran all the necessary background checks, reference checks, license verifications, I obtained all of their medical history documents, and I submitted all of the information to the in-service coordinator, Mrs. Pierre (she’s the person who runs the orientation class). Once I submit their information to Mrs. Pierre, my work is essentially done. Business as usual.

The day I submitted the candidates to the in-service coordinator, I received a call at my office just as I was getting ready to leave for the day and go home to a nice beer. I have caller ID and the number was displayed as RESTRICTED, which always makes me raise an eyebrow. 

I answered, “Hello this is Alex.”  
No response.  
“Hello, can I help you?”  
I heard breathing. Not heavy or over the top. Just the regular sound of someone breathing on the phone. I sat and waited for the person to answer for a few seconds. And then, she spoke.  
“…did I get the job?” She spoke so as though she were in distress. I recognized the voice right away. It was Jane.  
“Excuse me? Who is this?” I wanted confirmation.  
“…did I get the job?”  
“Jane? Is that you?”  
“………did I get the…job?”  
“I’m sorry Jane, but there were other candidates for the position I wound up hiring. I wish you luck in…”  
*click*

What a strange girl. I thought. She really needs some professional help.

I placed the phone back on the receiver, grabbed my coat and my bag, said goodnight to a few people and walk out of the facility heading to my car. Since the facility I work for is in Queens, parking is somewhat limited. There is a parking lot on the premises, but most of the employees arrive at the facility at 7:00am, whereas I usually go in at 9:00am, so by the time I arrive the lot is full, aside from parking that is reserved for family members. My boss offered me a reserved parking space, but I’m not the type to take advantage of special treatment, so I declined it. Instead, I park my car on the street 3-4 blocks away. I get to take a nice walk by the park on the way, have a cigarette and clear my head.

It’s twilight by the time I leave, which I enjoy. The summer days of walking to my car in my work clothes when it’s sunny and 90 degrees outside are finally over for the year. There’s nothing more uncomfortable than getting in your car when you’re already sweating a little and having a wave of heat hit you in the face when you open the car door.

I had walked a block and turned the corner from the facility when I noticed a car was sitting double parked ahead of me. Probably someone waiting for a spot to open up, I assumed. It was an old black Honda Civic, probably an early 2000’s model. It looked similar to the car I saw Jane get into when she stormed out of the office. The rear bumper was riddle with dents and dings, something that one of those “Bumper Bully’s” would have probably saved. The windows were tinted, but it looked as though someone was sitting in the driver seat. I had an uneasy feeling…not ten minutes ago I had just gotten off the phone with a girl that genuinely gave me the creeps. Was she inside the car waiting for me?

Without breaking my stride, I studied the car thoroughly trying to see if there was a figure in the car. The closer I got to it, the more I doubted there was anyone there and I slowed my pace down to get a better look inside.

Nope, no one there. From the sidewalk I peered into the car to see if there were any clues. I had been so focused on trying to find something, that the sound of Jane’s voice from behind startled me.

“Did I get the job?”  
A burst of fear swept through me and I jumped at the sound, simultaneously turning to see the familiar long blonde hair of Jane staring at me.  
“Jane! You frightened me!” She was silent. “What are you doing here?” Still, she said nothing, refusing to react or take her glaring eyes off me. “Are you following me?” She just stood there like a tree, staring…that stare. There was something unsettling about it. “Listen, Jane, I mentioned earlier on the phone, I decided to go with another candidate. I’m sorry.”  
Her head started vibrating and her eyes turned red with anger as her hands formed fists. Any person in the world would immediately interpret the situation as a threat.  
“Jane…what are you doing?”  
And like someone had flipped a switch inside of her, she suddenly collected herself, stopped shaking and relaxed her fists. “Have a nice night,” she said politely and walked into the Honda that was double parked. I wasn’t going to wait for her to drive off, I ran to car that was parked about a block away and jumped inside before she could do anything else. I sat and caught my breath hoping that would be the last I would ever see or hear of Jane. My hopes were short lived as I saw in my review mirror her car approaching slowly from behind. I was parallel parked, so there was no chance for me to speed off and try to outrun her from where she was.

Her car inched closer and I started panicking, debating whether I should get out and make a run for it. Before I could decide what to do her car had pulled up alongside mine, her tinted window was rolled down and she was staring at me. Her car never stopped though, she just drove slowly, making some sort of statement. Warning me.

And then, she sped off.

I drove home, my pulse racing the entire time. But what threat could this girl possibly be to me? Why should I be the least be worried?

I didn’t know the answer to that question…but I *was* worried.

***
Much more coming on Jane as a lot has happened since she approached me on the street, but I don’t want to hit you guys with everything all at once. I’ll have part 2 up soon!

2k14mq,1,2014-10-22,I think I just got screwed over from an unpaid internship.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2k14mq/i_think_i_just_got_screwed_over_from_an_unpaid/,"I just finished a 3 month unpaid internship for a start up company.

 They had me do some really big roles including leading and previsualizing major projects. Their shortage of employees also meant I was responsible for doing a lot of things I was not originally hired to do. I enjoyed the freedom of doing whatever I wanted, but they asked for a lot, even when I said that I wasn't comfortable doing what was asked for.

They were sometimes days were I had nothing to do and was on ""stand by"" for another project. For 8 hours I would just sit and stare at my screen, waiting for a task. When my time was up they'd ask me to stay longer, often 3-4 more hours of just waiting.

The criteria of unpaid internships is that I am there to learn, that no work of mine is of benefit to the company, that my being there doesn't take someone else's job, and that I am not being promised a job at the end of my internship.

They kept saying they were going to hire a director for us to learn from, but it ended up just being me doing all the work and figuring it all out, not learning anything new. Obviously, my work ended up being used by the company tremendously. And lastly, halfway through the internship I was told I would be definitely offered a position with the company.

So the end rolls around and I remind my boss that I needed to sign the paperwork to make me a full-time employee. He tells me he can't right now because of some timing issues (they just put in the paperwork for another unpaid intern last week), that he needs to discuss it with the CEO and that I could come in for the next few days (it would still be unpaid) and wait for an answer.

What I'm almost damn sure is going to happen is that they're going to wait until the next major project deadline looms over the horizon (which isn't for at least another few weeks to a month)  and then MAYBE hire me then. If they ever do. After months of telling us we were going get legitimate copies of the program, they still never did. If we couldn't trust them with that how could I with the possibility of employment?

But I fucked up Reddit. I fucked up real bad. We just signed a lease to a new apartment which would've been perfectly timed with my unpaid internship ending and my paid employment starting and now I have no fucking money because I'm an idiot.

I'm so frustrated and upset at myself for trusting them. "

2k1h48,53,2014-10-22,I (23f) aborted twins by my recent ex (24m) earlier this week. Do I tell him?,Throwawaypizzalady,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2k1h48/i_23f_aborted_twins_by_my_recent_ex_24m_earlier/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 
I recently broke up with my ex of 6 months. The relationship wasn't great, he was a bit of a sponge and more of a drag than a pleasure to be with. We ended fairly mutually about a month ago.

He was selfish and immature. As most men (boys?) in their early 20s are. 

I had been pretty ill in the run up to the break up. This solidified my feeling that he wasn't right for me, as he showed little sympathy or concern when I was ill. 

Following the break up, my sickness intensified. I was vomiting 6,7, sometimes 10 times a day. I took a pregnancy test, which turned positive. 

I freaked out. I phoned my best friend in a fit of panic. I had not long ago moved to a new city and was alone. As a recent graudate, I'm working hard for crap pay as an intern. Pregnancy would mean losing my job, my apartment and my freedom. 

I had no money, no partner, few friends and it seemed at the time, no other choice apart from abortion. 

I tried to call my ex as soon as I found out. I left 10 missed calls, texts, voicemails asking him to call back urgently. He didn't answer for 4 hours, and in the meantime I booked an abortion for 10 days time. 

Eventually, he called. He had an uninterested and irritated tone in his voice.  

It completely put me off telling him the truth, so I made up a fake excuse for calling, telling him I felt terribly sick and lonely. He said he hoped I would get better soon. That was it. 

I finally realised that this guy was just never going to be there for me. All he cared about was himself. 

In the week that followed, I endured Hyperemesis gravidique (the worst morning sickness in the world that you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. Think food poisoning that just never seems to get better). 

A Dr excused me from work for further notice. I lost 4 kg (10lbs) in one week. I wanted to die I was in so much pain. 

Although my ex knew I was still ill, he never called to check up on me. He didn't know the extent of my illness or the reasons for it, but he still never asked how I was. Not even a text. Nothing. 

The day of the scheduled abortion arrived, to my relief. I had my first scan and got the shock of my life. I was 7 weeks pregnant, expecting twins. I mean what the fuck kind of fucking bad luck is that on top of everything else. Fate can be so cruel. 

At the time, I was still adamant I wanted to go ahead with the procedure. I was so sick and all I wanted was to be well again. I had been under so much stress in recent weeks, worrying about my job, my health, my future, my ex. Everything was just too much. I just wanted everything to go away. 

Now, it's three days after the procedure and I can't stop thinking of what it would've been like to have two little baby twins. 

I'm racked with guilt that I ended not one, but two lives. At the time, I felt like I didn't have a choice due to my health and financial constraints. Now I just feel like a monster. 

I want to talk about it with someone so badly. I feel like I'm bottling it all up. When I'm with people, on the outside I seem totally normal but every time I'm alone I just think and think and cry and cry about the terrible thing that I did. I'm so ashamed. I feel like I've made a terrible mistake. I'll probably never get the chance to have twins again. 

I feel like I want to tell my ex. But not because he has a right to know. 

I feel he should share the burden of my guilt for giving me so little choice in the matter. For seeming so uninterested in my wellbeing. For making it so hard to tell him. 

Is that selfish? Should I just forget about telling him and just go to counselling instead? I just don't want to feel guilty anymore, but I feel like I always will. 

Will telling him ease my conscience? Does he have a right to know?

EDIT: TO MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. We ended mutually, on friendly terms. "

However, before I do that I would like to give a little back ground: before going back to school at my local Community College last year, I had already graduated with a liberal arts bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in library science (yes, to be a librarian). Due to the recession, I was forced to work at a customer care call center. Eighteen months ago, I was not in a good place. I was getting more burnt out at the call center by the day and the library job search was getting me nowhere, so I decided it was time for a change and I registered for classes. Flash forward 14 months. I am two months graduation, rocking a 3.6 GPA, passed both the A+ and Network+ (and hopefully the Security+ by the end of the year), completing an internship. Not only this but after completing my first interview on Monday afternoon, I was offered the job today. However, I am not sure if I want the job. For one, I am not sure if I like the guy who I will be working for, but it could have me not knowing his personality; but I did like all of the other guys who I will be working with/for. Also, while the job 35-40 hours a week and pays $15 an hour (which I have no issue with) but here is the big red flag for me is there are no benefits, including health insurance (which I’m not sure how that is going to be legal next year; let’s not get political here please). Hell, my shitty call center job had insurance. My parents have said they will take care of that for me but damn it I am 31, I want show I am an adult. However, there are reasons to say yes. I know there is always a 100 reasons to say now but this a pretty big red flag as I have said.  My experience of the last five years tells me to take the job and be grateful but my gut tells me to turn it down and hold out about six months before stop being picky. Right now, I am leaning hard no but I want to weigh all options. Is there any advice I may have that would help me?"

Anyway, I'm a freshman at MS&amp;T right now, and I just checked my grades on joess to see that I have an F in trigonometry (I know, I know, keep laughing, even I know that I'm too stupid to really be going here) and am unsure if I can improve grade before end of semester or if I should drop. I have A's and B's in all my other classes, so if I keep in the class and end up with an F, it will drag my GPA down to at least a 2.8, assuming all my other grades stay the same as they are now, which obviously would kill my chances for an internship this summer. I think I can do well in the rest of the class, because the F is due to my stupidness and underestimating the importance of the homework and studying, not from a lack of ability to understand the subject, but I don't know if there's even enough time to raise it though? 

I've emailed the professor to schedule an appointment to discuss this, but I wanted to get some advice from some other people. All my friends are freshman too, and are too busy making fun of me for failing a remedial class/ too inexperienced themselves to offer any real advice.

2k1xi1,6,2014-10-22,Industrial Engineer Looking To Exit Manufacturing,GenericHbomb,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2k1xi1/industrial_engineer_looking_to_exit_manufacturing/,"**TL;DR** Went to school for Industrial/Manufacturing Engineering and hate working in Manufacturing. Interests include animals, science(biology, chemistry, social), programming, 3d printing (don't want to stay in manufacturing though). Any thoughts?


I am about to graduate from a respectable engineering school and have spent over a year working full time paid internships. Similar to many MEs, EEs, and IEs I have ended up in manufacturing and this is where my 'professional' experience is. I really have no passion for manufacturing and just can not dedicate myself to it the way I would like to. It feels soulless to me I suppose.



What I enjoy about IE/Manufacturing:

* The pay is decent even before leaving college

* The atmosphere is friendly while maintaining competitiveness against other companies


What I am good at:

* I'm good with computers, always have been. I have been teaching myself programming but between working full time, school and lack of guided discipline I have not made it too far.

* I'm good with psychology, reading people. I'm excellent at reading social cues, understanding people etc. I love talking and thinking about how the mind works.

* I'm good at big picture thinking.

* It doesn't show here but I have excellent verbal and written skills

* I have excellent leadership qualities and have 4+ years of management experience(3 in food service, 1 in manufacturing) before even graduating college


Areas I am interested in:

* Animals. I love animals, always have. Wanted to be a veterinarian when I was younger. I have always been told I have a connection with animals.

* 3D printing. Took a 3D printing class and loved it but am finding it difficult to find positions that align with what I want. I would likely remain in manufacturing I imagine.

*Programming. Obviously it is valuable but I have always thought this may be a good path to go. However, I am worried I will end up back in manufacturing.

* Science. I have always loved the sciences. I love learning about how the world works, biology, chemistry, psychology, social sciences. A lot of my personal reading revolves around the sciences and I think the field is fascinating.

I feel engineering (IE) provides me with excellent logic and critical thinking based skills that are useful anywhere. I have a lot of lower level management experience for my age that is useful anywhere. I am just not sure how to break out of manufacturing in to something more science based.

I went in to engineering because I ""needed"" to go to school and it provided an excellent skill set, good pay, respect, and the ability to climb out of childhood poverty. I wanted to be somebody important and make a lot of money. I did not go in to engineering because it was something I thought I would love which was my mistake. Looking for the right path this time.

I did fine my first two years, but I've struggled in most CS courses since. I've never had time nor ideas for personal projects either. I can work in C, but OO and algorithms are huge weak areas (I bombed the only interview I've gotten so far because of those). I couldn't even get an internship last summer either as a result. I have some solid projects on my resume, but if I had to go back and do any of those without the teams I worked with, they'd never happen. 

So yeah, that about sums it up. What could I go through to get back up to speed in my spare time? Books, project ideas, new languages to pick up (I pretty much only know C and Java, and the latter I'm awful with).

I started a new job part-time as an executive assistant.

I got the job through a woman I intern for(it's her husband). I have been doing graphic design for her website for free since March. She told him about me and suggested I can work for him. That's how I got the job.

Anyway, He runs his own drug/pharmaceutical company in NYC. I worked for him a couple days in the summer and he gave me a pay of $25 an hour. I thought that was great. He then offered me employment starting this week, as he needed me part time and possibly full time eventually. I don't think the pay is right. 

30,000 salary if I'm full time working 5 days

60% of that since I'm working 3 days a week which amounts to $15 or $360 a week. 

I looked up the pay for executive assistant in NYC and the pay was nowhere near that low. It was above that. I was not expecting to receive that little. I might as well waitress and I can make more. I don't know what to do, should I ask for more money or am I wrong? I can not live on that pay. I honestly took it very personally since I work for free for his wife, I thought he would be generous with pay. I'm starting to think I'm being taken advantage of here. "
2k24es,11,2014-10-22,"As an increasingly depressed college senior, I'd like your advice.",slrrp,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2k24es/as_an_increasingly_depressed_college_senior_id/,"So just some brief info:

&gt;Graduating in the spring with a double major in Finance &amp; Accounting (non-target, state school, southeast/midwest)

&gt;3.3 Finance GPA

&gt;3.2 Accounting GPA

&gt;3.0 Overall

&gt;Wealth Management/Equity Research Internship

&gt;President of school investment club 

&gt;VP of Entrepreneurship club 

&gt;Experience with DCF Modeling, Bloomberg, database lookup functions

All GPAs are likely to increase, especially the major GPAs, before I graduate (my GPA is low primarily due to a health condition which has been taken care of but the damage has been done). I'm growing increasingly concerned with my prospects upon graduation. Public Accounting firms thought I was too interested in Finance by my club/internship experiences (sometimes they even flat out said it during the interview) and the only finance positions our university has listed through our career site are sales-oriented (I picked up accounting to avoid that fate). 

Honestly, what kind of chance do I have at finding a financial analyst-style position? I realize the ambiguity in that job title but I ultimately want something that pays well (i do have loans), does not require me to sell a product or try to persuade potential clients, and will challenge me to constantly learn and apply what I know. My university's network is horrid and I'm already in the employment office several times a week.

TL/DR: College grad in spring, wants a non-sales job, concerned with job prospects 



**1st Update:** Guys I just want to thank you all for your advice. It's been a rough week (3 rejections on Monday to start the week off) and I just needed my perspective to be brought back to earth. You guys are wonderful and I appreciate all forms of advice, no matter how dry/realistic; I know the market a bit better than most college grads but clearly stress is blinding my view at the moment. 

**2nd Update:** I think you guys are getting hung up on the idea that I don't want to do sales because I don't want interaction. I don't want to do sales because I don't think it's an admirable profession. 

**3rd Update:** I guess I should clarify this because I feel like there's been some miscommunication. When I say I don't want to work in sales, I'm talking about selling life insurance for a company like Northwest Mutual. I'd kill for a S&amp;T job with a BB firm. I think we can all agree those roles are worlds apart from each other. 

**Final Update:** Thanks again to everyone that provided meaningful feedback that I can use moving forward. I always welcome criticism so long as it's constructive and I can take something from it. Sorry if I seemed down; obviously I would never admit that I'm upset in front of someone from a prospective company. I appreciate the several ""cheer up"" comments, they are additionally appreciated. Best of luck to everyone that helped and have a good weekend! "
2k26lq,0,2014-10-22,A Halloween punchbowl of T! I went to a taping back in July…(MAJOR SEASON 7 SPOILERS!!),SeptimaRiffic,rupaulsdragrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/2k26lq/a_halloween_punchbowl_of_t_i_went_to_a_taping/,"Greetings, my beloved Halloween Hunty BOO BOOs! I thought you might enjoy a sip of T to warm you up on this chilly October night, and also to quench your thirst for some new Season 7 information! **WARNING: THIS POST CONTAINS ~~NOTHING WHATSOEVER~~ MAJOR #S7 SPOILERS, SO STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON’T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS!!**

I went to a taping back in July. My boyfriend’s boss’s friend’s daughter’s pet chimpanzee works for World of Wonder (I think he’s currently busy editing the #MarcoMarco fashion show…) and he was able to get me a ticket to attend a live taping. I was so excited to see my favorite show! Well, favorite show behind ANTM, Project Runway, Hoarders: Buried Alive, Teen Mom 2, Kitchen Nightmares, The Real Housewives of New Jersey and Steve Wilkos…probably in that order.

On the day of the taping, the audience members were quietly ushered onto the mainstage set, which had been *completely* transformed since Season 6! But I won’t tell you exactly how, just that it’ll be a *huge* surprise when you see it, and that at some point you came for me, and I don’t remember when or what you said, only that you did, and that it was really hurtful to me. Anyway, there were a bunch of audience members who arrived earlier and were already seated, so I sat down in an empty chair near the side. We were all seated facing the mainstage, where a microphone was set up in the middle. A producer came out and told us that we would be watching a talent showcase put on by the queens called the “Cavalcade of Unexpected and Noteworthy Talents”, and that each queen would come out one by one to shows us their own special “C.U.N.T.”

Before they brought out the queens, the production crew had us film different reactions by ourselves: completely expressionless, frowning/booing, and half of the audience asleep while the other half received hooks and yarn to crochet things. I actually started making myself a scarf because it was so cold in there, which (we were told) was because RuPaul needs to be kept below 32-degrees or she starts to melt. Then they announced the Guest Judge, who was a *huge* celebrity and who we all recognized right away. Let’s just call her “L. Michele” – or, because that might be too big of a clue – let’s just call her “Lea M.” I forgot to mention that the judges had numbered scorecards, which they would hold up after each queen presented their “C.U.N.T.”

The first queen to come out was **Miss Fame**. She was wearing a vintage silhouette scoop neck metallic dress with maroon hair and a face painted for the Gods of Valhalla – it was *Götterdämmerungorgeous*! Her comedy routine was well-received, but I literally forget all of it now because it was *so* long ago that I saw it. Next up was **Pearl**, who smoked a cigarette out of her nose while putting makeup on a homeless LGBT youth. It was really heartwarming. She received 10s across the board from the judges. Then another queen, I think it was **Kandy Ho’**, lip-synced to a really fast song and scored middle-of-the-pack. Another queen, I don’t remember which one (she might have been **black**, or maybe a **big girl**, or perhaps **Puerto Rican**, or possibly a **campy queen**) did a hilarious comedy skit and made a great joke about RuPaul that was really funny. RuPaul said “Oh no she better don’t!” and the audience all laughed. It was *so* funny. And memorable.

Next up was a new queen that I had never heard of before named **Vanity Mirrorz** (whose name I know was spelled with a “Z” even though we just heard of her for the first time then, and you might think that it was a regular “S” at the end, but I know for a fact that it ended with a “Z” because I have psychic powers), who wore an all-white surgical gown and [one of those old-fashioned doctor’s head mirrors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_mirror). She had a Bride of Frankenstein pure-white updo which was covered in pieces of mirror (which kind of reminded me of ~~Phoenix’s~~ Venus D’Lite’s crushed Christmas tree ornament outfit from Season 3). She did a comedy-meets-dance routine, showcasing her strengths as a comedian and a dancer, but she was kind of wheezing and breathless and hard to understand when she would stop dancing to tell a joke. The producers told us to not smile or clap when she was done. I think we all felt sorry for her. She was just standing up there awkwardly. Also, I noticed that one of her glued-in hair mirrors flew off in the middle of her routine and landed near the judges’ table. It almost hit Lea Michelle, who jumped up and threatened to leave the panel!

Before the next girl came out, the lights were dimmed and we saw several PAs carry out a huge barbell and put it in the center of the stage. When the lights came back up, they announced another amazing new girl named **Lukami Muscles**. We all giggled when we heard her name for the first time. When she came out, she had a really unique runway walk – [exactly like this one](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7pwdKWm7xHQ/UX1WERYbT4I/AAAAAAAALew/fZPWI_m6Hb4/s1600/vince-mcmahon-walk.gif). When she got to the end of the stage, she lifted the barbell up over her head with one hand! Another bunch of 10s from the judges, except for Michelle, who gave her a 4 for some reason…I think there were three more performers after her, but they’re all a blur now that it’s been *so* long since the taping. After the showcase, the audience was allowed leave, but the producers invited whoever wanted to stay to sit in for the final judging. They promised pizza after it, so I figured I’d stay just because of that.

In the judging, Ru declared Miss Fame safe, but warned her about resting comfortably on her makeup skills. Pearl was declared the winner for displaying the best “C.U.N.T.”, which made everybody feel really good, especially after Ru delivered a tearful speech that included a surprise for the homeless LGBT youth – *they would be getting their own show on the World of Wonder YouTube channel*!! It was so heartwarming.

Next up was Lukami Muscles, who was read for filth for looking like a butch-queen/manly-queen and for having a really meaty tuck, but she was praised by Santino for having a flawlessly fishy face. Michelle explained that she gave Lukami’s “C.U.N.T.” a low score because she herself could lift a barbell twice as heavy with her tits alone! We filmed a bunch of open-mouthed gasps, looking-to-our-neighbor shots and giggles to accompany that comment. Ru asked Lukami who should be in the bottom, and she said Vanity Mirrorz deserved to go home.

After her performance, we could all sense that Vanity Mirrorz was angry with the judges. Michelle called her out for it too. To make matters worse, Santino piped up and said that Vanity looked like a Troll Doll and that he didn’t understand her outfit at all, and that the mirrors in her hair needed to be glued in better (Lea Michele agreed whole-heartedly with that comment!). Then to our shock, Vanity replied that at least she *had* hair and clocked him for basically being a hypocrite. Oooo girl, we were all gagging like a bunch of fish out of their bowls at that expert read! Ru settled us down, and then asked Vanity who deserved to be eliminated, and she said Lukami Muscles.

Suddenly, Lukami Muscles got into an argument with Vanity Mirrorz right there on the mainstage! The audience went completely silent as it was happening. It was *super* awkward. RuPaul clapped her hands and told them both that they were going off-script. Meanwhile, Kandy Ho’, who was in the back with the other “safe girls,” started wobbling back and forth and then threw up into a nearby umbrella (which belonged in another girl's ""C.U.N.T.""). It smelled kind of like pizza, and that made me even hungrier for pizza than I already was. Production immediately called for a break so that they could clean up the stage, which still had broken pieces of Vanity Mirrorz’s mirrors on it in addition to the vomit. An intern had to clean up the vomit while the rest of the production crew handed out water to the audience, which I drank thirstily.

After we came back from break, Vanity Mirrorz and Lukami Muscles were in the bottom two. They had to lip-sync to “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynyrd. I won’t tell you the outcome, just that Season 7 is sure to be the best season yet! There are some seriously fierce queens this season, and some exciting new things that we’ve never seen before. But that’s all I’m gonna tell you for now!

I have a pretty great GPA (3.8), two internships, hackathon experience, two handfuls of my own software applications (some even successful), and (will have) managed to graduate college in three years.

I have been applying to some (like 30+) software development job openings in Berlin already and have had a few interviews, but no offers yet. This gives me hope that I can actually make it in, but perhaps I am missing something.

2k2g39,7,2014-10-23,[Deck] Blue Sun Rig Destruction,Shatner42,Netrunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/2k2g39/deck_blue_sun_rig_destruction/,"***Overview***: Fundamentally, this deck is Uncorrodable (e.g. get rid of the runner's fracter and include a bunch of barriers to lock them out) that doesn't put all its hope on barriers. This deck has sentries and code gates too, all of which end the run, and all of which bait banishing the offending breaker to the bottom of the stack with Wisp. Blue Sun was chosen for its flexibility (bouncing ice to stymie knight/femme/parasite, using OAI as an econ card, plus rearranging ice to mess with Kit, Nasir, and Quetzal) and because of its reputation for flat-lines causes many runners to play conservatively or go digging for their plascretes.

    3x Will-o'-the-Wisp


*Agendas*: The agendas provide a large chunk of the deck's economy. There is also a lot of 1-pointers to feed to Archer. Atlases can be used for tutoring, but they're mainly just 3/2s because 3/2s are superb. I traded one Profiteering out for one Chronos Project because scoring that agenda at the right time has the capacity to win you the game. Sure, they may have Clone Chips and Test Runs and Levys but if you just exiled their one copy of Corroder, none of that matters. Plus, the runner doesn't know how many OTHER copies of Chronos Project you have, giving them more to worry about even if the card gets stolen. The 2x 5/3s are rarely scored except after the runner has been rendered impotent, so their abilities don't matter much, but I decided to ditch the Priority Reqs (whose effect was never particularly needed) in favor of agendas that offered some versatility. Hades Fragment helps against milling and can, in combination with deck shuffles, bring some important stuff back to the top of R&amp;D. Government Contracts helps you restart your economy if you are repeatedly hit by Account Siphons and Vamps; this hasn't happened much, but it adds slightly more versatility than Priority Req did, so in it went. The sheer amount of bad publicity these agendas produce is staggering, but remember: it doesn't matter how much mid-run money they've got if they can't break your Ice Wall.  
    .  
*Ice*: All the ice ends the run and requires a breaker to get through (no option of spending clicks or beating traces instead), and 2/3rds of it is inexpensive to rez (i.e. 4 or less credits). Most are barriers because Corroder is the frequently the weak link, and because that's what most of the good, native ice available to Weyland is. There are just enough code gates to force the runner to find a solution to them, and because Kit hates it when you stick a Quandary on the outside of a server. Changeling can be advanced to gear-check fracters or killers and you'll toggle it to whatever they're weakest to, or whatever you want most to banish with Wisp. Archer is imposing, and might even trash some programs along the way, either by a surprise rez or in combination with Corporate Troubleshooter. That and once you've scored that first 1-pointer, suddenly the runner has to treat your facedown ice with a lot more caution. Curtain Wall is the only big, expensive ice, and it is mainly included to combo with OAI. However, unlike all of your other barriers, it is extremely taxing to break and will be troublesome to runners while they still have a fracter.  
    .  
*Assets*: 3xHoward Jacksons because he makes everything better. Once the runner is locked out, you will really lean on him to dig for your winning agendas. Plus, he's important for allowing you to recur your rig destruction cards MORE than the runner can recur their rig rebuilding cards. I don't normally find The Root necessary, but it is a helpful and taxing asset that you can use to bait the runner into your remote; I seldom need it but am never sad to see it. Aggressive Secretary is another tool for de-rigging the runner. Rez and bounce an unsprung Agg Sec into your hand, then install and advance a card. Is it an agenda, or is it the same trap? Give those runners even more to worry about.  
    .  
*Operations*: OAI gives you money from bouncing Curtain Walls and can open an early scoring window (Quandary over an AOI'd Archer protecting an Agenda on turn 2, for example). Power Shutdown is a major tool for destroying the runner's rig. Blowing up Corroder or Kit's Refracter is the dream, but I've screwed up runners plenty popping SMCs, Faeries, Datasuckers, Clone Chips, and sources of stealth credits (Cloak, the three flavors of 1-cost stealth hardware). Archived Memories lets you Wisp or Power Shutdown more. It also lets you grab whatever Power Shutdown milled, turning the two cards into a weird form of draw acceleration. Digging out a trashed Agg Sec restarts that mind game. Just Wisp'd the runner's only decoder? Dig those Quandaries out of the trash and enjoy your new scoring window. Really, it's a great card and well worth the influence cost.  
    .  
*Upgrades*: Wisp is the star here. There are all sorts of things a savvy runner can do to keep Power Shutdown, Agg Sec, and Archer from trashing their precious breakers, but there's not much that stops a Wisp from landing. When possible I put one on HQ and R&amp;D. Corporate Troubleshooter mainly makes Archer a threat after it's been rezzed. However, the runner won't know if you've installed a Troubleshooter or a Wisp, making it harder to gauge the risk in running. And if nothing else, you can stick one or both upgrades in your remote, either to look like an agenda or to protect one.  
  
    ---
***Playing the Deck:***  
Ice up your centrals. Score a Hostile Takeover, score a Profiteering, or bounce an OAI'd Curtain Wall to get your initial nest egg of credits. Place Wisps in likely-to-be-ran servers. Once they've responded to your gear-checking ice, blow up and/or bury their gear. Continue to build up your ice and dismantle their rig until you have a scoring window. Score until you no longer have a scoring window. Repeat. Enjoy drinking your opponent's rage-tears.  
    
Remember that it doesn't have to be their fracter that dies. If, for example, you killed their Dagger (or the stealth credits fueling it), put sentries over your important servers and score, score, score! If your opponent has managed to keep their rig functional somehow, go traditional glacier and try to bait them into overreaching by sometimes posing assets and upgrades as agendas... or just letting them steal a 1-pointer so you can score a 2- or 3-pointer. Better yet, bait them into running an advanced Aggressive Secretary.  
    
The deck isn't all that complicated, it just requires careful play during the early phase where your credit pool is low and your opponent's rig is untouched. Mind games with bounced/Archived Memories'd and re-installed cards can help slow the runner down while you make your way to the mid-game. Then you can start taking a crowbar to their rig in earnest.  

    ---
***Options for Tweaking and things I'm on the fence about:***  
*Why Lotus Field? Why Wraparound?* As part of my drive for versatility, I wanted some paradigm-shifting ice. With Corroder out, a Curtain Wall is just a big Ice Wall, but if you're using Yog then Lotus Field is most definately NOT a big Quandary. A fracter-deprived runner might still have an answer for your barriers (AI breakers, mid-run ice destruction, Paintbrush, etc.), and Wraparound makes those answers a lot less efficient. They aren't deck-defining, but they have been situationally very useful and worth their influence cost. If I were to cut one, I might be tempted to swap in a Rototurret to act as a mini-Archer (combos off Troubleshooter, ETR sentry, plus it might waste a faerie that would later have been used on an Archer). I could also see them getting replaced with Weyland or Neutral ice pretty quick if you wanted to free up influence for other strategies.  
    .  
*Moar Cood Gaets!* I really think this deck should have between 3 and 5 code gates. Unlike the barrier-purist Uncorrodable decks, I think it's valuable to gear-check the runner for all three breaker types, ESPECIALLY when playing as Blue Sun. If a Quandary forces the runner to play a Yog, that's great! And if that runner used a tutor to get that decoder, even better! Then I'll bounce the Quandary back to my hand and enjoy the credit swing, possibly while whistling a merry tune. I'm on the fence about cutting one or two cheap barriers for one or two more cheap code gates; striking the right balance between win more and versatility is tough.  
    .  
*Sans SanSan?* I'd love to include a SanSan or two in the deck. While this deck is very good at creating scoring windows, there is no fast advance so said windows have to be big; a clever/lucky runner might still pull off a hail mary and raid your remote. A deck with this many 3-advance agendas calls out for a SanSan. Also, traps (Agg Sec, Wisp) would make good guards for your SanSan while you wait for your agendas to show up. I could free up some influence by cutting imported ice and/or replacing some number of Archived Memories with Interns. If you were to do so, I wouldn't blame you, but Archived Memories' ability to recur Power Shutdown as well as induce runner doubt (""Okay, he picked up a Wisp/Agg Sec and installed SOMETHING but I have no idea what."") makes me very hesitant to cut any. Troubleshooters could also be cut, but they allow Blue Sun to directly convert its huge pile of excess cash into scoring windows, which you really want to do.

*To Scorch or not to Scorch?* It'd be easy to cut an ice or The Root and put in one or more Scorches. A single Scorch + Archived Memories can still flatline if the runner ended their turn tagged. However, this deck lacks any means of tagging, so you're either hoping the runner will do it for you, or you're diverting more card slots and influence to make it happen. I think this deck is strong enough at punishing the runner via rig destruction that you don't also need to threaten a flatline. However, you could make room for a single Sea Source by swapping an Archived Memories for an Interns or trading Lotus Field and Wraparound for a Quandary and a Bastion. Or you could replace one of your 1-pointers with a Posted Bounty. I don't think it's necessary, but I understand that it's hard to say ""no"" to an in-faction alternate win condition.

***Deck Weaknesses, Real and Imagined:***  
*Lots of Barriers? Doesn't E3 Quetzal eat you alive?* Not really. Quetzal can break a Curtain Wall better than anyone and will make bouncing one that's been OAI'd tricky. However, once you have two barriers stacked, she needs a fracter just like anyone else. And since she's not a Shaper, getting that fracter back after it's been Wisp'd is going to be a challenge. She'll likely have parasites and suckers to chew up your low-end ice, but this deck has enough recursion to make up the losses, and any parasite still on ice at the start of your turn gets trashed. In closing, a little tricky but very manageable.  
    .  
[Nasir, I don't like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDGlN6mluGA): This guy's ID isn't inherently a problem because we're not one of those ""Curtain Wall + Hadrianns Wall + Janus"" big ice Blue Sun decks. Heck, we don't even run Tollbooth. In fact, we have enough cheap ice that we can reposition to screw with this guy that I'm sure he'll hate us before we ever start nuking his rig. However, the typical Nasir deck comes stocked with cards to use mid-run money (most notably Personal Workshops, Clone Chips, SMC) and we'll be giving him plenty with all of our bad publicity. Combined with the number of tutor and recursion cards Shapers have access to, this guy has the potential to quickly build and rebuild his rig throughout the game (""Click-1: I run your ice wall, spend the 4 bad pub, and bounce. Click-2: I run your ice wall...""). I've played and won against Nasir decks, but they are a real challenge, unlike the brittle rigs Crims and Anarchs build. If it's a stealth deck, nuke the source of his stealth credits. If it's big rig, make him keep fetching and paying for Morning Star/Torch/Garrote as you keep Wisping them to the bottom of his stack. And always keep bouncing and repositioning cheap ice out front of your important servers; he hates that.  
    .  
*Early Credit Denial*: This deck's econ comes from scoring agendas and bouncing OAI'd Curtain Walls, which take a little preparation to pull off. If a runner can turn-1 break into your HQ then you're vulnerable to being repeatedly Account Siphoned. While you try to get back on your feet the runner will rummage through your hand and your R&amp;D. An OAI'd Curtain Wall will save you, but those same runners might derez or trash the darn thing. Note to Runners: if you can, you WANT to derez or trash the darn thing because in that situation I REALLY want those 14 credits. Against Andromeda, I'd give serious consideration to double icing HQ (Quandary + Ice Wall FTW) and just accepting a turn of her running amok in R&amp;D. Once you have a little money to begin with, you can bounce back from Siphons and Vamps pretty quickly by rezzing HQ ice, The Root, and any Wisps during the run, and then bouncing them back to hand until your credit pool has stabilized. And note that unlike other traps, a rezzed Wisp will fire even if you're broke. Also, while it may be tempting to create a scoring server immediately, I'd recommend taking your time and icing up things up first; you're vulnerable early on so cover that weakness.  
    .  
*Blackmail*: I have yet to run into one of these decks, but you will be swimming in bad publicity so in theory a runner could only run your remote with Blackmail. This would leave your ice unrezzed and making your Wisps and Troubleshooters worthless, thus leaving your agenda undefended. This would be a headache but you can work around it. You've got a LOT of tiny agendas as well as a lot of stuff that can pose as agendas, so when facing Blackmail you stop going vertical and go horizontal instead. Build two or three remotes, each with a single card protected by a single ice. Then they have to play your shell game, hoping they Blackmail the correct server. Alternatively, you could OAI some ice and NOT bounce it back to your hand. Keep this up until they've run out of Blackmails or you've managed to actually rez a decent remote."

I switched into CS very late, I was a business major who decided to pick up a double major starting my Senior year (took a CS class and was hooked, having previously felt like I had no idea what I was doing in business).  
I have some personal projects, but they are mostly class assignments and a few little things I'm working on.  Unfortunately, trying to cram an entire second degree with no filler classes into one year is really killing my ability to do anything extra-curricular, and this combined with my late entry into CS and low GPA I feel make me a particularly bad candidate on paper. 

I applied to a ton of companies over the past month and had no luck at all (I got like one phone screen which I moved onto the next round in but that still has to pan out). All the big companies denied me instantly and the smaller ones all wanted web developers with lots of experience so I stopped looking for now.

I have one more semester left before I graduate in May and I want to be ready by the time March rolls around to at least have a chance of getting something good.  So for that I wanted to share my action plan for the next few months and also I have a few questions I would really appreciate if you guys could help me shed some light on.

**Plan:**
start doing some Udacity courses for web development and get the basics down enough (html/CSS/javascript syntax) before winter break, and then over winter break just burn through as many web/other interesting courses as I can that have major projects at the end to add to my resume.  Working 40 hrs/week for 3 weeks should get me pretty far into some good projects.

Go to all the recruiting events/career fairs next semester and hope I can land something.

1. I feel like I'm focusing a lot on web development with this plan, but I'm not even sure if I will want to do web development as my actual job.  Back end stuff sounds kind of cool to me, but I really liked the kind of programming we did in our data structures classes and such.  I'm thinking of web development as a sort of ""foot in the door"" for more software developer type roles.  Is this a good idea or should I be trying something else?
2. What else should I do/any other suggestions, given my situation? 

I apologize for what is probably a pretty long post and ridiculous run-on sentences, but I feel kind of hopelessly lost right now and that I've just been wasting my parents' money. I have this fear I'm just going to graduate and have nothing to show for it even after what I thought was my second wind from discovering CS after 4 years of just doing the bare minimum in business classes I hated.

Edit: I guess what I have learned from this is that the term IT might be changing. While some people in this thread talk about IT as if it is strictly tech support I have found that my role in IT departments still is a fair amount of software development. However, this software consists of mostly internally used tools or web development. In addition to this, it consists of meetings where people of different tech disciplines come together and postulate ideas to use technology to improve the business side of of the company. This is why it often results in web development because companies want to have increased web presence. Thank you all for your input!"

2k3fxk,336,2014-10-23,Layer 8 problems -- Part 2,jwhardcastle,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2k3fxk/layer_8_problems_part_2/,"After [an HVAC contractor created a loop on our network](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2jy8hh/layer_what_i_dont_see_that_on_the_osi_model/) and temporarily bogged down our Cisco network backbone for about an hour Monday morning, we thought we were in the clear once the loop had been removed.  In the past things always went right back to normal once the loop was gone.  Switches recovered, servers and workstations didn't seem to mind too much, all was well again.  This time, however, there appeared to be lingering effects.  I mentioned this happens maybe once a year, but this is the first time it's happened in the last 18 months since we put in our new VOIP system.

The first thing that TheNetworkGuy noticed was that one of the voice switches (the call control units for the VOIP system) didn't come back online right away.  This voice switch, like all the others, is wired to the network with redundant copper links, each Cat6 plugged into a different half of the core.  If we reboot one switch in the core, the other switch takes over.  This particular voice switch, which happened to handle half of the T1/PRI connections between our VOIP system and the rest of the world, didn't come back online, but TNG was able to get it to reconnect by shutting off the redundancy at the core.  This forced the voice switch to failover to the other core switch, and it reappeared.  TNG didn't think much of it, and moved on.

Later on Monday, I was on the phone with someone in the fundraising office:

&gt; Fund: We need this to go out right away an****click**** -- **dialtone**

Her voice cut off mid-word and I was left with a ringing in my ear.  I hung up and she called right back.

&gt; Fund: That's so weird, that's been happening to me today.  My calls keep dropping right in the middle of talking to someone.

&gt; Me: I agree, that isn't supposed to happen.  We'll send Intern over there to replace your phone and that should take care of it.

Fund had also been having other phone problems recently, so we thought nothing of it.  We thought it was just more problems with her hardware.  

Tuesday morning, things are going smoothly.  I'm waiting in the office for an underground utility rep to show up so we can talk about some directional boring.  /u/thefultonhow is going over some things with Intern, and TNG has just arrived.  Then we get another report of problems.  This time, the assistant to the head of school reports that the head (the head of school is both my boss and **the** boss -- basically the equivalent of a CEO) is having the same problems as Fund.

&gt; Me: Who was Head talking to when he had this problem?

&gt; HeadAsst: He was talking to the Communications Director.

Comm works in the office right above Fund, in the same building.  I say *building* but I really mean an old house that has been converted into an office for 20 people, with a Cisco switch mounted in the rafters in the basement.  My spidey sense is going off, and so is TNG.  

We had seen some weird SNMP alerts over the weekend with the switch in that building spiking the CPU above 97%.  TNG wasn't worried, because this is a known bug in the particular revision of IOS that the switch is running, and it doesn't affect network traffic.  We had patched most of the switches on campus to remove the bug, but for some reason had missed that building.

&gt; Me: Is it possible that we actually *are* seeing packet loss?  That the switch is flaking out on us?  Can we just do some emergency downtime and fix it?

&gt; TNG: Yes, of course, but you've got to give the go ahead to knock the building offline for 20 minutes, no computers or phones, while the firmware is upgraded.

&gt; Me: Do it.  Send an email out, schedule it for noon, and hopefully folks will get the hint and leave for lunch.

I went out to meet the world's quietest-talking site surveyor, while TNG prepared for the upgrade.  Knowing that someone would need to be in the FundHouse to reboot the switch (because the bug also blocks telnet access), I ran to the cafeteria and grabbed a quick bite before heading down to the affected building.  As I'm passing through the lunch line, another employee comes up to me.

&gt; Athletics: Are we having problems with the phones?  I've been dropping calls.

My spidey sense is now full-on screaming at me.  And meanwhile, while I'm in line in the cafeteria but everyone else is back at the office, TFH's phone rings and it's HeadAsst.

&gt; HeadAsst: Head was just on a call with someone else and the call dropped.

&gt; TFH: Was the person in FundHouse?

&gt; HeadAsst: No, they were elsewhere on campus.

&gt; TFH: Ok, that's not good.  We thought this was a problem with the equipment in FundHouse, but clearly Head is having problems independent of that.  Can you transfer me over to him so I can get more information?

Call transfers...

&gt; Head: Hey TFH, I understand you need some information about the problem I've been having.  It's weird.  I'll just be talking on the phone and all of a sudden the call gets disconn****click**** -- **dialtone**

TFH calls back...

&gt; TFH: Yeah, seems like you're having a similar problem.  We'll look into it.

As I'm walking down to FundHouse to bounce the recalcitrant switch, I shot a message to TNG and TFH.

&gt; Me: Guys, we've got a bigger problem than just FundHouse.  I just heard from Athletics that they have dropped calls too.  Not on campus, but calls out through the T1.  

&gt; TFH:  And I've confirmed that Head's issues are completely independent of FundHouse issues.  I was on a call with him when the call dropped.

&gt; Me: I think we need to engage tech support for the VOIP system.

&gt; TNG: OK, I agree.  I'll call them now while we start upgrading the switch.

The switch upgrade goes well, and has the added side effect of rebooting all of the phones in FundHouse twice, once when I unplugged the UPS for two minutes to reactivate the switch, and a second time when TNG finished the firmware upgrade and rebooted the switch again.

Meanwhile, TNG is on the phone with VOIPSupport describing the issue and getting a ticket created.  When I get back, I hear them discussing rebooting the whole phone system.

&gt; TNG: That's fine, I will reboot the whole system, but first I want to know what caused it.  If we reboot it, and we find out that we haven't solved the root issue, the problem could just come back tomorrow, or some time soon when it really counted.  I want to stay on the line until we track down the issue so we know how to fix it in the future.

TNG's good at this.  He's got experience from the consulting world, where he's used to dealing with much larger and more complicated networks than ours.

TFH and I start trying to gather more information to help TNG and VOIPSupport narrow down the issue.  I sent TNG some screenshots from my call log to help him find my dropped call with Fund so he can scour the logs with VOIPSupport.  We call HeadAssist to find out if the boss is in, and when the office is clear TFH runs down to Head's office where we haven't yet swapped out the phone to make a call and see if we can reproduce the issue.  TFH calls me at my desk.

&gt; TFH: OK, so I guess I'll just stay on the line until i****click**** -- **dialtone**

Call time: 11 seconds.  Well, at least we can reproduce the issue.  TFH calls me right back.

&gt; TFH: That was fast!  Should we try again?

&gt; Me: Sure, let's see if we can get some timing on it.

That call lasted 3 minutes and 50 seconds.

Back in the office, TFH, AssistantDirector and I are scratching our heads trying to figure out what the commonality is.  TNG is on hold with VOIPSupport, so he wanders over as well.

&gt; TNG: It's not the network, because if it were, we'd be experiencing other issues besides just phones.  Stuff would be going crazy all over the place.

&gt; TFH: Well, it's not just FundHouse, because Head and Athletics are having the problem as well.

&gt; TNG: It can't be just internal calls, because we had Athletics drop calls outside.  

&gt; Me: You kicked the PRI voice switch, right?  What switch are all these affected clients connected to?

TFH looks, and sure enough all of the suspected affected are connected to the same voice switch, out of the 5 available.  So, now we think we've got a good place to start hacking away with VOIPSupport.  We see that our very own AD is on the broken voice switch, so we get her to call TFH until it drops.  51 seconds.  Another call, 3 minutes and 49 seconds.  Call after call after call, nothing lasts longer than 3 minutes and 52 seconds.  Success!  We can now reproduce the issue on command, without leaving our office.

&gt; VOIPSupport: OK, so let's just reboot the switch and see if that fixes the problem.

&gt; TNG: No, as I said, we want to find out what is wrong with the voice switch, so we can prevent this from happening again in the future.  Telling us just to reboot the phone system whenever we have a problem isn't really a solution.  Isn't there some debugging you can do on the voice switch to find out what's going on?

We know full well the answer to this question.  We've had problems with the equipment in the past that required the vendor to log into the voice switch and enable some more detailed debugging and logs.  We've seen it several times.  We know that as soon as VOIPSupport does this, we'll see something weird and be able to track it down.  But VOIPSupport must not know about this.  He's tier 1, dealing with our tier 3.  So, we follow his script.  TNG and VOIPSupport use a shared screen to look through pages and pages of logs.  We see calls initiated, built, connected, transmitted, terminated, and torn down.  The system reports that each call was ended with ""reason 1,"" or ""normal termination.  We ask VOIPSupport what this means.

&gt; VOIPSupport: I have reviewed the logs with my manager.  That means the call was ended normally.  Hang up or something like that.

&gt; TNG: Except it wasn't.  The call terminated abnormally.  

This process repeats for the half-dozen calls that we have explicit details about, who called whom, when the call was placed, when it ended, etc.  VOIPSupport looks at the logs, finds the call, sees that it terminated normally, puts us on hold for 10 minutes to confer with his manager, and then returns to tell us that the system is working.

Finally, we see something else.  VOIPSupport finds an item in the logs that indicates the voice switch lost communication with the phone.

&gt; VOIPSupport: Well, that means your network is the problem.  The voice switch couldn't talk to the phone.

&gt; TNG: That's not possible.  We aren't seeing packet loss on our network.  I'm looking at the core right now.  I'm looking at the switch where the phone is right now.  And why would it only affect this voice switch?

TNG is nevertheless doubting himself a bit, and so we start looking at everything.  Port statistics on the switch, CRC errors, packet loss, ping the switch, ping the phone, etc.  Meanwhile, VOIPSupport has dug in his heels.


&gt; VOIPSupport: I have confirmed with my manager that this is a network issue.  I'm going to close this ticket as solved, the issue is your network.

&gt; TNG: That's not correct.  We still haven't solved the issue.  I can show you it isn't the network.

&gt; VOIPSupport: Well, I don't know about the architecture of your network, so I can't help you.

&gt; TNG: You aren't hearing me.  Every indicator I have says it isn't the network, and on the other side it only appears to be this one voice switch.

&gt; VOIPSupport: I can forward you to network support, but if they can't fix the issue, it's a paid service.

&gt; TNG: You're telling me you are unwilling to fix this issue?  That I have to pay you fix this?  I want to speak to your supervisor.  I want to escalate this issue.

&gt; VOIPSupport: He's busy.  You can't speak with him.  Whatever you want, I will tell you.

&gt; TNG: You've been going back and forth with your supervisor for the last hour.  I want to speak with him directly.

&gt; VOIPSupport: You cannot.  He is busy.

After a few minutes of this, my blood is boiling a bit.  I'm not known to bite my tongue.  TNG has been on the phone with this guy now for almost 5 hours, with no resolution.  TNG may have the patience to do this all day, but I've got dinner plans with my wife.  I'm done.  I put on my loud, clear, authoritative, ""I want this done now"" voice.

&gt; Me: VOIPSupport, I want your full name, your employee ID number, your telephone number, and your manager's name and number.  We are unsatisfied with the service we have received today, and we would like to follow up with your supervisor.  We want this issue resolved, and we want it done right now.  Please give me the information before you transfer us, immediately, to your supervisor.

After some silence, VOIPSupport agrees to give us his name (""that's my only identification, I don't have a phone number or an ID number,"" he complains) and his email address.  We determine this is satisfactory for the time being.  VOIPSupport give us a different 1-800 number to call for the ""duty supervisor.""  TNG dials, and after speaking to a functionary he is dumped into a cellphone voicemail box for **VOIPManager**  He leaves a number and awaits a callback.

&gt; Me: OK, let's gather some nuclear ammunition.  Packet capture, any logs we can find, ping all the things, dump switch statistics.

&gt; TNG: Agreed.

We cloned AD's port to my machine and fired up WireShark.  Sure enough, three minutes and change into the call WireShark shows a clear pattern.  The phone would send a hearbeat every 4 minutes.  The voice switch would respond ""OK,"" and then (in a fit of multiple personalities) issue a command to reinitialize and reset the phone, which terminated the call.  The phone responded that the call had been terminated, and the voice switch would record that as a normal event.

Finally VOIPManager called back, took down some information, and told us a stateside rep would call us back to further diagnose the issue.  Within a few minutes, we received a call from a man who shared a first name with a top five American metropolis.  He saw the packet capture and the screenshots we had attached to the ticket, said, ""Oh, that's not right,"" and within an hour had gathered extensive debugging from the affected voice switch and other hardware to escalate to the engineering team and get the bug fixed.  They concluded that the voice switch was not actually acknowledging the hearbeat messages, and was sending out the command to reinitialize the phones every four minutes.  Satisfied, TNG rebooted the switch and the problem went away.

**TLDR**: It turns out you can lead a horse to water, show them a picture of what it looks like to drink, and watch them die of dehydration, but they still won't transfer you to a supervisor.

*Edit*: The Cisco IOS, not Apple iOS.  Clarified ""voice switches"" which are a component of the VOIP infrastructure, not vSwitches, which we use on the VMWare side.  And fixed my dumb typos."

Now I'm going away and the relationship sort of has an expiration date this coming january. I guess I'm in a better position since I'm the one getting to travel and have cool experiences, and she's the one who gets to stay at home.

But.... 

Yesterday she send me a text saying 'she needs some time to figure things out'.

I called her and she told me she doesn't want to risk liking me more as january comes closer and then wait for me leaving for 5 months.

She told me she will text me on saturday hopefully being ready with an answer...
I asked her if it would alter the situation if we took my internship ""out of the equation"" and she said yes.

Im so damn nervous and I really like her... Im nervous about her dumping me because she's afraid of a longterm relationship.
Any advice on what to do, should I just wait for her to get back to me?

thx

I'm looking at about a year and a half until I graduate and I feel like I wouldn't be able to help much even if I got an internship. My gpa isn't bad, but it's not great. I used to go to university of Houston and when I was there I compared myself to the other students there who have great GPA's and lots of programming experience I just don't see how a company would look at my resume and say ""hey lets hire this guy instead of this other guy from this big college"". I want to do personal projects but I have no idea what to do or what would even look good. I have some experience in Java and JavaScript and a tiny bit in C++. My biggest fear is this not working out. I want to be a programmer so bad. Any advice? "

I want to bring a friend into it so we both have time to work on it and we share the same love for the specific clothing style. 


I'm stuck on the idea of actually starting this brand.

Would it be smart to hire some graphics designers and make 1-5 shirts and put them on teespring and see how they do before I start looking for clothing manufacturers? 

Should I start a website first? Should I make a desirable social media presence? I don't know where to start with this and I don't want to jump into something I can't control.

2k4792,5,2014-10-23,"The VA Experience, OIF 2008 Veteran, substandard medical care",wheres_the_VA_Reform,Veterans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/2k4792/the_va_experience_oif_2008_veteran_substandard/,"I need to share my experience with the VA System. I'm curious as to if others receive the same care I get the joy of experiencing when dealing with the VA Health Care System. 

I have been going to a va hostital (campus) since 2009, after being medically retired from active service. I spent the end of 2007 and most of 2008 in Mosul, Iraq. Experienced many IED's &amp; Concussion Blasts and my memory has definitely suffered. Not just my memory, when I'm speaking I have what im saying in my head, but when I talk i occasionally involuntarily slur/garble my speech. Thus repeating myself, thankfully, most people don't point it out :( ... In the end of 2013 I attempted suicide by overdosing with Ambien (More then a 90 day supply, less then a years). I went from being depressed and in my bedroom to waking up a hospital bed with the works. Essentially I took too much Ambien (shocking i know, don't think clearly with major depression...), vomited it up and then the vomit went into my lungs.  Adding white lung to my list of medical life accomplishments. It took about 10 days in intensive care to be stabilized and transitioned to a mental wing at a va center. 

Thats my back history.  I've talked to many psychologists &amp; psychiatrists, and I like to think I'm doing better, I was finally at a point where I was ready to talk about my experiences in Iraq, and that has helped a lot since my suicide attempt.

The VA care Pre &amp; Post suicide has been mediocre is the nicest way I can think of. 

The main facilities I go to is the mental health section. Whenever I call the main appointment number &amp; then get transferred to the number for mental health appointment line: the phone rings for 30-45 minutes on average. I really wish i was exaggerating that number, I have never, I repeat _never_ called and a person has picked up in under 5 minutes. Your phone will ring for so long, that your going to need to plug it into the charging adapter. Now once they answer, the appointment window is normally 3-4 weeks out from when the veteran calls it in which is rather soon! If you try to set a primary doctor appointment then on average you schedule 45-60 days out from the time you call in. But lets say you need a specialist. Well the primary is going to reference you to a specialist then you'll schedule an appointment for them a couple weeks out too. You just hope you don't have to see a 3rd person. Because after 3 months, most things common ailments go away on their own.

The va medical professionals just say, If you want to be seen right away go to the ""emergency"" room. The emergency room gets overwhelmed by veterans that are tired of waiting for medical appointments. The best way to get seen in the emergency room, is to arrive there by ambulance on a stretcher.

Over the course of 5 years I have had many (20-30) appointments randomly scheduled from the VA. I always schedule my appointments on my days off from work. My appointments I schedule get confirmation calls. These ghost appointments, just show up, then the patient (me) gets tagged as a no show. Sometimes I get notified that I had a missed appointment usually not. Until I'm with my med doctor and hes like hey you have a bunch of missed appointments. 

Brings me to today: I recently moved and was driving an hour each way to the VA center to see my doctor. My doctor has 2 or 3 times now, not come and got me for my scheduled appointment, set 4 weeks prior. Now the mental health calls the doctors, and talks to them, to let you know the patient has arrived. After 15 minutes of missed appt you go back to the window (while waiting in line again, 10-15ppl on a 3 of 5 window, and it takes a 2-3 minutes before the call next person, I assume they are browsing reddit for next post to read). Then you repeat till you get seen or get fed up and leave.

One check in then 2x 15 minute reminders. I left. Now the best experience  have had with the VA was dealing with a medical intern. They seemed to care, and when the mental health cancelled my appointment cause the doctor above the medical student was out for the day. The medical student would call me to say they could see me still. Ive never gotten that with other doctors at the VA. I guess the medical interns haven't been ruined by the VA system yet.

In short, I'm tired of my current VA center giving me a loop around. I'm going to try the one that's 20 minutes north of me. Hopefully they are not all the same. 

It seems the only way to get good medical after the military is to afford private care, non VA. I don't make enough money :("
2k4cfi,282,2014-10-23,Dr NO!,Gozer1985,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2k4cfi/dr_no/,"I was a young nursing student doing clinical portion of my training in a hospital with loads of young medical students, residents and interns. There was a lot of dating, and flirting between the young Dr's and nurses.  It was harmless fun..mostly.

One day, Im caring for my patients and this resident comes into the room to see the patient. To clarify, a resident Dr is a person who has completed medical school and are now completing the clinical portion of their training, which is usually 1-3 years depending on specialty.  The residents visit the patients, then come back with the attending physician to write orders. So, this resident comes in and, automatically my creep meter goes off.  He is wearing shirt, tie and labcoat. This is around the time when Viagra was just coming out and his tie has the pattern of a bunch of little Viagra pills, and he has about 3 pens with the Viagra logo in his lab coat front pocket. 

side note- I never understood why all the guys were so coo coo over the Viagra stuff from the reps back then. I mean, Viagra is for older men who need help getting it up so what is that saying about the 30 years olds so excited about the Viagra ties and pens?!?!?

I see the Viagra gear and automatically think to myself ""here we go...""  Immediately he's flirtatious asking me questions about the patient while overtly looking me up and down. No offense to anyone reading this, but he was of middle eastern descent and I always found those dr's to be more overtly sexual and aggressive with the nurses. I am of middle eastern descent as well but you most likely wouldn't be able to tell by looking at me.

Time goes on and I continue to see him daily, and he continues to flirt. I keep it polite and eventually he asks me to lunch.  I keep making excuse for about a week or so and he is so persistent.  I finally agree to have lunch with him....in the hospital cafeteria.  He doesn't want to eat the cafeteria food because he ALWAYS eats the cafeteria food, besides, a woman like me deserves to eat somewhere nice, not the hospital cafeteria (eye roll).  So I agree we can lunch at this little café about a 1/2 from the hospital,we can actually walk there.

I wont bore with the details but he insists on driving, and, Im in it this far, so finally I just relent.  What could possibly go wrong. We are both well known at the hospital its not like he's going to kidnap me or anything..right??

Im waiting in front of the hospital for him to pull the car around. He rolls up in a shiny black mustang, opens the passenger door from inside with the biggest smile ""hop in!"" I get in, feeling a little uneasy.  All we need to do is exit the parking lot, go to the first light turn left and we're there.....except we get to the first stop light and he turns RIGHT.
Me: You're turning the wrong way
Dr No: I thought we'd have lunch somewhere else
Me: Where? (wait for it)
Dr No: a place right up here
Me: Where?
Dr No: My place ( with a shit eating grin on his face)

By now, we are only about a 1/2 block from the hospital in the opposite direction that we should be and we are stopped at a light in the turning lane, he has his blinker on to turn into his apartment complex.

I start screaming  ""turn this fucking car around right now motherfucker""  and all sorts of obscenities, I keep trying to unlock the door and he keeps locking it with the automatic lock so I start beating on the window. He sees how freaked out I am, and starts to back pedal and trying to calm me down.  He turns the car in the right direction and pulls into the front of the hospital and I jumped out, ran inside.  

I was embarrassed, I felt stupid for even putting myself in that situation. I told some of the other nursing students and we had a system of watching out for him, when he would come to the floor I would hide in the med room until he was gone.  I only had a couple more weeks on that rotation and I then changed hospitals.  Not long after, I found out one of the other students in my class had been involved with him,only she was actually 'dating' him.  She stopped dating him after she discovered (through his room mate) that he actually had a wife and kids in his home country.  We both went to nursing administration and shared our stories about this resident. It turns out he had been in trouble for harassing nurses in the past and he was eventually removed from the program.

2k4lvc,1,2014-10-23,Some thoughts on #Gamergate,Jenny_Lite,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2k4lvc/some_thoughts_on_gamergate/,"I posted in another thread about Gamergate talking about my experiences with a group of guys that were hoping for a career in the video games industry.

First off I need to declare that there are aspects of Gamergate that raise important ethical questions about how the Media and industry interact with each other.

I actually think the people that have raised the issue have had a large degree of success as many of the publications and developers have been forced to clean up their relationships.

Anyway my own experiences with groups of gamers/wannabe programmers was at university.

My university fed a lot of Computer Science graduates into the games industry. I never really understood why it was seen as a such a prestigious area, by so many guys. Because as employers the big game developers aren't particularly great, their pay and conditions tend to lag behind companies in other sectors, and some of them can treat their programmers pretty badly.

As I put it to one guy, if you're getting paid 30% less than what you could earn in an equivalent job with a a different employer, then essentially you're paying for the privilege of working there.

They're also pretty poor employers generally, some of them forcing people into declaring themselves self employed, taking advantage of interns (which is fairly unusual in other areas of the tech industry) and laying people off at the drop of a hat.

Still though a lot of guys wanted to work there, and they were all guys. When I started my course my Maths wasn't up to a high standard so I ended up needing extra tuition.

The university ran a sort of remedial maths course (it wasn't actually called that).I was the only one from my course on it, everyone else was from the computer science department, and every single one of them wanted to work in that games industry.A lot of people that start computer science courses don't realise that there's a huge element of Maths involved so it takes them by surprise. I was also incidentally the only girl on the course.

So I got a kind of insight into the types of personality that are drawn to gaming as a profession. They were mostly nice guys, they were pretty intensely focused on what was happening in the gaming industry almost to the exclusion of all else.

I think because they had ended up in an environment with other like minded people their attitudes and personalities had kind of been amplified.

The most fascinating thing about them, however was their attitude to having to take the extra maths classes.I'd fought to get on the maths course, after I realised I was struggling with my course. It was primarily laid on for the computer science students, and was geared towards them.

Initially when we started the majority of them were fairly accepting of having to do it, for the simple fact that they were not going to be able to complete their degree without it.

A few didn't though and from the beginning were vocal about how unjust and inappropriate they felt it was. The people that held that view started to push it on everyone else, so that by the second week it was almost uniformly held.

For a strong minority, it drove them mad that anyone in the course, might believe that it was right that they should be there. One guy in particular used to go around the class questioning people constantly to make sure they shared his view. He tended to ignore me for some reason.

I was pretty much ignored in general, the PHD students that was teaching us were ignored, or faced disruption. Which was bad news for everyone as nobody wanted to teach the class by the second week, and the university was starting to take a negative view of what was happening.

The guys were nice individually but in a group they were a fucking nightmare. It was just a horrible example of cutting your nose off to spite your face. They somehow felt that by their protesting, the university were going to change the requirements for their degree.

When I pointed out to them once, that computer science degrees had to comply to set standards, and it was unlikely the University could change it even if they wanted to, the reaction I got wasn't good.

Every time Gamergate gets mentioned, I think of them. A pissed off group getting themselves worked up about something and completely missing the real problem.

I mean the fact that they didn't realise the Maths content of their course before starting was the real issue. Their course like mine was under subscribed so they lowered entry requirement while maintaining overall standards which resulted in a massive amount of drop outs. Also the Universities attempt to give a basic maths grounding was pretty half hearted.

So they were actually being fucked over by the University, however in a different way than they thought. 

In that sense I feel it's very similar to Gamergate.

2k4rtx,1,2014-10-23,I feel like an asshole kid–and I want to change that,[deleted],DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2k4rtx/i_feel_like_an_asshole_kidand_i_want_to_change/,"I want to get along better with my parents, but I’m finding that increasingly difficult to do. As I’ve grown up, it feels like we’ve grown further and further apart. It’s sad to say, but sometimes I feel like the less I see them, the better we get along.

I’m 19, hapa, taking a gap year before college, and living at home for the time being. My parents are both upper middle class, successful professionals, and since I was young they always emphasized doing well in school and extracurricular activities.

Naturally, this has resulted in them being incredibly overbearing at times, academically and otherwise. For a huge chunk of my life I’ve been forced to do activities and things I didn’t really care about, not to mention being constantly harassed about grades, thinking about future careers, etc. We’re the kind of family where only &gt;90% is actually good. That’s pretty much what my parents care about. It’s like being happy means fuck all.

Growing up, I rarely ever was able to hang out with friends, and long-term I think that’s impacted both my social circles and social development overall. Throughout highschool I think I may have made five genuine connections with people, other than that, I was the kid who’d always be alone in a crowd. As a whole, I don’t remember having a happy childhood, and that’s definitely continued throughout my young adult years. Though I’ve made an effort to limit it, I still am dependent on external validation, which is probably a result of the way I was raised. I like to probe into my own psychology a lot, and I think this need for validation is a huge issue. 

The more I think about it, the more I realize how much suppressed anger I have. Maybe it’s a result of my childhood, maybe it’s not. But it’s definitely there. It’s not purely directed at either of my parents, but for whatever reason they are pretty much the only people who bring it out of me. With other people, I’m easy to get along with and pretty laid back. But in the overbearing environment I live in, it comes out, a lot.. Both my mom and I tend to be temperamental, confrontational, etc, so so things can get ugly, very ugly. 

I know my parents love me unconditionally and just want the best–or what they perceive as the best–for me. They care so much about my brother and I, probably way too much. But, the worst part of all of this is that I’m hurting the people who love me most, and who I love most. 

All of this has been building up lately, and I’ve become increasingly aware of it. I’ve tried to avoid my parents, because I know any interaction will likely become one of a few things: a lecture on school/work/careers,a scolding of some sort (like I’m a fucking child still), or straight up confrontation. A few weeks ago, what should have been a laid back family dinner after a long-ass day ended up being a two hours of blabber about my current internship, future careers, and subjects of that nature. 

Not fun to be around. 

I want to get along with you guys, but you make it so damn hard.

Originally, I had planned to do med school. So I took the MCAT, rocked it, taught for kaplan/princeton review for awhile, and then decided not to go to med school for various reasons. There wasn't much for me to do with a BS in biology, so I went back to school to do applied cognitive neuroscience, as neuroscience was what appealed to me most about med school anyway. After starting the program, I became really interested in neural nets, and then dynamical systems, and then intelligent systems, and then machine learning ending up taking several courses outside of my degree plan, due to lack of guidance and a desire to ""learn"", and realized I had done enough for basically half of a masters in computer science. At that point, I applied, was accepted and was allowed/placed into classes that were far beyond what I had anticipated ie (computer architecture), and had a couple bad and incredibly depressing semesters, resulting in tanking my gpa below 3.0, which prevents me from being able to graduate. Currently, I haven't been to school since the spring semester (still in my masters programs, just not taking courses). Since that time, I had an internship in web development, which ended, and I've worked on several independent projects, but I feel like even with the good grades I got in my intelligent systems/dynamical system optimization/machine learning courses, I don't have a chance of getting a job in the field most relevant to my education. I can go back and retake some of those courses and pull my gpa up, but I have already sunk so much money into grad school and feel so burnt out that I'm worried I no longer have to motivation to finish.

I decided in order to broaden my chances of finding a penpal/fellow writer, that for my first post I'm going to give three story ideas. However, these ideas are not non-negotiable and I am very much open to whatever ideas you might have or alterations to the ones that I have provided! So don't feel hesitant on asking if I'm okay to change anything about them! :)

As for my kinks, I have many. Pretty much I have no limits. However some of my biggest ones are ageplay, incest, watersports, panties (this does not mean I like wearing them. It means I find them extremely attractive and well some other things, but I don't wear them! lol), Dom/sub relationships, and light bondage. However this does not mean these are all my kinks or that I am opposed to introducing others to the story. Also, if one is not comfortable with any of them, they do not need to be added to the story. I am looking for someone who is open to do this long term. Build up the characters and the story line. I find it more interesting that way! Or at least someone who doesn't reply with one 4 worded sentences each time. So at least a paragraph per response please!

(Option #1) In a world filled with magic and darkness, you have been assigned to pose as a professor at a renowned school that prepares young students of all kinds of background, history and abilities to hone in on their skills and become a hunter or huntress. In reality to you a member of a secret organization of killers, sworn to put an end to all darkness in the world. However, while undercover you discover a young elf who, though is completely doubtful of himself and his skills, is extremely gifted in the ways of mentalism and conjuring of the elements. He just doesn't know how gifted he is yet.

But you sense something dark about his soul, so you take him under your wing as an apprentice and teach him to improve upon his already discover two skills (though he believes his mental skills are unknown to anyone since he never told anyone. You somehow figure it out.). But also you must teach him in the ways of the darkness hidden inside him in order for him to control it and not let it take over him. (Maybe you cause a series of terrible events to occur at the school that somehow lead back to me, and you convince me the only way to live a decent life now is to run away with you. Or you can teach me there in secrecy. I leave all these details open to your creativity. I am not picky and find someone with an imagination attractive!) Ultimately we will fall in love. A tabooed student teacher relationship. Or maybe we just fuck for the hell of it because of the intensity of training and need to blow off steam. Your choice. This was the first long-term style rp idea that I did and what made me want to continue doing them. So it's always a favorite!

(Option #2) Lately there have been several natural disasters happening throughout the country, but mostly in California. You had the understanding that it was just tectonic plate movements due to being on a fault line. But that didn't explain the recent tornado. One day while walking home from school you feel a tremor coming on and look for the nearest safe spot, but be it that you were in the middle of crossing the road, that left you with little to no options. What's worse is that you turned to see what's going on and see a car speeding out of control and without a doubt going to hit you. You close your eyes and accept your fate, until you feel a collision from your back and land on something softer than the ground.

You open your eyes and see me on top of you. ""Oi, you're not light. Get off!"" I say in my accent. Though you cannot pinpoint it's exact origin, you get up immediately. Before you can even thank me or ask any questions, I grab you by the hand and yell, ""let's go!"" i drag you down the alley and without warning you feel a odd sensation of weightlessness and fall to the ground. However it isn't the hard concrete. It's a soft grass plain. The grass is brilliant orange-red, and you are disoriented and confuse. I put out my hand to you and help you up. ""Damn vortex manipulator. Cheap time traveling technology."" you hear me say as I examine a odd looking watch on my wrist.
With many questions you look to me, but once again I manage to cut you off with, ""Anywho, sorry about earlier, it was either that or the front end of the car! I'm The Doctor, I don't believe I caught your name."" As I put out my hand to introduce myself. (if you didn't catch it by now, this is a Doctor Who rp idea. I am the doctor and you are the young (maybe even more mature) women I saved from what you think is a natural disaster. However due to faulty technology we are stuck in a different time period until I can get my ship to me. Will you end up being my companion I take on multiple adventures, or will you be just a luck bystander who decides to thank me once we get you home?)

(Option #3) I am a young medical intern who is just trying to become a full fledged doctor. Even though I excelled at my medical classes, I was having a hard time keeping my cool under pressure of the real medical world and you, my head medical doctor have been tasked with teaching us, and you've taken a interest in me. You decide to help me with my pressure and stress issues of being thrown into the real world of a doctor head first. How you do so is your choice.

(Bonus option #4) We have just finished are training at the ninja 
academy and have become full fledged apprentice ninjas. We will know be broken into teams with varying abilities and skills in order to grow as ninjas and fight for our cause of peace among the kingdoms. I'm a reckless, impulsive, smartass who always has a retort and goes in without ever really having a plan. However though everyone looks down upon me for a past I don't know about, I have a strong will to learn and get stronger.

Maybe you're one of the three comrades who have been assigned to my team and have to put up with me, though we aren't very fond of each other yet. Maybe you've always fancied me but I never noticed you because you were too scared to ever say anything to me. Maybe you're my rival but have a mutual understanding of wanting to get stronger for our own personal reasons. Maybe your my teacher and leader of the group as a full fledged ninja who helps me realize my potential and aid me in growing to become one of the strongest whoever live, included embracing the darkness inside me I don't know about.

(All of these are negotiable. You can say if you want to tweak the roles or have the roles reversed. I left ages, race, body type, and character traits out because I want someone to have the freedom of creating the characters they ultimately want. This includes kinks as well. We can discuss these details before hand and come to an understanding before we start. I am looking for someone who is detailed-oriented and looking to do this for a while. I hope to hear some people! Please include some information about yourself so I don't feel like I'm talking to someone with no interests in this, and include with option you are interested in, unless you have an idea, by which please include it as well. I take it goes without saying that I would like one to be open to correct grammar and spelling for the most part! Happy writing!)

Edit: Sorry, I didn't realize I typed so much and how long it was! If still up, I'm still looking for partners!"

some basic information:

- I'll graduate next year and will likely start to apply for jobs in June / July next year. I'll graduate with a BS in Computer Science with network technology as specialization (almost anything from network management to GSM to OSI to optical networks). My GPA isn't the best but I've been told to be quite talented when it comes to programming and I'll receive letters of recommendation from my professors for IT security and Web Architectures.

- I work for a pretty big company as some kind of long-term intern. I've been assigned various tasks and completed each of them without any problems. I used Python, Java and C++ for those tasks, btw. The contract ends with my studies and I probably could continue working for them if I wanted but I'm young enough to be idealistic and to do what I'm interested in.

Information Security came to my attention about two years ago and I still love it. I learned a lot of stuff about the internals of C, C++, Objective-C, Java and C# (and the languages as well, obviously), audited some PHP code (and found vulnerabilities), found XSS vulnerabilities, reversed applications, took more than one look into the Windows internals etc., you name it. Nothing professional except my IT security lectures, though.

Google sounds interesting to me, Valve has an interesting position, several companies like Veracode look cool and so on, there's just one essential problem I'll have to face: 

All of these jobs state they require a BS and sometimes some knowledge of C/C++/PHP.
How realistic is that? What do they actually expect from me? Do they give you any training? How much do entry positions and ""regular"" positions differ? Would I have a realistic chance even though I ""only"" hold German citizenship? [This one](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#!t=jo&amp;jid=8395001&amp;) for instance seems pretty interesting.

Yes, that may sound stupid and naive, especially for someone in his 3rd and final year of university, but I've only had one internship (which I got in no time, it was a small company) and my current job thus far and I'd really like to land a job in Information Security. Maybe that's why I'm so overly self-conscious. Do I worry too much? 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

**GamerGate's original claims are that Zoe Quinn slept around for coverage favors. This was debunked literally months ago. And yet it persists.**
 
* [Kotaku shows that Nathan never wrote the articles he was accused of writing](http://kotaku.com/in-recent-days-ive-been-asked-several-times-about-a-pos-1624707346)

&gt; On March 31, Nathan published the only Kotaku article he's written involving Zoe Quinn. It was about Game Jam, a failed reality show that Zoe and other developers were upset about being on. At the time, Nathan and Zoe were professional acquaintances. He quoted blog posts written by Zoe and others involved in the show. Shortly after that, in early April, Nathan and Zoe began a romantic relationship. He has not written about her since. Nathan never reviewed Zoe Quinn's game Depression Quest, let alone gave it a favorable review.

* Rock Paper Shotgun: [This is the only article Nathan ever wrote on Rock Paper Shotgun that mentioned Depression quest.](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/08/admission-quest-valve-greenlights-50-more-games/#more-183169)

* GamerGate has not provided any other evidence to back up this assertion
Even though **Nathan Grayson is the journalist** accused of this unethical behavior (and he never actually wrote the articles he was accused of writing), and GamerGate insisting this is about ""ethics in journalism"", [They can't seem to stop talking about Zoe Quinn \(not a journalist\) and Anita Sarkeesian (also not a journalist)](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=133825445&amp;postcount=9805)
 
**Other bullshit about Zoe Quinn**
 
 

* Zoe Quinn was and still is today regularly accused of doxxing herself.
* Zoe Quinn was and still is today accused of faking death, rape, and other threats.
* Zoe Quinn doesn't actually sell the game she's accused of sleeping around to get coverage of.[ It's a free game about Depression, called Depression Quest, created to help others learn to live and deal with the disease](http://store.steampowered.com/app/270170/)
She does take donations, [and was accused of lying about giving those donations to charity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2g53ak/zoe_lied_about_donating_to_charity_charity_doesnt/) 

* [However, the charity confirmed the donations were actually received.](http://i.imgur.com/zmAyaud.png)
* When accusations of those lies first arose, GamerGate started donating to that charity in her place. After the charity confirmed receiving the donations, GamerGate started harassing the charity and threatening it with legal action because they claim they ""didn't disclose publicly"" they had received donations from her (even though that is not actuall illegal). This is a charity is made up of volunteers and a part-time paid intern, helping people deal with depression

* Zoe Quinn is frequently accused of winning an award (instead of Papers Please) for Depression Quest because she slept with someone. In actuality, her game didn't receive an award, but just an honorable mention. [Papers Please did indeed win the award.](http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/19/5528068/papers-please-16th-annual-independent-games-festival)..No evidence backs up the claim she slept with someone to get the....honorable mention.

* Zoe Quinn was accused to have ""deliberately sabotaged, DDOSed, doxxed, and shut down"" TFYC (""The Fine Young Capitalists"") because they were ""competition"" for Rebel Game Jam. The reality is that[ it's yet another bunch of bullshit accusations against her](https://storify.com/TheQuinnspiracy/tfyc-truth-finally-comes-out)

 
**Other bullshit about Anita Sarkeesian**
 
 

* [Anita Sarkeesian was similarly accused of faking threats.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2fb7px/why_would_anybody_believe_that_anita_sarkeesian/) yet it Still happens regularly. 

* Anita Sarkeesian needed to cancel an appearance [for a talk at a university because of extremely specific and violent threats](http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/14/6979071/utah-state-university-anita-sarkeesian-threats) against her and the students.

* **Reminder: Anita Sarkeesian is not a journalist.** She makes videos about video games, and that's it. Any attack on Anita Sarkeesian masquerading as ""a fight for ethics in journalism"" is automatically and instantly misplaced.
 
**Even more bullshit**


 
 
* [There is a mailing list in which games writers talk to each other.](http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/17/Exposed-the-secret-mailing-list-of-the-gaming-journalism-elite) Warning: Breitbart link. This fact was presented as inherently controversial, but not really explained why. Absolutely nothing worthy of discussion was ever found on this mailing list. Just people who happen to share the same job, joking with each other, and asking each other uncontroversial questions.

* One frequent accusation of journalist collusion is that there was a collected and coordinated effort to write ""gamers are dead"" articles to attack gamers. In actuality: The first article, written by Leigh Alexander, was targeted at   **developers (the audience of Gamasutra),** explaining how the gamer stereotype no longer has to be their focus, since games are so much broader. She wasn't attacking gamers, she was attacking the outdated stereotype.


* The subsequent articles are [all related to and reactions of the first](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=132616610&amp;postcount=7856), not independent takes at a coincidental time indicating collusion. So nobody ever fucking said ""gamer's are dead""

* Rock Paper Shotgun is often accused to have written their own ""Gamers are dead"" article. They didn't. [They quoted one in a weekly round-up.](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/09/01/the-monday-papers-4/)

* Jenn Frank was accused of failing to disclose a conflict of interest. [She actually did disclose this in her initial draft, but before publication this was ""removed by editors because \[it\] did not fulfill the criteria for a “significant connection” in line with the Guardian’s editorial guidelines.""](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/01/how-to-attack-a-woman-who-works-in-video-games)


* [Maya Kramer was accused of colluding/sleeping with the IGF chairman to secure an award for The Stanley Parable, a game she'd done PR for.](http://www.igf.com/rules.html) This award was actually the [Audience Award](http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html), and [is decided by a public vote on the website and consequently immune to this alleged impropriety.](http://www.igf.com/rules.html)

* Phil Fish, developer of the game Fez, is acused to have fixed the IGF 2012 awards. But while Fez's backers were part of the judges, they did not actually have a say in the vote [since they weren't a part of the jury that makes the decision.](http://igf.com/2012juries.html)

* The Escapist ran a horribly misguided attempt at interviewing GamerGate supporters who are developers. [Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong.](https://storify.com/alexlifschitz/escapist-drama)

1. Titles of the articles are ""game developers"" and ""female game developers"". Um. What?
2. None of the female game developers felt safe to share their actual identities
3. The questions are ridiculously loaded
4. The male game developers were sourced straight from 4chan...you'll never guess what happened next
5. One of the male developers interviewed was directly involved in coordinated attacks against Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, and others including baseless accusations like tax fraud.

Sorry, I forgot to send the rest to you man. Here it is. Reddit made me cut it up as it was to large for one message and I had to leave for a bit so here's the rest of it. PM me back if you have a question.

**So what is GamerGate, in actuality?**
 
 
* [It's a carefully coordinated attack on women in gaming, orchestrated by the underbelly of 4chan, deliberately masquerading itself as a ""concern about ethics in game journalism"" because that's the only way it would gather mainstream support](https://storify.com/davidsgallant/the-origins-of-gamergate)

* [It's an attack on ethical journalism](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/10/gamergate-is-an-attack-on-ethical-journalism/), the exact thing they have claimed to fight for:

 
1. The main target of #GamerGate is not a journalist. She’s a video game developer. Holding her accountable for “ethics in journalism” is like telling your accountant that it’s his job to negotiate peace treaties in the Middle East.

2. The second biggest target of #GamerGate is an exemplar of clean journalism. If what you don’t like about gaming journalism is that it’s too cozy with the industry and therefore the writers are afraid to be critical, then your fucking hero should be Anita Sarkeesian. She funded herself with Kickstarter and not industry money. She is harshly critical of video games, even as she is a fan. She is the ideal of what a critical gaming journalist should be: Knowledgeable, critical, fair, thorough and utterly non-corrupt.

3. The biggest victory to date of #GamerGate has been an attack on ethical journalism. One of the most important ideas when it comes to ethical journalism is that there’s a wall between advertising and editorial. #GamerGaters hate this rule of ethics, because, as opponents of ethical journalism, they wish to control what journalists say and censor any ideas or opinions that they don’t want to hear. And so they have been targeting advertisers, trying to get them to pull ads from gaming websites that publish ideas they wish to censor.

5. The most recent target of #GamerGate was selected because she engages in ethical journalism. If Brianna Wu had kept her mouth shut and just quietly developed video games, she probably would have been left alone. Instead, she dipped her toe into the art of writing ethical journalistic pieces. But, because they are opponents of ethical journalism, #GamerGaters attacked Wu like they do any other young woman that doesn’t just churn out mindless pro-sexist propaganda. In the last link I have below, you can see someone posting her address where everyone can see it and threatening to kill her and her entire family.

6. One of the main leaders of #GamerGate works for Breitbart. Milo Yiannopoulos has been up front, rallying the troops of #GamerGate and even helping them select the inevitably young, female targets for harassment. He also works for Breitbart, an organization whose hostility towards ethical journalism is legendary. No surprise there, because #GamerGate is also opposed to ethical journalism. 

In other words, #GamerGate is about “ethics in journalism” in the same way Fox News is “fair and balanced”, which is to say “not in the slightest and, in fact, they are the opposite”. Fox News called itself “fair and balanced” to cover for a not-exactly-discreet intention to be unfair, unbalanced and frequently just straight up misleading. And so #GamerGate claims to be about ethics in journalism, when in fact it is about the opposite: Bullying gaming journalists until they get in line with a corporate-friendly agenda of uncritically marketing “games pitched at the intellectual and emotional level of a 16-year-old suburban masturbator“. Anyone who actually tries to talk about anything interesting or intellectually engaging, particularly if female, will be drilled out with harassment.

&gt; Some Misc links:

**Chat logs show how 4chan users created #GamerGate controversy**

""The 4channers express their hatred and disgust towards [Quinn]; they express their glee at the thought of ruining her career; they fantasize about her being raped and killed. They wonder if all the harassment will drive her to suicide, and only the thought of 4chan getting bad publicity convinces some of them that this isn’t something they should hope for.""

Even though **Nathan Grayson is the journalist** accused of this unethical behavior (and he never actually wrote the articles he was accused of writing), and GamerGate insisting this is about ""ethics in journalism"", [They can't seem to stop talking about Zoe Quinn \(not a journalist\) and Anita Sarkeesian (also not a journalist)](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=133825445&amp;postcount=9805)
 
**Other bullshit about Zoe Quinn**
 
 

* Zoe Quinn was and still is today regularly accused of doxxing herself.
* Zoe Quinn was and still is today accused of faking death, rape, and other threats.
* Zoe Quinn doesn't actually sell the game she's accused of sleeping around to get coverage of.[ It's a free game about Depression, called Depression Quest, created to help others learn to live and deal with the disease](http://store.steampowered.com/app/270170/)
She does take donations, [and was accused of lying about giving those donations to charity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2g53ak/zoe_lied_about_donating_to_charity_charity_doesnt/) 

* [However, the charity confirmed the donations were actually received.](http://i.imgur.com/zmAyaud.png)
* When accusations of those lies first arose, GamerGate started donating to that charity in her place. After the charity confirmed receiving the donations, GamerGate started harassing the charity and threatening it with legal action because they claim they ""didn't disclose publicly"" they had received donations from her (even though that is not actuall illegal). This is a charity is made up of volunteers and a part-time paid intern, helping people deal with depression

* Zoe Quinn is frequently accused of winning an award (instead of Papers Please) for Depression Quest because she slept with someone. In actuality, her game didn't receive an award, but just an honorable mention. [Papers Please did indeed win the award.](http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/19/5528068/papers-please-16th-annual-independent-games-festival)..No evidence backs up the claim she slept with someone to get the....honorable mention.

* Zoe Quinn was accused to have ""deliberately sabotaged, DDOSed, doxxed, and shut down"" TFYC (""The Fine Young Capitalists"") because they were ""competition"" for Rebel Game Jam. The reality is that[ it's yet another bunch of bullshit accusations against her](https://storify.com/TheQuinnspiracy/tfyc-truth-finally-comes-out)

 
**Other bullshit about Anita Sarkeesian**
 
 

* [Anita Sarkeesian was similarly accused of faking threats.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2fb7px/why_would_anybody_believe_that_anita_sarkeesian/) yet it Still happens regularly. 

* Anita Sarkeesian needed to cancel an appearance [for a talk at a university because of extremely specific and violent threats](http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/14/6979071/utah-state-university-anita-sarkeesian-threats) against her and the students.

* **Reminder: Anita Sarkeesian is not a journalist.** She makes videos about video games, and that's it. Any attack on Anita Sarkeesian masquerading as ""a fight for ethics in journalism"" is automatically and instantly misplaced.
 
**Even more bullshit**


 
 
* [There is a mailing list in which games writers talk to each other.](http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/17/Exposed-the-secret-mailing-list-of-the-gaming-journalism-elite) Warning: Breitbart link. This fact was presented as inherently controversial, but not really explained why. Absolutely nothing worthy of discussion was ever found on this mailing list. Just people who happen to share the same job, joking with each other, and asking each other uncontroversial questions.

* One frequent accusation of journalist collusion is that there was a collected and coordinated effort to write ""gamers are dead"" articles to attack gamers. In actuality: The first article, written by Leigh Alexander, was targeted at   **developers (the audience of Gamasutra),** explaining how the gamer stereotype no longer has to be their focus, since games are so much broader. She wasn't attacking gamers, she was attacking the outdated stereotype.


* The subsequent articles are [all related to and reactions of the first](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=132616610&amp;postcount=7856), not independent takes at a coincidental time indicating collusion. So nobody ever fucking said ""gamer's are dead""

* Rock Paper Shotgun is often accused to have written their own ""Gamers are dead"" article. They didn't. [They quoted one in a weekly round-up.](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/09/01/the-monday-papers-4/)

* Jenn Frank was accused of failing to disclose a conflict of interest. [She actually did disclose this in her initial draft, but before publication this was ""removed by editors because \[it\] did not fulfill the criteria for a “significant connection” in line with the Guardian’s editorial guidelines.""](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/01/how-to-attack-a-woman-who-works-in-video-games)


* [Maya Kramer was accused of colluding/sleeping with the IGF chairman to secure an award for The Stanley Parable, a game she'd done PR for.](http://www.igf.com/rules.html) This award was actually the [Audience Award](http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html), and [is decided by a public vote on the website and consequently immune to this alleged impropriety.](http://www.igf.com/rules.html)

* Phil Fish, developer of the game Fez, is acused to have fixed the IGF 2012 awards. But while Fez's backers were part of the judges, they did not actually have a say in the vote [since they weren't a part of the jury that makes the decision.](http://igf.com/2012juries.html)

* The Escapist ran a horribly misguided attempt at interviewing GamerGate supporters who are developers. [Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong.](https://storify.com/alexlifschitz/escapist-drama)

1. Titles of the articles are ""game developers"" and ""female game developers"". Um. What?
2. None of the female game developers felt safe to share their actual identities
3. The questions are ridiculously loaded
4. The male game developers were sourced straight from 4chan...you'll never guess what happened next
5. One of the male developers interviewed was directly involved in coordinated attacks against Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, and others including baseless accusations like tax fraud.


**So what is GamerGate, in actuality?**
 
 
* [It's a carefully coordinated attack on women in gaming, orchestrated by the underbelly of 4chan, deliberately masquerading itself as a ""concern about ethics in game journalism"" because that's the only way it would gather mainstream support](https://storify.com/davidsgallant/the-origins-of-GamerGate)

* [It's an attack on ethical journalism](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/10/GamerGate-is-an-attack-on-ethical-journalism/), the exact thing they have claimed to fight for:

 
1. The main target of #GamerGate is not a journalist. She’s a video game developer. Holding her accountable for “ethics in journalism” is like telling your accountant that it’s his job to negotiate peace treaties in the Middle East.

2. The second biggest target of #GamerGate is an exemplar of clean journalism. If what you don’t like about gaming journalism is that it’s too cozy with the industry and therefore the writers are afraid to be critical, then your fucking hero should be Anita Sarkeesian. She funded herself with Kickstarter and not industry money. She is harshly critical of video games, even as she is a fan. She is the ideal of what a critical gaming journalist should be: Knowledgeable, critical, fair, thorough and utterly non-corrupt.

3. The biggest victory to date of #GamerGate has been an attack on ethical journalism. One of the most important ideas when it comes to ethical journalism is that there’s a wall between advertising and editorial. #Alligators hate this rule of ethics, because, as opponents of ethical journalism, they wish to control what journalists say and censor any ideas or opinions that they don’t want to hear. And so they have been targeting advertisers, trying to get them to pull ads from gaming websites that publish ideas they wish to censor.

5. The most recent target of #GamerGate was selected because she engages in ethical journalism. If Brianna Wu had kept her mouth shut and just quietly developed video games, she probably would have been left alone. Instead, she dipped her toe into the art of writing ethical journalistic pieces. But, because they are opponents of ethical journalism, #Alligators attacked Wu like they do any other young woman that doesn’t just churn out mindless pro-sexist propaganda. In the last link I have below, you can see someone posting her address where everyone can see it and threatening to kill her and her entire family.

6. One of the main leaders of #GamerGate works for Breitbart. Milo Yiannopoulos has been up front, rallying the troops of #GamerGate and even helping them select the inevitably young, female targets for harassment. He also works for Breitbart, an organization whose hostility towards ethical journalism is legendary. No surprise there, because #GamerGate is also opposed to ethical journalism. 

In other words, #GamerGate is about “ethics in journalism” in the same way Fox News is “fair and balanced”, which is to say “not in the slightest and, in fact, they are the opposite”. Fox News called itself “fair and balanced” to cover for a not-exactly-discreet intention to be unfair, unbalanced and frequently just straight up misleading. And so #GamerGate claims to be about ethics in journalism, when in fact it is about the opposite: Bullying gaming journalists until they get in line with a corporate-friendly agenda of uncritically marketing “games pitched at the intellectual and emotional level of a 16-year-old suburban masturbator“. Anyone who actually tries to talk about anything interesting or intellectually engaging, particularly if female, will be drilled out with harassment.

2k5i7x,0,2014-10-23,I'm writing a book for younger guys to chuck their excuses and make things happen in their lives. Is this chapter I just finished (1) easy to understand and (2) inspire you to get off your ass?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2k5i7x/im_writing_a_book_for_younger_guys_to_chuck_their/,"You don’t have to be in charge to be a leader. But you do have to make decisions like one.

“I quit. I just. I quit,” moaned one of my co-workers. “If the boss ain’t gonna pay us, I ain’t gonna work.” He whipped out a Camel and had a few puffs, a no-no while on the clock.

The project manager brushed past me while scribbling something on his clipboard. “Look, I feel bad for you. And I don’t blame you either. A hard day’s work deserves a wage.”

“A hard day?” spat a technician behind his welding helmet. “More like a hard five weeks. My old lady is giving me hell ‘cause I can’t buy all the drugs and prescriptions we need. Afford all that out of pocket, no way. Do you even know what five weeks without health insurance does to your budget?”

“Make that back-pay with interest.” The first employee whined. He ripped off his gloves and plopped down with a magazine. “Not lifting a finger. Just following our coward boss’ lead.”

The project manager scratched the crown of his faded baseball cap and shrugged. “He’s definitely not gonna shoot it to us straight. I’ve been up to his office I can’t tell you how many times. Always get the runaround. He’s hopeless.”

I slipped in my earbuds. Better to listen to a random podcast than the workroom bitching for the umpteenth time this year. This two million dollar construction project for a museum was one of the biggest I’d tackled in my five years here, so I wasn’t about to become Mister Unproductive.

Paid upon completion…Paid upon completion… I told myself as I screwed this or that steel thing into some random square widget. Don’t even remember what I was doing. But I do remember what I heard.

“Break time’s almost here,” I heard a muffled voice. Not even an episode of London Real could inoculate my ears from complaining that’s gone viral. My locked car would be the break room of my choosing today.

“I should just quit. Maybe complain to the state about it.” The technician threw a blowtorch onto the workbench beside me.

“You’re not gonna quit,” I jumped into the conversation, “because you want that paycheck. If it’s really so bad here, then go get another job.”

“We’re all way too old to get a job somewhere else,” replied the technician.

“You’re full of great ideas, aren’t you?” said another co-worker. “I say we just walk right out the door and carpool our way down to job services. Filing for unemployment is the new job security.”

“Can’t do that.” The project manager snapped. “We’re staying. Try to get some work down. Maybe he’ll come around and decide to tell us what’s up.”

On my way to fetch protective gauntlets from the desk on the opposite side of the work room, I made sure to keep my eyes down. Bobbed my head, too. I figured that would be a clear enough sign that my ears were occupied with top forty hits. By the time I’d gotten what I needed and made the ten second walk back to my station, every employee and manager had camped out on the makeshift benches right next to where I needed to work. Smokes all around. I think I even saw somebody whip out a silver flask.

“We’ll figure out what to do on break.” The project manager stuffed his protective goggles into his overalls. “Nah, make it after break. Then we can move.”

“Hey, Nathan,” the technician called to me, “turn that shit off and join the club.” This forced a chuckle from my co-workers.

“Yeah, it’s not like you’re on the clock,” another added. “We’re just rocking this bitch out like superstars, ain’t we?” Not sure what he meant by that, but the comment earned several supportive grunts.

I hit pause. Don’t know why though. “Feels like a complete waste of time, huh?” I pounded away on some random object. “We deserve better than this crap. Just give us some answers. But nope, he’s too good for that. Up there on that high horse of his.”

A string of “uh-huh’s,” “damn right’s,” and approving nods followed. I didn’t normally join in on these free-for-all’s, but I felt like I was getting the hang of this. Just one of the boys.

“Here we sit on our asses for what? Nothin’, just nothin’. The least he could do is be blunt about it. He’s cooked his own books and he’s paying the price.” I waved my hammer at my newfound audience. “And to think, none of you can do anything about it.”

The shop supervisor spoke up, “You’re right. This sucks. You put in fifteen years, and it’s like you’re the new intern who couldn’t pour piss out of a boot even if instructions to do so were written upside-down on the heel.”

“Seriously, we do kinda suck.” The technician shrugged. “You know, I’ve been here for nineteen years. Hell, I was the fifth employee here. Can’t just walk out of here with that kind of record, but I don’t see no point in sticking around.”

“Can’t we just talk to the guy?” I said.

“Wouldn’t do any good.” The project manager kept his gaze to the grimy floor.

“Just e-mail him, he’s all the way down the hall,” I glanced at my co-workers encircling the project manager. “We’re better off just—” I stopped.

There must have been something special about that dusty, metal-shaving covered, oil slick-spotted floor because every guy’s eyes were stuck on it. Just, stuck. I probably could’ve set a hundred dollar bill on fire and they wouldn’t have noticed.

“You’re wrong, Nate.” The shop supervisor sighed. “We do deserve this. We’re just peons.”

I felt my grip on my hammer loosen.

“Here it is, kid.” The project manager finally looked up at me. “Your future. Just a bunch of old geezers sitting around like a support group of divorced women who only know how to bitch. We can’t control a damn thing.”

Your future. I had a joke ready—one of those “how many welders does it take to plug in a lightbulb” ones—but it sludged right back down. Kinda like the would-be vomit I felt fapping the bottom of my throat.

Those two words. Those two shitty words.

Your future. In fifteen years, I’d be thirty-eight. In nineteen, I’d be forty-two. Damn. That’s a long-ass time. And I’d be spending every minute of it huddled between my project manager and supervisor, grumbling about whatever trouble the man in charge is stirring up. That sucks.

“Hey Nate, you might as well get back to work. Nothing’s gonna change.” The technician snickered. “How does it feel to be this company’s newest little bitch?”

I felt the strangest pulse rush through my hands. The hammer dropped.

He was right. I was one of them now. The longer any one of us waited to do something, the easier it was to do, well, nothing. You know what? That feeling is surprisingly comfortable—for a time.

I stared down the technician. “Okay. You’re right. But not anymore.” I slipped off my gloves, wiped my hands on my Carhart’s, and heaved a sigh. “As of about five seconds ago, you’re dead wrong.”

“Huh. What’s gotten into you?” The technician rolled his eyes.

“Look at us. Seriously.” My hands were flailing. “I can’t live with myself, knowing that the highest calling I’ve lived up to becoming one of you guys.”

“Do you even know who you’re talking to, punk?” The technician’s crooked spine straightened up.

“Do you even know what you want?” I shrugged. “That goes for everyone. Do we even know what we want from the boss? Have him get fully engaged with what we’re doing here, or keep himself and his meddling out of the picture entirely? Seriously, guys, what do we want?”

The project manager shook his head. “That’s a good question. But I don’t see how anything will change—”

“Nothing will change,” I cut him off, “if you don’t believe something will change.” I shut up before going all motivational speaker on them.

“That’s good, that’s good.” The shop supervisor sat up. “Well, who wants a Marlboro? Anybody got a light?”

Really? I was not about to let a hankering for a hit my future. Funny how you can tolerate indecisiveness for what seems like forever. Until you snap. Most people probably never do though. I guess I’m just not one of those people.

The project manager raised an eyebrow at me, as if it to say, “Got any matches?”

Now that my adrenaline-laced thoughts were out there for everybody, I’d look like a complete idiot if I didn’t follow through. So I did. Accountability is the Achilles’ Heel of inaction.

“Nope. I’ve got something to say to somebody.” I tossed my goggles onto the workbench and made a beeline for that accursed corner office.

The door was opened, so I walked right in and marched up to his cluttered, half-built desk. A worn Bible lay open on top of well-used napkins from Kentucky Fried Chicken.

“Hey Nathan.” His head laid low. “Listen. I know the situation. We’ve talked about it before in the shop.”

“They want answers now.”

“I know, I know.” The boss shook his head.

“The guys are pissed off, frustrated, and unproductive.”

He cleared his throat and tapped his keyboard a couple times. “Are they?”

“Yep.” I nodded. “A word from you might do us all some good.”

“A word about what?” He finally looked me in the eye. “We get paid upon completion, including me. If that’s what this is all about…”

“Yes,” I said. “And no.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, here’s what I mean.” Flying from the seat of my pants in three…two…one… “They just want you to be honest with them. They want an answer. From you. Personally.”

“Nope, can’t do that.” He sunk back in his chair. “We’re weeks behind schedule. I don’t know how that happened, but here we are. What do they want me to do? Pay them out of my own pocket?”

That’d be nice. Didn’t say that. Instead I repeated my concern, “All they want is to hear it from you straight. What’s the status of the job? They’re all good workers. You know you don’t hire slobs. We know we’re going to get paid what we’ve earned. You’re good for the money. The money is not the issue, they just want the truth. They don’t mind working for free for now, so long as they know what’s happening.”

Moved by this bit of ego-stroking, he uncrossed his arms. “Sounds fair and square to me. But tell me. What makes you think they’d even want me to come down there?”

Oh, geez. I guess I’d have to spell it out for this guy. “You know I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks and shit about high performance on the job, right?”

The boss shrugged. “Yeah, never got a complaint about it. Seems like they keep you focused.”

“Okay.” I took in a long breath. “A couple weeks ago, I heard this story about a clothing company from about a hundred years ago. They were going out of business. All the workers in the factory were on edge because their jobs were virtually wiped out.” I cleared my throat. “But you know what the owner did? He marched himself right down to the factory floor where his employees were about to riot. You know what he did? The owner threw up his hands in front of everybody and told them the news, ‘Hey, we’re in the hole, and the company’s going down fast. We have no money left for payroll.’ The next morning, the owner showed up to his office and found sixteen grand in cash piled up on his desk. The employees had all dipped into their life savings to save his ass. And their jobs. All they needed was for the leader to be a leader. And that meant being honest as hell.”

He stared at his computer monitor for a few seconds. His forehead wrinkled up like old sandpaper. “Guess I have something to say then. Go back out there. I need to prepare first.”

I returned to my work station and tried to act semi-productive compared to the bitching circle.

About ten minutes later, the project manager did a double-take and sprang from his seat. “What brings you down here, sir?”

“Hey,” the boss announced in a tender voice. “I know you guys want an update on the payment. Well, I’m waiting for that update,e too. But that doesn’t make it right for you to not have any answer at all about whether you’re getting a paycheck on Friday. At the end of the day, you have all earned your paychecks, and it doesn’t make it right.” His head dropped. So did the tears. “I love you guys. We’ve got to make it past this point. And I believe in every one of you.”

I think I heard a dead baby cricket chirp.

The most irate employee was the first to offer a handshake and a compliment. “We’ll get through this, don’t worry about it. Thank you for being honest.”

After a slew of hugs and handshakes, productivity and bitching had an inverse relationship. This time, it was in the company’s best interest.

The boss gave me a nod and a real handshake on his skip back to the office.

“Nathan!” the project manager shook his head, hiding back a chuckle, “what the hell did you do?”

I slipped my leather gloves back on, giving myself a couple seconds to think. “I made a decision. I made a damn decision. For the record, I’d say it was worth about sixteen thousand dollars.” Now I grinned. “I’ll take it in cash.”

Most people are comfortable in their own misery. Do they have potential? Absolutely. Is there more out there than the daily grind, followed by happy hour? Probably. Have they become numb to their dreams? Definitely.

I don’t think any kid wakes up and says, “When I grow up, I want to go to the same place every day. I want a paycheck that barely pays my bills. I want a sucky boss who has me bitching all day long. I want my routine to make the snail Olympics look exciting.” But one day that kid wakes up, and he’s a grown-ass man sitting in a circle of old codgers who have nothing better to do than whine, complain, and bemoan circumstances they can’t control—and probably don’t even want to control.

Let’s bring it close to home now, to you and your life. Our habits betray us. How easy is it to put off doing stuff we know we should do? Even if it’s taking a pee break while racking up an epic kill streak in Call of Duty. We just tell ourselves we’ll wait just a liiiiiittle bit longer. Then when the bladder is about to burst, we go. Unfortunately, life is not like a bladder, so rarely are there warning signs that say, “Hey idiot, go take care of your shit. Like, right now.”

Unless—

Unless something inside you snaps. Unless you are pissed off enough to just effin’ do it. If you’re just going to complain and whine and drag others into your misery, you might as well be dead. Your existence would be ironically neutral, but at least it wouldn’t be negative. A tad macabre? Yep, but that’s what we’ve come to in a culture that looks up at the number seven on the menu, says, “I’ll take the large fry and drink with that,” then thinks, “I’ll just work it off at the gym later. If I have time.”

Back to the postgame wrap-up, if you will. The bitching all around me on the workroom floor was just annoying, like a nagging, “You really should do that. You know what you need to do. This is something you ought to take care of sooner or later.” But what did I do? I numbed the noise with my headphones. How often do we distract ourselves with this or that shiny thing when we know what we should be doing? Then when that gets old, we join in the complaining! Maybe you’re that littler guy who always wanted to bulk up, but now you make yourself the butt of your friends’ jokes, “Yeah, I’ll always be that skinny kid from the ‘burbs. Just call me mister twiggy!” Exactly what I did.

But I got pissed. Supper pissed. The grand circle of complainers became my mirror, and I saw who I was becoming. Heck, I heard it, too. “We deserve this…How does it feel to be this company’s newest little bitch?” That was me? The “newest little bitch”? Really? Huh. Maybe it was true up to that moment, but nothing changed until I did. That first step was about me, a statement of who I had chosen to be. The goal wasn’t to make a scene and awesomely ride into the sunset like a heroic marauder (though that does sound pretty cool).

The point is, if you just wish you could take the leap, whatever it is—ask out the hottie from the coffee shop, finally enroll in the master’s program, start that micro-business on the side, lose thirty pounds—then you can only get there when you take that first step off the cliff. Go with your gut, that voice deep inside that says, “Quit being a douche, you already know what to do. There’s nothing left to learn, figure out, or think about.” The mind is where every battle is lost, so don’t be mister rational, or you’ll create an excuse for yourself every single time.

Hit pause for a sec—I just used the word “leap” there for a reason. When facing a big-ass decision or lifestyle change or whatever, it feels like you’re facing cold and snowy Mt. Everest, plus you’re naked and have zero gear. When I dropped that hammer and marched my assets into the boss’ office, I figured something out. Making a decision and following through with it is not like climbing a mountain. It’s like jumping off it. See, we work ourselves up into these fits of fear and anxiety. When we peek off the edge of that cliff, our minds go crazy with all the ways it might not work out. But once you jump, once you take that first step, gravity does all the work. Gravity, in my case, was accountability. Yeah, I’d decided to say something to the boss. But I didn’t talk about doing it. I put myself right in the bullseye—smack dab in front of the boss man’s desk. At that point, there literally was no going back. And that’s when the magic happened. So it is when you take that first step off the scary cliff. Only once you’re falling do you realize you’ve been wearing a parachute the whole time.

Are you thinking, “Yeah, great, Nathan, but what you’re saying is just theory. Doesn’t really apply to my situation, blah…blah…blah,”?

Let me give you the simplest framework then. Here’s a quick test that will point you to the right decision every single time. If you find yourself trying to talk yourself out of making decision XYZ, then most likely, you need to go with your gut—with decision XYZ. But if you find yourself trying to talk yourself into making decision ABC, you need to weigh the options first of going with decision ABC or not. What is going to most likely turn out best for you and the people who are depending on you? Oh, and write down the freaking potential outcomes (1) if you do it and (2) if you don’t do it. Write down what you want to get out of the career choice/relationship/whatever, then the potential outcomes if it works out and if it doesn’t.

Here’s another layer to this strategy. Witnessing the extreme consequences of compounded negative choices works for you. Not sure if you want to go back to school? Talk to somebody who did, and see what they have to say. Then go down to the county jobs center (I’m serious) and chill out in the lobby for about fifteen minutes. Whether you’re thinking about moving up in the formal education career or are a “wantrepreneur,” there is no better way to end the waiting game than in that fifteen minute span at the jobs center. When you look further down the track at what might be/might not be because of a decision you’re waffling on, it’s like watching your future self’s back.

And whatever you do, don’t base your decisions on what other people think. Take a college student looking to pick a career. He may think he is making his own decision. But what’s happening is that his decision is heavily influenced by his peer group. The key to good decision-making is passion. What are you chasing right now? Are you an aspiring engineer but hate math? In the context of career choices, are you making decisions based on what seems right or what you know in your heart? Ultimately, nothing really matters in the context of history. Will it matter in a million years? Does your decision alter the course of history? You know you’re going to die, so why would you spend your life unhappy? You’ve got to determine who you are making decisions for. Parents? Friends? Society? A girl? The point is not that pleasing others is bad, the point is that you need to question your own motives and your need.

The only way to guarantee failure is to do nothing. This is what we’re driving towards—making “just effin’ do it” stupid easy. Here’s how we’ll do this…

ACTION STEPS (aka, Quit Reading and Get Off You Ass)

    Write out your struggle stream of consciousness. Maybe it’s something like, “I’m sick of my current job in construction. My skills are worth more than what they’re currently paying me, so I’m thinking of going back to school. Maybe physical therapy? Don’t really know where to start or what schools to look at or even what degree I’d need.”

    Go to Google and type in your summarized struggle, such as “should I go back to school” or “physical therapy schools in [your city].”

    Write down the names of three websites you find in your search that look pretty interesting to you, interesting meaning that they can hold your attention for at least ten seconds.

    Now write three things you will do by midnight tomorrow to take action. Our example reader’s steps might look like, “Get phone number of admissions department at local college to learn about classes and price for physical therapy program, watch a 20-minute video about the career options for physical therapists, register for online career assessment from local university.”

    Congratulations. You have officially taken that first step off the edge of the cliff. It may not feel like it, but I’ll tell you one more thing—no stopping now.

2k5kna,0,2014-10-23,So I got myself in to a little bit of a situation...,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2k5kna/so_i_got_myself_in_to_a_little_bit_of_a_situation/,"I got an interview with one of my dream companies. They sent me back a letter saying they were interested in a second interview and wanted me to apply to specific jobs postings that would be upcoming.  

I went in, looked at all the jobs, and the only one I qualified actually happened to be one of my dream jobs.  I applied, and got a second interview.  During the second interview, they were really impressed and at one point I told them where my ultimate goal was-a slightly different group in their own building.

The interview got a little weird at this point and they asked me if I was interviewing with the company anywhere else.  I told them no.  This struck me as a little odd, so I went and checked the postings.

There was a position with my #1 pick for which group to work with.  Apparently the requisition had been posted a few days after I initially been scheduled for an interview.  I wrote up a cover sheet, applied, and got scheduled for an interview within 5 hours of applying.  

Here is my predicament. The three gentlemen I interviewed know my first pick.  They had to know it was posted.  I want to write them thank you letters, but I should let them know I applied to the other position.

No matter what, I need to tell them I did apply to the other job. Better they hear it from me than, find out half way through the hiring process(that's if they give me an internship).  I don't want to lose the chance at either job, and they were really nice people. 

I've written them personal thank you notes, but not sure how to tell them them they are my second pick.  Here is what I have so far.  Do you think this is wise?

&gt; First and foremost, I want to work for your *company* and *your location* is my first choice.  I did recently apply for one other position at *your location* and will be interviewing next week for that position.  I do feel very strongly about *company* and hold *the original position* in high regard. If I do get the opportunity, I would be going with them as a first choice.   I understand this could be a deal breaker on an internship.  I thank you for the opportunity. I appreciate your consideration and once again, thank you for the opportunity.

That's how I plan to end the thank you letters.  Am I crazy or insane? Does this seem like a good idea? Any idea how to better word this part of the thank you for the interview letters?"

But you do have to make decisions like one.,JoshuaWriter,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/2k5o96/advice_you_dont_have_to_be_in_charge_to_be_a/,"“I quit. I just. I quit,” moaned one of my co-workers. “If the boss ain’t gonna pay us, I ain’t gonna work.” He whipped out a Camel and had a few puffs, a no-no while on the clock.

The project manager brushed past me while scribbling something on his clipboard. “Look, I feel bad for you. And I don’t blame you either. A hard day’s work deserves a wage.”

“A hard day?” spat a technician behind his welding helmet. “More like a hard five weeks. My old lady is giving me hell ‘cause I can’t buy all the drugs and prescriptions we need. Afford all that out of pocket, no way. Do you even know what five weeks without health insurance does to your budget?”

“Make that back-pay with interest.” The first employee whined. He ripped off his gloves and plopped down with a magazine. “Not lifting a finger. Just following our coward boss’ lead.”

The project manager scratched the crown of his faded baseball cap and shrugged. “He’s definitely not gonna shoot it to us straight. I’ve been up to his office I can’t tell you how many times. Always get the runaround. He’s hopeless.”

I slipped in my earbuds. Better to listen to a random podcast than the workroom bitching for the umpteenth time this year. This two million dollar construction project for a museum was one of the biggest I’d tackled in my five years here, so I wasn’t about to become Mister Unproductive.

Paid upon completion…Paid upon completion… I told myself as I screwed this or that steel thing into some random square widget. Don’t even remember what I was doing. But I do remember what I heard.

“Break time’s almost here,” I heard a muffled voice. Not even an episode of London Real could inoculate my ears from complaining that’s gone viral. My locked car would be the break room of my choosing today.

“I should just quit. Maybe complain to the state about it.” The technician threw a blowtorch onto the workbench beside me.

“You’re not gonna quit,” I jumped into the conversation, “because you want that paycheck. If it’s really so bad here, then go get another job.”

“We’re all way too old to get a job somewhere else,” replied the technician.

“You’re full of great ideas, aren’t you?” said another co-worker. “I say we just walk right out the door and carpool our way down to job services. Filing for unemployment is the new job security.”

“Can’t do that.” The project manager snapped. “We’re staying. Try to get some work down. Maybe he’ll come around and decide to tell us what’s up.”

On my way to fetch protective gauntlets from the desk on the opposite side of the work room, I made sure to keep my eyes down. Bobbed my head, too. I figured that would be a clear enough sign that my ears were occupied with top forty hits. By the time I’d gotten what I needed and made the ten second walk back to my station, every employee and manager had camped out on the makeshift benches right next to where I needed to work. Smokes all around. I think I even saw somebody whip out a silver flask.

“We’ll figure out what to do on break.” The project manager stuffed his protective goggles into his overalls. “Nah, make it after break. Then we can move.”

“Hey, Nathan,” the technician called to me, “turn that shit off and join the club.” This forced a chuckle from my co-workers.

“Yeah, it’s not like you’re on the clock,” another added. “We’re just rocking this bitch out like superstars, ain’t we?” Not sure what he meant by that, but the comment earned several supportive grunts.

I hit pause. Don’t know why though. “Feels like a complete waste of time, huh?” I pounded away on some random object. “We deserve better than this crap. Just give us some answers. But nope, he’s too good for that. Up there on that high horse of his.”

A string of “uh-huh’s,” “damn right’s,” and approving nods followed. I didn’t normally join in on these free-for-all’s, but I felt like I was getting the hang of this. Just one of the boys.

“Here we sit on our asses for what? Nothin’, just nothin’. The least he could do is be blunt about it. He’s cooked his own books and he’s paying the price.” I waved my hammer at my newfound audience. “And to think, none of you can do anything about it.”

The shop supervisor spoke up, “You’re right. This sucks. You put in fifteen years, and it’s like you’re the new intern who couldn’t pour piss out of a boot even if instructions to do so were written upside-down on the heel.”

“Seriously, we do kinda suck.” The technician shrugged. “You know, I’ve been here for nineteen years. Hell, I was the fifth employee here. Can’t just walk out of here with that kind of record, but I don’t see no point in sticking around.”

“Can’t we just talk to the guy?” I said.

“Wouldn’t do any good.” The project manager kept his gaze to the grimy floor.

“Just e-mail him, he’s all the way down the hall,” I glanced at my co-workers encircling the project manager. “We’re better off just—” I stopped.

There must have been something special about that dusty, metal-shaving covered, oil slick-spotted floor because every guy’s eyes were stuck on it. Just, stuck. I probably could’ve set a hundred dollar bill on fire and they wouldn’t have noticed.

“You’re wrong, Nate.” The shop supervisor sighed. “We do deserve this. We’re just peons.”

I felt my grip on my hammer loosen.

“Here it is, kid.” The project manager finally looked up at me. “Your future. Just a bunch of old geezers sitting around like a support group of divorced women who only know how to bitch. We can’t control a damn thing.”

Your future. I had a joke ready—one of those “how many welders does it take to plug in a lightbulb” ones—but it sludged right back down. Kinda like the would-be vomit I felt fapping the bottom of my throat.

Those two words. Those two shitty words.

Your future. In fifteen years, I’d be thirty-eight. In nineteen, I’d be forty-two. Damn. That’s a long-ass time. And I’d be spending every minute of it huddled between my project manager and supervisor, grumbling about whatever trouble the man in charge is stirring up. That sucks.

“Hey Nate, you might as well get back to work. Nothing’s gonna change.” The technician snickered. “How does it feel to be this company’s newest little bitch?”

I felt the strangest pulse rush through my hands. The hammer dropped.

He was right. I was one of them now. The longer any one of us waited to do something, the easier it was to do, well, nothing. You know what? That feeling is surprisingly comfortable—for a time.

I stared down the technician. “Okay. You’re right. But not anymore.” I slipped off my gloves, wiped my hands on my Carhart’s, and heaved a sigh. “As of about five seconds ago, you’re dead wrong.”

“Huh. What’s gotten into you?” The technician rolled his eyes.

“Look at us. Seriously.” My hands were flailing. “I can’t live with myself, knowing that the highest calling I’ve lived up to becoming one of you guys.”

“Do you even know who you’re talking to, punk?” The technician’s crooked spine straightened up.

“Do you even know what you want?” I shrugged. “That goes for everyone. Do we even know what we want from the boss? Have him get fully engaged with what we’re doing here, or keep himself and his meddling out of the picture entirely? Seriously, guys, what do we want?”

The project manager shook his head. “That’s a good question. But I don’t see how anything will change—”

“Nothing will change,” I cut him off, “if you don’t believe something will change.” I shut up before going all motivational speaker on them.

“That’s good, that’s good.” The shop supervisor sat up. “Well, who wants a Marlboro? Anybody got a light?”

Really? I was not about to let a hankering for a hit my future. Funny how you can tolerate indecisiveness for what seems like forever. Until you snap. Most people probably never do though. I guess I’m just not one of those people.

The project manager raised an eyebrow at me, as if it to say, “Got any matches?”

Now that my adrenaline-laced thoughts were out there for everybody, I’d look like a complete idiot if I didn’t follow through. So I did. Accountability is the Achilles’ Heel of inaction.

“Nope. I’ve got something to say to somebody.” I tossed my goggles onto the workbench and made a beeline for that accursed corner office.

The door was opened, so I walked right in and marched up to his cluttered, half-built desk. A worn Bible lay open on top of well-used napkins from Kentucky Fried Chicken.

“Hey Nathan.” His head laid low. “Listen. I know the situation. We’ve talked about it before in the shop.”

“They want answers now.”

“I know, I know.” The boss shook his head.

“The guys are pissed off, frustrated, and unproductive.”

He cleared his throat and tapped his keyboard a couple times. “Are they?”

“Yep.” I nodded. “A word from you might do us all some good.”

“A word about what?” He finally looked me in the eye. “We get paid upon completion, including me. If that’s what this is all about…”

“Yes,” I said. “And no.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, here’s what I mean.” Flying from the seat of my pants in three…two…one… “They just want you to be honest with them. They want an answer. From you. Personally.”

“Nope, can’t do that.” He sunk back in his chair. “We’re weeks behind schedule. I don’t know how that happened, but here we are. What do they want me to do? Pay them out of my own pocket?”

That’d be nice. Didn’t say that. Instead I repeated my concern, “All they want is to hear it from you straight. What’s the status of the job? They’re all good workers. You know you don’t hire slobs. We know we’re going to get paid what we’ve earned. You’re good for the money. The money is not the issue, they just want the truth. They don’t mind working for free for now, so long as they know what’s happening.”

Moved by this bit of ego-stroking, he uncrossed his arms. “Sounds fair and square to me. But tell me. What makes you think they’d even want me to come down there?”

Oh, geez. I guess I’d have to spell it out for this guy. “You know I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks and shit about high performance on the job, right?”

The boss shrugged. “Yeah, never got a complaint about it. Seems like they keep you focused.”

“Okay.” I took in a long breath. “A couple weeks ago, I heard this story about a clothing company from about a hundred years ago. They were going out of business. All the workers in the factory were on edge because their jobs were virtually wiped out.” I cleared my throat. “But you know what the owner did? He marched himself right down to the factory floor where his employees were about to riot. You know what he did? The owner threw up his hands in front of everybody and told them the news, ‘Hey, we’re in the hole, and the company’s going down fast. We have no money left for payroll.’ The next morning, the owner showed up to his office and found sixteen grand in cash piled up on his desk. The employees had all dipped into their life savings to save his ass. And their jobs. All they needed was for the leader to be a leader. And that meant being honest as hell.”

He stared at his computer monitor for a few seconds. His forehead wrinkled up like old sandpaper. “Guess I have something to say then. Go back out there. I need to prepare first.”

I returned to my work station and tried to act semi-productive compared to the bitching circle.

About ten minutes later, the project manager did a double-take and sprang from his seat. “What brings you down here, sir?”

“Hey,” the boss announced in a tender voice. “I know you guys want an update on the payment. Well, I’m waiting for that update,e too. But that doesn’t make it right for you to not have any answer at all about whether you’re getting a paycheck on Friday. At the end of the day, you have all earned your paychecks, and it doesn’t make it right.” His head dropped. So did the tears. “I love you guys. We’ve got to make it past this point. And I believe in every one of you.”

I think I heard a dead baby cricket chirp.

The most irate employee was the first to offer a handshake and a compliment. “We’ll get through this, don’t worry about it. Thank you for being honest.”

After a slew of hugs and handshakes, productivity and bitching had an inverse relationship. This time, it was in the company’s best interest.

The boss gave me a nod and a real handshake on his skip back to the office.

“Nathan!” the project manager shook his head, hiding back a chuckle, “what the hell did you do?”

I slipped my leather gloves back on, giving myself a couple seconds to think. “I made a decision. I made a damn decision. For the record, I’d say it was worth about sixteen thousand dollars.” Now I grinned. “I’ll take it in cash.”

Most people are comfortable in their own misery. Do they have potential? Absolutely. Is there more out there than the daily grind, followed by happy hour? Probably. Have they become numb to their dreams? Definitely.

I don’t think any kid wakes up and says, “When I grow up, I want to go to the same place every day. I want a paycheck that barely pays my bills. I want a sucky boss who has me bitching all day long. I want my routine to make the snail Olympics look exciting.” But one day that kid wakes up, and he’s a grown-ass man sitting in a circle of old codgers who have nothing better to do than whine, complain, and bemoan circumstances they can’t control—and probably don’t even want to control.

Let’s bring it close to home now, to you and your life. Our habits betray us. How easy is it to put off doing stuff we know we should do? Even if it’s taking a pee break while racking up an epic kill streak in Call of Duty. We just tell ourselves we’ll wait just a liiiiiittle bit longer. Then when the bladder is about to burst, we go. Unfortunately, life is not like a bladder, so rarely are there warning signs that say, “Hey idiot, go take care of your shit. Like, right now.”

Unless—

Unless something inside you snaps. Unless you are pissed off enough to just effin’ do it. If you’re just going to complain and whine and drag others into your misery, you might as well be dead. Your existence would be ironically neutral, but at least it wouldn’t be negative. A tad macabre? Yep, but that’s what we’ve come to in a culture that looks up at the number seven on the menu, says, “I’ll take the large fry and drink with that,” then thinks, “I’ll just work it off at the gym later. If I have time.”

Back to the postgame wrap-up, if you will. The bitching all around me on the workroom floor was just annoying, like a nagging, “You really should do that. You know what you need to do. This is something you ought to take care of sooner or later.” But what did I do? I numbed the noise with my headphones. How often do we distract ourselves with this or that shiny thing when we know what we should be doing? Then when that gets old, we join in the complaining! Maybe you’re that littler guy who always wanted to bulk up, but now you make yourself the butt of your friends’ jokes, “Yeah, I’ll always be that skinny kid from the ‘burbs. Just call me mister twiggy!” Exactly what I did.

But I got pissed. Supper pissed. The grand circle of complainers became my mirror, and I saw who I was becoming. Heck, I heard it, too. “We deserve this…How does it feel to be this company’s newest little bitch?” That was me? The “newest little bitch”? Really? Huh. Maybe it was true up to that moment, but nothing changed until I did. That first step was about me, a statement of who I had chosen to be. The goal wasn’t to make a scene and awesomely ride into the sunset like a heroic marauder (though that does sound pretty cool).

The point is, if you just wish you could take the leap, whatever it is—ask out the hottie from the coffee shop, finally enroll in the master’s program, start that micro-business on the side, lose thirty pounds—then you can only get there when you take that first step off the cliff. Go with your gut, that voice deep inside that says, “Quit being a douche, you already know what to do. There’s nothing left to learn, figure out, or think about.” The mind is where every battle is lost, so don’t be mister rational, or you’ll create an excuse for yourself every single time.

Hit pause for a sec—I just used the word “leap” there for a reason. When facing a big-ass decision or lifestyle change or whatever, it feels like you’re facing cold and snowy Mt. Everest, plus you’re naked and have zero gear. When I dropped that hammer and marched my assets into the boss’ office, I figured something out. Making a decision and following through with it is not like climbing a mountain. It’s like jumping off it. See, we work ourselves up into these fits of fear and anxiety. When we peek off the edge of that cliff, our minds go crazy with all the ways it might not work out. But once you jump, once you take that first step, gravity does all the work. Gravity, in my case, was accountability. Yeah, I’d decided to say something to the boss. But I didn’t talk about doing it. I put myself right in the bullseye—smack dab in front of the boss man’s desk. At that point, there literally was no going back. And that’s when the magic happened. So it is when you take that first step off the scary cliff. Only once you’re falling do you realize you’ve been wearing a parachute the whole time.

The pay is a little underwhelming off the bat, but there are pay raises each 6 months and I'll be promoted in a year.

This summer, I had an internship in Los Angeles and really liked it there. The company I interned with was facing some labor cost freezes, so while the manager I had there made it clear she wanted to hire me, she didn't have the money to at the time.

Well cut to today - the very day I get the official appointment letter from the job in Washington - I get an email from my former manager in southern California, asking how I'm doing and whether I'm looking for a job. It turns out that as of yesterday the labor cost freeze turned into a labor cost thaw.

Despite the cost of living differences, I've estimated I'd still take home about $10k more in the first year in LA. I'd probably have to formally interview for the job (the job that I'm assuming exists, that is), but I think I'd do well. After the first year though, the take-home pay gap shrinks, though I don't think they'd converge.

To complicate matters, the job in LA fits what I want to do well, but the job in Washington fits what I want to do perfectly. I think I'd be happier on the weekends in LA, but happier at work in Washington.

Your hot takes on this would be greatly appreciated."

It's well worth the read, very informative and motivating. 

Key points:

* Innovation comes from creative monopolies (note: not detrimental monopolies) as the largest companies were able to do something so well that they escaped competition.

* Success for these companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) came from investing their time and energy into an exceptional product that changed an industry.

* Everything comes down to planning. PayPal was able to endure the dot com bust by merging with X.com and by providing a relevant and innovative service.

It's done a lot to motivate the inner entrepreneur in me and only increased my ambition. 
Working as an intern at a sustainable energy firm in Australia, Zero to One has given me a great perspective on the larger vision of similar success to SolarCity. 
I've found the B2B development difficult as an intern, but I digress.

I have a little over $2k saved up in my bank.  I have: a ROTH-IRA with $100, a $6k private student loan with my bank, and ~$30k in other student loans.  My 6-month deferment period ends in November.  

What I'm wondering is what to do with my $2k and how I can handle my money to save for my life goals, which mostly involve travelling at this point.  Any advice is deeply appreciated... And if I've left out any relevant info, ask! Thanks again!"

I have a draft of the script ready, it is 2-3 minutes long. Very little real-world video would be needed, if any. Mostly its dialogue and a few explanatory images.

Possible opportunity to get more involved in the project as well, if successful we will need help in a number of other domains.

GPA is 3.6.  I interviewed first/second round for a couple of summer intern consulting positions but did not receive offers from either.  I did receive an offer for a software engineering position which it looks like I'm going to take.  Unfortunately I absolutely despised my previous co-op position in this line of work.  I don't want to turn this into a self fulfilling prophecy, but it is safe to say that I don't have high expectations for this internship.

Give that I will be doing full time job search next fall (as a January 2016 hire) but don't have any consulting experience under my belt, should I give up on this line of work/practicing cases/etc?  Is it even possible to score a full time position in consulting without any previous experience?

2k6f8j,6,2014-10-24,Is it a waste of time getting a second degree in Computer Science if you're mostly interested in front-end/UX/design/user issues? What do you suggest is a good move from my position?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2k6f8j/is_it_a_waste_of_time_getting_a_second_degree_in/,"I'm a second-degree student currently finishing up a BA degree in Computer Science, and gunning to start a career on the front-end side of things.

I have the following under my belt: Intro to CS, Data Structures/some algorithms, Discrete Math 1 (i.e., not including probability), Computer Architecture (including assembly, etc.), Calc1, Calc2.

Currently taking: C/systems programming, Linear Algebra, Programming Languages/Theory

I will not be able to take my algorithm design/analysis class if I decide not to get my degree (i.e., I'd learn it on my own.)

As the topic indicates, I'm interested in stuff like front-end, design (as in UX, not graphic, though visual communication is fine), usability... would even consider working in product/marketing role some day.  I'm not really shooting for your typical backend role, and as much as I enjoy CS, I know I'm more passionate about (and naturally predisposed to) thinking about people-issues.   I'm trying to decide whether or not to finish my CS degree the more I realize this, and lose focus feeling like I'm wasting time and money in school, where 90% of the time I end up self-teaching everything anyway (I get very very little out of lectures and learn better at my own pace).  Plus there's useless requirements I need to finish (I love to learn, but not pay thousands for those classes).

A lot of this boils down to how important the CS degree will be for my goals, considering I already have a degree, but still need to break into the industry, have gotten at least halfway into the program already, but don't wish to be in a CS-heavy role.

There's a lot of breadth I want to cover, so I'll try to be specific with my questions:

1)
I'm aware there's been a recent trend of loading more logic onto the client-side.  To what extent does a front-end developer need the hard CS background?  Excluding algorithms (I only know enough about the usual big-O stuff), does my foundation look strong enough to pick up the rest as I go along?  Do most ""front-end roles"" require the hard CS knowledge?  I know there's certainly a demand for front-end developers, but I don't know if that necessarily means the traditional HTML/CSS/JS/design guys, or if that simply means back-end guys working on the ""front,"" but otherwise still doing the same sort of work.  It's hard to tell what this actual ""demand for front-end developers"" entails, or to whom exactly ""skilled front-end developers"" refers to, when the term ""front-end"" is a loose concept.  Are all angular guys classified as those in-demand ""front end developers?"" If the market is likely to dictate me ending up in a role that will still require essentially the same CS background (ie, very strong background in data structures, algorithms, etc.), then I'm wondering if the second CS degree will still be worth it?

2)
I'd like to know on the front-end side of things, if it's possible for me to break in not coming from either a traditional back-end role or a designer role (ie, entry level front-end).  I'm not worried about my work ethic and ability to build a portfolio/projects etc., but I don't want to fight an unnecessarily difficult battle, because it seems most people eventually move into the front-end from either of those two roles.  Obviously I will want to snag an internship first.  I know there's solid demand for well-prepared python/ruby/js interns, but what about front-end?

3)
Assuming I stay for at least another semester (I have reasons), I'm curious to know what classes would be useful for a front-end role.  For instance, I wondered if OS would be of any use, or if that would be overkill (I've read OS is a useful class, and recalled reading it would introduce you to effective techniques/concepts analogous to the way the internet/the browser works, but that's beyond my understanding at this point).  It's a pretty time-consuming class at my university and it's time I could spend building my portfolio/learning something else.  There's also a database class that touches some practical things, but I suspect it's the type of stuff I'd end up picking up out of necessity, unlike OS which may best be learned in a university setting.

Alternatively, on the other spectrum, I could take classes related to cognitive science/psych and information architecture/visualization.  There's an HCI/usability class too which is probably a definite on my list.

Input here appreciated.  I guess I'm asking if I should milk as much hard-CS knowledge as I can still, or if it's not very worthwhile given where I see myself in 5 years.

4)
One last thing: since the decision to drop a class I will make for myself, I'd like to narrow my question to -- which class do you think is LEAST useful for a front-end developer: C/systems programming, linear algebra, or a programming languages/theory class.

--

If anyone has any other general insight into the nature of my question, feel free to chime in!  Thank you so much.

What do I do now to boost my chances of getting an internship (and later a good job)?,Hauzron,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2k6m0d/276gpa_what_do_i_do_now_to_boost_my_chances_of/,"I'm a Junior doing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I have a 2.76 GPA. I learned C# and some web development languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript a little PHP back when I was around 14-15. I stopped programming for a while and since then all I've really learnt is C++ in university. I consider C++ do be the language I'm most proficient in now. I don't really know the full syntax and more advanced parts of C++. I'm taking Data Structures and Algorithms right now in university. I've also forgotten some of the more advanced parts of C#.

I did some projects on freelancer.com (formerly getafreelancer.com ) back when I was around 15 years old. Mainly psd to html conversions. I also did one C# project on freelancer.com a couple of month ago.

Here's my old freelancer.com profile: https://www.freelancer.com/u/WebDeveloperr.html I've made a new one although I haven't done any projects on it yet.

That and a 2.76 GPA are all I have under my belt and I have to get an internship in Summer 2015. A 6 week internship is mandatory to graduate in my university. What do languages do I learn now? What skills do I develop next? What can I do to boost my chances of getting a good internship?

It's probably obvious by now but I'm more interested in the software side of computer engineering than the hardware side. Not that much interested in web development anymore. Despite that I bought an arduino starter kit a while ago. I haven't done much with it yet or completely learnt how it works. Just did the blinking lights project.


Also how exactly does github work? I've seen it get mentioned a lot on here.

EDIT: In case your wondering why I suddenly stopped learning around 16 years old, I kind of lost my passion for programming. I was actually a civil engineering student during my first year before deciding I wanted to be in a technological field and switched to computer engineering.

EDIT 2: Forgot to add this. I live in the UAE. Dubai.

2k6wmt,10,2014-10-24,"Going back to school part time, working full time. Feel like I am wasting valuable time.",electrikmayham,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2k6wmt/going_back_to_school_part_time_working_full_time/,"This may or may not be something that is reasonably answered but I figured I would ask anyways.

**Background**

I am a 33 year old male. I am single and I have no kids. I was in the Army for 2 years in the early 2000's and was Honorably Discharged due to a non combat injury. I did not qualify for the GI bill so I basically disregarded college. I got a job in IT and have been there since.

Recently I realized that college was something I not only needed, but wanted. I took some classes over the summer and am currently enrolled in 9 credit hours. I am also working full time. So far I have a 4.0 GPA and the classes seem to come fairly easy to me. I have plenty of time to do my homework while working. I feel like I could take on more of a class load while working but it may hinder my grades, which I am not willing to risk.

Every day I go to class and I feel invigorated and happy. I get to learn and I get out of the house. Then I have to go to work and I feel like I am wasting my time. With my current class plan I won't be able to transfer to a University until Fall 2017, a full 3 years. This assumes that I take a class during EVERY semester, including the Winter and Spring minimester (which are very stressful) and each summer term.

I am lucky enough to be from Texas which lets me use the Hazelwood act. This exempts me from tuition (not fees or books) for classes I take at public colleges. I have a financial plan for the next 3 years that hopefully puts me in a position to not have to take loans for what I will owe when I transfer (living expenses, fee's, books etc).

I feel like taking a lighter class load and working is wasting my time. I feel like I could take more classes and succeed quicker if I wasnt working but I have no clue how to get into that position while being able to prepare myself for University financially. 

I'm also running into an issue where my major (CS) requires internships which I cannot have due to my full time job. The University I want to transfer to (University of Texas) is so competitive that they are denying CS transfer students with a 4.0 gpa. I feel like I don't have enough time to have extracurricular's to make my application competitive enough to get in.

Does anyone have any good advice? Has anyone gone back to school and stopped working full time? How did it affect you? How did you go about doing it?"

I've decided that I would like to pursue becoming a manager in the scene and be able to further develop and focus my passion for League of Legends and Esports. I have some questions that hopefully current managers in the scene, players, and anyone else that has experience can hopefully answer for me. If this is something I can find myself doing in the future, I want to be prepared to be able to meet my potential future teams needs, especially with recent words that have been thrown around about past and current managers.



1. I know it varies from team to team, but what are some qualities that teams, players, organizations look for in a manager?


2. What are task's that are generally required of a manager working for / with an competitive team?


3. What are some challenges that Manager have to overcome or be expected to encounter?


4. Last, are there ways I can get experience, similar to an Intern, studying under a current manager or player, something along that lines, so if I approach a team I can have something on my resume to make me more of an attractive interest? I don't doubt my current skills but it would be nothing short of beneficial to be able to do something like this, that way I have some knowledge, contacts to work with if/when I was able to start working on my own.


I appreciate any answers, input ahead of time and look forward to reading your responses!

2k7k7d,0,2014-10-24,Should I let my boyfriend pay my student loans?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2k7k7d/should_i_let_my_boyfriend_pay_my_student_loans/,"I'm afraid this might get long, but just from the outset: I do not feel comfortable with my boyfriend paying off my student loans. I am wondering if this is stupid and if this is the right subreddit.

I grew up poor, so fortunately I got a lot of financial aid in the form of grants/scholarships to cover my undergrad and graduate schooling. Because I wanted to finish my undergrad in three years and my masters in 1.5, I didn't want to waste time working and I took out loans for housing and food etc. that ended up totaling $40,000. This wasn't a problem for me, because I wanted to be a librarian, which I have been for one year in January (I graduated last May), to the tune of $57,000 a year. I also live in SF (moved here from AZ last year), so while that may seem like a decent living it's not exactly. This is also fine by me, because ever since I was a kid, I wanted to live here. 

I'm currently paying $500 a month on these loans (I'm down to ~$37,000 currently). I'm hoping to extend this in the future, but my currently my boyfriend is grad school (getting a phd in computer science) and doesn't exactly make a whole lot to contribute. However, he's starting an internship soon and will supposedly be making $10,000 a month. 

He wants to help me pay off my student loans, because it bothers him that I have this monthly debt. His parents make almost $500,000 combined, so I feel like maybe he doesn't understand where I'm coming from.

It's important to me that I've worked so hard to achieve this and I want to see that through the end. I'm embarrassed that he's going to make so much money, embarrassed that his parents find out he paid off my loans (they told me people should never take out loans for schooling, I do not regret my choice and have told them as much), and disappointed that this is a problem for him. I understand I've helped us in many ways the past year because his pay can be sporadic and he's been very grateful, but it's not the same. I'm helping us because we live a life together. He doesn't need to help me for choices I've made in the past. We've been together for four years, so it's not like he wasn't with me, but we moved in together when we moved here so our life is a lot more intertwined. 

I guess I'm asking if I'm being stupid, I know I'll end up paying much more in the long run, but I certainly don't want him to pay and then I feel like I'm in debt to him. I guess I'm asking if anybody else has been in this situation? "

You can also save money by sending a bank wire instead of paying with a credit card, since the credit card processor takes 3% off the top.  Even if an online jewelry retailer doesn't specify that they'll accept bank wires, they'd probably give you a discount if you called them up and asked.  edit: Blue Nile is probably the largest online diamond retailer, and due to their volume discounts from suppliers, it can be hard for other suppliers to match their prices.  However, their jewelry is mass-produced, so if I was going to buy an engagement ring, I'd probably get a slightly smaller diamond and pay $100-$200 more to get it custom-designed so you have something unique.  Jewelers will do this locally.  We do it too, and send computer-rendered images of the CAD design to the customer until our CAD guys get it right.  edit2: There's actually a significant jump in price at popular carat sizes.  I guess a lot of people go into this saying they want at least X carats, and then end up not getting anything below that.  So you can buy a 0.94 carat diamond for quite a bit less than a 1.00 carat diamond, even though pretty much no one would be able to notice the size difference.  In fact, some diamond polishers will even cut a diamond poorly just so they can make it a little bigger and push it over the one-carat mark or the two-carat mark.  We keep an eye out for this though, and would make sure not to sell these diamonds.
[Any reddit discount code?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clik1gx?context=5)|Actually, I did make a Reddit discount code when I was writing creating the backend for our coupon system, that I'd planned to post in /r/jewelry until I read their no-advertising policy.  It's ""colby2012"".  Heh heh.
[Is there any real reason nowadays that artificial diamonds are seen as a poor cousin of natural ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clikc8c?context=5)|Because there's no guarantee that lab-made diamonds will continue to have value.  Natural diamonds are rare enough that we can guarantee that even if they find a bunch of new deposits, they'll never going to be so cheap to extract that the price of diamonds will fall dramatically.
 |Right now, artificial diamonds are hard and expensive to make.  They use a technology called ""carbon vapor deposition"" where they essentially shoot a thin mixture of methane and hydrogen with microwave radiation, trying to create carbon atoms floating around that aren't bonded to anything.  Eventually, they bond either to a diamond seed crystal, which grows it, or the hydrogen, which makes it turn back into methane.  This process takes a really long time, and requires tons of energy.  For diamonds larger than a carat, it's usually cheaper to buy a natural diamond.
 |If you want to get something that is very difficult to distinguish from a natural diamond and wouldn't have any value to a jeweler or diamond trader, you may as well get a cubic zirconia or moissanite.
 |TL;DR: The main reason people are willing to pay as much as they are for natural diamonds is because they know that they'll continue to have value.
[Isn't the only reason diamonds have any value due to very shady diamond wholesalers who buy up all the diamonds and store them, as to not flood the market while simultaneously creating a fake scarcity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/climt73?context=5)|That used to be the case with De Beers in the 1980s, but then a bunch of diamond mines opened in Russia and Canada that De Beers wasn't able to get, and they ended up losing a bunch of money and their diamond stockpiles.  De Beers still controls about 40% of the world's diamond mines, but they're no longer able to control the supply like they used to.
[If you have ever tried to resell any diamond smaller and 3-4 karats, you will see how much ""value"" diamonds have.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljf6ya?context=5)|I work for a diamond company, we do that all the time!  The trouble is, you've got to find a buyer first, so to get the full wholesale value, you usually have to let it sit in the market listings for a while until it gets sold.  If you want to get your money NOW though, then you'll have to settle for a lower price so it can sell more easily.
[You can tell the copy apart. Diamonds aren't like that, are they? If one of each were put into a bag and you randomly pulled one out, could you determine which was 'real'? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cliugy4?context=5)|You wouldn't be able to tell a copy from an original, I'd imagine.  But an art expert could.  Same goes for diamonds.  A trained gemologist can tell a CVD diamond from a natural one.
[It is in terms of the cost of paint and canvas etc.  The cost of these paintings are subjective as are diamonds.  Yes diamonds are rare and hard to extract but aside from industrial applications, they hold no value whatsoever except as a concocted status symbol.  It's just a freaking rock.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cliuz9g?context=5)|Well, diamonds have been particularly valuable as gemstones in ancient India, as well as Greece and Rome, so it's not like De Beers just decided to make them valuable in the 1930s.  They were always valuable before then, it's just that only nobility could afford them.
[Says De Beers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cliqhnw?context=5)|I wish I had their money.  We're just retailers.
[*Again, the main reason natural diamonds are more valuable than synthetic ones is because of their known scarcity.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clj3huo?context=5)|The reason I prefaced with those questions is because they're the ones I tend to get asked on REDDIT, because Reddit is often up their own asses with their own fiction about how doomed they think the diamond industry is.  Look, if you or anyone else wants to buy a synthetic diamond, NO ONE CARES.  Go to [Link to www.gemesis.co](http://www.gemesis.co) and buy one.  Or buy a CZ.  It's your decision.  But if some day your girlfriend tells you she wants a natural diamond ring as opposed to a synthetic one, it's precisely because she wants you to spend a lot of money on her, not because of the arrangement of the carbon atoms.
[Exactly. Time Warner is doesn't have a monopoly either. There's other companies to compete with them, like Comcast. This keeps the market competitive and balanced.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clinstc?context=5)|The difference is, there are hundreds of diamond mining companies on four different continents.  Russia's a major player too, and they don't like cooperating with anyone.  They were actually instrumental in breaking up the De Beers monopoly in the 1990s.
[Are you impressed by the ability of your industry to assert that 'natural' diamonds are far superior (and thus more expensive\) to man-made diamonds, when at the atomic level, they are identical?  Do you rub your hands with glee knowing your industry can set any price it wants for an essentially worthless piece of carbon?  Do you feel slightly bad that you're selling rocks to people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clilg1z?context=5)|Why do you think diamonds are worthless?  Diamonds are worthless in the same way that Picasso paintings are worthless, despite being made out of fairly common elements.  Just because you wouldn't pay what they sell for, doesn't mean they don't have value.  Do you think that mine built itself?  Or rather, do you think anyone would have built it if diamonds were worthless?  edit: As far as feeling bad, of course not.  Historically, a lot of diamond retailers have manipulated customers into buying crappy diamonds that were cut it a way that they could make it a larger carat size, even though it looked like crap.  We're focused on a business model of much more honest and open communication with our customers, and making it a policy to not sell overpriced crap.  Also, we've been able to bring on two developers as interns, then hire them full time.  We also have a lot more sales staff per customer than our competitors, and our goal is to buck the trend that's going the opposite direction.  So in that sense, I'm actually kind of proud of what we've been able to do.  Our customers all know exactly what they're buying, so why would I feel bad for them?
[Link to en.wikipedia.org.  13 cents.  Sure, there are less diamonds per ton compared to copper (0.6% of the copper ore is actually copper\).  But even if it was 1000x harder to get diamonds out of diamond ore, the price would only be $1.30 per carat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/clio0ss?context=5)|One gram per ton is considered really good for diamond ore.  Also, they have to be sorted optically, as opposed to chemically, like copper is.  
[The price setting mechanism for an authentic diamond is, as I understand it, controlled by a single entity and not by a broader market.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|This was the case up until the early 1990s, when the USSR broke up and Russian diamond mines started selling on the global market.  De Beers tried to absorb them like they'd done with new mines before, but the Russians were having none of it.  (Surprised?)  They ended up losing a lot of money trying to buy up the lower-priced inventory, and ended up losing a lot of money in addition to their market domination.  IIRC they're still the largest diamond mining group, but control less than 40% of the market rather than the 80-90% they used to.
[The main distinctions, as you write, are that GIA does not certify industrial diamonds and it is possible to detect ""differences"" in industrial diamonds, though as I understand it industrial diamonds may be more pure than those found in nature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|TL;DR: Yes, diamonds are controlled mainly by market forces now, like other commodities.
[To me, a price setting monopoly  combined with a regulatory authority like GIA to create a barrier to substitute products](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|You're oversimplifying things, but essentially, there are only a few types of inclusions that show up in CVD (synthetic) diamonds, and they tend to form a pattern that isn't found in natural diamonds.  So gemologists will use inclusions in a natural diamond to quickly rule it out as being synthetic without having to check with UV or X-ray.
[are not characteristics of an asset class whose price is rational and if those barriers were removed, the price of diamonds globally would fall.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|There are a ton of substitute products out there.  People had the same worries when they started producing gemstone-quality CZs in the 1970s.  They were not born out.
[So in theory, diamonds could become close to worthless but the analogy to Picasso is not valid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k79q5/iama_owner_of_an_online_diamond_company_ama/cljelgl?context=5)|Oh you mean if GIA started not distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds in certificates?  You realize that's like the US Federal Reserve deciding to let anyone print their own money, right?
 |There are no perfect analogies in any other commodity, but the closest I can come up with is somewhere between art and precious metals, since diamonds have characteristics of both.  Another analogy might be gold-plated jewelry vs. solid gold.

2k80vj,1,2014-10-24,19[m4F] Options for long-term,throwaway_rhen,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2k80vj/19m4f_options_for_longterm/,"Though this is my first time posting in search of a penpal. Let me start off my sharing a little about myself. I am 19, Hispanic, 6'2"" tall (yes I get told I'm tall a lot), I have an average but slender body, and have dark brown hair.

I decided in order to broaden my chances of finding a penpal/fellow writer, that for my first post I'm going to give three story ideas. However, these ideas are not non-negotiable and I am very much open to whatever ideas you might have or alterations to the ones that I have provided! So don't feel hesitant on asking if I'm okay to change anything about them! :)

As for my kinks, I have many. Pretty much I have no limits. However some of my biggest ones are ageplay, incest, watersports, panties (this does not mean I like wearing them. It means I find them extremely attractive and well some other things, but I don't wear them! lol), Dom/sub relationships, and light bondage. However this does not mean these are all my kinks or that I am opposed to introducing others to the story. Also, if one is not comfortable with any of them, they do not need to be added to the story. I am looking for someone who is open to do this long term. Build up the characters and the story line. I find it more interesting that way! Or at least someone who doesn't reply with one 4 worded sentences each time. So at least a paragraph per response please!

(Option #1) In a world filled with magic and darkness, you have been assigned to pose as a professor at a renowned school that prepares young students of all kinds of background, history and abilities to hone in on their skills and become a hunter or huntress. In reality to you a member of a secret organization of killers, sworn to put an end to all darkness in the world. However, while undercover you discover a young elf who, though is completely doubtful of himself and his skills, is extremely gifted in the ways of mentalism and conjuring of the elements. He just doesn't know how gifted he is yet.

But you sense something dark about his soul, so you take him under your wing as an apprentice and teach him to improve upon his already discover two skills (though he believes his mental skills are unknown to anyone since he never told anyone. You somehow figure it out.). But also you must teach him in the ways of the darkness hidden inside him in order for him to control it and not let it take over him. (Maybe you cause a series of terrible events to occur at the school that somehow lead back to me, and you convince me the only way to live a decent life now is to run away with you. Or you can teach me there in secrecy. I leave all these details open to your creativity. I am not picky and find someone with an imagination attractive!) Ultimately we will fall in love. A tabooed student teacher relationship. Or maybe we just fuck for the hell of it because of the intensity of training and need to blow off steam. Your choice. This was the first long-term style rp idea that I did and what made me want to continue doing them. So it's always a favorite!

(Option #2) Lately there have been several natural disasters happening throughout the country, but mostly in California. You had the understanding that it was just tectonic plate movements due to being on a fault line. But that didn't explain the recent tornado. One day while walking home from school you feel a tremor coming on and look for the nearest safe spot, but be it that you were in the middle of crossing the road, that left you with little to no options. What's worse is that you turned to see what's going on and see a car speeding out of control and without a doubt going to hit you. You close your eyes and accept your fate, until you feel a collision from your back and land on something softer than the ground.

You open your eyes and see me on top of you. ""Oi, you're not light. Get off!"" I say in my accent. Though you cannot pinpoint it's exact origin, you get up immediately. Before you can even thank me or ask any questions, I grab you by the hand and yell, ""let's go!"" i drag you down the alley and without warning you feel a odd sensation of weightlessness and fall to the ground. However it isn't the hard concrete. It's a soft grass plain. The grass is brilliant orange-red, and you are disoriented and confuse. I put out my hand to you and help you up. ""Damn vortex manipulator. Cheap time traveling technology."" you hear me say as I examine a odd looking watch on my wrist. With many questions you look to me, but once again I manage to cut you off with, ""Anywho, sorry about earlier, it was either that or the front end of the car! I'm The Doctor, I don't believe I caught your name."" As I put out my hand to introduce myself. (if you didn't catch it by now, this is a Doctor Who rp idea. I am the doctor and you are the young (maybe even more mature) women I saved from what you think is a natural disaster. However due to faulty technology we are stuck in a different time period until I can get my ship to me. Will you end up being my companion I take on multiple adventures, or will you be just a luck bystander who decides to thank me once we get you home?)

(Option #3) I am a young medical intern who is just trying to become a full fledged doctor. Even though I excelled at my medical classes, I was having a hard time keeping my cool under pressure of the real medical world and you, my head medical doctor have been tasked with teaching us, and you've taken a interest in me. You decide to help me with my pressure and stress issues of being thrown into the real world of a doctor head first. How you do so is your choice.

(Bonus option #4) We have just finished are training at the ninja academy and have become full fledged apprentice ninjas. We will know be broken into teams with varying abilities and skills in order to grow as ninjas and fight for our cause of peace among the kingdoms. I'm a reckless, impulsive, smartass who always has a retort and goes in without ever really having a plan. However though everyone looks down upon me for a past I don't know about, I have a strong will to learn and get stronger.

Maybe you're one of the three comrades who have been assigned to my team and have to put up with me, though we aren't very fond of each other yet. Maybe you've always fancied me but I never noticed you because you were too scared to ever say anything to me. Maybe you're my rival but have a mutual understanding of wanting to get stronger for our own personal reasons. Maybe your my teacher and leader of the group as a full fledged ninja who helps me realize my potential and aid me in growing to become one of the strongest whoever live, included embracing the darkness inside me I don't know about.

(All of these are negotiable. You can say if you want to tweak the roles or have the roles reversed. I left ages, race, body type, and character traits out because I want someone to have the freedom of creating the characters they ultimately want. This includes kinks as well. We can discuss these details before hand and come to an understanding before we start. I am looking for someone who is detailed-oriented and looking to do this for a while. I hope to hear some people! Please include some information about yourself so I don't feel like I'm talking to someone with no interests in this, and include with option you are interested in, unless you have an idea, by which please include it as well. I take it goes without saying that I would like one to be open to correct grammar and spelling for the most part! Happy writing!)

Edit: Sorry, I didn't realize I typed so much and how long it was! If still up, I'm still looking for partners!"
2k80x5,1,2014-10-24,Community College?,[deleted],InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/2k80x5/community_college/,"Hi everyone! I hope this is okay to post here. I want to work in IT and need opinions about community college associate degree programs. My experience level with computers and technology is basically the same as any other 24 year old's. I'm good, but I wouldn't be able to land an IT job right now and really know what I'm doing or anything. Do you all think associate programs at community colleges actually teach you the skills you need to work in IT? I'm interested in networking or just general IT support and troubleshooting. The program I'm looking at has classes such as CISCO Fundamentals, Visual Basic, Fundamentals of UNIX/Linux, Windows Directory Services, and more. Certain classes say you will be academically prepared to take certification exams afterwards. It also has a co-op class where apparently they set you up with an internship type deal. My work experience is only customer service--nothing IT related. And as I said, I just have pretty basic knowledge right now. Has anyone else went into a CC program with hardly any knowledge? Did you learn enough to actually work in IT? Any advice or opinions would be great!"
2k85i9,1,2014-10-24,Seattle Chills,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2k85i9/seattle_chills/,"Do you remember that ""memory rewrites itself"" no sleep a while back, I feel like one or two of my specifics like the color of the cars may have been rewritten in my brain, but I remember all most all of that night. This is not well written, just a recollection of a recent happening. 


Anyways, let me lay some background on you.
I went to a massive high school, I graduated with 900 kids, and the other schools in our area literally called us the green army. However, regardless of its size everyone knew the popular girls. There was this popular girl named Lexi in my high school math class that thought was absolutely gorgeous. Eventually we started flirting for some time, and I managed to get her number, and things were looking pretty good. High school crush stuff. Anyways, I knew she had roid head x-boyfriend that was somewhat in the picture but I did not think anything of it. One day I see him at my work, which was our high school spot to be, CDI. I feel like we has staring me down but I figured it was just a coincidence, till I get a text from her saying, Kevin’s at your work, he knows we have been talking and he is pretty mad, be careful he’s the stalker type. Well shit I thought, holy fuck this roid head could totally beat my video game playing ass into the ground. I was like 6” 140lbs soaking wet haha. As far as I remember I just told my boss who was an in-training MMA player (so I felt protected) and nothing went down. Lexi and I kinda stopped talking after that.


Fast forward, to July of this year. Well I guess I forgot one thing, about June I sent her a Facebook message which is now weirdly gone, I just checked for it. But I was just checking in on her, she was a cool regardless, and always a well-intentioned person. Basically the typical what have you been up to, where are you headed kind of thing. So July rolls around, I’m on CO-OP for the second time which is an extended internship through college, I get three credits to maintain my finical aid and then I get to go work for a company for about 8 months. On my first visit to Seattle with my company, I was leading a coating application study, I was basically a field engineer, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and I see “RIP Lexi” all over, so I do some digging and found out she was in a car accident at 3am NY time on a Sunday, dead on impact (remember this this is important). This hit me slightly harder than I expect, sure I’ve had tons of family die, a couple of people I know die in college, and from high school, but I actually used to text this girl a lot, I don’t know, it was just harder than I expected to cope. Anyways I knew she liked to party, so I had a margarita in her name at dinner that night. 

Fast forward 3 weeks, I’m back in Seattle, doing the same old bottle testing and changing application parameters. The weekend comes around, now the rental company gave me a free upgraded to a Camaro, so I put about 800miles on that thing (gas was paid for the car was paid for, unlimited miles, why not). I drove up to see my cousin for the weekend, who lives an hour north of Seattle. We played some magic pack battles and just talked because I see her once every 5 years this was extremely convenient to be in Seattle on business. It seems like I have family where ever I go. On my way back to the hotel , I had about 20min left to drive, I was driving on a four lane high way in the pouring rain, imagine, raining in Seattle. Anyways, all of the sudden something moving upwards catches my attention to the right of me, it’s a jeep, flying up in the air, idk if it hit a deer or a bump I have no idea but my adrenaline was starting to flow, as it lands a car in front of it comes sliding to a halt in front of me (maybe it hit the right wall of the highway and bounced off), so I’m slamming on my breaks with all my might, as shrapnel is flying everywhere, and as I’m sliding around I look to my right and another car is flying directly at my passenger side (3 cars so far), so I gun it and drift around the two cars just barely missing the car in front of me and to my side, by the time I look at the speedometer I’m going 120mph and far away from the crash, then I’ll I remember is pulling into the hotel. I look at the clock it’s about 20min past midnight, so I might have spaced out for the rest of the ride back. I’m not saying I’m good at drifting but I can’t believe I drove that well in that situation, I always thought I would just lose my shit and die. I drive a 02 ford ranger I got from my grandfather, which is a rear wheel drive (Camaro is rear wheel too) so I’m used to drifting in a rear wheel vehicle. I’m still a bit freaked out from what just happened so I decide to take a long hot shower and relax a bit, I put the song on “need to feel loved (Adam k and Soha vocal mix)” on repeat. I find it relaxing and need to relax because I have work at 6am. I was probably in the shower for an hour or so just letting the water hit me. I get out text a few friends about what happened to get it off my chest think about what I am going to tell my parents so they don’t freak out.  Everytime I almost die my mom loses her shit.  So I’m getting ready for bed and I tell Siri to set an alarm for 5:30am and she says “the alarm is set” and I go to get cozy into my king size hotel bed, not 10 seconds later my Iphone decides to start playing music, it’s the song tracking treasure down by Gabriel and Dresden (mixed for feet version) except it’s not at the beginning its at 4:20 into the song where it says “at the same time” 9 times real slow. Suddenly I realize at same time 3 weeks ago 12am Seattle time is 3am NY time I nearly avoided an accident and Lexi died in one. I got the craziest chill traversing my entire body for what felt like an eternity. 

I love trance/edm music and most of my favorite songs give me the chills, but none quite compare to what tracking treasure down does to me now.

On Friday (the 12th) we'll take a night train to Venice and spend two nights there.  We fly back to the states on Monday (the 15th).

As far as the night train, is being in a 6 coachette cabin way worse than a 4?  Right now the difference would be about $100 for the pair of us to be in a 4 vs a 6 person cabin.  The cost of the sleepers combined with the lack of a shower, to me, puts that out of the running (ie. if I can't shower then how much better will I feel anyway).  Basically at a cost difference of $100 should I go 4 person or 6 person?

For the Stonehenge day trip I'm debating renting a car and driving us out there for a day in lieu of taking a bus tour.  The benefit of renting is that we're free to set our schedule in each of the towns and I get the novelty of having driven ""on the wrong side of the road"".  It might actually be cheaper too since a car is like $40 vs 2 bus tour tickets at $100/person.  I drove a stick shift for 10+ years so the manual doesn't bother me but is this just a silly idea in general?

Those are just the two items that I'm specifically still wondering about.  I'd welcome ""things to do"" or ""you messed up"" comments on any of my trip thus far.

EDIT:  I was all set to book a flight from Paris to Venice but the price of a 4 person night train cabin fell to $140 whereas the flights are $124.  I figure the night train saves me the hassle of going to the airport, getting another hotel room night, and to top it off, I've never been on one before so it'll be another experience.  I just feel sorry for anyone that comes into contact with me the day after since there's no shower.  

For Stonehenge I'm still undecided as to how to get there but I'm going to go.  I assume there's a good chance I'll be underwhelmed when I get there but I think there will be an even greater chance that if I don't go see it for myself I'll regret it later.  I had one idea where I'd go see it immediately after landing but the problem there is the timetable.  It seems it could take as long as an hour to get through passport controls/customs plus however long it takes to hire the car, plus the drive, and I'm supposed to book a specific time to see the rocks....that's setup to be a fail.  Once I'm already in my hotel I think I probably don't want to take the tube and/or bus back to heathrow again to hire a car so probably leaning towards the bus tour.  In general, can the bus tours be booked just 1 or 2 days ahead of time?  At this point it feels like I'd like to just wait to decide what to do based on how painful the journey is from the airport to the hotel.  "

I'm having some concerns about my graduation coming up in May. I'm an MIS / Social Science double major with ~2.8 GPA, no internships (currently looking for a spring internship and might go with a summer internship after I graduate if I can find one). I'm really conflicted with the career path I want to take.

On one hand I'm probably best suited for a BI/Data Analytics role, maybe some kind of Database/SQL work. 
I've been getting pretty interested in Web Dev(leaning towards backend), however, currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and Python on my own time. 

Is there any way I can combine these or advice for entry-level work? I'm kind of overwhelming myself a little but for my next semester all I need is either 2 classes or an internship so I'll have more free time for learning/projects.

Thanks in advance guys.

A chance to change the game,tmoney226,Debate,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debate/comments/2k8bh6/making_paperless_debate_better_a_chance_to_change/,"Computers in debate, despite being in existence for a few years, are a relatively new thing. The very way debate is being approached is changing. A few tools have been produced for debaters who debate with their computers (i.e. Verbatim, synergy) and only a few others. Computers are cool. Debaters are cool. I think more can be achieved.

The issue around current programs is their niche functionality. Verbatim is sweet, however its use does little to help debaters network. Synergy allowed people to flow on their laptops, but downloading the installer makes me feel old and slow (not to mention you better hope the installer doesn't goof and create run-time errors every time you start word). Overall, the products on the market are decent, but not quite what we hard working debaters deserve.

Here is your chance, capture the market, pitch your idea now. I will devote some serious time to making it happen. DebateStrat is my website, my first step, in moving debate further in the paperless debate realm. (Edit: My focus is now the google doc add-on) ""Crate"" is my second step, more information can be found here: http://debatestrat.com/discussion/12/future-functionality. 

So I ask you fellow debaters, what doth thou want in terms of paperless debate?

* I left my car keys in my unlocked car is east Van the other day and it got stolen. The police are telling me to lock my car next time. This is victim blaming - I didn't ASK for my car to be stolen.

* I dropped a bowl of pho the other day and the employee refused to give me another one and said I should not text while eating and walking. This is victim blaming - I didn't ASK for my food to drop.

* I went out for a party thursday night and slept through ym exam today. The prof told me that I should not party the day before. This is victim blaming - I didn't ASK to sleep in.

* Last year I went to the hospital after alcohol poisoning. The doctors told me to not drink so much alcohol. This is victim blaming - I didn't ASK to be poisoned.

* I got rejected for an internship because my ""grades and performance weren't at their standard"". This is victim blaming and sexism - I didn't ASK to have low grades and they should realize that I'm an open-minded and independent person.

* My bike got stolen and security said I should have had a lock. This is victim blaming - I didn't ASK to have my bike stolen.


Everyone needs to stop victim blaming - this includes:

* Stop blaming telling your innocent kids to stay away from strangers

* Stop blaming and telling people to study instead of party

* Stop blaming and telling people to keep their valuables more secure

* Stop blaming and telling people to be safer and travel in groups at night

* Stop blaming and telling people to make ""smart decisions"" when it's our right to handle our own finances and that we are the victims if something goes wrong

2k8ui0,0,2014-10-24,27F4M - The Intern &amp; the Senator,isabelle_garcia,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2k8ui0/27f4m_the_intern_the_senator/,"[Isabelle Garcia](http://i.imgur.com/Kd1HaAj.jpg) was a recent graduate from William and Mary College, just three hours from her dream destination in Washington, D.C.

Isabelle had a love of government and politics since as far back as she could remember. In the 3rd grade she memorized the entire Gettysburg Address. Other girls wanted to be singers and movie stars, but for Isabelle, she wanted to be a cross between Hillary Clinton and Jackie O., maybe with a little Jennifer Lopez mixed in.

It didn't surprise anybody when she took an unpaid internship on Capitol Hill right after she graduated college. It wasn't going to be an easy move. Isabelle wasn't the typical rich kid with wealthy parents to fund them while they pursued their dreams in politics. She had been saving her money for this moment since she was 16 years old. Her full scholarship to William and Mary meant she didn't have to tap into her savings to get her degree. Now she would be using everything she had saved up to spend long, unpaid hours running coffee and grabbing meals for Hill employees that would barely acknowledge she was there, and one day might let her sit in on a policy meeting.

It was an easy choice when Isabelle decided on an internship with Senator Paul Thompson's office. She had received offers from every Senator's office she had applied to, but it was Senator Thompson that had always been her number one choice. 

Senator Thompson was the up and coming lion of the Senate. Cocky, yet charming. Charismatic in a way that only a politician could be. He was a bit of a playboy, the only never-married Senator on The Hill, but the public trusted him and viewed him as a man of the people, even when he was seen getting a little too drunk at the Nationals game, or caught out by the paparazzi with two different Hollywood starlets in the same week. He was honest, he was respected, and most of all, he was someone that got things done. Isabelle liked to think that that her future husband would possess all of those qualities. And if she was being honest, on more than one occasion Isabellle had imagined herself being the Senator's wife.

It wasn't long into her internship that her idealistic notions of DC politics came crashing down. She had enter a world where female interns were seen more as future mistresses than anything else. They were used and abused, the ones not able to handle it were spit out from the mouths of the power elite into the D.C. gutter. The Hill was nothing like Isabelle had ever imagined, but she was prepared to take all it could give her.

Over the last six months Isabelle had gotten very close to the Senator. Instead of being assigned the typical duties that an intern would cover, Isabelle was more like a personal assistant to Senator Thompson. Of course, that raised the eyebrows of many on the office staff, but nobody would ever dare say anything above a whisper as to why or how the young intern had gotten so close to Senator Thompson."
2k8vjo,2,2014-10-24,Asking Out a Coworker,lescapegoat,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/2k8vjo/asking_out_a_coworker/,"Quick background: I graduated with my Education degree last December. Subbing for the spring got my name around, and I ended up with an assistant position at an amazing school that I love.

And as a bonus? There's an astonishing teacher down the hall. She's amazing with the kids, embodies a sort of ideal presence that I want to have when I have my own classroom, and, well, she's so pretty it hurts. My first day, she came in, telling me how excited she was to have me there, wanted a hug, at which point I realized this could be a problem.

Every encounter since - brief, as Im not a teacher and our schedules generally dont align - finds me a babbling mess when she tries to talk to me, blushing from the eye-contact and tongue-tied. We've talked more substantially in the past (she got up with me one day when I subbed in the school, ""We've seen you on the playground and we like your work.""), but it was easier to engage in real conversation when I was in her room working with her several days in a row. And when I assumed she was married. 

Turns out she's not. She's paid me passing compliments, (""I like your hair,"" or ""I like your [item of clothing],"" ""Looking sharp, Mr. [name]."") but again, I get to be a bit of puddle. I'm a shy person in general, but this some next level social awkwardness. Today I'd thought I worked up the nerve to ask her out, but finding even a 30 second window of privacy to suggest going out sometime is... tough. For instance, trying to go to her as today ended meant me realizing her assistant and intern were still there with her. 

I'm at the point where I'm even considering a facebook message. I'm way more comfortable in writing, and as a friend suggested, ""better that than not doing it at all."" We've talked a bit on there before, which was way more comfortable for at least one of us.

Of course, I'm hyperaware of every possible mistake I could make. She may not have any interest in me, but I'd hate to scare her off if she does. Would a written message be a dorkish, awkward turnoff, given circumstances (lack of opportunity, my firework nerves)? Or would she really care about the methods if she has any interest to begin with?

2k8vkg,2,2014-10-24,I really need some advice.,LongDistanceJoe,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2k8vkg/i_really_need_some_advice/,"Hey guys, I'm using a new account because I think some people know my main, and I'm not sure I want my GF knowing exactly what I'm thinking at this point. I'm looking for advice on what to do/how to handle this. I guess I'll start from the beginning.

We started dating back in 2010, both of us were juniors in high-school at the time. It was ""long"" distance from the get go. She lived in Washington, I Live(d) in Oregon. It wasn't too bad though, only 2.5 hour drive or so, and we got to see each other most weekends after we started dating. A s senior year came around we started looking at where we thought our relationship was headed, and decided that, while we wanted to stay together, we weren't going to have that influence our choice of colleges. It was kinda rough but we promised each other we wouldn't try to hold each other back from achieving their dreams.. This ended up meaning she moved to Chicago to go to school, and I stayed in Oregon.

 So the distance jumped from around ~206 miles or so, to 2,133 miles. And it sucks. I wouldn't say for a second that it's not worth it though, I love this girl. We always have a great time when we're together, and I wouldn't trade those times for anything. Over the course of the first 2 years or so of college we got to see each other for like ~3 months at a time during the summer (usually i'd go stay with her in Chicago, since my school starts much later than hers), a few weeks at a time during the winter, and we peppered trips to see each other during fall/spring when we could afford it/had time.

Now is probably the time I should mention that while I like visiting Chicago, I would never live there. Although my GF tried to get me to move there, it's never made any financial sense to go. I can finish my degree in Computer Science here, and live with my parents without gaining massive amounts of debt right out of the gate (on the other hand she has like 100k of student loan debt). The other thing, for those who aren't familiar with the Portland area: we have a booming tech industry. Intel has around 90% of it's employees in Oregon, and there are plenty of opportunities to make good money here. 

Back to our story: around early winter last year my GF gets an interview to be an  Intern with a famous fashion photographer in NYC. She flies out for less than 24 hours, does the interview, and comes back. After waiting like 4 months, she finally finds out she got it! I'm really excited for her at this point, but I also have very mixed feelings. This means that  she's moving to NYC at some point soon. Sure enough, she's got a 3 week internship starting this January, followed by another month or so after she graduates in the spring. Her dream carrier is to be a fashion photographer, and this is a fantastic opportunity. 

So here we are, present day and she's moving to NYC at the end of this year. I still have about another year of school left (5 years instead of 4), and she's told me that if I don't move to NYC with her once I'm done with school, we're breaking up. She doesn't think she can handle it. We've been together for just shy of 5 years right now, and at that point (when I'm done with school) it will be around 6.5 with all of it being distance. So here I sit. I have literally zero reason to even consider moving to NYC, except her. I could get a better paying job with cheaper living here, my family (who I'm close with) is here, my friends are (almost) all here, and finally, I just love this place. I love everything about Oregon from the weirdly nice people walking around, to the trees and hills, and mountains and  coast. I know NYC is a lot different from Chicago, but I don't like big cities. It's noisy, people don't give a shit about you, it's dirty, crowded and claustrophobic. I know it's a huge city, and there are tons of of cool things to do, but I can't see myself ever living there. 

The last thing that my GF mentioned today, is that since we've never lived together for a really long period of time, she's worried I'll make the move only to find out it won't work. Then I would be out thousands of dollars moving across the country.

So what do you think guys and gals? She doesn't have any plans of moving here unless her carrier never takes off. We said we wouldn't let each other get in the way of our dreams, but my dream is to live here with her, my friends, and family. Her's is to live in NYC with me. Should I break it off now and get the heart-break over with? Should I wait and see if something changes?  Or should I move out to NYC when I graduate, when I know the only reason I would be there is her?

TL;DR, I'm not going to TL;DR the last 5 years of my love life. It's too important to me."

1. What do the big publications think about breaking the double blind with an arXiv upload?

2. Are the amount and volume of reviews that one gets from people reading their work on arXiv worth the risk?

3. How does one get visibility for their work? Is the situation very different if you already are a known entity in the field, vs when you are a student looking for their first publication, say?

It’s a paid position, but the wage is minimal, what it pays just about gives me enough to eat, so I work a second job to cover rent, my car, and pay off my loans. I don’t have a great deal of free time, but when I do have a few hours to myself I like to walk.

I don’t sleep very much. No more than three hours a day. I don’t even sleep at night, mostly, but in break times. An hour here, an hour there. I tried that sleep-rhythm thing, where you set up mini-naps during the day, but my schedule wouldn’t allow it, and it just felt... I don’t know, false.

Anyway, this is all a ramble. I’m sorry.

So, I like to walk. I like antiques. So one of the things I like to do when I’m in a new place (we went on holiday to Paris when I was five, my dad told me I spent half the time in old markets staring at brass ornaments and cracked porcelain statues) is to hunt for pawnbrokers, antique shops, markets and the like. I don’t collect antiques, but I do buy things. Not very often, but sometimes I get a feel for something, and I buy it, and I’m usually able to sell it again on the internet for a small profit.

It was during one of my walks that I saw *her*.

I’m not a stalker. But I did stalk her. She wasn’t what I would call beautiful, but she did stand out in a way. I can’t explain it. It was as though, for a moment as she passed me on the street, she had a glow about her. She was about my height, maybe taller in heels, heavy about the hips, a little too wide in the shoulders. She had bobbed hair, with low bangs, dark, and dark eyes and thick lips. It wasn’t lust that made me follow her, it was, if anything, an echo of that same internal mechanism that alerted me to the presence of a saleable piece. I just knew that I was meant to follow her. Not following her was impossible.

She walked with a single minded sense of purpose, her gaze fixed forward, her attention turned inward upon her own thoughts. I recognised the look, and welcomed her as a kindred soul. I followed her until she reached what I was sure was her apartment; an assumption I confirmed over the course of a week. Her building was close to where I lived, and later, when I found out what floor she was on, I realised I could just about see her front room from my bedroom window. Coincidence lay upon coincidence.

Over the months that followed, I developed a routine based around her. I found out her name, where she worked, where she shopped for groceries, the delis she frequented during her breaks, which ones she avoided. I found out she enjoyed theatre, had few close friends, and bought books about far off countries in small, out-of-the-way bookstores. I followed her into restaurants, into clothing stores, I found out where she did her laundry. I even managed to steal a few items of her clothing. Nobody noticed.

All this time I kept myself hidden. I flirted with the idea of coming clean, of one day confronting her and saying, “I’m here,” but I always held back. It was just a fantasy. In reality, I had no desire to make myself known to her. I didn’t want to *do* anything to her. I didn’t want her company or her conversation, but her presence in my life was becoming a necessity. If I couldn’t sleep before, it was impossible now without having seen her through my window, or followed her for half a block on the street. 

It was a problem. But I hit upon an idea. I would create my own version of her. I bought clothes in the same styles as she wore. I bought the perfumes that she liked. I dedicated one corner of my apartment to creating - as near as I could - a replica of her front room in my own front room. Right down to the books on the book case, the clothes strewn haphazardly on the floor. Everything would be identical. I would create a lacuna, and she would fill it.

Then, one day, a week ago, she disappeared.

2ka76b,5,2014-10-25,iOS Development Questions - Workflow and Controls,audib7777777,Unity2D,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/2ka76b/ios_development_questions_workflow_and_controls/,"Hello everyone,

I am currently developing a mobile iOS Smash Bros-like fighting game called Elderly Horses (more info here: https://www.facebook.com/elderlyhorses). I have a few questions regarding iOS Unity game development.


**1. Workflow**

I currently have the following workflow:

Unity -&gt; Build Project -&gt; Open in XCode -&gt; Run on my iPhone to test

I have a feeling this is not the most efficient way to do things. Am I right? Should I code in mouse clicks as well as touch events so I can test it in Unity itself, or should I use an iPhone simulator for testing small changes?


**2. Controls**

Using Unity 4.6's new GUI system, I seem to be limited into firing functions ""On Click()"", but this does not give me enough control regarding continuous input or button release.

My impression is that I should just code the UI on my own rather than using Unity's UI system so that I can control everything precisely? Am I right here?


**3. iOS Networking -&gt; Unity Pro / Asset Store**

Having bought one asset (Puppet2D for reverse IK Control for the characters) I feel as though I've started down a dangerous path with asset purchases. The goal of my project is to learn Unity, get better at coding, and end up with a project I can use to get a paid internship or job in the future. 

Since accessing sockets for networking is a ""Unity Pro"" feature, as far as I can tell I can't use Photon with Unity basic for iOS networking. I could buy more assets for this functionality, but I don't want to keep buying assets or start paying for Pro if I will run out of money and scrap the project anyways.

Now that I've sunk hundreds of hours into the project, and quite enjoyed the process so far, I feel like I've been ""gotcha'd"" into needing to pay up, scrap the multiplayer, or restarting and coding everything myself straight in XCode so I don't have to buy all of these add-ons and Pro versions and what not.

I must not be the only person who is or has been mid-project and feeling skeptical about the viability and affordability of using Unity as a learner. 

Any input, links, advice, etc. would be very much appreciated.

My question is, when I begin looking for a full time job upon graduation (assuming they don't offer me one) will interning at a small firm cause issues when I try moving into bigger firms?"

I was admitted to a top tier institution for computer science. I'm here because a professor at my undergrad liked me and had lots of clout and vouched for me to be here. I'm a master's student, but I have full funding doing research because my old professor convinced someone here to take me on.

**My plan**: I'm doing AI research in the aerospace sector, but I really don't care that much about it. I want to get my Masters and go work for a company doing AI. I think aerospace is interesting but I really don't have background in it and so far I'm not convinced it's an industry I want to work in.

**My advisor's plan**: She thinks I worked in my undergrad prof's lab (I never did). I never told her I did and my undergrad professor never said I did, I think she just assumed. Even though we've established I'm here for a Master's, I get the feeling she expects me to convert to a PhD. She constantly says things about ""you need to do X if you want to convert to a PhD"". 

I'm not really lying about anything, but I feel like I'm withholding my true intentions because I want someone to pay for my two years of a master's (shit's expensive, plus now I get a stipend). I'd like to find an internship over the summer, but feel that doing so makes it obvious I'm not interested in a PhD, so I'll likely stay and do research. 

So there. I feel like an ass and like I'm living a lie. "
2kaqd6,175,2014-10-25,stalked for 3 years,bearmare,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2kaqd6/stalked_for_3_years/,"This began about 4 years ago, when I was 22. Just to set the scene a little: I had recently graduated from college and was working as an intern, living with my parents in my hometown (aka the post-grad dream). A lot of people I went to high school with either never left my town or moved home after college as well.


My friend was having a party, where she invited her then boyfriend and his friend, let's call him Jim. Jim had expressed interest in me before, and I was sort of indifferent about it. I drank way too much that night, and ended up hooking up with Jim. He seemed like a nice, normal guy and, after a string of douche bags I'd dated, I thought this could end up being a good thing for me. The next morning, I gave Jim my number and we agreed that we should hang out again.


That night I was babysitting for my cousins, and due to an immense hangover I didn't plan on meeting my friends at the bar after. I got a text from Jim asking to hang out, and I let him know that I wasn't feeling well and was going to head home after I was done babysitting. He proceeded to text me about 10-15 times, asking why not, that I should just go to his house, it's not a big deal, let's hang out, etc. while I was putting the kids to sleep.


This was red flag to me so I asked him to please back off a little because I thought he was a nice guy but I don't want to feel pressured. This sparked him to continue to text me saying that he wasn't pressuring me and I should just go to his house and hang out with him. Basically I just stopped answering at this point because he was acting like a loon and I didn't want to deal with it. After a couple more days of his calls and texts, I realized that I would have to actually ask him to leave me alone. There's a line between infatuation and obsession, and after conferring with some friends (male and female) we all agreed that he crossed that line. I tried to be polite yet blunt, and told him that I wasn't interested in dating him, now or ever.


After this initial situation, he would periodically text/call/facebook message me. My hometown has a pretty active bar scene and since most people from HS were around, you basically saw the same people at the bars every night. Since we had a lot of mutual friends, I saw him pretty frequently when out at the bar but just avoided him. He would blatantly stare at me from across the bar and talk to my friends about how in love with me he was. This got me a little uneasy, but I really thought he was harmless so I learned to ignore it, assuming that he'd get over it eventually once he realized that it'd never happen.


Flash-forward to 2 years from the initial incident and things had died down a bit. I would still receive messages once every few months from Jim, but mostly him just saying ""hey"" on Facebook messages trying to engage me in conversation which I would promptly ignore. If I saw him at the bar, he'd still stare but wouldn't talk to my friends and me. I thought he was getting over everything, until one night when everything took a turn for the super creepy.


I was out with friends at our normal spot, and decided to head home early so I wouldn't have a debilitating hangover the next day. My town is relatively safe, so walking the half mile home isn't scary or dangerous. As I approached my block, I saw someone a little ways behind me but chalked it up to someone else walking home from town and they eventually turned down the block next to mine. When I got to my house I thought I saw something in the shadows along the side of my house, but didn't really look too long at it and ran inside. My mind plays tricks on me sometimes so I didn't think too much on it.


As I got ready for bed, I saw that Jim was calling me. It was 2 am at this point and I was a little buzzed and pissed that 2 years later I was still dealing with this ass clown. I picked up the phone and went off on a rant, telling him that he needed to back off and leave me alone, I'd get police involved if it came to that but he just needed to stop being a creep. He didn't say anything and I just heard heavy breathing on the other end. He quietly said ""you looked really pretty tonight"". I was freaking out a little because he was not at the bar that night, I hadn't seen him in months. I knew that I had locked the doors, and was safe inside my house. If anything I could wake up my dad, who was aware of the situation and is a BIG man that is very protective of his daughter.


I hung up and tried to figure out what to do. Before I could calm down, I received a text from Jim saying ""cellar door"". The cellar door was unlocked. I immediately woke my dad up who ran downstairs in a rage, and we heard someone running out of the basement before we could see anything. We called the police and told them the story, they went looking for Jim but didn't find him. The next day they showed up at his door and let him know that he had to keep his distance from me, showing him the texts I'd saved from over the years and saying there was enough evidence here to justify a restraining order. Again, I didn't want to take this step because I thought it was too extreme. I know it was naive of me but honestly I thought that he would listen to the police.


At first this worked. He kept his distance, I didn't hear from him for over 6 months so I thought that everything was going to be OK. From what I heard he was going to therapy and it was going well. I moved to NYC for a new job and was in a new relationship with this sexy Australian guy (win).
When I was home for Thanksgiving, I saw my friends and we went out to our favorite home town bar. It was packed, and I wasn't surprised that Jim was there. He was staring at me again and I decided to leave. This time I was going to take a cab. He followed me out of the bar and grabbed my arm and tried to kiss me. I shoved him away and asked what the fuck did he think he was doing. The bouncer at the bar came over and intervened, asking if Jim was bothering me. I'll give you guys the transcript:


Jim: (getting a really weird look) ""No you don't understand, she's my 
girlfriend. We just had a little fight.""


Bouncer: ""Oh ok, just make sure you're gentler with your lady next time"".


Me: (after momentarily being stupefied at what was happening) ""Um what the fuck. No. No that is not true. This guy has been STALKING me for he last 2 and a half years. He is not sane.""


Jim: ""She loves me too, don't worry she's just upset. Baby, come on don't talk like that. Look, you're even the background of my phone.""
Proceeds to show a photo of me crossing the street to the subway near my apartment, clearly from a distance and I obviously didn't know I was being photographed.


The bouncer seemed to understand that Jim was a nutcase. He took a step between us, and asked Jim to just go sit down while he talked to me. The bouncer said he'd get the police here.


After the police arrived, Jim was issued a retraining order and went to court mandated therapy. It turns out that he never was going to therapy before, just telling people he was so it'd get back to me. He'd apparently taken a job in the city so he could find out where I was living and ""watch"" me. This shook me to my core. I ended up moving out of state, mostly because the job I accepted was a really great opportunity and I have a lot of friends living in my new city. Jim hasn't bothered me since all of this happened, and I'm moving on with my life. Condensed, this sounds like a lot to deal with but it was all over the course of 3 years. I'm not afraid to go home again, I'm just going to be smarter and make sure he follows the terms of the restraining order.


So Jim, let's not meet. Again. Ever.



** A couple of updates from what people have said in comments:
The restraining order is at my parent's house in NY and even if I had it with me, I wouldn't post it due to privacy concerns. That's a hard nope on my part and I think it should be pretty obvious why I don't want to share it. 



Also, I unfortunately broke up with the Aussie for reasons that don't pertain to this incident. He was really great during it all, especially because we'd just started dating and could've easily been scared away by all the drama.



Lastly, thank you to everyone that is glad I'm OK and that I'm moving on from this situation! I was nervous about posting this because I didn't want to deal with people victim blaming me. I'm a very self-aware person and know that this wasn't my fault, but it would've still been upsetting if I had people telling me it was my fault because I slept with Jim in the first place. "

I have a few offers (and maybe one on the way) for internships next Summer and I am trying to figure out how to decide who to go with. I have some data on these companies but I'm not sure what data points matter and I'm hoping you'll be able to help me.


**Company A:**

* Chicago
* Pay: $$
* Rent: $$
* Connected with devs during onsite interview; Like and use the product; One of two interns in team of like 30 dev; Startup that was recently acquired by a larger company in the space.

**Company B:**

* San Francisco
* Rent: $$$
* Pay: $
* Smaller team, Small business SaaS startup in Silicon Valley; Also only a couple interns

**Company C:** (no offer yet but I should hear next week)

* San Francisco
* Rent: $$$
* Pay: $$$
* Large tech ""startup"" in the valley; Very popular product with recent successful fund raising; Consumer facing product; I've gathered it's a great culture but only from YouTube videos from the company and stuff like TechCrunch cribs.

So what's signal here and what's noise? Am I making a mistake if I go to Chicago? Will I be stuck there? Do the networking opportunities in SF outweigh working on a product I care more about?

Thanks a bunch for any and all suggestions/help!"

Took some advice from a site specifically about sys admin resumes as well ([here](http://resumetointerviews.com/2014/06/system-administrator-jobs-with-a-resume-writing-guide/), if curious).

As a side note, I did end up keeping my older job experience entries including my internship - since I've been at one job so long it looks a bit empty without it and I think it's relevant to show the length of time I've been working in IT. If you don't think that's a good idea, feel free to let me know. That's why I'm posting - for your feedback :)"
2kb75l,7,2014-10-25,"I'm feeling conflicted about something I witnessed at my field placement, and going to my supervisor makes me uncomfortable. Advice? Drop it?",presumptuous111,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/2kb75l/im_feeling_conflicted_about_something_i_witnessed/,"I intern in an in-patient psychiatric setting and I'm in my second year MSW internship. I mostly do psychosocial assessments with some groups, discharge planning, etc.

One of the patients I was assigned to do a psychosocial on is 14 and was really anxious when I talked with her. She immediately asked if I was the social worker assigned to her, which I answered no, I'm just doing the assessment. And she said ""Well I really need to talk to someone. I think I'm pregnant."" She explained what happened (consensual sex with another 14 year old) and also told me about the time frame of her last period and when she had sex. I explained to her that anytime anyone has unprotected sex there is a chance of pregnancy, but from what she told me, there is very little chance of her actually being pregnant. But I did tell her I would meet up with her main social worker and tell her she needs to meet with her urgently.

I told the social worker all of this, and she immediately bust out laughing and said ""Wooooo am I going to scare her! I'm going to scare her out of having sex for the next 20 years!"" The SW was noisy and another social worker in a neighboring office heard and said ""You should bring a book of baby names! Hahaha!"" all in all, it was extremely uncomfortable for me because I could empathize with how nervous the patient was, and I was treating this like a serious matter because she could actually be pregnant. Also, I think it is ineffective to ""scare"" people into things. I don't know if the SW really did this or not with the patient, by the way.

I wanted to talk about this with my supervisor (the pregnancy question moreso than the SW's reaction), but the problem is my supervisor is also her boss. It would be very difficult to not disclose who the SW is, as there are only 4 in the hospital, and I usually do assessments for only two of them. I also have to have my supervisor co-sign my assessments, so even if I tried to cloak who the SW was, he could just go into the notes and find out. I don't want to ""tattle"" for unprofessional behavior, but the SW's reaction make me so uncomfortable that I need to know what to do.

I have a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering Technology Graduated with a 3.6 GPA and even worked an Internship with Bombardier Aerospace my Junior year as an Engineering technician making a cool $17/Hour at the flight test center in Kansas. Yet for someone reason employers see Bombardier on my resume and its's like they say no that company is shit. I have another friend who worked a internship with Bombardier and can't get a job either and he to thinks its the fact that it's Bombardier and the fact that they are not really respected in the industry. Im starting to believe that too i mean i have some friends with no job internships and wee able to get jobs. I am desperate right now and willing to move anywhere in the United States to find a good paying job.

1.Any one else in this scenario?
2.what advice could some veteran employees give me?
3. What states are booming right now with tech jobs? Im pretty sure i am leaving NJ soon this state is dead right now

2kbckr,1,2014-10-25,"Me [26F] and SO [25 M] of 2.5 years. He owes me almost $1000 of October bills and expenses. I'm trying not to resent him, and I feel we need to change the situation.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2kbckr/me_26f_and_so_25_m_of_25_years_he_owes_me_almost/,"We had been room mates for about a year (in a residence of 3 then 4 total college students) before we started dating, so we've been living together the entirety of our relationship. We've lived as just the two of us for a little less than two years. Both graduated in June. We aren't old fashioned, gender doesn't matter, each partner pays half.

I've been better with finances than him since day one, which is fine since we were both broke college students and he always still managed to pay his portion of everything; bills, dates, groceries, etc. Except for special occasions when one of us treats the other to a date (congrats, happy birthday, I've loved you extra much lately, etc). Between June and September I offered to pay all the bills because I was making about $90 more than him a week which was about the cost of our bills. It was out of his control: he had to an internship (paid) as the last act of his degree and they capped him off at 32 hours a week, my job let me work a full 40 and frequent overtime.

At completion of his degree we moved out of our college town to a new city because holy shit, BOTH of us were done with bars filled with tweenagers, horrible landlords, and gouging rent prices. I had saved up enough money for three months worth of bare-bones living expenses on my end since we decided to move in Feb/March. He didn't save up much beyond moving costs. Whatever, not a problem until it's a problem.

We moved in September. BF found a janitor job immediately; part time, ~$925/mo income. Plus he got on food stamps, so total he contributes about ~$1050 a month. I sat on my ass for a month and took my time finding a comfortable mediocre admin job; full time, ~$2400/mo, plus it comes with a company car which is helpful since we share a car otherwise.

But I ended up paying all the bills AND rent for October so far because he hadn't gotten paid enough yet. I had a talk with him about finding a second part time job and helped him find places near our house to apply for. Which he did... after I brought it up. No call backs yet...

I'm going to stop the venting and wrap this up. We both have student debt (me 10k, him 35k) to repay, we need to buy furniture for our house, and we want to get our life moving forward. Right now, I'm in a place to do that financially. He isn't. I don't feel it's fair for me to saddle him with 50% of our shared expenses (which was the original plan) because that would be MOST of his income, leaving him with little personal funtimes money. For me it is only half. So I feel like the healthy relationship thing to do is to take on the bills again and a greater portion of the rent until he stabilizes. I plan on having this conversation with him soon, but I need to deal with an issue first.

I'm kind of mad. I'm ready to move forward. I'm an ambitious person. It irks me that I would spend money that I had planned on putting toward furnishing our home and paying off my debt toward my SO's half of the living expenses, just so he has more than $50 left at the end of the month. He goes off to buy a pair of nice interview pants and he's over budget, let alone if something happens to the car or some other surprise expense. Not to mention he has almost no spare money pay me back.

The only other option I see is to continue tallying up what he owes me, which seems like a terrible idea. He would feel terrible, and I would feel evil for having a piece of paper with a running list of ""things I did for you that you have to pay back."" That sounds like abuse.

What can I do to deal with my budding resentment? Are there financial options we haven't thought about yet?
---   
**tl;dr**: I am super-ambitious and earn twice as much as my medium-ambitious BF, but don't want keep helping him pay his half of living expenses because I want to buy furniture and pay off as much student loans as I can before they start accruing interest. But at the same know it's the right the thing to do otherwise he only has $50 left over at the end of the month. How do I work on my feelings of resentment in this situation, which I know is just a temporary patch in an otherwise FUCK YEAH relationship? Are there are other financial arrangements I haven't thought about yet?"

I got a 28 on the ACT, a 4.8 weighted GPA (as of the end of junior year), and will be graduating from the IB program. What do you think my chances are of being accepted? Should I be worried or no?

Also, I've been looking into these two degrees for a while now and still haven't been able to form a decision between choosing one over the other. My goal is to become a front end web developer/mobile app developer. I've been looking at the curriculums for both degrees and, to me, it seems like DAS is the more creative/interactive path whereas CS seems to be more technical. I know that an outstanding portfolio is more valuable and important than what degree you have, but I want to take advantage of my 4 years in college and gain as much knowledge that could potentially be useful my future career. Therefore, I'd like to talk to any current or former students of either of these two degrees, or anyone that knows any helpful information that could help me in making a decision about which major to choose. What's the biggest difference between DAS and CS? What would be better for what I want to do? Are there good internship opportunities for students of either major in the Gainesville area? If a current/former student of either major, what are your opinions about it? I'd really appreciate any responses! Thanks in advance!"

2kboyd,5,2014-10-25,"Me [28 M] with my SO [27 F] 5-years, trying to move on.",j-sap,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2kboyd/me_28_m_with_my_so_27_f_5years_trying_to_move_on/,"I want to start off saying I posted some of this before in different places so some of you may have seen it before but there are more details in this post than in any other.

So we had been dating her for over 5 years and are both in our late 20's. We ended up meeting when both of us were on vacation and she ended up moving to my state after a year of traveling back and forth to see each other. We both had crazy schedules over this summer and made the most of it by always going to events or on small trips each weekend. She worked as a bartender and was a camp counselor while she was waiting for a school job, I was taking summer classes each morning and then working afterwards. She just graduated with her masters in psychology in May and I was going into a 20 credit semester for an engineering degree. I had taken care of and supported her through her school and we had talked about how she was going to take care of me over the next year until the summer when I would get a paid internship.

So Labor Day weekend we take a trip and had a great time (she would later tell me that it was not great but a good trip) with nothing but good times and no fights. I could not believe how lucky I was and was planning on proposing (we had talked about what we would want in a wedding through the summer). I even bought her an ipad on the way home because I wanted to do something special for her. We got home early that day so she could work her bartending shift that night. Later that night she came home late, really late because she talked with someone after her shift about our relationship and broke up with me that night. I was annoyed that she stayed out so late and that she had texted me two hours earlier saying she was finishing up and still hadn't arrived home. I was more worried than upset until I found out she was just taking her time. She told me she had wanted to break up for a while but felt it would have been ""inconvenient"" for her to break up over the summer.

I was absolutely devastated and confused for the first 24 hours. Then I accidentally saw on her ipad that her text had started copying from her phone since the device was activated the previous day. Everything started to make sense. She then stayed over the person's house she had talked to and had been texting the next night and every night since. He was a regular at her bar which is where they first met and was her boss over the summer. She denied anything had happened between them but did tell me that she was attracted to him and that he was her best friend.

I also know the weekend after she broke up with me she was going to a mutual friends birthday party in another state at a casino resort. Well she asked this mutual friend if this new guy could come with them the day after we broke up but if they would not take any pictures of him or mention that he came (especially on facebook). My ex and the guy ended up sharing a hotel room together and the mutual friend called me to let me know what was going on. I ended up confronting my ex about the situation once they got back by setting up a lot of loaded questions. I could not believe how much she lied to me about the past weeks events and ended up telling her what I knew and returning the ipad. I should also mention at this time that she had seen my dad earlier in the week when she would stop by the apartment to get stuff when she knew I wasn't home in passing and the first thing she asked him is if I thought that she cheated on me. 

She wanted me to help her move out and control who I talked to (including my parents) about the break up. When I stopped bending over backwards to take care of her and help her move out she got very angry. We set a deadline for her to get her stuff out but most times we planned for her to get her stuff she would not come when she said she would because she was going out of state or to concerts (her words). When she finally did come to get her stuff I asked to not be home because it hurt too much. I was seeing a therapist at this point and he told me I had been way too nice and needed her to grow a spine; and he was right.

I had separated our belongings already and put in piles all of her stuff and had been very generous with splitting our mutual stuff to the point where over 70% of the items in the apartment were put aside for her. We had not talked a lot during this time so I out a note out explaining this and telling her that if there are other items she wanted to contact me or leave me a note and we can figure it out.

She ended up packing around half the remaining items that I did not pack and left that day with all the things that I might want and left items in our place that she knew I would not want such as her clothes, shoes, and photos before we were together.

When I got home that day I was floored at how little I had left. I called her and ended up asking her if she had seen my note and why she took everything out of the draws and packed it and left all the things that were in clear view that needed to be packed. She did see the note and said it was confusing. I asked her which part was confusing because all she had to do was contact me and she couldn't give me an answer at first and then told me she needed those things more then I needed them. 

At that point I was pissed and told her that the locks are getting changed and that I needed some of my stuff back. She started screaming back at me that she would call the cops for stealing and I started screaming back that I would call them for trespassing. After a minute of this and staring at couple lonely Tupperware containers and a sparsely populated lazy Susan I stopped my self and was in shock reflecting on the situation. I asked her how we had got to this point and she didn't have an answer. 

I ended up boxing the rest of her stuff up and putting it outside so she could pick it up (which she knew it was going to rain in two days and waited to pick up because she went on a day trip out of state because she ""earned the right to go out and have fun"") and she returned a box of some of the items to me but she still has all my grandmothers old Pyrex and a couple other items that I realize are lost forever. She told me later that week that she never wanted to hear my voice again. That really hurt but I learned from this experience that my ex had changed and was willing to lie and steal from me even though a couple weeks prior I trusted her with anything. 

After that we broke contact and I have only heard from her when she needs something. Such as a reference for an apartment which she did not get or money.

It has been almost two month now and she had not contacted any of our mutual friends again that I know of. It is sad but everyone that she connected with and knew before the summer started are now in her past. She use to post several times a day on Facebook but now post once a week and it is all impersonal or angry (she posted a quote that started with dear haters) post only to take them down later that week. This one post made me sad more than angry because it is the exact opposite of the person I grew to love.

It has been a tough time for me but I have found out how great my friends and family really are. School was really rough at first but I am pushing forward and every week my grades are going up. I have also been beating myself up in the gym each week. I have seen more gains in a month then I have the rest of the year. I have learned a lot about relationships after reflecting on what happened. I now see the signs that something was wrong in the way she acted. There were plenty of times in the past where we had talked and agreed that some of our actions needed to change. For me it was teasing her about little things. I know I was improved over the summer. She ended up getting tickets to a festival thinking it was a concert and we both were stuck in a small crowded area before the show for several hours. We decided to leave and make our own night instead. She asked me to not bring it up and that was something I never brought up to her. She was constantly putting other people before me and always had the excuse that she was a people pleaser. I can now see it got worse and worse as the relationship progressed as she would say that she would be there for me but then do the opposite. I know they were hollow words that she never actually tried and that if something came up with someone else I was dropped.  I know that when I am ready for another relationship down the road I will be a better person and a better man to whoever I connect with in the future.

It is still surreal to me that my relationship is over. There are times when I am on auto pilot thinking of calling her to only realize that she is not there anymore. Over the summer I could not have imagined my life with anyone else. I had countless women hit on me and was fine seeing them deflate when I said I had a girlfriend or that I was not interested. I have learned that some people can lie every day when they say they are people pleasers and that someone is more important to them than anyone else in the world only to hurt them more than anyone else could. There was a time that I was also sad that she is hiding from the emotions and repercussions of the break up while I have dealt with them every day. But now I know that she is lost. She is someone that can be easily manipulated and when an idea gets in her head it does not come out.  Is she being controlled by this new man or has she always felt this way? I will probably never know. All I do know is that I gave her all my love every day and was happy to build my life around her and to be with her. I thought of our relationship as till death do us part and had never been happier.  I really want to have that again even though it feels like I can never be that happy in the future. Right now I am just trying to take care of myself and better myself for the future. I don't know exactly what it will bring but I am going to make the most of it; I just have to get through each day.

So as of right now I don't know if I would take her back. I know she emotionally cheated on me but everything else she denies. Her lying cast a huge cloud of doubt over the last couple months of our relationship. Everyone says I am better off to know now but another part of me is still hurt and lonely. It is contently on my mind the second I stop hanging out with people or doing something to distract me. I think that I would never be able to trust her again and to go through this again with her would be rough.

So why am I posting this here? I just want to vent and to know what I can do to move on and feel better? I feel like I have a hole in me and I don't know how to fix it. 


tl/dr: Girlfriend of 5years breaks up with me unexpectedly and runs straight to another man. Lies through her teeth afterwards and takes my stuff.

Now, I’ve heard conflicting reports about the likelihood of Australians applying to outside internships (most cite Google as an example of a company that is supposedly flexible with taking on international interns, while others say that the whole sponsorship thing is too much of a headache for most companies).

2kcc5j,4,2014-10-25,CMV: I have no sympathy for most college graduates who complain that they can't find jobs,beachtowngirl,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2kcc5j/cmv_i_have_no_sympathy_for_most_college_graduates/,"I feel like it’s hard to get a job in today’s market, and it's especially harder to find the “right” job. Nevertheless, there are precautions you can take to set yourself up for success. I believe that many college graduates who aren't finding full time positions either aren't putting in enough effort, or aren't putting in the right type of effort. 

As a senior who is graduating in the spring, these are the steps I’ve taken to secure a job for myself:

1. Taken several resume and cover letter workshops.

2. Sent out over 100 resumes in my fields of interest.

3. Attended a couple career fairs and sent dozens of follow-up emails.

4. Updated my LinkedIn profile and connected with professionals in my field of interest.

As a result, I've attained three separate internships for this semester, next semester, and the semester after I graduate, all while nannying to support myself financially. Additionally, I have a few exciting interviews lined up for “real” full time positions. Consequently, I have a job offer from the company I'm interning at, but want to keep my options open.

I've worked hard throughout college, but don't consider myself to be particularly exceptional. I'm only getting positive results because I’m pushing hard every single day to get what I want. Therefore, when I hear friends from my university who are just as qualified as me complain about their lack of prospects, I can't help but feel like they brought it upon themselves. For example:

1. One friend complains about having to move back in with her parents after graduation, but hasn’t sent out ANY resumes for ANY jobs. She could be saving money for the next eight months for an apartment, but instead has given up before the fight has even begun. (Note: her parents are fully supporting her financially, so she easily could be working and saving money.)

2. Another friend who just graduated is depressed about having to move in with his grandparents and not finding work. He said he sent ""fifteen"" resumes and “should've found something by now.” Um... fifteen resumes? Fifteen isn't nearly enough. He's perfectly qualified, but he just isn't trying. 

My friends are smart, talented, and from a great university. However, I can't help but feel many college students expect a job to just drop into their laps. I have no sympathy for students who aren't finding jobs. My solution? WORK HARDER, and if that isn't working for you, then WORK SMARTER. All of my friends who have done this have obtained positions at great companies.

That being said, I realize that finding work can be really difficult and I don't like being judgmental. Change my view?

I am definitely most interested in doing backend development, as I am intersted in algorithm and optimization. Here are my options:

**Company A:**

Startup that is well funded and growing fast. I would be doing full stack web development. The team seems smart and the product is pretty legit. The team right now has around 10 engineers.

My fear in taking company A is that I would only have startup experience going into my job search, and I don't really want to limit myself to only going to startups because I am not sure that's the lifestyle I want. I would get more hands on experience here I think, and I would get to work on back end stuff.

**Company B**


Large, well-known company where I would be doing front-end stuff. It would be a great looking internship on my resume and the work seems very interesting as far as front end engineering goes.

My fear in taking company B would be that I would then end up as a front end developer in my first job. I am not sure how much career mobility I would have if I decide that front end development is not for me. However I think this would be a better company for me to work for from a lifestyle standpoint and from a financial standpoint.

2kci3b,1,2014-10-26,Diagnosed during childhood (ADHD-PI) in US. On Adderall for 3 years. Parents took me off (didn't think it was an issue). Now at university in UK and think ADHD is causing problems.,EwanB,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2kci3b/diagnosed_during_childhood_adhdpi_in_us_on/,"Warning: Wall of text. I'd be grateful if you read it as there's a lot of background but there is a TL;DR.

I spent 8 years in the US as a kid (2-10), and at 7 was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, and spent 3 years on Adderall. My parents are Brits and this was during a lot of controversy over ADHD being overdiagnosed, so they were pretty skeptical. They eventually had me go through a full neuropsychological evaluation with a doctor well-known locally for rejecting bad ADHD diagnoses. He confirmed that the diagnosis was good and I was a good case for medication. However, I was also on another drug for a childhood seizure disorder at the time and it was a possibility that the seizure disorder was related to my ADHD symptoms. My parents decided that they didn't like the idea of my being on Adderall (British parents think American kids are overmedicated), and thought it might just be related to my seizure disorder, so they took me off.

I'm now 23 and at a top university in the UK. I recently had some problems including not getting a graduate job offer after an internship, partially due to lack of attention to detail, and having to take a year out of university because I couldn't focus on studying for finals. Instead I spent 2 months during revision period hyperfocusing on various TV series. I would sit down with my notes to study and would find myself thinking about a series non-stop, and honestly found it hard to focus on anything else until I had finished the series. I never had this issue before, achieving in the top 20% of students at my university, but the idea of spending months doing nothing but revising old material for exams was just something I couldn't seem to get to grips with. I did maybe a few hours work total during this time, most of it organising my revision notes.

I had completely forgotten my ADHD diagnosis and my being medicated as a child, and only found out about this again a few days ago. I found out because I looked up ADHD, thought I fit the symptoms for ADHD-PI and told my parents I was planning to get tested.

I've looked through the previous threads on this sub on getting diagnosed and treated by the NHS, especially those pertaining to adult ADHD. But I had a few questions that weren't answered and would be interested to get some information, if anyone has had a vaguely similar experience.

Firstly, I saw some people had trouble with GPs rejecting that ADHD was an issue because they were at university. It seems like my childhood diagnosis (which I have documentation for) should help with this but does anyone have other tips for managing this? Apart from switching GPs if they continue to reject it out of hand, which I intend to do.

Secondly, my university counselling service has a psychiatrist on staff, and I wondered whether going to see them and getting a note saying I should see a specialist would be useful when approaching my GP?

Thirdly, I don't have much in the way of academic records apart from grades from high school, and these are top percentile good. They don't show that my teachers regularly called me out on being inattentive, putting very little effort in when I wasn't interested, and regularly daydreaming and falling asleep in class when I wasn't interested. Provided I have a childhood diagnosis, would it still be valuable to contact former teachers for written input? I feel like my grades may screw up people's perception without background, but it'd be a lot of effort to get background.

Finally, any other advice about managing the process? I am in a position to go private if necessary, but I'd prefer to avoid it if possible and I'd like to know how to make the NHS route as painless and quick as I can (knowing that quick and painless rarely describes the NHS on mental illness).

**TL;DR 23 year old British student at university in the UK, got childhood diagnosis for ADHD in the US and was on Adderall for 3 years before my parents took me off (British parents think American kids are overmedicated), now having problems which I think are at least partially caused by ADHD. Any advice for the process of getting tested and potentially medicated by the NHS? I have read previous threads on the subject and looking for anything missing that might relate specifically to my situation of having a childhood diagnosis and previously being medicated.**"

2kctev,5,2014-10-26,"After Being on Opiates for 2 Years, I took Suboxone for 1 Year. I am 11 Days Clean Today. Nobody Told Me How Marvelous it Would Feel.",[deleted],opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2kctev/after_being_on_opiates_for_2_years_i_took/,"Backstory:

Started with small amounts of alcohol at 14, cigarettes at 16, heavier drinking at 17, marijuana at the end of high school, and well, by the time I reached college, it felt good to try something new.

Half of a 5mg hydrocodone. More weed and alchohol. Percocet? Sure. Mushrooms. I am real. LSD. This is real. Oxycodone. Who needs Percocet? Morphine. I am soldier. Oxycontin? This is dope. Wash it down with some more alcohol. Opana? With a touch of happiness. DMT, Whip Its, Dilaudid, and eventually heroin.

Where did it go wrong? A million places. To try to pick one is just naive at this point. A small part of it started at birth, in my opinion, and built upon itself until I ended up where I did. Peer pressure, bad decisions, self-loathe, boredom... I don't think the list will be finished for a while. There's still many problems to identify.

As this continues, I feel like I'm faking my way through everything. No one knows who I really am or what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing.

Go to college at 18. Lose all scholarships by second semester. Almost drop out. With support (family and friends), I kept myself in school and managed a mediocre GPA. I also worked, but mainly to support my rent and bad habits. I finished Penn State with an Economics degree, but it didn't feel like me by that point. At that point, there was no one drug I was addicted to. However, I had become addicted to not being sober.

Finish school. No internships. I'm in no condition to get a job. Guess I have to get my MBA.

Car accident October 2012. My neck. Fuck... Nevermind, my neck feels better... Shit, my back... hurts terribly. ""You've fractured your L2 and L3 vertebrae"". Shit. I know I shouldn't take the... I feel better immediately.

Every month, 90 white pills, marked with my favorite V, 7.5mg of happiness. Or what I thought was happiness. Many people are oblivious to the future at this point. I knew what was coming, I just felt ""too good"" to care. The truth is, I didn't feel anything.

10 months go by. The few days where I tried to stop, I only felt 10x worse than I did before the medication. I couldn't stop. More pills every day. 3 at most. 4. 5. ""I need more pills."" ""You have to wait another week."" Fuck... and so I hit the streets.

It got worse every month. Started 2 days short. Then 4. Eventually I was going through all my pills in 2 weeks and picking up opiates or suboxone for the other 2.

Finish my MBA with 3.9 GPA. As proud as I am, I was not the only one to finish with a 3.9. The pills did too. We had become one. If I remembered to take my pills on time, I was ""untouchable"". Up by 7am in a decent mood and ready to rock. Oh yeah, and 80k student debt.

But as clear as everything looked, it was blurrier than ever. I had lost one, or more, of my senses. I had lost my touch, my ability to feel, and was quickly reflected through my actions.

Emotions were gone. I could see the reason so easily, but I couldn't empathize, sympathize, truly care. I wasn't aware how bad the situation was, but I knew I felt trapped and I wanted to get out.

I moved to Philadelphia in August 2013 for a job. I took my last script and was ready for it to be over. Last pill. This shouldn't be too bad. HOLY FUCK WHAT IS HAPPENING?

Now, had I been shooting H with my buddies, they would have warned me about the withdrawals, and tried to keep it flowing. But my doctors weren't as close and they failed to mention the 10-month opiate withdrawal.

It was terrible. Puking, shitting, sweating, freezing. But the worst part was that I knew the ONLY thing I wanted was another pill. I can't do this. I have work tomorrow. ""Doctor?"" ""Yes?"" ""I need help.""

That was the day the suboxone started. Now, I hope most of you are privileged enough to find a doctor that cares and listens. I don't include ""afford"" in that list, because I have found most areas have a nearby doctor/facility that is willing to help opiate patients for cheaper (but I do remember constantly thinking about how I couldn't afford one). 

I would go to the doctor every 2 weeks. I, a 25 year old white financial advisor, was in the heart of Philadelphia sitting in an office full of junkies. The only thing I was sure to hear when I went to the doctor's was ""fine, if I can't get it here I'll just go pay for it out there."" Sad stuff.

1 year. I kept my job. I relied on suboxone. I often even forgot to take it at night and struggled to wake up in the morning, but still knew how addicted to it I was. It was the first time I was addicted to something I could forget about, but I would only forget so long... 12 hours... until I didn't feel well. More suboxone.

Every doctor told me something different. There were 4 ""qualified"" suboxone doctors on sight. The first one told me to aim for ""a year or less"". Than ""several years'. I was excited when the third said ""2-4 months"", but the last one me ""forever"". He said, and I will never forget, ""most people go back to opiates so it might be best to stay on it for the rest of your life.""

I wish I had come to reddit... had seeked help. I had the opportunity, I just didn't take it. I falsely felt as strong as I felt weak. It's normal. Don't feel like you're the only one. Most of us got here because we don't like to seek help. It's okay.

It finally all collapsed. Every day I was less happy and cared less. A month ago, I happily left my job and felt free, like I could finally deal with the real issues.

In the ideal world, I go right to the doctor with my plans. I didn't. I waited 2 weeks before I ran out of Suboxone and just didn't go back to the doctor. I wanted to quit, but truthfully, the fact that I had to sit in a waiting room of junkies to get 20 films is what brought it all together. It's amazing how the human brain can be affected by chemicals.

Day 1: Don't feel great.

Day 2: Starting to feel tired and sick. I hope this is gone by tomorrow.

Day 3: I'm fucking sick. Woke up puking. About to get hemorrhoids from the shit. Sneezing (I never sneeze). Can't move. Everything hurts.

Day 4: Little less physically sick, but even less energy. Starting to breathe worse.

Day 5: No energy at all. Didn't leave bed/couch. Starting to cough. Nose very runny. When will this end?

Day 6: Finally went outside. Exercise, as much as you fear it, helps. You don't have to go to the gym right now. But can you drop and give me 5? 10? Do it. Good job.

Day 7: Still sick, but doesn't feel like the flu anymore. The tears flow. I can feel. I never write. But writing felt good. I wrote this the moment I felt like I could truly feel.

""I start writing this on the day that I finally start to feel again. It hurts more than one could ever imagine, like losing both your body and mind at the same time, but still feels almost more euphoric than its predecessors.

To feel again, it sends streams down my face. To see color. To be hot. Cold. To hear music. To care. To truly care. It is something that can only be understood by those who have lost their senses.

How does one get to this point? There is no defining cause and every individual takes a different path, but there is only one ruthless result.

It's funny how those things that seemed so simple as a child, so easy to digest and understand, end up eating at you, day after day, and you fail to ever realize that you are the mouse and the giver, and with that authority, you will never refuse a cookie.""

Day 8: Nose still runny. Little energy. Coughing is the only thing that has got worse. But, holy shit, does music sound good. All those bands I used to enjoy... I've turned off the TV. Turned off the Xbox. I am sitting in my living room in the dark, 2 candles lit, listening to (what used to be) my favorite albums. It reminds me of the first time I ever took MDMA. But better.

Days 9-11: A lot of the same. Nose STILL Runny. Energy SLOWLY coming back. This is the most I've ever felt. So much crying, but happy crying. I'm happy. I forgot what happiness was. I've confused numbness for happiness that last 3 years. I think this is the happiest I've ever been in my life. My only fear is I will forget how good it feels to be sober (I never thought I would fucking say that).

I will update soon. PLEASE, PM me. It's so hard to reach out. You feel like no one cares. Like the hole you dug has left you in darkness which will never let you see light again. I feared it for 3 years. It took me one week to be happier than I've ever been. Please, I beg, speak. Your family, your friends, a doctor, a psychologist, Narcotics Anonymous, me. I could list 10 more sources if you don't like any of those.

And whatever you do, don't feel inferior. In the 3 years I had this problem, I never took the time to look up the solution (mainly because I didn't want to deal with it.) But if you're sick of it, the time is here. I look forward to hearing from you. Cry. Smile. Laugh. Just try to remember what it's like to feel. Remember those happy times you had as a sober child and do not lie to yourself and think that those emotions can't be re-hashed. If there was one thing I was sure of when I was high, it was that being sober is equivalent to the devil. That's because when you're always on drugs, you confuse coming down with being sober. Give it a week for me."

A few months ago I got a girlfriend (yay :)!). But she has psychological problems. I'm going to outline them here, keeping it short but relevant.

I noticed light scars on her arm, thought they were old. I found a double-edge blade on her bathroom sink. Later we talked about her personal issues, I suspect that she have been abused by her father.

She also admitted that her mom is an alcoholic (my own mom went to rehab a year ago).

I told her that she can tell me anything, and I will do everything I can to help her. But she once told her closest guy-friend, and he just thought it was made up and they never spoke again, which is why she doesn't trust me (and she told me).

Later we wanted to have sex. After 3 tries (different days) we found out that it isn't possible - she says it hurts, and we stop after 10 seconds (of me only going 3 cm in).

She went to the doctor, was told that it is normal with abused girls. She then got a time for psychologist, but the first meeting is next month.

---

Her mood have gotten a lot better since the start of our relationship but my worries are:  

- I don't want her to hurt herself. Sometimes I see her go into ""depressive mode"" where she thinks everyone is against her, and hates her. Can I just tell her?
- I'm not pushing for the sex (my drive is a bit above normal), but anyone who has experience of how long it will take before we can have it?
- Right now we are keeping it to oral sex (once evey 2-3 weeks), but I'm still worried that we shouldn't do it, because it still affects her. How would I know?

Something else - She is an international student in my country, doesn't speak the language, and has problems with finding a job and an internship. This doesn't help her mood sometimes.

Can you give me some advice, and/or subreddits that I can seek it in?"

I never reported him because to be honest I didn't think it was my place to. If he cheats knowing the consequence, and he still does, you know power to him. I am just bummed that after a 100+ applications, 3 interviews, countless emails asking people in the industry I came up with Zero for an internship over the summer.

One thing I have always been proud of, is everything I turned in or took was on my own merit. Countless nights studying, hours working on homework, I did it on my own or with my study group. 

But the other guy, who does nothing, I found received 3 different offers for internships.  He has a pretty decent GPA, because of his abilities. And companies went after it. I am so upset and depressed that I didn't get anything. I am a petroleum engineering major, and most of our recruitment takes place in the fall. I know a lot of engineers in my place that don't have a single internship.

I graduate December 13th.

* I have no debt, car is payed for and I paid for school as I went (tuition was like $3500 a semester), and I have never had a credit card.

* Between savings and checking I have $6000.

* I had a time consuming internship this semester and had to give up my part time job to do so. My internship ends on Halloween and have an interview tomorrow for a 27 hours a week job(possibly full time once I am done with school!. The guy called me about the job so I think I have a good shot at getting it.

*If I do get the job I will apply for a credit card to start building credit history.
* This might be irrelevant to this topic but I have close to $70,000 dollars in Schwab IRA.

* The reason I need to buy a house: my Dad's business is probably going to go belly up in the near future. Through horrible decisions on his part my parents are responsible for so much debt it is cringeworthy. So when things go south the bank will be taking everything.

* in my area I can get a house a 2000+ sq foot house and an acre of land for a montage payment around $450. I could probably persuade my brother (junior in college) to be my roommate and help pay the mortgage.

* I have always abhorred the idea of getting an apartment because you are not building equity.

* And now for the part where some of you might scoff at me, I have 2 large Alaskan Malamute dogs and they need a yard. I am a firm believer if you have a pet you are obligated to it for its life. If worse comes worse I have found a Malamute rescue I can take them to, but if that happens I am pretty sure part of my soul will be crushed in the process. My original goal was to live with my parents for a year after graduation and save, but that isn't in the cards.

I graduated college in May and within a few weeks i scored a paid internship. My internship is going to end on Halloween and I don't have any backups for jobs so I've been pumping out applications since September. I moved to a new city with two of my sisters for this internship, my two sisters are attending graduate school and get reimbursement checks, and i can't help pay rent until i get a full time/decent job so they cover for me. My mom liked/agreed to the plan until a few days ago where she told me they shouldn't be covering for me.

Student loans are going to start soon so if i pay for that and for rent i'll be broke in 2 months which makes me wonder why she had liked the idea of my sisters covering for me before but not now. If I had known I'd be dealing with all this stuff i wouldn't have moved.

I haven't made any friends in this city and I moved in June. People keep telling me that what i did at my internship, grant proposal research and writing, will help me score a job but i can't find one to save my life.

I live with my parents, and my boyfriend is not my son's dad. I'm 24, a student (one more year, thank goodness!) And I'm reaching 5 yrs with my employer this Wednesday. It's retail, so not the best hours or pay but it's helped me all these years and they work with my school schedule.  

Usually my boss schedules me a few morning hours during the week so I can be home by the time my son gets out of school. This last week in particular though, I've closed every day I worked. And the day off I had during the week, I was in school until 8pm. Let me also add that my bitchin' babysitter/ friend picked up an internship this fall quarter so she hasn't been available to babysit my son and god have I felt it!! 

So, Wednesday night. I had picked up my boyfriend to stay at my house for a couple of days so he could watch my son. He has been unemployed for about 4 months now, and has been watching my son more often and I'm very grateful. So, I left my son and boyfriend a note of ""instructions"", typical stuff : do homework, work on project, shower 8:30, bed 9:30. Every day usual stuff. 


On this particular night, Wednesday, I'm extremely stressed. My son had not been completing his homework all week with other people. I, myself, had a research article to complete after I got out of work, that was to be turned in 9am sharp the next morning. I had all this in my mind. So, I get home at around 10:45pm and MY SON HAD BARELY JUMPED IN THE SHOWER! I pulled him out of there and told him to go straight to bed, but not before I lectured him a whole bunch about his recent behavior and taking advantage of the fact that I'm not around to make sure his responsibilities are getting done even though it's not a new concept to him. That he knew better than to play video games all day when he hadn't even opened his backpack to look at homework. He started crying and telling me he was sorry, I took away his Wii, unplugged tbe cable from his t.v., and kissed him goodnight. 

Then I turn to my boyfriend and basically, What the hell!? He said that he told him over and over that he should be doing homework but wasn't and he wasn't going to be fighting with him to do it. So, of course, with that lax attitude ANY kid will take advantage and do whatever they want! I told him, my son is 7 years old! He still needs authority figues to IMPLEMENT rules because he is still a very small child! He just kind of shrugged and said, Well I don't want to put up with him whining, and he knew what he had to do. !/! $@#@$@$@$@/!!!!! 


Next, I walk out of the room to grab something from the garage and my mother, having heard the lecture I gave my son, has the AUDACITY to tell me...""You barely see him and all you ever do is make him cry!"" OH.MY.GOD! I snapped right at her and said DON'T EVEN START THIS! You're right! I'm working and the days I don't I go to school! I put my trust in you guys to help me out with him. And when I come home at almost 11, and my son is barely going into the shower WITH 4 VERY CAPABLE ADULTS IN THIS DAMN HOUSE NOT SAYING A SINGLE WORD TO HIM! OF COURSE I HAVE TO BE THE BAD GUY! No one tells him to do homework,  no one tells him to shower,  no one tells him to do anything, KNOWING he has a schedule to follow! So yeah, someone needs to do it! And unfortunately, it has to be his mother who he sees for about 20min a day!....She said nothing. 


Fast forward to Friday, my boyfriend said he wouldn't mind staying to watch my son again but I told him no thanks that my friend is home and I'm taking him there. He said that he's already there at my house, why am I going to be rushing to drop him and my son off at 2 different locations 1 hour before I go into work, and also pay someone. Being a little hurt still from everything, I said, because maybe now soupyy-poopjr. will actually get his homework done and someone will actually be supervising and interacting with him instead of just being on their phone the whole time. It was harsh, and I apologized after but he just shrugged. 


Then yesterday. Usually my parents watch my son on the weekends while I work but my friend insisted on having him over to work on his project that's due soon (God bless her soul). My son happened to mention that he was leaving to her house and my mom asked me why, that they were going to be home. I said, Because she is taking the initiative to help me out a little, knowing that I have a busy schedule and is making sure that he succeeds in school. Her expression dropped and just said, Well, if that's how you feel. And that was that. 


I didn't purposely want to hurt their feelings but they make me feel horrible about not having time for my son when the only reason is because I'm doing something good! It's not like I'm out partying or going out, I'm literally booked with school and work. It is even coming up in my dreams how much this is bothering me. I mentioned it to my b/f and he said, Well maybe it's your conscious saying you're guilty for not being around. Gee thanks, that was help. I feel like gathering them all up and asking them all, Okay, then decide for me which one to drop, school or my job? To make things easier for everyone and now no one will have to be burdened with babysitting for me. 

I do feel guilty not just for my lack of time but because he is my son and no one else's responsibility. I suppose it's not fair that I ask them to do these things for me. So I just feel stuck because beggars can't be choosers but my son behaves horribly when he is babysat by them and I'm the one who has to come home and straighten things out, THEN I get called the bad guy! I just want to curl up and cry.

My local university offers a [BA in Computer Science](http://www.umt.edu/catalog/colleges-and-schools/humanities-and-sciences/computer-science/bs-professional/default.php), but the coursework seems focused on programming and math. My local community college offers an [AAS in Information Technology](http://www.umt.edu/catalog/colleges-and-schools/missoula-college/applied-computing-and-electronics/aas-network-management/default.php) with a Network Management option and the classes seem more aligned with what I'd like to do and need to know. The community college is half the cost of the university and I can power through everything in two years, whereas with the university I'm certain I'll have to take a lot of extra math and science that I didn't need before. I'm looking at probably 3 years easily, maybe 4, even though my degree is from the same school.

I know I could just get some certifications and try to break into IT, but I think school provides opportunities through networking and internships that will be worthwhile when I graduate and look for work. Our county unemployment rate is 3.5% and entry-level openings are rare, so it's hard for me to compete with all the actual IT/CS grads in the area.

My question is this: Is it worth saving $10,000+ and getting the AAS? I don't want to end up getting screwed 10 years down the road because I only have an AAS. I'm not going back to school *again*."
2kdy74,1,2014-10-26,"Me-26[M] w/23's [F]. I need to vent/ask for some advice. Am I over reacting? If so/not, then how do I have a constructive conversation?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2kdy74/me26m_w23s_f_i_need_to_ventask_for_some_advice_am/,"Hey guys, I apologize for the massive amount of text, but I feel like I need to give a flushed out story so that people can understand my concerns fully, and advise on the proper course of action. 

We've been dating for almost 5 years next month. It started out as an online relationship, and just last December we've decided to move in together since she had to move across the country for grad school, and I wasn't doing anything that important that I couldn't do over where she was moving to. 

Bear with me, I'm trying to set up the dynamics of the relationship fully so that whoever is reading can understand my viewpoints and possibly hers as well.  However, if you're not interested in the back story, go ahead and skip to where I sectioned off the more current events and where the issues start to arise. 

The relationship started off pretty casual since we had initially started as good friends and talking a lot. We had known each other for a year, and we had gotten close.

I would certainly say that for beginning and most of our relationship, she would be the one who would be more invested in the relationship. 

I appreciated having my own space, and at times would not want to make the two+ hour drive to her place. Instead I would want to stay home and relax and try to save some money. But more often than not, I would be driving on down since I felt bad, and did enjoy my time with her. 

For a while, we drifted further apart due to internships and study abroad programs.  I promised that I was going to try to visit her in France, but I couldn't. I was making shit for money at my job, and needed to straighten out my citizenship/financial situation which at the time was a lot of money. However, I didn't have the courage to tell her. I guess I thought that if I was going to disappoint her, i'd rather do it once she was situated in France, and not during the initial period of her studying abroad. I stopped talking to her as often as we did because I felt so guilty and talking to her reminded me of how depressing the whole thing was. But during that time I should have been there for her. 

When she came back though, I did my best to be more invested in the relationship. However, she had gotten to be a little bit more independent, as to be expected. She was hanging out with friends a lot, and that's fine. She's always been more social than I was. However, there were times where I'd be arriving at her place at 11 and she'd have a party going on. I would put on a smile and do my best to get through it because I just wanted to spend some quality alone time with her. I guess I also felt jealous about how much time she was spending with her male friends too and tried to awkwardly ask her to tell me where she was, and what she was doing, but she kind of dismissed it with ""Okay mom."" I decided that I could trust her, even if it made me uneasy. 

Now this past year, she graduated, and got into a Ph.D program across the country. I decided to follow her because i'm not doing anything amazing where I was living at the time, and I also have a sister who lived in the area my GF was going to be in. 


For the first few months things were going alright. She was hanging out with a group of girls that were also grad students one of which was like her mentor, but they were into partying hardcore, and both me and my girlfriend were laid back, so it wasn't the best fit. 

My GF tried her best to make friends, because she craves a large social dynamic. We always joked about how she had self multiplying groups, because things would always start off small but get a lot larger due to the fact that she'd be constantly inviting others. However she was having difficulty making friends here for whatever reason. I specifically remember one time when we went to go see a movie with some first year students. While we were the last ones to order our snacks, the rest of the group just...walked off into the movie theater. 


Only one guy stayed behind. I'll call him..M.



The movie theater was packed, so finding seats would be difficult. The other guys managed to get a line of seats in the middle section, but that had left me and my GF to get seats off to the side. On the walk home, GF cried because she felt like she had been excluded. I don't think that the other people were trying to exclude her, but they definitely weren't going out of their way to make everyone feel included. 

I tried to console her but personally did not care since I've always been one to have a small knit group of close friends. As long as there was one person to hang out with, I was fine. But GF being the social person she was, really suffered. 

As time went on she became closer friends with M. He had a group of friends that she liked hanging out with. Their group dynamics were much more in sync with how she was. They were smart, funny, and relaxed. That's great, she had friends to hang out with. 
__________________________________________________________

However, problems started to arise. 

For her birthday, we were not really able to do anything due to the fact that my job had not started yet, and I had no money from moving across country. She was paying for everything at that point, and I felt terrible. I was doing whatever I could at home to make life easier for her, but there wasn't much I could do aside from cook and clean. 

For Valentines day, I had finished training, and had planned on grabbing dinner with her. However, she had invited M and his friends to do so as well...remember what i said about self multiplying groups? They were unable to make it for the actual dinner portion, so I was secretly happy, however, they made it in time for drinks afterwards. We ended up sitting outside and getting drinks. After a while, the group decided that they would head back to one of their places and hang out. She texted me asking me if I was okay with that or if I wanted to do something else instead. Normally I would say i'd be okay with  hanging out, but it was Valentines day. I decided to be selfish and text her that I wanted to do something else. We went to another bar to get drinks, but during the whole time she appeared mopey, and would give short answers. I tried my best to ignore this, and display a positive attitude to liven up the mood, but it didn't work. On the walk home, she said that it wasn't so much the people, but rather she wanted to hang out. 

Nothing really major happened for a few months until late June/early July. I did notice that she would be talking on Facebook Messenger a lot more often, and later into the night though. There were times where i'd wake up in bed, and she'd still be on her computer typing away at 2 am. Before that she would throw on a documentary or X-Files and we'd go to bed. However, she's always been a night owl, and I know relationships change, so I decided not to read too much into it, but it still made me uneasy. Every time I would glance at her computer screen, she would tab away, but I could see that more often than not ""L has messaged you"" displayed in the tab.  She mentioned that she needed this time to destress because a major exam was coming up soon. This was a major test to see if she is good enough to continue her PH.D research, but the date of the test wouldn't be until October... 

That's also when we began to search for a new place. I didn't know before moving here, but this area's housing situation is a buyer's market. You need credit reports, bank statements, proof of income, excellent reference, and a God's blessing on your side in order to get a place over every other qualified individual. However, these are things I found out after the process. 

GF has always been one to worry about things, and this housing issue was a major stressor. She would bust her ass applying for places, and I would just fill out the application. I had work, and so did she, but she worked in the same town, so she handled all of the appointments, and applications. I should have put in more work, and I would have had I known how competitive the housing market was here.

We applied for various apartments, but never got any call backs. I want to say it was this time that she became really distant. Understandably so. It was a stressful time, and she's never been a cuddly type of person when she gets too stressed. We didn't have a placed lined up despite applying to numerous places, and had to be moved out of our current place by August.

While on the porch of one of the places we were looking at, waiting for the landlord to meet with us, I peered at her phone over her shoulder. She was looking up in Portugese in Google Translate on how to say:

""I like you a lot"". Whoa. What? 

I didn't know how to handle it. I chose to pretend I didn't see it, and she quickly put away her phone. Why is she looking up how to say that? M was teaching her Portugese, but she's always had a affinity for learning languages, so that had to be the reason. Right? 

The appointment went well, and it seemed like we had built a good rapport with the landlord, but a week later we got our credit report back...I had bad credit, and GF had no credit. That's the reason why we haven't been getting places. Not only was the area super competitive for housing, but we were hardly ideal candidates.    

I felt horrible. Here GF was, busting her ass, while i've been dragging the chances of us getting a place down. I decided to tell her to find a place on her own, and i'll figure out what to do for a living arrangement by myself. She refused to give up on me, and said she'd try for another week. 

I scoured Cragislist; and eventually we ended up getting a place with roomates. 

However, things continued to be a bit cold between us. She was still staying up late talking to M, and not spending as much time with me. 

During this whole time i didn't really address the issue. I had hoped that it would be a phase and work itself out, but i didn't see things getting better. I decided to to talk to her. At first she was dismissive and saying things like ""I don't know..."" but then she started to cry. She had felt bad for making me feel so bad for so long. I asked if she and M had a thing going on, and she denied it. She joked that it was nice to think that someone else would be into her like that. She also did not know what to do. She could stop talking to M, but he was one of her few friends here, and she got along with him so well. Everyone else was just an acquaintance. I couldn't make her do that. She also addressed on how she felt like she's changed a lot since we first met, and how she felt like I needed more friends in the area and not to latch on to her so much. I said i'd try to make friends, but as I've said, I've never been one to really need a large group of people to hang out with. I personally don't feel like i ask her to do too much. We don't really share any meals together except for a crockpot dinner on Sundays, and we might watch something in bed before we go to bed. It could be due to the fact that if i'm not at work, i'm home. So we ended the talk by me trusting her to make good choices, and for a day or two after that, she was super sweet, and not talking on Facebook as much.

However, soon after that, she had to house sit for a friend in the city over, right after we had moved into our new place. I didn't see as much of her as I would like, but I made an effort to see her every weekend and some week days. However I noticed that she was back to talking to M pretty regularly, but the difference is now that when i'm next to her, she just doesn't talk on facebook messenger anymore. She just tabs out until I leaves, and as soon as I away, I can hear her clacking away on the keyboard, but I do see the tab with facebook open, and then usually within several mins, I see the Facebook text change to ""M has messaged you"". 

When she came back from house sitting, it was like nothing really changed. Our kisses were merely pecks now. She wouldn't want to cuddle as much anymore. 

Over the past few weeks, i've noticed that she's been coming home later and later, and her excuse is that she's been studying late for her major exam, but...she's come home smelling like M. 

Now maybe she could be studying at his place. He is smart, and she does do well in group study sessions. But it's the fact that she doesn't tell me about whenever she's hanging out with M. It's like she goes out of her way to hide the fact that she has been hanging out with M. I'll ask her what she did, and she'll mention on oh how she went to work, then did some extra curricular activities, and then got dinner with those people, and while all this is happening, i'm  hugging her and smelling M's scent where as in the past, i wouldn't. 

She's also stopped inviting me to things as well. She'll say ""I'm grabbing food with ___ people"" but not invite me. This is particularly concerning considering her propensity to invite people to events in the past. Why wouldn't she invite me? 

She had just recently taken that major exam that i've been talking about, and I took off work during the day to be with her. During the time, she was constantly texting on her phone. Who was she texting? I'm sure it was a mix of people. However, I brought this up because later in the day, I went home to do some paperwork, because she was going to M's talk later that day. I told her to text me afterwards to let me know what's going on, and that maybe i'll grab dinner with them. She kept saying ""Maybe."" and earlier in the day she had implied that she wouldn't be coming home that night, and she might be partying it up in the city with her mentor friend. It's not unusual for people who pass their exam to celebrate all day, and drink profusely. Why was she saying maybe? It's like she didn't want me around that night. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt, and wait it out. 5 o'clock comes around, which is when the talk should be done. Nothing. 6 o'clock comes around. Still nothing. 7 comes around, and then she tells me and her mentor friend that she's grabbing dinner with ""labmates"". She doesn't invite us. 

Normally I would let this off, since I don't want to be the spouse who intrudes on group activities, but this her her qualifying exam. Why the fuck shouldn't I be there to celebrate with her? I ask if it would be weird if i came. She said ""I don't know. I'm drink"", implying she's too drunk. What? Not like i've never seen her drunk in the past. I then mention that, and then she starts talking about how we should get a sushi dinner tomorrow, just the two of us. I start giving her passive aggressive (Okay. Sure.) responses because i'm pissed and didn't know what else to say. She then replies that I can meet up with them now if I want. I ask what she is doing afterwards, and she says ""Probably home"" and that she wants to ""Cuddle"". This puts me immediately at ease, and I tell her that i'll finish work, and pick her up when she's done so I can spend time with her. She mentions on how one of her other labmate shows up and is buying her a drink, and that's the last time I hear back from her that night.  

Around 10 or 11, her mentor friend asks me if she's made it back okay. I tell her friend that I haven't heard back from her. Her friend encourages me to go ahead and message people to make sure she's okay. I again, normally don't do so, but she's been drinking for a while now. So I do so. I first try to message her lab mate that had showed up, to no response, and I then message M and his group of friends on the chance that her ""lab mates"" included them, and not just her immediate lab members. Sure enough several of them mention that they had last seen GF at the place with M and a few other guys, and try to put me at ease by mentioning that they're probably staying at a friend's place to crash for the night, and not passed out in the street. It's now 2 AM and i have work the next day, so i decide to go to bed. I wake up at 4:30 to GF coming home. The story is that they had gone to her lab afterwards to drink some more, and then to one of M's friend's houses to crash. M then  had gotten my message, and woke her up, and drove her home. 

Now, the day after, it's like nothing has changed. I had hoped that things would be different after the qualifying exam, and that she would be more affectionate or want to do something with me, but everything is exactly the same. 
__________________________________________________________

So now, r/relationship. After typing out this giant story of my whole relationship, what the fuck should I do? I know that I do want to have a talk with her and address these issues, but I want to do so in a constructive way. I get the feeling that she's bored of the relationship but hasn't broken it off because I haven't done anything bad enough to warrant braking off a 5 year relationship that I drove across the country for. Do you think this could be salvaged? I'm not sure counseling is a possibility...what else could we do?


tl;dr-GF is distant now. I feel like she's bored, and her new friend is more fun.  I don't want her to distance her from her friend, but at the same time, I feel like they have priority over me. I want to have a constructive talk. What should I do?

First off, thank you for taking the time to read this. I'll try to be short. 

Background: I'm from Phoenix, AZ. So I may be unaware of what may be considered common sense in regards to driving in the rain and driving on a road that is inlaid with metal tracks for public transportation (Portland street car in my case). I've been in Eugene, OR for 4.5 years so I know to how to drive in the rain, just not when I'm forced to share a lane with public transportation tracks. 

Incident: It was raining. I was driving on a road that had metal tracks for the Portland street car in my lane. The road was slightly downhill and curved left ~90degrees. I was coming to a stop at a red light. As I came to a stop, my tires came into contact with the tracks and I lost control of my vehicle. My foot was already riding the brake, so I began pumping my brakes (I don't have ABS). I slid down the track about 7 feet and instead of curving with the track, my vehicle continued straight and slammed into the curb. 

I'm an alert driver and my vehicle has been functioning perfectly. There is no doubt in my mind that the accident would not have happened if you removed the tracks or if there had been a sign warning me of how slippery they get. 

Damages: My vehicle may be totaled, it suffered frame damage.  I will know tomorrow, but the first mechanic told me it'd be about 50/50 chance they could fix it. KBB on the vehicle is $1700 and I was told I could probably get around 700-800 for scrap since it still runs. If it can be repaired I was told it would be a few hundred dollars. 

My neck and back have felt very stiff since the collision, but I have not seen a doctor as of yet. 

I am working as an intern while I pursue my Masters degree. Not having a vehicle would likely force me to quit the position. 

Question: Is the city of Portland legally liable for anything here? How should I proceed?"
2keag7,3,2014-10-26,"Me [20 M] with my GF [20 F] 3+ years, feeling forgotten",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2keag7/me_20_m_with_my_gf_20_f_3_years_feeling_forgotten/,"Pretty long background of my relationship, so I will try to be quick to summarize. 

Started dating this girl in High School, I just lost my father to complications during surgery. Began to not really care about those around me, as I knew I would just be let down at some point. Dated this girl not expecting things to be serious, I made it clear I was not looking for love, I didn't believe in it etc.. We have had hiccups along the way, a couple silly breakups (2 I think to be exact). I was never good at expressing myself so I don't always tell her what I feel which is a big issue.

Fast Forward to College. We live in same dorm, I found new friends, she didn't fit in as easily. Always wanted to spend time with me as she was somewhat alone, I was usually busy. Second year, same story, different living location, I lived with 4 friends, she lived with her dorm roommate. She got a job so she had less time to spend with me, but she still asked to hang out more times than I said yes.

This new school year has been the issue. She moved in with 9 other women, who are all single and very active socially. I am now living with 1 friend. I also got a wonderful internship at a tech start-up which is my dream. 

The problem is now I am completely worthless to her. She has become so much like her roommates, and become so different than the girl that made me feel alive again. I brought this up to her, and a massive fight ensued. The one time I choose to express my feelings the conversation blows back up in my face. She said things like 'Why are you jealous that I now have friends?' and 'I just act different around my friends than I do around you.'. I get that, I'm sure I act different around my friends, but to me this means that she is most herself around her friends. 

So it has me thinking that if she is the true her around others, and has to modify her personality when she is around me, then it is a bad relationship. I have tried ignoring the issue, and moving on, but her changes keep punching me right in the gut. Even in the bedroom she is doing new things, and acting differently, no doubt due to things her friends have said or told her. 

I feel worthless, I feel forgotten and betrayed. And if I try to express all of this to her it will not end in a positive way. I understand that she expects me to be an emotionless drone, but deep down I am inexplicably hurting. I genuinely have no clue what to do, or where to go from here.

I keep telling myself this can only last a year, her roommates all graduate in the spring and she thinks we are going to live together next year, but I have no idea what this next year is going to be like.

I hope someone else has some insight on this situation, as I am at a complete loss for what direction to go. 

tldr: GF got new roommates, has become more and more distant and uncaring towards me. Don't know how to handle it."
2kefil,9,2014-10-26,I am writing a letter to my parents and the church to explain my change in beliefs and would appreciate some feedback.,salap,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/2kefil/i_am_writing_a_letter_to_my_parents_and_the/,"To whom it may concern,

I can honestly say that I began this year of service at the church with the best of intentions and a desire to serve the God that I not only believed in, but loved with all of my heart. I was sacrificing a year of my life to follow a path that I saw as not only beneficial for my walk with Jesus, but most importantly something that I believed he had called me to do. However I can no longer continue this internship under the guise of claiming to still hold a belief that the Bible is the inherent word of God, and that Jesus is the son of God. From this statement I am not implying that I have any plans of leaving on my own account due to this, but that I feel compelled to inform you of this decision rather than to continue as though my views have not changed.

I write this letter for no other reason than to have an opportunity to articulate my thoughts and present them in such a manner that I can be confident of my position being heard. My goal is in no way to convince you of my opinion, but to simply inform you of it. I understand that what I have to say will be in stark contrast to your own world view. Please do not take anything that I write as a personal attack as it is definitely not intended as such. I truly do appreciate those in the church who have always had my best interests at heart and I hold a great deal of respect for. However it is important to me in every aspect of my life, that I explore the reasons for why I believe what I do, and that I can back these claims up when confronted. I did not go looking for a reason not to believe, but rather the contrary. I was adamant about my beliefs and saw research as a means to back them up. My initial pursuit was to fulfill my obligation to provide a reason for the hope that I have. (1 Peter 3:15) However in my search for answers I found the ground to be  forever shakier. This led me to question whether I was able to back up my faith to others and whether my beliefs were actually justifiable.

Please do not think that my decision has been made lightly in any way. This has quite possibly been the biggest decision that I have made in my life and I have put a lot of thought into it. I have researched from both perspectives and made my decision based on my personal conclusion from this research. 
I have always had little things throughout the bible that I was never 100% sure about why it happened or why it was included in the text. A majority of these would be in the Old Testament (Slavery, stoning kids, rape, bears to kill kids etc.). These were points that I had heard before but I did not allow them to shake my faith for two reasons. The first being that I never paid a huge amount of attention to them and the second being that I believed there had to be a reason or justification that I was yet to find. This was because I had already made up my mind that this book was perfect and God breathed before I had even questioned it from a neutral perspective.  So rather than question these events I blindly dismissed them, as I ‘knew’ with all of my heart that God was just and merciful so there had to be an explanation.  

This decision did not just happen over night, over a week or even a month. It has been an ongoing dilemma, I can not pinpoint my decision to a certain place in time but can now confidently say that I no longer consider myself a christian. My entire life I had held these slight uncertainties but they were never a big issue. During this year however, as I learnt more about the bible the list of questions grew rather than shrunk. It was when I delayed my bible studies (due to a family member being terminally ill) after completing the first semester that I began looking into these questions in search for answers. With time that I had previously used to complete my study now free, I decided to do my own personal studies on areas of scripture that I wanted to learn more about. This lead me to the Gospels. I started reading Matthew and I found that the details in stories relating to Jesus were different to those that I remember. This caused me to read the other gospels to see whether I was getting confused or my memory of what the Gospels said was wrong. I found that on comparison the gospels contradicted on their accounts of what happened and what was said many times. 

This was a large issue for me because if the bible is the word of God then it should be perfect, without fault. If they disagree upon even minor details, I believe that should call into question the claim that this is the word of God. If we believe the scriptures are divinely inspired, we must also believe them to be internally coherent. The gospels are by no means the only aspect of the bible to make contradictions or make false claims but I mention it purely because it was where I first noticed this taking place. 

If the Bible contradicts itself (which happens throughout the new and old testament) then how can we claim it to be completely true. If a source fails to agree on minor details (these contradictions are not always minor) then should we not at least seek evidence or question its accuracy when it makes major claims? A book that contradicts itself does not point toward a perfect all knowing creator but rather men who wrote it. The Bible is subjected to the same linguistic and cultural barriers as any other historical literary source. If this book was indeed written by a divine, all knowing, all powerful God then why would that be the case? Some brush this off as being human error that took place while this book was being written down by authors who were divinely inspired. This allows the claim of the bible to still ultimately be Gods word and that the information is still God's word even if errors exist in the details. Personally I struggle to brush it off that easily for two reasons. If God took such effort to preserve the underlying meaning then why not preserve the spelling, facts and coherence, which would substantially improve its reliability as a whole. Secondly, if we can say that changes have been made then how can we guarantee that the meaning has not been changed, let alone study the true meaning of a text down to the individual words. This is exacerbated when we find that we don't hold any original manuscripts and the copies that we do hold contain a great deal of variation. The only way that we come to the conclusion that this book is true is if we hold the view that we can trust the bible, and then trust it when it states that it itself is true. 



The Bible is not the only holy book to claim that it is the word of God and christians are not the only religious group to claim miracles, experiences and a relationship with their God. So how do we claim to be the only ones who are correct, when the others claim the exact same thing. I am by no means implying that other religions are correct, but rather questioning how we can back up our claims. I struggle to accept personal experiences as proof, my own included. This is due to the numerous claims that are made by others about their own religion or way of thinking. Muslims adamantly believe that their god is real, so much so that they are willing to die for it. Even today we could interview a group of people who claim to have seen the virgin Mary who appeared to them and spoke with them, to others who claim to have been abducted by aliens. Now please do not take this as me being derogatory by mentioning these groups alongside christianity. I was hesitant to include this as a point, as my intention is not to be disrespectful in any way but rather to point out that claims need to be substantiated before being accepted as truth. Iit is not strong enough evidence to claim that miracles have been performed in the name of Jesus or that the Holy Spirit moved without providing adequate evidence to back it up. Christianity is not the sole religion to make these claims. People from all kinds of religions claim to have seen miracles performed in the name of their one true God. What makes christianity different? What proof is there for either side to claim that they are right while the others are disillusioned? I struggle to see any way of backing it up. In the Old Testament the Bible laid down the criteria for proving that a ""god"" is real. And the criteria is very simple: The ""god"" in question has to prove its existence through demonstrable actions in our world in an open setting. The reason that Ahab's people were supposed to believe in God rather than Baal is because, on command, God proved his existence. Baal, being imaginary, did nothing. The fact that Baal did nothing proves that he is imaginary. Should we not accept the same standards today?

Another issue I have is with morality and its continuation throughout time. I realise that we now claim to be under grace rather than the law, so we no longer have to live under the law of the Old Testament. However, surely morality should stay constant? God is unchanging - And he dictates what is morally acceptable. So if something is morally acceptable in the Old Testament then should it not be morally acceptable now? For example, Slavery was condoned and detailed in the old testament, but no-one would seek to justify that now. In a situation of rape, the victim is forced to marry their aggressor and it is treated as a property crime. These make sense in the culture of the day, but shouldn’t God’s morality be perfect and unchanging? 

What it seems to come down to is interpretation. We cannot take the Bible literally and we often claim scriptures to be purely symbolic (gouging of eyes etc.). These scriptures never ask to not be taken literally, it is up to the interpretation of the reader to make this decision. However this interpretation is subject to change as our perspective as a person is inherently subject to change throughout time. We now look at some scripture to obviously be symbolic due to information that we now hold that would otherwise refute these claims. Throughout history however, this information was not readily available if known at all. An example of such a case is creation (I grew up taking it as a literal description, but that's an entirely different discussion altogether). All of our current evidence for how life exists and how it began points to a different answer entirely. Today it is common for christians to accept a symbolic view of creation and the garden of eden, however throughout history this would have been heresy. As there was no evidence to argue against this account it was accepted as the literal word of God, and why would they think otherwise? It was the physical evidence that caused a change in interpretation. This shows that we are willing to bend its meaning to fit what we agree upon, rather than it being backed up by our new discoveries of how our world works. Which is what was expected. If God wrote this book then why would he allow for such confusion to ensnare its interpretation?

Now this letter has already surpassed the length that I initially would have anticipated so I don't want to go on for too much longer and this will be my final point. Creation is an interesting issue, as how we explain away the need for the tree to be present in the garden and ultimately the opportunity for us to sin, with the idea that God  wanted us to have free will. However, we can see in other passages of scripture that he will quickly put aside our free will to bring himself glory (Pharaoh in Exodus 4:12, 7:3 etc.). 

Now consider the idea of the garden of eden itself. If you had a two year old child, then there's a pretty good chance that they don't fully understand right and wrong yet. That's a pretty good comparison for Adam and Eve, being as they hadn't yet eaten from the tree of knowledge.
Now, as a responsible parent, you tell the kid not to touch the stove, which is on. You tell them that touching it will burn them, and it will hurt. You step out to make a call, and leave the stove on. This is a fair comparison for leaving the tree in the garden unattended.
Enter me. I'll be the serpent in this one. I go to your child, and tell them that touching the stove won't actually hurt. You were mistaken. I say to touch the stove. You know what the kid does? They touch the stove. They are inclined to believe me.
You know what you do when your kid burns themselves? You bandage them. You kiss their boo-boo. You explain that there are people out there who you mustn't believe, and tell them to learn from the experience.
However you don't kick them out. You don't cut off their college fund, or subject them to the horrors of working in the adult world. You don't curse them.
You yell at me. I'm the one responsible for your child's injuries, not the child.

These are some of the fundamental issues that I have with the christian belief system and what ultimately has lead to me to reject it. I say these things to you with the utmost of respect and humility. When I say these things I am not claiming to know the answers to life, but merely state that I no longer see the Bible and christian worldview as holding sufficient evidence to back up the large claims that it makes. This is not due to any offense or bad feelings towards the church or any of its congregation, but to a personal search for answers. I am comfortable that my search was conducted in such a way to look at the evidence from as close to a neutral viewpoint as I could get. This required me to ask the question of whether the bible was true rather than automatically accepting it as fact from the onset. A system that discourages exploration of ideas contrary to those of itself, is a system that I struggle to see eye to eye. Surely a book written by a divine being should be able to stand up to criticism and be backed up by evidence in the world around us. Why would god require us to believe in something with not only a lack of tangible evidence, but also overwhelming evidence describing the contrary.

Finally I would like to thank you for reading this letter and hearing my position on these matters and I apologise for its considerable length. I understand that from your perspective what I am saying is inherently wrong, and that you may make sense of what I am doing by believing that I am being deceived. However it is important to me that I get to share with you my thoughts on what I believe to be true, and  what I don’t. I sincerely hope that this letter has come across in a manner that represents my motives. I do not mean to upset anyone but to be completely honest with what I believe, and I saw writing this letter as the best way of doing so.

Your sincerely,

2keftq,0,2014-10-26,Looking For Advice to Settle My Nerves (Recommended Guatemala July 2015),kimbalto,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/2keftq/looking_for_advice_to_settle_my_nerves/,"I am a 22 year old college student in my final year. I applied to the Peace Corps on September 28th, and received word that I'd been tentatively placed under consideration for a position in Guatemala on October 16th. The email told me the position I was being considered for started on July 14th, 2015. 


 I guess I'm just looking to get a more pragmatic perspective on what my realistic chances are with these heightened numbers of applications. That being said, I'm just going to put all my cards on the table here and hope that someone with an understanding of the topic comes across it. 


I study Philosophy and Mandarin at Grand Valley State University in Western Michigan. (Grand Rapids area). I carry a 3.25 gpa with grades coming together this semester that'll bump that up a couple points. I write for the school newspaper and was heavily involved with the backpacking club for a time. 


These aren't my major points though. I've spent about a year's worth of my life overseas studying and working in Asia. I did two study abroads, 3 months in China and 5 in India, and recently returned to India to spend another 5 months working an internship with a study abroad provider while simultaneously gaining credits toward graduation. We coordinated the first ever semester long study abroad to the state of Kerala. We were featured in 'The Hindu' Newspaper and interviewed on Asianet News. We also connected with an NGO in Nepal and spent 2 weeks working in Himalayan villages; an excursion which I independently organized for myself and 4 other students on the program. 


At home I've volunteered and interned for humanitarian organizations for years. I volunteered twice a week at a homeless shelter for a year, and interned for the West Michigan Refugee Education and Cultural center for about 8 months. (5 of those were spent volunteering, 3 interning.). I've also worked as a camp counselor, a lifeguard, and a personal counselor for developmentally disabled children. 


Currently I work at a 6 person group home as a direct care worker. The job took 3 months of paid training to qualify for, and today I feed, bathe, medicate, exercise, and generally oversee all aspects of their daily lives whenever I'm working. I typically get about 20 - 30 hours a week. 


Between school and work though I haven't had much time for renewed volunteer projects. I was working with a private refugee tutoring network called THRIVE for about 4 - 5 months right after I'd gotten home from my most recent trip to India in May of this year, but recently had to discontinue my work with them to make room for the quickly accumulating responsibilities of my life back home. 


As for the future before service, in the winter I'm registered for the Community Working Classics Program, a class that enrolls students as assistant teachers in the prison system. Students assist professors in teaching classics and philosophy courses to inmates serving under a variety of sentences. I'm also currently enrolled in private Spanish tutoring and plan to take intermediate level Spanish courses in the Winter along with Mandarin. 


While I know it may seem like I've gathered a number of experiences, I can't help but worry. I've read people taking Peace Corps Prep and applying from Ivy League Schools. My upbringings are a tad more humble than all that, and I can't say I've accumulated the institutional backing that I see a lot of people talking about recently. 


Still, I've always tried to live a life that catered to the base values of sincerity and human connection. When someone recommended that I apply to the Peace Corps, I was sort of humbled. The idea seemed so grand and monumental that it was just a pipe-dream, something meant for other people with more experiences and connections. I kept the peace corps sticker on the back of my laptop over the next 4 years, and today I've finally come to a point in my life where a distant speculation begins to seem possible. 


Please, if there's anyone out there that's been through the process or understands how it operates, please contact me. I'm eager to gain a more in-depth understanding of what's happening behind the scenes, especially since the Peace Corps went under its radical changes. 


Thank you to all those that read this. I appreciate all the help I can get.

However, I found a lot of ways to improve the process in the lab I work in. So I proposed an overhaul of our infrastructure. I have set up several services, such as an email server, a gerrit server, and several others. I have also introduced configuration management to our process and migrated our VMs into a private cloud that I built. I am now planning and soon to be setting up a Ceph storage cluster.

I have been both designing an implementing our new infrastructure. I have also had people helping implement plans I designed. I am looking for a title that more accurately reflects this. I am thinking of changing my title to 'Infrastructure Architecture Intern'. Would that be more apt, or is there a better title for what I have been doing?"

I have always been in love with your cozy campus culture and the allure of the Information Technology program offered. I want to ask anyone involved in the IT program about it's quality. Even if you are a Computer Science Major, I'd love t hear your answer as you are the majority.  How difficult do you find the classes? How relatable are the teachers? Are there many opportunities in the area for computer internships and preferably work?

Additionally I have questions about housing, I am over 21 so I'd like feedback from people who are in the same position. As far as I understand students like me re placed in the Town Center, correct?
Does anyone live off campus? If you do how hard was it to find an apartment, how affordable was it? I have a roommate in mind, my girlfriend, however I don't know what the rules and guidelines are for student housing so I thought I would explore my options. If anyone can help me to answer any of these questions I would greatly appreciate it.

2keo9c,8,2014-10-26,I am writing a letter to my parents and the church to explain my change in beliefs and would appreciate some feedback. [x-post from /r/exchristian],salap,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2keo9c/i_am_writing_a_letter_to_my_parents_and_the/,"To whom it may concern,

I can honestly say that I began this year of service at the church with the best of intentions and a desire to serve the God that I not only believed in, but loved with all of my heart. I was sacrificing a year of my life to follow a path that I saw as not only beneficial for my walk with Jesus, but most importantly something that I believed he had called me to do. However I can no longer continue this internship under the guise of claiming to still hold a belief that the Bible is the inherent word of God, and that Jesus is the son of God. From this statement I am not implying that I have any plans of leaving on my own account due to this, but that I feel compelled to inform you of this decision rather than to continue as though my views have not changed.

I write this letter for no other reason than to have an opportunity to articulate my thoughts and present them in such a manner that I can be confident of my position being heard. My goal is in no way to convince you of my opinion, but to simply inform you of it. I understand that what I have to say will be in stark contrast to your own world view. Please do not take anything that I write as a personal attack as it is definitely not intended as such. I truly do appreciate those in the church who have always had my best interests at heart and I hold a great deal of respect for. However it is important to me in every aspect of my life, that I explore the reasons for why I believe what I do, and that I can back these claims up when confronted. I did not go looking for a reason not to believe, but rather the contrary. I was adamant about my beliefs and saw research as a means to back them up. My initial pursuit was to fulfill my obligation to provide a reason for the hope that I have. (1 Peter 3:15) However in my search for answers I found the ground to be forever shakier. This led me to question whether I was able to back up my faith to others and whether my beliefs were actually justifiable.

Please do not think that my decision has been made lightly in any way. This has quite possibly been the biggest decision that I have made in my life and I have put a lot of thought into it. I have researched from both perspectives and made my decision based on my personal conclusion from this research. I have always had little things throughout the bible that I was never 100% sure about why it happened or why it was included in the text. A majority of these would be in the Old Testament (Slavery, stoning kids, rape, bears to kill kids etc.). These were points that I had heard before but I did not allow them to shake my faith for two reasons. The first being that I never paid a huge amount of attention to them and the second being that I believed there had to be a reason or justification that I was yet to find. This was because I had already made up my mind that this book was perfect and God breathed before I had even questioned it from a neutral perspective. So rather than question these events I blindly dismissed them, as I ‘knew’ with all of my heart that God was just and merciful so there had to be an explanation.

This decision did not just happen over night, over a week or even a month. It has been an ongoing dilemma, I can not pinpoint my decision to a certain place in time but can now confidently say that I no longer consider myself a christian. My entire life I had held these slight uncertainties but they were never a big issue. During this year however, as I learnt more about the bible the list of questions grew rather than shrunk. It was when I delayed my bible studies (due to a family member being terminally ill) after completing the first semester that I began looking into these questions in search for answers. With time that I had previously used to complete my study now free, I decided to do my own personal studies on areas of scripture that I wanted to learn more about. This lead me to the Gospels. I started reading Matthew and I found that the details in stories relating to Jesus were different to those that I remember. This caused me to read the other gospels to see whether I was getting confused or my memory of what the Gospels said was wrong. I found that on comparison the gospels contradicted on their accounts of what happened and what was said many times.

This was a large issue for me because if the bible is the word of God then it should be perfect, without fault. If they disagree upon even minor details, I believe that should call into question the claim that this is the word of God. If we believe the scriptures are divinely inspired, we must also believe them to be internally coherent. The gospels are by no means the only aspect of the bible to make contradictions or make false claims but I mention it purely because it was where I first noticed this taking place.

Some brush this off as being human error that took place while this book was being written down by authors who were divinely inspired.

My whole life I overachieved to get what I wanted and still do so today.

Growing up though, the main driver was me leaving my parents place, i know, typical. Never took intrests in what I did, and when they did, none of it was really good enough or noteworthy rather. That coupled with them fighting, silent dinners for most of my life, and them fighting me on everything, made it huge motivator for me to leace.

But before that I took a forced gap year because of things I just couldnt control (FASFA issues since im an immigrant). It was a huge ego check for me first of all, but it also crushed the thing that drove my life for most of my teen years. It was like getting something youve always wanted, giving it to you, then putting it on a glass display and telling you to come back in a year.

So now we're here. Where I feel detached from everything. I do research here, im a TA, I have great grades, and a solid list of internships so my time is busy, but I dont feel attached to everything.

I should add i got to school in NYC and I know that has something to do with it, but I know its not normal.

I have gone from someone that can talk to anyone, anytime, to always feeling out of place and just uncomfortable. 

I've been to the school health center here and thats the reason for the back story, just stuff she pointed to as relevant to explain whats happening now.

So what now? How do I get out of this discomfort?

2kf1r0,49,2014-10-26,PSA: Navigator Ltd.,cranmuff,toronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/2kf1r0/psa_navigator_ltd/,"Everyone is in a tizzy about the Jian Ghomeshi story today, so I thought I'd post my opinion and some facts about the firm he hired to manage his PR crisis, namely Navigator Ltd.

I recall two ocassions when someone hiring Navigator Ltd. was in the news:

1. After the road rage incident between Darcy Allen Sheppard and Michael Bryant escalated to the point where Sheppard was hanging off the side of Bryant's car, as Bryant sped through Yorkville, leading to Sheppard's death.
2. When Adam Giambrone had his liason on the couch with the intern, ending his mayoral aspirations in 2010.

Both situations were morally murky and we don't need to rehash opinions of who was in the wrong in either case. That's not what I'm getting at here.

But the ""PSA"" aspect here is that in both cases Navigator took a very aggressive media stance of blaming the other party, (which we've already seen with the ""jilted girlfriend"" comment), and (in my opinion) a social media campaign of uncertainty / doubt and support of their client.

So as this story unfolds, please keep the history of this PR firm in question: credibility smearing is expected and I suspect that a lot of victim blaming comments will appear here and on all the local blogs. They are really good at what they do, which is steer public opinion in favour of their clients."

Can somebody please talk some sense into me? I don't want you to necessarily lie to me and tell me everything will be okay if it's not, but I need a voice of reason right now.

I got an internship with a big company. I was so excited when I heard about the offer, but I found out that the company will be drug testing me before I start work.

I am not a frequent drug user, but I did smoke weed a couple of weeks ago and I took an Adderall the weekend before that. And on top of that, a couple of months ago I did MDMA (not good for my anxiety, would not recommend).  I'm terrified that rather than doing the simple urine/blood screening, which I would pass with flying colors, they will test my hair follicles.  

If I fail the drug test I will have to tell my parents, my friends at school, and my faculty advisors.  Everyone will be so disappointed in me.  They are all so proud of me for securing this internship, and I don't want to let them down.

All weekend I've been researching hair follicle drug testing.  Some say there are ways to strip your hair and rid it of the chemicals, but the methods aren't foolproof.  Others say that the drug tests aren't good at detecting one-time use of drugs (which mine were).  I don't know whether I should turn down the offer for the best internship I could have ever hope for, or take the drug test and risk making a fool of myself in front of my employers, family, and friends.  

The test isn't for another month, so I have all this time to ruminate and continue panicking.  I don't know how I'm going to deal with daily life with this on my mind."

I made a throwaway since the information in this post with the information on my real account could make it very easy to identify me.

So we've known each other our entire lives. Our parents were best friends in college, which meant we always had family events together. I don't know if it's just in my mind, but for the past 2 years, we've had this weird tension whenever we're around each other that isn't really there when I'm interacting with the daughters of other family friends who're the same age. I didn't act on it because she was in high school and I was really stressing out in college with grades and internships. Now that we're (slightly) older, I want to.

My family usually has thanksgiving dinner at their home and I'm thinking about asking her out then. However, I know she's going to be in my life for a long time since a lot of the things I do with my family also involve her family. **I also don't know if she thinks of me as an older brother or if she's actually attracted to me.**

What I'm worried about though is that we're at different stages of our lives (I just graduated college 5 months ago and am working as an investment banker in San Francsisco and she's a freshman at Stanford) and if it ends horribly, it's not like I can avoid her. I don't really want to wait until she graduates college to ask her out, but I don't really know how to approach this. What would you guys do?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Really appreciate it.

TL;DR

-Family friend is a freshman in college and I just graduate college

-She acts differently around me compared to other people

-Don't know if she sees me as older brother or if she's attracted to me

-Want to ask her out this thanksgiving when our family's are together (obviously, in private)

-Don't know how to approach it since she's always going to be around since our families are so close"
2kfcoy,10,2014-10-26,Low GPA sophomore with 2 successful entrepreneurial projects,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2kfcoy/low_gpa_sophomore_with_2_successful/,"Hi. I am a CS major at a good state school, one of the better state schools for CS. I am thinking about internships this coming summer as I should begin applying during the winter. 

I have a low gpa, about 2.6, as of the end of Spring 14 semester. I had high hopes of improving that this semester with a 4.0 semester, but that is appearing to be very unlikely. I am taking what is commonly known as the weed out course here and finding it difficult along with another class. I think I could manage a 3.0. I may be able to do better but I am trying to be realistic - I probably can't improve my overall GPA a whole lot this semester.

Here are the more redeeming aspects of my resume:

* Built a website 4 years ago that I have maintained ever since. Received over 10M impressions and grossed ~$40k in advertising revenue so far. Worked with advertisers and sometimes hired content writers. Top in its niche.

* Started a technology repair business this semester where I repair phones/computers out of my dorm room. Should reach $10k revenue by the time I apply.

* A few assorted projects/webapps. One of them got some neat press from Mashable/CNET/some other places.

* Did an internship at a startup the summer before my senior year of HS. Mostly through knowing people though.

Here's what I would like to go for. Ideally, I want to get an internship this summer in NYC or in California. Would my GPA hurt me that much? I guess the bottom line is that I am not the best academic student but I have a really great work ethic when I'm actually excited about something so I would be very productive if I was given the chance to work on something cool. I think I'm a creative thinker and tend to have a lot of ideas that impress people. I  Lots of people, when they get to know me, are blown away by some of  I'd love to say my list is Google/SpaceX/Facebook/Apple/Amazon/NASA but I fear my GPA might disqualify me from all of those. Looking further down the road, I fear that I might do better on the managerial side of things although I tend to be very technical which is why I began pursuing CS.

Would really appreciate some insight and advice. Thanks!"

2kfsqz,1,2014-10-27,Horrible Bosses - Unpaid wages in Ca,kitkat218,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2kfsqz/horrible_bosses_unpaid_wages_in_ca/,"TLDR: My bosses never paid me.

So this is my first real reddit post. And it is mostly because I'm extremely anxious for going to the Department of Labor in a few days. I'm so sorry if this is long.

I was hired as an intern at a place for college credit. I needed 80 hours of interning to graduate. And I was not allowed to be paid for these hours. I met a really awesome store owner who said they wanted a marketing / graphic design intern to get the place sales. So I got hired as an intern. 
She was not the only owner of the place, she was just the ""face"" the other owner, her ""silent"" partner, handled ALL the financials. Including paying the other owner, merchandising etc. I did my 80 hours of internship. And it was a horrible experience, and not worth being called an intern. I was a free unpaid sales associate, and the few times there were an opportunity for me to learn or gain marketing experience I was not allowed to go. And forced to be the only person in the place.

After my internship hours were completed, with both bosses aware as they were signing papers, I thought I could go back to finishing my final semester of college. Then my female boss called saying the only other employee they had quit and that they could afford to pay me if I could please help them out. So I did. And I worked up until my college graduation day, which they knew about. They both also knew that I was moving to a different state a few days after my graduation. So I went to the place several times to be paid and they would not cut me a check. I have text message records of the female boss saying she'll pay me tomorrow, or she did not bring her check book today...etc etc etc.

Well I had to move with out getting my check. And then I grew a pair and decided to call and say that if you do not write me a check within 7 days I'm going to file a small claim against you.  So she writes me a check. I get the check finally happy, and then it bounces, and costs me more money. He put a stop on it. 
I then find out that he has gone behind her back and written her out of the original LLC on the company and started a new LLC with only his name. So she advises me to file with the Department of Labor, which she is also doing.
Fast forward, She had her conference last week. She called me after saying that he brought in SEVERAL lawyers to intimidate her, and that he is claiming she and I committed fraud together to claim me as an intern to get a tax break and then she paid me under the table. No such thing happened.

To help myself defend: I have my bank statements showing no deposits during the time I was interning and working there. All of the exchanges between the female boss, asking for her to pay me/ general work day information to prove that I was in fact an employee. And 2 separate declarations from her saying that she never paid me under the table, as well as an overview of what happened between her and him.
My main questions are: Am I going to look wrong because I never was given/ filed out a I-9 or a W-4? How in the heck do I prove I didn't commit fraud? And am I going to be steamrolled even though I did nothing wrong?

Thank you so much in advance."
2kfuga,1,2014-10-27,First Time Seeking Help,JoeFabooche,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2kfuga/first_time_seeking_help/,"So this is my first topic here. I do not really know what to say because I generally do not talk about myself and my own issues. I prefer to help others. I have been depressed for years. I am a 21 year old male in his last year of post-secondary. I loath what I am studying but it is where I ended up and it's the last year of my degree. I loathe the people in my classes. I honestly tried. I have two friends there but they are just ""friends"". One only talks to me when he needs something and is a user. Will cover his own ass and help himself but when you need it, nowhere to be found. The second is probably who I consider my best friend right now though I know I am not his. We only see each other on campus because we both live 2 hours away. And that's it. It just stops there. I would do anything for this friend but I don't feel I get the same back and I am not demanding. This person will always go their own way and not listen to my opinion. 

I did an internship this summer at a law firm. I enjoyed it but I felt like my boss thought I was an idiot. I am slow to pick up on things but once I do, I can manage. It brings me down every day because I start to replay stupid shit I did and stupid shit I said. I mean, the guy asked me to make a photocopy of some forms one day because the day he was making them he ran out of fresh paper and used, used paper with something on the back of it. What did I do? I photocopied both sides. I just go into this sort of mode, I mentally check out and I start to ""panic"". I don't realize the simplest things and make the stupidest little mistakes because of it. I even tune out sometimes and I certainly do not mean to. He was pretty good about it, told me he guesses he didn't explain it well, explained again and this time stupid me did it right. I just get so nervous that I do not think. I thought he was asking me to make copies of it not make NEW copies because one side is used.

Anyway, internship ended in September. A lot of people in my program stayed on at their internships....I did not. They said they would keep in touch. They are a new firm and thus do not really need staff right now until they build a client base. I told them I'd be more than happy to help out any time they need me to as I finish my degree. They said we can ""keep in contact"". But I honestly doubt I will be hearing from them again. I was nothing special nor did I impress anyone. That just brings me down so much. 

I am 21 years old and I have gotten nowhere. Still live at home. No job at the moment. No car at the moment. Feel like an idiot. 

Background info: have been depressed since as long as I can remember. Told dad when I was 15. Dad told me I have nothing to be depressed about, etc, etc. He has no idea what it took for me to open up to him like that. My family does not talk, we do not talk about feelings, we do not acknowledge that depression is ""real"". It is just seen as being lazy, etc. Since then and various teasing I simply do not open up to people. I am losing touch with what little friends still remain. They are giving up on me. Giving up on trying to coax me out. To socialize with me. 

I want to. I truly do. But I just can't. I can't come out of my shell. This girl I have known since high school liked me. She went after me. I kept shutting her out. I liked her but I kept shutting her out because I was afraid, depressed, no confidence. A few months back she started seeing someone and has moved on. Barely hear from her. The regret I feel is just killing me inside. 

All this regret. All this bullshit. I see myself going nowhere. I don't know what to do. It's at the point where I only leave home to go to class now, and I have started skipping quite a lot because I just can't get out of bed. I still do assignments, show up on important days but I am not doing myself any favours by missing as much classes as I am. I always tell myself ""next week"" but then next week comes and nothing....nowhere...no progress.

Everyone moves on and progresses. I stand still, like a statute. Sorry for the length. "
2kfwqx,7,2014-10-27,My (26M) ex gf (24F) of 4.5 years is acting bizarre post-breakup and I don't know how to handle it.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2kfwqx/my_26m_ex_gf_24f_of_45_years_is_acting_bizarre/,"She broke up with me over a month ago (9/18) due to her wanting to be alone and figure herself out and my bad attitude was stressing her out. I also get a sense that there might be another guy in the picture. 

The breakup really was just what I needed in terms of my own self-improvement and enlightenment. I've really been able to step back and evaluate where I went wrong in the relationship have been making big changes towards a better me. This has been the most eye-opening, maturing month of my life. I've really learned to love myself again and be my own best friend. I've been doing a lot of reading of self-improvement books, took up yoga, applying and interviewing for various internships, quit smoking pot, meeting new people, reconnecting with old friends, you get the idea. The breakup has been one of the biggest learning experiences of my life. 

We have gone in and out of NC since the breakup, mostly her initiating contact. Basically, she kept trying to keep me in her life by texting me every few days and we would update each other on what we've been doing while apart. She sees that I'm getting my act together in terms of my attitude towards stuff now and is glad I'm being mature and taking things in stride. 

I want her back more than anything, I still do. I feel like I've been robbed of a truly great thing and potential future with her. We had talked about marriage, what our future home would be, all that stuff while we were together. So last week, I asked her if she was seeing that guy, which she denied. I then let her know that she can't have me around and be single, too. We're either a couple or nothing at all because it hurts me too much to see her reaching out to me all the time, knowing she doesn't feel the same way as me anymore. I can't heal and move on if she keeps this up. She said she understood and we said what I thought would be our final goodbyes. 

Then a few days ago, she sends me this text message...

""Hey, I know you don't want me talking to you but there are some things I need to say. First, I am NOT seeing (guy's name). We've hung out a few times and went to a concert and it was fun but it didn't mean anything, and no, nothing happened.  I'm also not hanging out with him anymore because I don't want it to turn into anything and I meant It when I said that I'm trying to focus on myself. I'll only see him if I want to go rock climbing because I can get in for free. So I hope you believe me. Second, after we broke up I went a little crazy with the drinking and partying but I've gotten that out if my system and I finally feel like I'm ready to just look for a better job, do good in school, and work on being fit. So it's mostly quiet nights at home alone for me. Third, you are an amazing person and I will always love you. You deserve to be happy and find someone who isn't all ""i need to be alone and work on myself"". And it will kill me when you do but that's what you deserve. And I deserve whatever karma throws at me for hurting you. But I just needed you to know these things. I don't except an answer and that is okay.""

Wtf! If I'm such an amazing person that you love so much, why are we not together?! I do deserve to be with someone who makes me happy, but SHE was that girl. I think this whole ""being alone to work on myself"" stuff is bullshit for breaking up with someone over, especially with someone you've been with for almost half a decade and have experienced so much together. We did hang out a lot, more than we probably should have, though. We became too comfortable around each other so I can respect a need for space, she's just not the one who's giving it to either of us. 

So I'm just really confused about my next move, Reddit. I never responded to that text because it will keep opening up the wound. I can't handle talking to her if there's no chance of us getting back together. Her actions do not sound like she wants to be alone to work on herself. I still want her back, but what can I do? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

tl;dr -- Ex says she needs to be alone to work on herself, but still contacts me occasionally. Says I'm an amazing person and she will always love me. Why the hell aren't we together then? Need advice on where to go from here."

I have those worthless backgrounds because I don't know where to go to start professionally. I don't know which platform to choose and why. It's a one-time choice but I'm gonna stick to it for a long time to master it and make some real use out of it.

I wanna start my journey to master one thing, one field, one platform, so that I can make some real apps, maybe commercial apps, and jump head first into the industry. This gets me on my way to freelance as well. If I succeed in that I'd have a really solid portfolio by the time I graduate, I don't think I need to spell out how valuable that is.

This'll hopefully get me into big internships (I'm aiming for Google, but who knows).

I'm posting this because I need help choosing the platform to start with. I want one that doesn't take *too* long to learn, I want a platform that is somewhat stable and has a decent future and isn't planning on going anywhere but up (like the mobile platform and maybe the web).

I know some HTML5, CSS3 (pain in the ass btw), jQuery (not much, JS even less. This is my web dev weakpoint). I also got into a small internship at a small company (I'm the only intern :p) where I learned to use GitHub a little bit, and used Python for the web (Flask microframework and MongoDB for database, first time database use ever, learned a ton). I know Java more than any other language at the moment, mostly cuz I used it for Programming 1&amp;2 in college and for the KCPC contest currently.

Sorry for insanely long post, should've made it shorter, but I think knowing these things about me would help you help me :p

**So,** which platform should I start with? Just to be clear, I don't want someone to make the decision for me, I want someone to help me make the decision informally.

**TL;DR** - I'm a level 2 CS student, background in web dev (client and server side with a little database). Which platform should I start developing for and why?"

I am here looking for insight, advice, anything really from Great Dane owners that I should consider when choosing my first dog. Why should I choose a Great Dane? Why shouldn't I? What are things you wish you knew before you got yours? What are things you have learned along the way?

Anything I can do?,cheesedoodleempire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2khft0/my_job_is_screwing_me_over_and_trying_to_get_me/,"I work for a large, big-box store as an hourly wage-slave and have done so for many years throughout high school and college. I never had any problems with my employer working around my schedule and they usually have been very accommodating with my classes.  

This whole issue started months ago. Back in May, I was preparing to go on a full-time internship for academic credit. My school has this weird thing where it's a requirement to graduate - the school sets you up with an internship site and you treat it almost as a capstone class. So, knowing that this was happening soon, I went through the process of changing my availability at work, letting them know that I would be going on an internship for school and would be temporarily be able to only work during the weekend. 

Well, my availability change was denied. Great. After the first few weeks, I had run out of favors and people to cover for me. I went to some of the hourly managers about it and let them know the situation, but they said there was nothing they could do. Their only advice was just to call out if no one was available to cover those shifts during the week. I ended up calling out a lot - sometimes 2 or 3 times a week. I really didn't want to and felt awful doing so, but I could not miss my internship.

Well this whole issue finally escalated to HR, who said she would absolutely not let me work the weekends since it ""did not meet the needs of the business."" According to her, my only options were to change my availability from 6-close every night (which I said would be impossible, I would never be able to get from my internship site to there in an hour) or I could put in my two weeks now and possibly be rehired as a seasonal employee later on (and lose my accumulated raises.) I asked about a leave of absence for academic reasons and was told ""you would still have to be available during the week"" (that's not how leave of absences work!) Even though there are multiple people who leave for school and come back during the holidays, they are trying to phase out that practice. Oh, okay....I left the office feeling pretty defeated. 

We had another meeting about a month or so later, where they said that since I had not done anything to change my schedule and I had not gone to anyone (even though I had talked to multiple managers) I was not cooperating with them over the issue. I started being written up and bad shit started happening. 

So now flash forward to now: My internship is over and my schedule is wide open. I have been written up multiple times over the past few months, mostly for calling out so much. My hours have been cut to less than 5 hours a week. I was pretty much kicked out of the department I was working in - I don't get scheduled there anymore and they hired some new people to work there instead. I'm probably going to be let go at any time now. 


Is there anything I can do at this point? I feel like I've been treated unfairly and wasn't given any options by HR, even though they claim they have ""flexible scheduling.""  I've already been searching for another job, but haven't had any luck yet. Any advice is appreciated!"

 **tl;dr**: Parents are hardly accessible, uninterested in my life, and yet their opinion weighs heavily on me. Is this reasonable?


Backstory:


My mom and dad divorced when I was three, and my dad married my stepmom when I was nine. My dad and I have always been fine, but have a non-relationship. Efforts to create one have fallen flat. My stepmom and I had an okay-ish relationship until my sister was born when I was twelve. After that, we barely spoke for five or six years. I lacked the confidence to do anything about it, my dad failed to speak up for me at any point (even when asked), and she was either rude or acted like I didn't exist until I graduated high school.

Fast forward to now, and for the past six years, we have all been acting like nothing happened. I am fine with this; I harbor no desire to dredge up the past. However, I have some issues. (Warning: ranty)


* Stepmom calls once every three months or so. She talks about herself for an hour, or until I can get myself off the phone. If I do call dad, he talks for five or ten minutes, and then hands the phone off to her.

* Stepmom helped me secure an internship in the very small, very inclusive town they live in. My now-fiancée moved with me and was subsequently unemployed for six months when they failed to follow through on promised work. Dad owns a company and fully has the means to employ someone else. It is impossible to get a job in this town. I tried for years. Fiancee took some freelance work but was miserable. We have since moved, she has been working to get me (only me) back.


* They have little interest in the goings-on of my life (unless it involves me moving back to their town), and zero-interest in the goings-on of my fiancée's. When we do finally force ourselves to go visit for the weekend, they spend the first day talking to and about me an ignore him completely. The second day, they are back to whatever is going on in their life and ignore us both completely.

* Stepmom is manipulative. Her goal is for me to be single and living in their town, working with her in real estate. Based on our interactions, this is undeniable.

So the current issue. My fiancée and I want to get for-real-with-the-ring engaged, not just operate under the understanding we would get married. We've been together for nearly four years, are on our own, and do not rely on them for anything. I don't know if this is from years of withheld affection or what, but their opinion is very important to me. I know they don't like my fiancée and would absolutely not approve of me getting engaged or married. The mature adult side of me says ""I 10000% do not care about the opinions of people who do not truly care about me"", but the wounded teenager in me desperately wants them to approve of me and my actions.

I am not interested in going to them and pandering to them for their support, but I know when I call and tell them we are engaged and they express their disappointment, I will be crushed. Is this reasonable? Or am I letting old hurts get in the way of my own happiness?

First of all I'm not sure if this is the right place for my questions. If not you can contact me and I will delete my posts.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a Computer Science student from the Netherlands. (I hope my English isn't terrible.) Currently I am working for a small company as my internship. Since I started working in this small company I would get these ideas of how I would do things differently. 

So now a few months later I am thinking again of starting my own small project. I started thinking about services I could provide. From web design till computer advise. But I cant figure out what I want. I kept thinking ""Why should I do this. This isn't new. There are  a lot of companies for this.""

So here I am wondering why I just cant do something. I thought about starting a newsletter service. But I don't know anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

**My problem:**

I know I want to start something in my college time. To gain experience, try things out and earn some money. But I cant set up any plan.

Are there any tips for me? Suggestions ? Or maybe even some ideas of IT business are coming up ?

It is probably weird. But it really irritates me that i cant get this straight in my head for the last weeks. I hope I can get some information here.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for your time reading this!

Also, I graduate in May with an associates in Gen Ed/Arts and Sciences degree. Well, at first i was going to go into Engineering, but Physics and Chemistry II was simply too overwhelming to take at the same time with Calculus I. In that same semester, my mother passed away and i was only able to complete Calculus I. After the spring semester had ended, i did not know what i wanted to do next semester since Engineering was beyond me. So, i went with Computer Science, and that did not really go too well. I got put into two programming classes in the same semester and with the crappiest professor as well. So, i had to end up dropping C++ because it was just too much doing two programming classes at the same time. Then, i had to go to the advisor and talk about what i wanted to do next semester because C++ was only registered in the fall, so my only choice to graduate in May was to go into Gen ED/Arts and Sciences degree. Right now, i am stuck in the rut of where if i want to start working after i graduate in may, find an internship that would look at my degree and somewhat get me an internship, or continue going to a University to see what i want to do to graduate with Bachelor's degree. I am  pretty good at working with Word, Math,working with people and really enjoy working with people. If you have any suggestions for me that would be great. I know this is long, but i tried to make it as simple as i could. I would really like some advice on what i should do."

2khvfo,158,2014-10-27,We do exist!,DrunkRobot97,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2khvfo/we_do_exist/,"For a time, I was truly worried.

My race had designed me to carry a very important cargo. Our planet, exhausted by centuries of consumption and ever-escalating war, was watching itself slowly wither away. We hadn't advanced to the stage where we could colonise another system before we broke our mother world's back.

In desperation, another plan was hatched. A sample population of thirty thousand individuals would be written in the language of genetic code into a databank, placed onto a tiny relativistic spacecraft, piloted by yours truly, and aimed towards the nearest habitable system. Once there, I would land on the planet, gather together materials, construct a habitat, and then grow the thirty thousand stored within me. A new land for our race, a second chance.

We succeeded in launching the spacecraft, it was one of the few things our entire planet could get behind. As the world of my creation became smaller and smaller, I was cautious, but hopeful of the future.

Then my world went silent.

I do not know what exactly happened back home, and I possibly never will. What I did know was that I may very well have been the sole survivor of an entire species, and failure in my mission meant total extinction.

But that wasn't to be the last obstacle in my way. A few decades after the old world went silent, the new world started making noise. Year after year, the noise became loader and louder.

*"" - - / - - / ' - / ' - ' / - ' - ' / - - - / - ' / ' ' ""*

*""Crashing, oh! Four- or five-hundred feet into the sky and it... it's a terrific crash, ladies and gentlemen. It's smoke, and it's in flames now; and the frame is crashing to the ground, not quite to the mooring mast. Oh, the humanity! And all the passengers screaming around here. I told you; it—I can't even talk to people, their friends are on there! Ah! It's... it... it's a... ah! I... I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen...""*

*""For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war. Over and over again, we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies; but it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.""*

*""...the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.""*

*""There is also this. I have behind me not only the splendid traditions and the annals of more than a thousand years but the living strength and majesty of the Commonwealth and Empire; of societies old and new; of lands and races different in history and origins but all, by God's Will, united in spirit and in aim.  Therefore I am sure that this, my Coronation, is not the symbol of a power and a splendour that are gone but a declaration of our hopes for the future, and for the years I may, by God's Grace and Mercy, be given to reign and serve you as your Queen.""*

*""Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.""*

*""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!""*

*""The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like powdered charcoal, to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles. There seems to be no difficult in moving around, as we suspected.""*

*""We welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace. There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!""*

I fell to despair, realising what all this noise meant. The new world, the last hope for my creator's survival, was already occupied.

What's more, this race seemed to be going down the same path as mine, repeating the same old mistakes that had - apparently - brought my creators to extinction.

I had to somehow adapt my mission, it still held that I had to do whatever I could to ensure the survival of the sample, that it might have a chance to grow into a new community.

I begged.

Slowing myself down while entering the new system, I entered orbit around the third world, already blanketed in cities and slowly choking on greenhouse gases. I then made my presence known - As I found out, they thought I was some kind of asteroid on a collision course with their planet when they first spotted me - and I told them all of my task. I asked if I could be given shelter, just the tiniest amount of space so I could at least try to raise the sample.

After a few hours, I got a response.

""OK. We'll look after you. What do you need?""

It really did surprise me, the level of generosity they showed. There were many who wanted to 'intern' me and my craft, but those were in the minority, and I was offered any place on their planet to settle.

It humored them when I made my decision.

""Bielefeld?! Why the flying fuck do you want to settle there?!""

It was as good a place as any other. A developed city, with plenty of amenities to support the new population, surrounded by farmland for the crops I brought with me, stable, relatively transparent government that emphasized international cooperation, generally isolated with little tourism, it was perfect, really.

After the local government had made Bielefeld an 'international city', I came down and made first direct contact. Very little technology on my ship was much beyond their capabilities, and I was glad they didn't swarm me, always showing the utmost respect. We worked nonstop to get ready for growing the sample, planting the first crops for food, teaching a new corps of medical professionals a whole new physiology. To my utter surprise, most stable families in the city offered to adopt a child when the time came. That alone advanced my mission schedule by decades. Soon, we had, in advance, found a home for every single child to be born. The city adapted its constitution so that a 'xeno' had every right a native had, a right to an education, to a job, to a vote, to a marriage (even to a native!), everything.

That all happened a long time ago, now. I watched thirty thousand births. Them all being raised by their parents, going to school, learning of both their new home and the home they left behind, going into the world of work, marrying, and finally having children of their own. A few years ago, I told an old friend, a human, that the population of my race had just grown to be greater than 100,000. He told me:

""No it hasn't. You're forgetting the 7 billion standing beside you.""

I then asked him why his species had been so welcoming to another that had little to offer them alive, or even had much justification to existence.

""Throughout our history, we've done some truly awful things to people we didn't consider 'human'. Then, you came, with a chance for us to, in some way, atone for all that misery. Why pass that up?"""

I really want to work in the non-profit sector, as I can't really see myself working for a large corporation. I really enjoy writing and ideally I would eventually work as a grant writer or fundraiser. I also would like doing social media or PR/marketing. 

I'm not really sure how to break into the non-profit world without much experience. I interned at a non-profit for 3 months as their social media coordinator and event planner, but that is the only real non-profit experience I have. I'm wondering if it may be beneficial for me to try to either get an entry level position at a non-profit or begin volunteering at a non-profit that I am interested in while I attend grad school to pursue a Master's in Non-Profit Management? Or is it possible to obtain an entry level job at a non-profit and work my way into the position I want to hold? Most of the job postings I've seen for grant writers require you to have at least 2 years of experience with grant writing and experience with non-profit fundraising. Even though I'm graduating in December, is it possible to obtain an internship in the spring to gain more experience and exposure to non-profit management?

I would really appreciate any advice from anyone who works in, or worked in, the non-profit sector. What degrees do you hold? How did you find your job? What advice do you wish someone would have given you when you were just starting out?    "
2ki1px,2,2014-10-27,The Woman at The End of The Bar,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ki1px/the_woman_at_the_end_of_the_bar/,"I cheated on my wife. I’m not proud of it, I’m not going to sit here and attempt to come up with some vainglorious excuses such as “our marriage is sexless” (it is), or “the children give us so much stress that we never have time for ourselves” (they do),  or my personal favourite, “money has put a real strain on our relationship,” (it hasn’t). There’s no other reason that I can come up with for what I did aside from the fact that I let my dick do the thinking. Now, well now I have to live with what I did. And it’s fucking terrible. 

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr. Jeremy Stanton. I am a practicing psychiatrist specializing in pediatrics, practicing here in Toronto. I am 48 years old, very fit (gym at least 5 times a week) and about 6’3. I have a nice body, but a so-so face. It gets the job done. I have practiced for almost 20 years and during this time I have seen my fair share of distressed and disturbed patients, but nothing prepared me for what I had to go through with Celeste. 

Celeste. She’s beautiful. She’s in her late 20s or early 30s, the time we spent together wasn’t really expended on hammering out finer details about one another’s personal lives so much as it was spent hammering out the details of who could undress the fastest. She’s got the perfect body with those hips that you can just grab onto where your thumb fits right into the groove and your bodies just lock in together. Perfect. Perfect hair, perfect smile, perfect everything. I am a mature and intellectual man, but what she presented to me that night made the 17 year old horn dog inside of me take over. Wife and marriage be damned.

My wife Daphne is a principal at a public school here in the city. She works very hard and I admire her for that, but to put it in the most blunt fashion possible. Our marriage is virtually over. Neither of us have had the balls (ovaries?) to tell the other that we should leave, and I think that on some deep connected level bound together by children and time, we’ve grown to expect one another in each other’s lives, but for all intents and purposes, we should not be married. We should be good friends, but marriage should not be the foundation of our relationship. Strange for me to say that, you’d think that being a psychiatrist that I’d be all in touch with my feelings, and no willing to let anything get in the way of my mental health, but I’ll let you in on a little secret: teachers raise the worst children, dentists have the worst oral hygiene, and psychiatrists have no fucking clue how to conduct themselves in a mentally healthy fashion. 

My wife started to neglect our children shortly after her promotion, when our youngest was 14. She became obsessed with climbing the ladder, possibly making superintendent one day. She had the cuts for it, but now she’s a husk of her former self: overworked by the system and discarded like so many other potential hopefuls. Where once there burned a fire, there’s no just the dying embers of a passion for children, a passion for teaching, a passion for pretty much all the things that I fell in love with her for. 

Mind you, I’m no prize myself. See, the thing they don’t tell you in medical school is that regardless of how succesful or amazing you may get, there’s really no career advancement. Sure you go from internship to residency, but then you just sort of coast at that level until someone ahead of you dies or retires. The money is fantastic, but the drive to continue to go forward, quite like my wife, does end up diminishing after a while. You find yourself looking for new and more beautiful outlets that allow you to feel like you’re reaping a reward for giving yourself up for the betterment of others. 

And that’s where Celeste came into the picture. 

It was a regular night like any other. I had finished my rounds and was about to head home. I had taken to riding the subway since getting out of downtown in the summer is an awful nightmare. There’s no room for movement and the traffic is utter garbage. I changed out of my scrubs into my regular clothing and left the changeroom. On my way out I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and I looked good. I had just worked a full 12 hour shift, but my hair was just messy enough to pass off as trendy, and my clothing was just wrinkled enough to not make me look like a frumpy old man. I always liked the way my pecs looked in the shirt that I was wearing. 

I let the hospital saying goodnight to the usual crew and made my way onto the street. It was still relatively bright out and that fresh summer smell that somehow rose about the stench of open swears and the deep fried grease of the chinese restaurant next door, hung in the air. I had had a relatively rough week (two suicides), and I wanted to just take my time getting home. The idea of opening the door to three angry children and a wife who looked like she walked through a hail storm every day wasn’t very appealing. 

I walked down University avenue and made my way into Yorkville, a relatively trendy spot in the city with lots of bars, lots of money, and lots of money. As I turned the corner onto Cumberland Street I could see the patios and pergolas of the more refined eateries were filling up and didn’t really want to be part of that scene tonight. I walked down the road a bit more and could see that there was still room at The Attic, one of the newer bars with fancy guest lists and what my daughter advises me is called mandatory “bottle service,” (Table service, in my day).

I walked up to the entrance and went inside. I had been here once before with a group of the younger interns who had invited us older folks out to celebrate their gradual progressions, but was quite drunk that night, so I didn’t remember quite how beautiful it was. Everything was a clean, sterile mixture of black and grey and the staff were impecablly dressed. Women in above the knee dresses and men in shirt and tie. I worked hard, and it was nice to see from time to time what I was able to afford. I came from nothing, and it’s nice to sort of feel like you’re “at the top” every once in a while. 

I sat at the bar where the bartender continued to feed me cocktail after cocktail, vodka-water-barlime, was my usual choice but that night I found myself trying everything from 18 year old Whiskey to blends of scotch that I didn’t even know existed. Some of my tastes are refined, but the vast majority of the time I tend to relapse to my university days when it comes to drinking. 

I sat at the bar for about two hours and had built up quite the buzz. The drinks kept coming and the bill kept building. I didn’t care, I just wanted to enjoy the dying days of summer in a place where no one knew me, and no one expected anything from me. 

“I’ll take the bill,” I finally said, the urge to eat something overpowering me. 

“Certainly Sir, I’ll bring it to you right away,” the kind bartender said. He disappeared around the corner of the bar and came back with the receipt about 2 minutes later. I looked down at it and figured it had to be a mistake. 

It said that my total was zero. 0.00. No dollars owed. 

I flagged down the bartender who turned towards me and approached with a smile, “I’m sorry, but I think there’s an error with the bill,” I said, my speech more slurred than I expected. “It says that I owe nothing,” I had drank at least 150.00 worth of high end scotch alone, let alone the other drinks. 

“The bill was paid for by that woman,” the bartender said, again with the coy smile, as he pointed to the most beautiful woman I had laid eyes on in a very long time. At the end of the bar sat Celeste. As mentioned before, perfect hair, perfect body, perfect fucking everything. 

I honestly didn’t know what to think. Was she a former patient? I had run into former patients before who had brought me gifts or paid for meals, but this woman didn’t look familiar at all. She looked too old to have been one of my patients, and she had an allure to her that 20 years of marriage couldn’t overcome. I got up and my knee trembled a little, in hindsight I’m certain it was the booze, but in that moment the woman at the end of the bar seemed to be the case of the tremor.

As I made my way over to her I could notice that she had a smile on her face and had locked eyes with me. I approached and very nervously said, “Hello, My name is Dr. Jeremy Stanton, and I presume you’re the lovely person whose paid my bill?” I had a somewhat paternal smile on and felt like a bit of a creep, I had never hit on a woman that was this young. What am I saying, I had never really hit on a woman since I got married! 

“Doctor Stanton eh?” she said, “Well my name is Celeste Ville, and I guess my investment paid off more than I thought it would,” she winked at me. 

“Pleasure to meet you Celeste,” I slurred back at her, “What do you mean by investment?” I was genuinly impressed that such a beautiful, young woman was also so very well spoken and quick. 

“200.00 dollars and I got a doctor’s attention, not a bad turn around.” She was very blunt, and at this point had turned her face towards her drink. Her profile was beautiful, almost like it was carved out of marble. Creamy and stern at the same time. 

“You could have gotten my attention by just looking over,” THAT was the best that I could do? Man I certainly was rusty when it came to hitting on women, but at least I knew what her intentions were. A swirl of decisions flew through my mind. What the hell was I doing? Was my wife expecting me at home? Did I have to take one of the kids somewhere? Was there someway I could do this and get away with it? When was the last time I had had sex? I didn’t even have a condom on me. What the hell?! Was I actually going to cheat on my wife? Did this woman even want sex? 

“Oh I know I could have, this way, it’s just more fun. People tend to make better decisions when they’ve had a few drinks.” She replied, again, I was just staring at that profile, she never made eye contact with me while saying all of this.

“Better decisions?” I chuckled, “I think that’s debateable!” Knowing exactly what I wanted out of this situation. I had been hit on before, but I had never been hit on by a woman that looked like this before. Especially one so young.

“The decisions that I want you to make are the better decisions,” She turned towards me and had the most come hither look I had ever seen in my life. Her smile screamed fuck me, and her eyes, god those fucking eyes. 

“I, uh, well, I, will you excuse me for a second.” I panicked and excused myself to the bathroom. As soon I got into the single bathroom I locked the door, stood in front of the mirror and stared at myself. Was I going to do this? The four seasons was across the road and I knew the general manager, his son had been a patient of mine, so I knew that discretion was guaranteed. I splashed some water on my face, took one of the soft towels from the basked near the sink and dried myself off. I stared at myself in the mirror, my chest was heaving, my heart was racing, and my dick was already half hard. 

And then I took off my wedding ring.

I had made the decisions. C’mon Jer, you don’t live anymore, do this for yourself, you do everything for the damn kids and your wife who doesn’t even touch you. Just go out there, and fuck that woman’s brains out. 

I entered the bar area with a new sense of bravado. I walked right back up to Celeste and put my arm on her shoulder. “Hey, how about we get out of here, it’s getting late.” She smiled and got up from her seat. Her sexy legs were made even more beautiful by the high heels she gracefully wore. 
We left the restaurant and both her and I smoked a couple cigarettes before we made our way across the road to the Four Seasons. I had texted my buddy from the bathroom and there was a room waiting for us by the time we made our way inside. 

“Hello Dr. Stanton, thank you for choosing the Four Seasons, enjoy your night.” The staff here were amazing, and their discretion was always profound. Celeste and I made our way to the elevator and she pressed the button. As we waited, I took out my phone and texted my wife. 

“Hey Hun, I’ll be at the hospital overnight, they want me on-call” 

“k” was the only response I received. 20 years of marriage, I was about to fuck a random woman who I had just met, and that one letter response just drove home the lack of love that I had waiting for me at home. I knew I was making the decision that I wanted to make. 

We entered the room, and found the intimacy kit. It contained three condoms, some lube, and other personal items that make nights like this not so regrettable; at least children weren’t going to be a byproduct of this decision. 

Within 5 minutes we were both naked and Celeste was on her knees doing what she did so well. I returned the favour, being particularly proud of my ability to please a woman (sure, it had been my wife for the past two decades, but I hadn’t forgotten the ropes). We fucked for hours, only stopping to reload on more booze and to smoke the occasional cigarette. We fucked on the floor, on the bed, and at one point on the desk. It was amazing. All of the endless hours that I had spent at the gym had kept me in fighting form, and she loved it. She was the best that I had ever had. 

By the time we took our last break, the sun was rising, and we were both a combination of drunk and exhausted. She finished her cigarette and crushed out the butt in the ash tray next to her bed.

“I have to go, I have an early client meeting. I had a really great night” She said to me as she was gettin dressed. “Do you think you can get my zipper for me,” she turned her back towards me and held her long black hair out of the way. I got out of the bed and did up the zipper. I kissed her neck and then her back, all while sliding my hand up the front of her leg, under her dress. 

She turned and kissed me, “Thanks Dr. Stanton,” again she winked, and again my knee gave out a little, “I had a really great night,” she concluded as she put on her shoes and made her way out of the door. 

I went back to the bed, my shift didn’t start until 1pm, and it was about 8am at this point. As my head hit the pillow, I realized then and there want a colossal twat I was. 

I didn’t get her fucking number. I had no way of contacting this woman. All I knew was that her name was Celeste. I mean, she knew mine, but goddammit I hope she wouldn’t attempt to contact me at work. As I lay there, beating myself up, I managed to fall back asleep. It was the best sleep that I had had in years. 

About three hours later, close to noon, my phone began to ring. It was my wife calling me from School. 

Me: Hello honey, how are you? 

Daphne: Today’s been a rough day Jeremy, but I think it’ll be fine. How was your overnight shift? 

Me: Um, oh yeah, it was good, spent most of the time sleeping, luckily they didn’t need me. 

Daphne: Oh, well that’s good, ok just wanted to check in, I’ll see you for dinner tonight with Ambrose and his wife. 

Ambrose was my wife’s godawful cousin. She had come from money and Ambrose hated the fact that she married me, most likely because my single mother was on social assistance. His wife was no treat either, sort of like a cross between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen. God she had an awfully long neck (the wife, not Sigourney)

Me: ok Honey, you have a good one. 

I hung up the phone and took a long, much needed shower. As I stood there, water washing away the physical marks of the night before, the emotional toll of my decision started to set in. I had cheated on the woman who had given me children with a woman whose name I didn’t even know. God I really was a dick head. The good thing is that the chances of my wife finding out were minimal. 

I finished up at the hotel, made my way back to the hospital and worked my shift. I left around 5pm and took the train home. I walked the rest of the way from the station to my house, and just stood in front of my home before I went inside. I had always considered myself an emotionally strong man, but the choices I had made were weighing on me, and I began to feel bad for not telling my wife. I lit up one more cigarette before making my way inside and just sat on the front steps not knowing how to reconcile my actions with my beliefs. I had fucked another woman. Shit. 

I finally worked up the courage to enter the house and there were my kids, my wife, Ambrose and his alien wife. All sitting there, as if waiting for me, waiting to judge me for something that they didn’t know I had done. 

“Hello Everyone! I hope you’ve all had a wonderful day,” I exclaimed in my best dad voice, not wanting to raise suspicion. 

“We’ve been waiting for dinner, but everything else has been ok,” Ambrose retorted in his smug voice. God I hated that guy. 

“Well, I’m hear now, so let’s eat!” I smiled back. Don’t start anything, don’t bring attention to yourself. 

Everyone sat down to dinner and I went into the kitchen to see if I could offer my wife any help. Always the happy couple. Party-face. 

“Did you have a good day at work,” she asked without raising her eyes to meet mine. 

“Yes, did yours improve,” I asked as I made my way behind her to give her a hug. She was chopping carrots, and something just felt tense. Something was awry, did she know? How?

“Where’s your wedding ring Jeremy,” she put down the knife and turned around to face me. She was concerned, I could see it in her face.

“Oh, I took it off while I was at work, I had to do two physical workups today,” God what a terrible lie, I’m a psychiatrist, I usually don’t physically interact with patients. 

“You’ve never had to do that before, you’ve never taken it off,” she retorted, her voice slightly more raised.

“Honey, relax, I took it off for work,” I fished the ring out of my pocket and placed it back on my hand. “There, are you happy now Daphne!” I barked back at her. This wasn’t the time for this conversation, I didn’t want Ambrose to know anything about me or my family. I reminded Daphne of this, and she agreed. We took the food out and all sat down. 

“A Toast, to doctor and principal Stanton, thank you for ha” Ambrose’s toast was interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. I excused myself and made my way to the front door. As I opened it, I realized that there was no one there. Emptiness. I was about to shut the door and head back inside, thinking it was a neighbourhood kid playing a prank, until I looked down. 

There, on the stoop, was a box. I bent down and picked it up, turned, and closed the door behind me. As I inspected the box I realized that it had small tag on it. I turned it over and all it said was “for Jeremy, as a thank you” 

“Honey, who is it?” my wife called from the dining room. 

“No one, just some kids playing a prank I guess” I responded and made my way into the bathroom on the first floor with the box. 

I set the box down on the counter and slowly opened the top, not knowing what to expect. Inside there was an envelope. 

Thanks for a beautiful night Jeremy, hopefully you get some rest tonight. I’ll be in touch

-Celeste 

I nearly yelled, how the hell did she know where I lived?! What the hell was going on? I fucked up, and I fucked up badly, now this woman was sure to be the end of me. Fuck the divorce and the kids and the angry wife and the alimony. Fuck Fuck Fuck. 

I opened the envelope and realized I was in more trouble than I realized. Inside were a series of four pictures.

- Me leaving the hotel 

- Me entering the hospital 

- Me smoking outside 

- Me on the train home. 

What the fuck had I done.

My last semester is an internship of my choosing (with department approval) that relates in someway to health promotion/fitness/coaching/etc and takes place within the United States. I've already talked to my adviser and confirmed that a position with a pole/aerial fitness studio would likely be approved.

I've been doing pole since January 2014 and am already an ""advanced"" student at my studio. By the time when I'm looking for my internship I expect to be technically skilled and hopefully will have at least a year or more of teaching under my belt. 

My question(s) for anyone with input is this... Are there any prominent pole studios that have interns or would consider having one? What studios are most well-known and reputable throughout the country? If you are an owner or manager would you consider having an intern as an instructor for a 4-5 month period, who might be interested in staying on after said internship was over? What do you recommend I do now to prep for this, other than continuing to learn and trying to gain a teaching position? Honestly, any experience you have with this or any advice you have to offer is totally appreciated. 

Thank you!"
2kicu3,1,2014-10-27,I think I have psychopathic tendencies and I don't know how to feel about it,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2kicu3/i_think_i_have_psychopathic_tendencies_and_i_dont/,"I'll start from childhood. I guess I had a troubled upbringing. My mother was a chronic alcoholic with some severe mental trauma from childhood, finding her own mother dead while quite young. After I was around 6, she didn't live with us her anymore, she and my dad split up and she was an unfit guardian. A year or so after, my half-brother committed a murder. He was always a problem, taking drugs, getting a girl pregnant at 16, causing hell for my mum and dad (he's my mum's child, to an estranged father, not my dad). One night he and his friend stabbed a male prostitute who solicited them after trying to rob him. I found out about this when I was about 10, and I may have been too young to realise but I was quite unaffected emotionally (I'll return to my brother later). 

One day my mother showed up at my house drunk the day I returned from vacation and was quite belligerent; she shouted at the family and I ran and phoned the police and told her my mum was drunk and going crazy and they came and arrested her. I guess I blanked this out for a while, because I was shocked and distraught when she hanged herself when I was 12 years old.

During my teenaged years, there was much less drama. My father cared for me and my older sister but was very busy, and distant. I had some issues between 12-16ish, I would get depressed sometimes and play a lot of video games, and was quite overweight. I couldn't stay with a group of friends too long, I always messed it up somehow, I could be quite erratic and verbally violent sometimes. 

I have never had any close personal relationships with people. I feel a barrier between me and other people and I don't really care about anyone else's problems. I never got into terrible trouble, but I did some bad things, and I never felt guilty, because I was very good at not getting caught. I used to steal from my grandfather's box of change every week before school. My dad suspected me, but when he confronted my sister she burst into tears and it turns out she had stolen aswell, but much more petty amounts and sporadically. I was 13, and I was personally relieved. She got caught, I didn't, and I manipulated my dad into feeling guilty for accusing me. 

When my granny and grandfather were both ill in the hospital, I barely cared (aged 14). Going to visit them was an inconvenience when I could be playing video games. When I was 15 my dad bought me a gaming PC for christmas, and I promised to pay him some money towards it afterwards once I saved a bit. Once the PC was mine I didn't care about paying back, and a few weeks later he sat me down and we had an angry conversation. He said I ""didn't give a fuck about this family"" and I only care about myself. He was right.

Aged 15-16 or so, I had an addiction to shoplifting. I'm a keen reader, and I was able to go to various different bookstores almost weekly and steal books without getting caught. I never did get caught, and I felt no guilt; just content with my collection of 80ish books. 

I subconsciously started gaining a lot of weight aged 17 or so, and kind of blanked out how disgusted I was with myself until I was around 100kg. I got suspended from school for making a meme making fun of the fact that some mental kid in school wiped shit on the walls of a cubicle. Had another frank talk with dad that day, decided to sort myself out. Lost 60lb in 3 months, started studying very hard for my final exams before leaving school and going to university. I didn't care about anyone or anything except my own personal goals. it consumed me, and still does. I've always been told I'm very smart by family, but I was still surprised to get perfect grades when I applied myself. When I found that I'd got into the uni of my choice, I was so happy and consumed with getting away from my shitty, poverty-stricken house that I cared about nothing else. Didn't even think of my family's feelings about it. So I left aged 18 and started a new life, not looking back.

Over years of losing friends and making new ones I've acquired a keen skill for crafting my personality in order to make those around me like me more. On the first day in student life i fucked a beautiful girl, losing my virginity. It wasn't special to me, it was impersonal. i walked home afterwards feeling as though I had made a tick on a checklist of things to do. I didn't keep in much contact with family in that year, I was so focused on myself and didn't care about anything else. I got a girlfriend and didn't give a shit about her really. I said all the right things to make her happy when I needed to, and was just apathetic otherwise. I stayed with her for 8 months because the sex was good and I thought having a break up after a short time would make me look personally bad. I dumped her when I had enough, and while she was screaming and crying that ""THIS ISN'T FAIR"" i sat unmoved, calm, just thinking ""Can she just leave already so I can talk to more girls?"" I had sex with another girl for a month or so, charmed her, and after a month she had to go home for summer. I pretended to be sad and hugged her, then the night she left I looked for more sex. There were no girls around the accommodation that I knew/liked, but there was a guy who I knew really wanted me and liked me around. Went to a party he was at, took him back to mine and fucked him. I wasnt attracted to him, I don't consider myself gay or bisexual, it was just sex. Totally impersonal. I made it subtly clear I didnt want him to stay the night, and he left looking sad and I didn't care. Another tick off the checklist. When my second year began I started a relationship with the girl I met before summer ended. She is very emotional, but loves me, and I don't love her. I've cheated on her with a few different women, and feel no guilt, because I made sure she didn't find out and get hurt. I like instigating arguments and get giddy when I see her get angry/sad/crazy, while I feel nothing; it's all fun for me; a good argument is a good opportunity to practise twisting your bad deeds and making the other person somehow feel like the bad guy.

I tend to have very unrealistic goals. I plan my life very far in advance. I fantasise about becoming Prime Minister of the UK almost every day, I dream of having power over my whole country. My ego is gigantic. I look at my perfect grades, ability to learn almost anything very quickly, good looks, and ability to persuade and charm people and believe I'm just wonderful. I have a part-time job, I still get good grades, I'm studying abroad next year and I'm about to start a marketing internship. All planning for my future, getting a great graduate job and making lots of money and wearing fancy suits. When I want something, I work very hard and get it; nothing else matters. I believe I would definitely screw people over to get what I want. i care about nothing, no one, except myself and my own future. 

People say that psychopaths hurt animals. This isn't true with me; quite the opposite. I absolutely love animals, petting them and feeding them, they make me very happy. I love animals more than I love people. I am quite a misanthrope. I look at people on benefits and homeless people and I am disgusted. I came from the poorest bracket of society and I still worked hard and got into a brilliant university, with good career prospects. Why can't they? I would never physically hurt someone, but I like to imagine the people who've hurt me in the past and the thought of beating them senseless. 

I don't know what you will do with this information... but I wanted to tell someone at least. I didn't choose to be like this, I just am. I don't know how much was my childhood or If I was born like this or whatever. But I want to know if you think there's something I might do about it. Thank you.

I'm a 25 year old who has lived in New York City with a degree (a Bachelor's in Business Administration in Industrial Organizational Psychology) who took the degree with the intention of entering graduate school one day into the field to focus on leadership or HR management as it's my dream, but my dream is far off right now with my financial strains. 

I have been out of college for 4 years, and unfortunately, due to me picking my major as late as I did in undergraduate, I made the mistake of not utilizing my college to its full potential for opportunities in the work field, and coupled with a weak GPA due to 2 bad semesters, I was forced to find work on my own due to being the first in my family with a college degree. I have spent the last four years attempting to find stable work, only to have the following happen to me:

* Worked as an Intern for an author's private small company for the experience only for them to awkwardly end the commitment with me as their intern due to them choosing to move on from that portion of the project
* Worked in a volunteer event, networking my way into an interview with the MTA here in NYC for an unpaid social media position to work on one of their projects, only to be told I met what they wanted of the job, but couldn't hire me due to being out of school for 2 years (and thus couldn't be labeled as an intern)
* Invited to a networking party and given plenty of connections the night of the event, only to be told the next day that the only reason all of the execs there spoke to me were because they were drunk and didn't remember me
* Hired in retail only to be forced to quit 2 weeks into the job because the managerial team didn't respect the manager that got me into the position, and after the manager left, I was verbally insulted by a manager in front of a distributor and felt that it wasn't a place that wanted me.
* I was fired from a position 3 weeks ago, 3 weeks into the job, for being ""too good at the position"", as while I was hired to be a cashier, I was never used as a cashier by the company (where I did quality assurance and administrative work instead). I followed orders in being the ""yes man"" the company asked me to be, and let me go for the reason stated above, was told by the managers that I would be given help by them personally in finding a new opportunity, only for them to pretend I didn't exist the day after I walked out that door in an e-mail.
And I'm sure I've forgotten other situations, as 5 recruiting agencies have given me very negative experiences, including with a company that I am convinced is a scam.

I've been reading some of the threads in various subs for some advice and ideas for my own particular search, but I haven't been able to find anyone in my shoes that have gone through my situations, and it's left me very lost on where to go next.

All of the individuals I have worked with in all of my prior positions have also intentionally refused (and have stated so) to wish to network with me further, despite me only saying kind words to everyone I have worked with.

I am a guy that is just trying to find work in accounting (as I worked a year as a tax preparer for H&amp;R block with ease), as a manager anywhere (as I have been told by numerous employees/yers that I am capable/ready for the work if given a chance), an opportunity to enter the human resources field, or anything administrative. I am in a huge need (as is everyone else trying to survive obviously) to help my family through hard times more than anything, but I am lacking networking options, and I just need help or someone to talk to on ideas I can look into to aid in my search.

I make my post because I am looking for options on what people do in order to make themselves more employable through all these shenanigans that happen while on the job, or that if it's been a matter of bad luck for me for so long, what suggestions do people have where I can look into for either my options for work, or just to be more employable.

I apologize if my post was long, and I do not wish to badmouth anyone in my previous situations, I am just not sure where my options are right now, and I don't know where else to turn for advice to talk to someone about.

I have a personal problem but I've found this sub supportive more than anything else so maybe you can lend me an ear. I'm currently an intern at a hospital for my graduate program. Not only am I the youngest there (probably with the least experience) but I'm also the *only* woman of color (I'm black/mixed race). There's like maybe one other person of color there aside from the counselors but we do not  interact much. I hold myself to high standards and I've been trying hard to take on a lot of responsibility to show that I'm eager and capable despite my age.

However, I've been feeling a lot of tension because in general I am very social-justice oriented and I care about issues related to race, culture, etc. My supervisor is a nice white woman who has invited me to be open about all of those things but she seems so strict to me that haven't been able to be myself around her. Overall I felt distanced, a little isolated, and ambivalent about my experience but I guess that's to be expected.

Here's the annoying part. The other day my school adviser visited me at my placement to get a sense of how I was doing. I was already having a bad day and in our meeting I felt like she was evaluating and criticizing me because she was asking so many questions about why I chose the program, my age, etc. I completely broke down and started crying... I actually really feel embarrassed and resentful that this happened. While it helped me be more open with her, it opened up a floodgate of negative experiences I was having in regards to my age, race etc. She invited my supervisor in and I was all teary with her and we talked about it. Yay.

I'm so embarrassed. I know emotion is good but I feel like I ruined my professional image. I feel awkward and my supervisor probably thinks I hate her and want to talk about race all the time. I have a supervision meeting with her tomorrow... 

TLDR: Started crying in a meeting with my supervisor/turned into a conversation about my insecurities about my professional identity as a young black woman. Now I feel awkward. help me feel normal....

I've been into a lot interviews, most of them (luckily) were the ""final"" interviews. However, all of them didn't result into any offers.

I'm really depressed and frustrated right now. Is it because of my visa status? Is it because I'm stupid? Do I need more side projects? What. Is. Wrong?

I'm really jealous of a lot of kids in CS (who fortunately are both white and US citizens). They don't have to go through the inevitable racism and hardships when going through the internship search process that most of us, non-whites and non-US citizens experience."

Also, I graduate in May with an associates in Gen Ed/Arts and Sciences degree. Well, at first i was going to go into Engineering, but Physics and Chemistry II was simply too overwhelming to take at the same time with Calculus I. In that same semester, my mother passed away and i was only able to complete Calculus I. After the spring semester had ended, i did not know what i wanted to do next semester since Engineering was beyond me. So, i went with Computer Science, and that did not really go too well. I got put into two programming classes in the same semester and with the crappiest professor as well. So, i had to end up dropping C++ because it was just too much doing two programming classes at the same time. Then, i had to go to the advisor and talk about what i wanted to do next semester because C++ was only registered in the fall, so my only choice to graduate in May was to go into Gen ED/Arts and Sciences degree. Right now, i am stuck in the rut of where if i want to start working after i graduate in may, find an internship that would look at my degree and somewhat get me an internship, or continue going to a University to see what i want to do to graduate with Bachelor's degree. I am  pretty good at working with Word, Math,working with people and really enjoy working with people. If you have any suggestions for me that would be great. I know this is long, but i tried to make it as simple as i could. I would really like some advice on what i should do."

How do you find that?

----

Last December, I graduated with my BA in statistics from a somewhat high-ranking university.  I didn't choose statistics because I loved it, but rather because it sounded like something I could do, and people said it was a growing industry.  It made my parents happy, and I didn't really care.  My goal for so many years was just to get into this university!

Fast forward a bit to junior year.  I worked so so so hard, but I had a very hard time with the theory in my major.  My GPA doesn't look too bad, but it's not great.  I spent so much time on schoolwork, I couldn't handle looking for internships or jobs.  I panicked at every time period where I was submitting my resume out to employers.  Every time I thought I found a field to pursue, something didn't fit right with me.  Maybe that sounds silly coming from a 20-something year old, but I still have no desire to pursue those fields...So I just spent my energy studying.

I now have no work experience that is relevant.  Well, whatever, I graduated!

I used some money I had to travel in April-May, so I just chilled for a few months after graduating (mostly with my boyfriend).  Made more travel plans for June, because why not.  By that time, I felt like it was time for me to settle down.  I started living at home in July and started looking at jobs in August.  My parents say they want me to find a ""career"" type of job and not just anything.  I'm very thankful for the fact they are allowing me to take this time to myself (please don't hate on me for wasting my parents' money...I'm well aware), but sometimes I find myself seriously stressing out about having to deal with deciding on a career path now.  It's also really hard when I don't have job experience...

I'm trying to self-study stats and a few programming languages in my ample free time at home.  Then I look at jobs for a bit.  I feel bad for still not knowing what direction I want to go in.  I don't even know what to apply for.  Do I apply for everything?  Do I look into grad school?  What else is out there?  Where did the time go?  What have I been doing?  Just having fun?!  I haven't had this much time off in ages.  I look at the calendar, it's getting close to the year-end holidays, I'm just about to turn 23, and...I'm exactly where I was 9 months ago!  When I think about these things I just start panicking. I'm so annoyed with myself!

Recently, my mom got me a gym membership for my birthday.  I've always been into fitness, so it's been great.  I expend a lot of energy at the gym.  I'm feeling a little better.  I'm focusing a little better and getting up earlier.  Slow steps.

But I still just don't know how to approach the career related stuff.  I don't mind studying, but applying to jobs is such a chore for me.  I just want to support myself and move on.  But getting from here to there seems like a dream.

**edit: thank you all for the advice.  I received a lot of good advice while I was away from a computer for a day and a half.  I know this is a late edit, but I really appreciate everything.**  "

I just landed a 6-month internship with a firm in SoMa and need a place to stay for the time I'll be working there. I'm looking to sublet an apartment somewhere near SoMa starting in January until the end of June. I also have a car, so I'd be willing to go as far out as Oakland or Berkeley. 

My budget is fairly flexible, but I'm not looking to pay more than 1400/mo for rent. I'd prefer a studio, but I'd be okay with rooming with people. 

Any help would be much appreciated!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Can you guys give us some idea of what we will be doing in the game?  I am fairly unclear of what I would be doing in it but love the look and polish shown.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldqdx?context=5)|Sure thing. You'll be exploring an immersive, story rich world made by artists who had a hand in bringing Columbia and Rapture to life. That's to say, interacting with bizarre characters, eavesdropping on conversations, investigating the environment, and more in order to hunt down clues for what aspects of the creators' past to change next. Each creator has certain combinations that will unlock success for them, but even a ""wrong"" choice will yield interesting results in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. And to unlock the ability to change their past, you'll be accomplishing gameplay Feats within... The Maze of the Space Minotaur.
 |In a way, you're kind of a metaphysical investigator who is digging into the past, present, and future of these characters to learn how to put them on the right track. Part of the fun is simply seeing how radically different you can change their environments. Meanwhile, you'll also be learning about the mysteries of The Equinox, the theatre hosts, and more. 
[I  loved bioshock infinite and burial at see and the dialogue between booker and Elizabeth. I loved the way plot revelations unfolded. It all had such great build up, so thanks for all your contributions!  My question is what about your new project are you most excited about as a dev? What part should I, as a consumer, be most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldp3o?context=5)|The premise of The Black Glove is really exciting to us because it lets us focus on everything that we learned about making story rich, immersive environments -- and it also pushes us to take our skills to the next level. The idea of giving the player direct control over changing the course of the game narrative and the world around you is going to be immensely challenging and fun to tackle. We'll be able to develop The Equinox into an incredibly eerie and ""real"" place, which is something we know how to do based on work on previous games, but we'll need to move outside our comfort zone and develop new skills to hit all of the game's ambitious goals. It's a premise that has us constantly crackling with new ideas though and I think games that are fun to develop for are the most fun to play. Does that answer your question? 
[What did you draw upon or study in order to give your game such a cinematic feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldp7c?context=5)|The premise for The Black Glove lets us pull in influences from film, art, comics, music, and more. I'd say some of the more surreal elements were loosely inspired by the work of Jean Cocteau, Alan Renais, and the makers of Le Jetee, but we also have DNA in the game from folks like Jack Kirby, William S Burroughs, Groucho Marx, Laurie Anderson, Werner Herzog, and more. (I should point out that whenever things get a little &lt;too&gt; pretentious, we'll make fun of it scandalously.) Plus we have a variety of fail states that riff off our weird obsession with the ""so-bad-it's-good"" like sad-eyed clown art, black velvet paintings, and b-movies. 
[In your trailer and description of the game, you've talked about how the player will be able to affect the narrative through choices throughout the game. Can you give us an example to show how this will work and how consequential a choice made in the game will be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldn93?context=5)|When you gain the ability to change a creator's past in The Black Glove, you're able to change one aspect of his or her Medium, Message, or Muse. There are three choices available for each. In the original trailer, you saw the art gallery scene full of skeletons made from materials like wood, gum, wax, and more. The selections for that were MEDIUM: painting/sculpture, MESSAGE: the internal, and MUSE: science. Then you watched as the MEDIUM was changed to Multimedia and when you saw that room again, everything was radically different. The entire room was bathed in (unsafe) x-ray light and the patrons on hand were the display.
 |I'm happy to give more examples, but I thought illustrating that one was a good place to start.
[I'm curious, how does this actually play out? So you change things around and...what, exactly? Is there a timed story that plays out? Do you trigger things through dialogue choices? I'm not sure I see how the overall narrative progression works.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllfub7?context=5)|There are larger and smaller narrative scenes playing out within the environment for you to observe and interact with. There's are also ambient storytelling and narrative for you to explore and excavate. There's a lot to take in and it's your job to figure out what's most important to act off of. These scenes will ideally be fairly entertaining. I want to make sure that the characters are eccentric geniuses who are just fun to be around. For example, Marisol is humorously obsessed with incredibly dangerous art mediums and the filmmaker Avery Arnault has Werner Herzog's sort of fascination with the world, philosophy, and art, but that strangely often veers towards absolute schlock.
[But she said it was all perfectly safe...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllgjm8?context=5)|Marisol goes through interns like nobody's business. She's fairly obsessed with mediums that are dangerous to be around. 
[So just curious how will you change things?  I'm fascinated but just not quite understanding how you steer the world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllfge0?context=5)|When you gain the ability to summon The Black Glove, you get a chance to choose one aspect of the creator's past to alter, which causes massive changes to their narrative and environment. As the narrative scenes in them play out, you'll investigate the world for clues to what to change next. The goal is to satisfy the whims of the Creator, Critic, and Crowd. They're a fickle bunch, so it'll take some digging to learn what will lead to a consensus of opinion.
 |I should add that this doesn't necessarily need to be your definition of success as a creator... It's just how we've chosen to determine it for the purposes of the game. :)
[The dialogue from this game was intense. What was your favorite line from the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllg6lc?context=5)|Thanks! Glad that you liked it. Not sure about my favorite line. Maybe, ""You're a hot-headed kid. If only we could put that rambunctiousness to good use!"" But partially because my colleague Bill hated it. My favorite upcoming story in the game is The Ballad of Erasmo Noddy, failed escape artist. There's also a lot of back and forth between theatre hosts Hazel and Cribbage that's been fun to write. I can't wait to get Tara Platt and Yuri Lowenthal back in the studio to record it. They're husband and wife voice talents who are are playing as exes who are... combative best friends.
[What was the most difficult thing you ever had to cut from a Bioshock game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clled1y?context=5)|ROBB: the most difficult thing that i had cut from Bioshock was a 4th Big Daddy in the works.
 |This may sounds funny, but I was pretty sad that we had to cut the Plasmid advertisement jingle for Peeping Tom. Collaborating with BioShock Infinite music director Jim Bonney on jingles and songs was some of the most fun I've had making games. The guy's work is just genius. There are a few Splicers who didn't make the cut, as well.
 |ROBB: it was a big daddy that had an organic leach-like slug that acted as a sort of puppeteer for the beast.
[ How do you get started as a writer in gaming?  It's something I've always wanted to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldvxe?context=5)|I got a creative writing degree, worked in magazines and web-sites for years, then taught myself the basics of level design and game writing using a commercially available game engine. That got me a foot-in-the-door as a level designer at EA. I was later able to write for a few games there and having been a level designer was completely invaluable. It's very different than writing for comics, film, etc. That and how I became a writer at Irrational are probably separate topics, if you want to hear more about either of them.
[Thank you, Mr. Fielder, I've just got a few more questions in response!  1- What would you recommend for getting started with level design?  2 - Is a degree required to get started in the gaming industry?  3 - Which game engine would be best to start with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllegwo?context=5)|1 - Learn how to become a self-starter and never give up. You really need to be able to teach yourself how to solve the many problems you'll encounter.  2 - Nope. I personally think that higher education is very important, but if you can prove you can do a job in the games industry, you'll likely get that job. I'd say the more you learn (whether it's through gaining a degree or your own research), the more you can bring to a game though. 3 - That really depends. I'd recommend doing research into the available level editors (Source, Unity, Unreal, etc) and finding out what's right for  you. There are many factors to consider: price, available resources for learning them, the type of game you want to make, and so on.
[ I'll do my best, Mr. Fielder.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllgiv7?context=5)|Glad to help!
[Is The Black Glove something that can permanently be summoned, or do you have to re-summon it every time its used? I feel like altering a part of one's past means changing it so you wouldn't have needed to summon the glove in the first place.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllgny0?context=5)|You summon The Black Glove through success in certain games of skill and chance, like The Maze of the Space Minotaur. That's to say, by accomplishing certain gameplay Feats. These are achievements that spotlight particularly fun elements or key strategies. So, essentially, you learn how to have the most fun and are rewarded by unlocking new narrative and immersive environments to explore.
 |To answer that question fully, every time you summon The Black Glove, you can change one aspect of a creator's past.
[Welcome to reddit! Great to see you on here. Now my question: I've heard many different things about working with Ken Levine. What is it really like? Is it better than work at a ""regular"" studio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/clldmer?context=5)|Ken's my favorite writer in the games industry. I consider him up there with the Coen Bros (Miller's Crossing, Fargo). He's a game developer with incredibly high standards, which he holds himself to most of all. Having him open his playbook to teach me how to write Splicers for BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea was one of my career highs.
[How is the story presented in the Black Glove? Does the game have a definitive ending, or is it simply about the experimentation with the different creators?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2khn44/we_are_former_irrational_games_devs_who_helped/cllg0n2?context=5)|There are a variety of successful endings for each character, plus each combination will have a different effect on the overall ending of the game. There are also a series of subnarratives planned that may take multiple playthrough or thorough digging to unearth completely.

2kjb9h,1,2014-10-27,Keeping up with programming languages while in college,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2kjb9h/keeping_up_with_programming_languages_while_in/,"This is something that has been bugging me during this semester. A little background info, I am on my third year of my BS in CS, I had an internship this Summer where I worked with iOS. A couple semesters back I took my second java programming course, which involved a lot of Android dev which I enjoyed and kept doing, last spring semester we had a database course where we covered SQL and not much of Java, so I kinda put it aside, this summer during the internship I focused a lot on learning Objective-C for the iOS project, mid-internship Apple revealed Swift. 

Now that I started this semester I tried looking back at Java and I have forgotten a lot of things, to the point where I have to start from the beggining refreshing the basic concepts which is very frustrating, this semester I am taking a computer architecture course and a operating systems course, none include coding, they're more theoretical. While refreshing Java and Android I feel like I'm forgetting Objective-C, which I don't want to lose, plus I have to start worrying about Swift too. I have a part-time job, so I have very little time after work and assignments to feel like I'm advancing my programming skills, get involved in projects or  start my own projects. 

So my question is how did you guys handle this while in college, what techniques can you recommend. It's very frustrating to have to start again and again with stuff that I've covered before. "

Interviewing season is upon us and I was wondering if anyone wants to do some mock interviews. I am thinking of doing some mock interviews if there’s an interest. To tell you a bit about myself, I’m a graduating senior at UC Berkeley, with 2 software engineering internships at Apple inc, and Salesforce. Recently, I accepted a job offer for fulltime. I’ve done more than 50 software engineering interviews in the past, have interviewed for 20+ for internships and fulltime, and have aggregated interview questions from companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Linkedin, Amazon, etc. I will be trying to imitate the normal interviewer attitude without breaking character for 30-45 min and only then will I give you the feedback.

I am doing this for free, and I am genuinely interested in helping you guys out. I believe that there is a lot to be learned from an interviewer's point of view and unfortunately you rarely get honest feedback from the companies.

If you’re interested, please PM me with your resume, and the companies that you want to prep yourself for.

EDIT: It seems like I've been shadowbanned. If anyone is interested, you can shoot me an email at stevn1202@gmail.com with your availability, resume, what you feel like you struggle the most during the interview and your expectations for the mock interview. Thanks! "
2kjkfk,0,2014-10-28,Lack of libido; what do?,[deleted],sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2kjkfk/lack_of_libido_what_do/,"Mostly heterosexual female, mid-20s, college student here.

I've been sexually active since I was 17, a few months shy of 18, and have since either regularly had sex with a committed partner, or didn't go more than a few months without a hook-up. I masturbated at least twice a week, more when I wasn't having regular sex. For a while, that's just how I rolled. I loved sex and I loved feeling sexy and I'm one of the lucky ones who's able to cum fairly easily but also didn't feel the need to cum. That made sex relaxing and easy for the most part (we had some problems with my first boyfriend, but that's not an issue.)

I've been with my current boyfriend for nearly a year now and I don't know if it's the stress of being back at school and being super involved on campus while trying to find another internship and/or job, but my libido's been incredibly low. Like I haven't wanted sex basically since the semester started, while I used to drive to him like 45 minutes away when he couldn't get to me during the summer just so we could hang out and fuck.

It's been really, really difficult to get in the mood. I've bought myself lingerie and tried to get a decent night's sleep/good diet/light exercise (the lack of which didn't affect my libido at all last year) and nothing's worked. I barely even masturbate, and last year I used to find time when my roommate would go to the bathroom to see how fast I could get off, or touch myself silently when I knew she had completely fallen asleep.

It's just really concerning and I'm not sure what to do. I'm not taking anything, I'm not on BC (I use condoms), I'm eating healthier, and there hasn't been a big change in my relationship with my boyfriend either. I just want to want sex again. I don't even want to touch myself and that's really distressing."
2kjki8,2,2014-10-28,"Broke down today, just wanted to share with someone who can relate",tytbalt,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2kjki8/broke_down_today_just_wanted_to_share_with/,"I'm 25, female, diagnosed primarily inattentive type at 15. 

Graduated college a semester early, planned on going to grad school but decided I needed to take a year off. I had been doing lab internships in addition to full time course load and independent research projects,  and was burnt out.

Then got into a comitted relationship with a younger guy who had 2 years left in undergrad, so I pushed off grad school ""for just one more year"" in order to be supportive and stay with him. Well then a number of things happened...he conveniently decided to drop a major class and take 5 years to graduate instead of 4, WITHOUT consulting me at all. We broke up. I moved onto my friend's couch. It was emotional and tumultuous,  I was basically homelss and wasn't sleeping well, and then I accidentally nodded off at work and got fired for it. 

So then instead of being able to focus on applying to grad school,  I was broke, homeless, and desperate to find a job and not have to move back in with my parents.  I managed to do this, but had to put off grad school applications for yet another year. Spent most of that year depressed and suicidal. Then August rolls around and I get laid off. At this point, I figure, fuck it all, I'm moving cross country with my roommate to start fresh. Am unemployed for 4+ months, completely and totally broke, 100% unable to take the GRE or apply to schools. Finally find work,  which I hate, but at least I'm doing it, picking up the pieces, trying new things, and supporting myself. Amazingly enough, I met and fell in love with an amazing man who asked me to marry him 4 weeks ago. 

Fast forward to now. Due to financial troubles,  intense stress at the job I hate, and then the excitement and stressful planning of getting married,  I have managed to procrastinate on my grad school prep, yet again. 

Reading my grad school prep book, I find put that October is the last month to take the test and have the scores reported by admission deadlines of Jan 1. So in my typical impulsive manner, today I called in sick to work, paid and registered for the GRE, and began studying all day in order to take the test by Thursday,  the deadline. I was just 300% done with having to work yet another year doing what I hate and putting off my dreams.

And then I realized what a horrible idea that was. My verbal and writing practice sections have gone well, but the math portion...utter disaster. I spent the last 2 hours just...sobbing in despair. I am so sick and fucking tired of the infinite procrastination that I can not escape. I'm sick of being told I have potential but never, ever living up to it. I'm sick of being smart yet always struggling. Sick of working at a job I hate that I'm not even good at.

I just wish I were different. I just wish I were better. I just wish I were a competent, accomplished person. Not the failure that keeps trying to push her fucking rock up the hill, expecting different results,  only to be reminded yet again that it rolls back down to the bottom every. Fucking. Time.

It's paid (pretty well) and is full time, but it is very boring and somewhat soul crushing. When I work on programming it's so much more interesting and engaging to me, I get somewhat consumed by it.

 My plan right now is to just keep working until February and then go to grad school full time, I'm part time right now studying computer science. However, I'm tempted to just quit and go to graduate school full time right away after December, but I would be forgoing a decent chunk of money by not working an extra 1.5-2 months. I could save a few thousand more if I did that. It's essentially the difference of taking out more loans or not. 

I guess what my question is, is doing better in grad school for just one term and speeding up my progress by one term worth quitting my well paying internship 1.5-2 months early?

I may not be one but i sure do feel like one, an alcoholic.  I drink most days just cause or because it was a bad day and I feel bad for whatever reason and I want a drink.  Most days is because its there and I have nothing else better to do with my life.  I just feel depressed but drinking is one way to make myself happy or at least seem happy to others and myself.

I am a person to just bottle my problems and keep a smile on my face but in reality I just feel like shit and haven't been fully happen in a long time.  The last time I was happy and had no worries was when I was a child, I am now a Sr in college.

I now just get drunk to try and sleep most nights.  My biggest problem is that I feel alone.  Prior to this year I was ""happy"" to be alone and being able to function without anyone , except for the friends that I had.  This past summer I had an internship that I liked and connected with my co-workers really well.  Which changed my perspective a little bit on life, as to what I have to look forward too; that of wealth but with singularity.  I realized I was alone and didn't have that one person to talk to, my days consisted of waking up , going to work, watching netflix then rinse and repeat   

I would like to consider myself smart but in reality I am just a lazy fuck that doesn't have to do much to get good grades.  I drink on a regular basis, but maintain Dean's list at my university.  I just don't know what to look forward to anymore my grades are fine, I have a well paying job, i've traveled and I have a caring family.   What else do I have to do now.

One of my bigger problems is that I've never had a girlfriend.  I just finally lost my virginity this past month.  At school I just see couples, and think to myself what the fuck did I do wrong.  Girls always say they are looking for that nice guy but always end up with some douche bag. 

I am a nice guy but after what I've been through, I've turned into a cold hearted bastard that just does not care anymore.  It fucking sucks!  I will be the first person to admit that I am not the most socially out going person.  This has hurt me in many different ways, especially when it comes to girls.  I have my close friends but I don't have many outside of that.  Most of my male friends have plenty of close friends that are girls I don't, I am a straight male.  Most of my friends are in constant contact with their GF's or close female friends, where as I am just sitting in my room working or watching netflix.  

 I am just sicking of being alone.  I've tried with a few girls this past year but it has yet to work out in my favor.  It seems like what ever I do I get shut down or just get the shit end of the stick.  I try but I seem to find the girls that just won't work, where my fiends can find a girlfriend with no problem.  I just want to be happy but no matter what I do or try it never just seems to work out.


 Sorry for this being so long it has just been bothering me for a while.  Also sorry for the poor grammar and spelling, I am a little drunk.           "
2kjwmb,9,2014-10-28,Pros and cons of submitting to arXiv?,T_hank,computervision,https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/2kjwmb/pros_and_cons_of_submitting_to_arxiv/,"I asked this on /r/machinelearning , and wanted to compare the computer vision community's opinions with theirs.

Recently I have seen many papers on arXiv, which seem to be of good quality yet the authors have not (yet?) published to any mainstream publication. an example of this might be ""From Generic to Specific Deep Representations for Visual Recognition"" , ""Why do linear SVMs trained on HOG features perform so well""...

What is the CV community's view on this? some particular questions:

1. What do the big publications (I/ECCV,CVPR) think about breaking the double blind with an arXiv upload?

2. Are the amount and volume of reviews that one gets from people reading their work on arXiv worth the risk?

3. How does one get visibility for their work? Is the situation very different if you already are a known entity in the field, vs when you are a student looking for their first publication, say? Of course this would be different when submitting to something like ICLR where arXiv IS the platform, rather than just uploading at any random time of the year. I am asking about the latter.

4. A question that is personally important, if I apply for an internship, would they rate an arXiv upload?"

The situation is that I'm graduating from my bachelor educations in January 2015. I'm studying an engineering degree in global operations management, and meanwhile also a BA degree (so two degrees all at once). 
     
  
   
I've been working as an intern for the past 2½ years for a global company with about 18,000 employees worldwide. This means that I have gained a lot of experience doing my education, from educational relate projects that the company could benefit from. 
    
    
    
I have decided that I will not continue on a Master before I have finished the BA and found the right one for where I see myself in the future. So I told my boss, Director within LEAN on a Group level, that I would like to stay after my graduation as a Group Consultant within LEAN Manufacturing. He was very happy to hear that I would stay, and would like to hire me immediately. But (yes, there is always a ""but""), our company is going through a tough time right now financially, our profit margin is way to low, and this means there will be a round of layoffs very soon. It will not affect me as an Intern, but a consequence could be that I won't be hired after me graduation. 
    
   
    
So, I decided to look for other job opportunities at other companies, instead of betting all my money on one horse. I found a job at another global company, and that  is my ultimate dream job based on the job description. It is a job as Director of LEAN (just like my boss at my current position). I would really like to give it a shot, because I love to work with people and see a team make results. But here is the thing; I'm only 24 years old, and even though I've been a part of my current company since 2006 (started as a working boy), I know that my life experience is very low compared to other applicants. I believe that I realistically would be able to fulfill the job/task, based on the job description, and my 2 ½ years experience within professional LEAN Operation would be a major help.
    
   
   
But would I even be taken seriously? I mean, a 24 years old guy, applying for a management job replying to a Senior VP, as a Director. I believe some from the HR department would have a good laugh.
   
   
   
What do you think? (I am deeply serious, otherwise I wouldn't have submitted this question)
  
  
  
""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"", so I do not see any reason not to try, nothing to lose right. But any thoughts would be very welcomed. "

My problem now is I've lost motivation and I'm constantly tired.  I get 8 hours of sleep when I can, and if I can't then I'll take a short nap (like 15-20 mins) to keep me going through the day until I got to sleep.  Even when I do get enough sleep, I'm still tired throughout the entire day.  My motivation is also dwindling.  I used to have a constantly clean room, have clean laundry all the time, and cook good and healthy meals for myself.  All of that is gone now.  It's my last year in college, and I've lost motivation to keep up on my school work as well.  I got an internship over the summer that was extended because they liked my work ethic, and now I just can't keep it going.  I'm afraid they're going to let me go because of it.

I work out three times a week and play IM sports too.  I heard that is supposed to help, but it's just not.  I don't feel depressed or anything, it's just the above problems.  I've taken adderall before (not prescribed, I know it's bad) and of course it got me right up and going, but I'm afraid to go to my dermatologist and say that I wouldn't mind getting on a small dose of that to just give me a kick.

The first thing the interviewer did was confess that he has no idea what the internship is, and has no tech knowledge. He said that the owner of the company wants to set up an Intranet for their ~100 employees (expected to grow up to 300).

They're literally just looking for someone to do that. I told him I had no idea how to go about doing that, and I think it's something you'd need to hire professionals to set up. 

He said that if they purchase the software or hire people to set it up, would I be able to figure it out and configure/develop it.

I made it very clear that I have no experience with it, but he said they'd pay me just to try. The whole thing feels very sketchy, but as a senior in my CS program with **no** success in landing an internship, I'm considering it.

At one point an angry caller calls in and criticizes that the show has too many friends of the show on the air and says that it is the ""Ron and Fez Show"" and requests more bits just between just Ron and Fez and more interviews with celebrities.  Ron then explains they have 20 hours a week to fill and that they depend on the callers and friends of the show to help out.
 
At 1:18:00 Ron explains they depend on the callers to help the show.
At 1:19:00 Ron says that the problems with having celebrity guests on the show is that they all have something to sell and are on every single show with the same thing; Fez chimes in with ""they all get caught selling something and it sounds cheesy.""

I can only imagine how much 2001 Ron and Fez would rip apart this current version of the show.  I distribute the blame equally between Fez falling apart and SXM pushing guests on the show while simultaneously taking away any kind of fan interaction with the show.

Also, there is a great soundbite at 46:50 where Ron and Fez are criticizing an intern for allowing too much dead air.

This weekend I also heard another old show where Ron mentioned how much he likes Omaha Steaks and their stuffed potato.  Made me really cringe to think about what 2014 Ron Bennington would say about this version of his on-air personality."

It just seemed/seems like a cool job to have and though stressful you are making a difference and to me it looks pretty fun to keep the peace. However in my second year of high school I found a love for technology and took some IT classes and I really enjoyed solving technical problems and working with computer hardware. However I still have the thought of law enforcement in my mind. I figure I am pretty good with stressful situations and am in pretty good shape especially running/cycling wise. I also am a really good shot (used to be on the rifle team at school) if I do say so myself with various firearms.

I am in college now for Information Technology and I have an internship coming up in the IT department at the jail my dad now works at. I feeling like while I am there doing IT work the thought will constantly be to take the law enforcement route instead. This also means that with the connections my dad has and his friends in various departments it wouldn't be all that hard. I guess the one thing stopping me is that I used to have mild/minor anxiety and still do sometimes so I was worried that it would have an effect if I worked in law enforcement but my anxiety pretty much ended after I finished high school so maybe it was just that. One thing is either way I will be finishing 4 years of college.

Any and all advice would be SUPER helpful.

EDIT: Here is a pro and con list I have in mind for each career:

Law enforcement pros:

* Always new and adapting situations keep you on your toes
* Police officers are some of the best people I have ever met
* So many opportunities such as SWAT, DA, under cover, drug units, etc.
* Just think its a really cool job
* A lot more experience with this stuff (police summer camps, 3 years of Marine ROTC and drill team, lots of time at the range, avid runner)

Cons:

* Not pay very well
* Hard to get a job
* Stressful

IT Pros:

* Working in a nice office around technology that I like
*  Usually pretty cool people to work with
* Good pay 
* Lots of jobs
* Some advancement opportunities such as database manager and systems admin

Cons:

* Could get boring after a while
* Dealing with people who get mad at you when their computer fails them (of they fail it) 
* Regret if I don't like it and don't pursue law enforcement 
* Not much experience with IT"

I know  the fact that old codebases exist and that people have to take care of them.

when I talked about it to the senior Software engineer at the company, he said that is common and in every 10 ASP.net jobs, 9 of them want developer who work on ASP.net webforms 2.0 or at best 3.5 and any MVC jobs require someone who have 3 years job experience.

I'm not embellishing anything, so i apologise if its not exciting enough, however this has been pretty therapeutic as a lot of this has never really been told to anyone. So i've just been bottling up and getting more and more pissed off with myself for not being the bad ass I know I can be much sooner.

Anyway onto Lexxie and her attempts to be the ultimate con artist.

**Characters**

- Lexxie: Obviously, this story starts somewhere around the middle of 1st year and unfortunately her attempts to con and lie didn't end until I ceased contact with her 7 years later, this con in particular lasted around a year.  She looks like Princess Jasmine with a huge bottom, dresses like a clubber sex worker but swears shes a total virgin despite her tales of the contrary.

- Shaun: Whilst he starts off as the victim he'll prove himself to be just as much of an arsehole like any bad person out there, curly hair, does martial arts and somewhat neckbeardy.  Lexxie's first boyfriend at Uni.


**Storytime**

So Lexxie met Shaun in her classes, their relationship started just as it would for any somewhat mental couple.  Lexxie used any given opportunity to talk about Shaun and developed the ability to turn any subject in Shaun;

Cardboard......Shaun likes cardboard

Foot fungus.....Shaun is studying fungus

Tampons....Shaun once sucked vodka out of a tampon

You get the gist.

Besides this Lexxie also kept a notebook, in which she carefully wrote down each and every text message Shaun sent her.  Lexxie would then show this Kitty and myself and swoon about how Shaun was totally going to marry her.  Even when we pointed out the relationship was mere weeks old, it didn't matter, Lexxie just knew, IT WAS FATE.

Unfortunately for Lexxie, Shaun was a bit of a flirt, and in his words he had *""no idea as to how all these naked girly pics kept turning up on his phone""*.  Anyway it didn't matter what we said to Lexxie about him, she stood by him, insisting that the girls were evil whores trying to steal her man.

Now around the same time as this was going, I was growing increasingly ill, through some miracle my periods had re-started, but I was in excrutiating pain and was vomiting non stop.  I was spending more or less about 2 weeks out of every month vomiting daily and having intense cluster headaches and stomach pains.  The other two weeks of the month, my immune system was so screwed up I was catching every bug going so I was vomiting regardless. I still turned up to classes but I was continuously having to make sure I had a seat near the exit at the back of the lecture theatre as I was having to run out to the toilets to be sick. 

Naturally people were worried, so Lexxie and her new found relationship weren't getting the attention that they deserved so Lexxie starting being 'ill' too. However previous experience had taught the gang to be suspect of Lexxie and her claims so she focused on playing up her illness to Shaun, his family and the University.

Lexxie initially started off with migraines, however migraines are relatively easy to treat, at least on the pain side of things.  So she proceeded to claim she was allergic to all painkillers and antibiotics, so there was no cure for Lexxie.  On top of this she starting playing up her metabolism, telling Shaun that she needed to eat all the time and in huge quantities as her metabolism was too fast and causing her to lose weight too quickly.  Of course, the only solution for this was for Shaun to order takeout or take Lexxie to restaurants every. single. day. 

Lexxie then used these various ailments to get out of doing exams she hadn't prepared for so she could sit them at a more convenient time.  This had the added benefit of getting Lexxie a room to herself during exam time and often there was no invigilator making regular checks so it became easier for Lexxie to cheat in exams using smuggled notes or mobile internet. 

She also made sure to always be ill when around Shaun's family, so she got their sympathy and became besties with Shaun's sister. 

Then came the big con...

So Shaun worked in high class bar as a barman, whilst the wages were average, the tips here were huge, think making around £100 in tips for a 4 hour shift. More if you were female, as the bar was frequently attended by the business men and the more well off students. In addition, this bar was built inside a former church, all stone and gothic looking, so it was a pretty swish affair. Lexxie wanted in, so Shaun got her an interview, it went well and she got the job.  

Lexxie kept the job for a week before managing to walk into a stone doorway.   Yes she claimed that she had worked into the doorway and knocked herself out.  Shaun's boss found her on her back in the cellar of the bar, and got Shaun to take her to the local hospital.  There the Doctor on duty advised Shaun to take Lexxie back to his to keep an eye on her for 24 hours in case of a concussion.  Fair enough you all say, walking into stone, head first can cause a concussion, but not with Lexxie...

For a **WHOLE** year Lexxie claimed she had a concussion!  For a **WHOLE** year she guilt tripped Shaun's family into letting her stay with them rent free as she didn't want to be alone incase she fell into a coma.  For a **WHOLE** year she slept in Shaun's room, a room he shared with his younger brother.  That poor boy spent a year having to listen to Shaun and Lexxie have sex in the bunk bed beneath him. 

How do I know all this, because Lexxie would frequently try and get me over to Shauns where I would decline her 'generous' offers of his parent's food and I got to meet Shaun's poor exhausted family.  

If this wasn't enough Lexxie also used the concussion to delay her final first year exams and repeat classes she couldn't be bothered to attend the following year.  All with a full bursary and without paying extra tuition fees since if the Uni tried to question her, she would pull the race card to boot.  This became a recurring theme each year, which is why I knew Lexxie as long as I did even though she didn't switch subjects or do any internships.  Her course was only 4 years long but she made it last 7 years by faking illnesses and the whole time she continued to receive student funding and bursaries and often didn't have to pay tuition fees.   On top of this she committed benefit fraud, tried to fake my signature when I refused to help her commit said benefit fraud and would frequently quit jobs within a week or so of starting claiming an accident or illness.  She would then demand pay and compensation for her suffering and use her race as an excuse if her employers didn't pay up.  

All of this though was still just the start of Lexxie showing her true colours, I think the fact that it was initially directed at the gang and myself is why we all so oblivious also she cut herself off from most of the gang when she started dating Shaun as well as made Shaun cut himself off from most of his friends.  Since Lexxie needed his full attention so her needs could be met, shame Shaun became a lot less enamoured with Lexxie after this as they turned out to be pretty suited to each other in the end.

That everyone is the tale of Lexxie, the con artist.

2klz6e,7,2014-10-28,"May be of interest to some: A few dozen quotes from ""The Crisis of Democracy"". *More in comments due to space restrictions*",Brickus,chomsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/2klz6e/may_be_of_interest_to_some_a_few_dozen_quotes/,"I just finished typing up relevant quotes from *The Crisis of Democracy* with regards to the sections on Europe, the United States, and the conclusions. I figured that some of you on here might like to have them here for your own future use, or whatever else. I deleted most of my own notes from when I was typing up the quotes but I've left some in for clarificatory purposes.

&gt; **Quotes from The Crisis of Democracy**
&gt; 
&gt; “The report that follows is not a pessimistic document. Its authors believe that, in a fundamental sense, the democratic systems are viable. They believe, furthermore, that democracies can work provided their publics truly understand the nature of the democratic system, and particularly if they are sensitive to the subtle relationship between liberty and responsibility. Their discussion of ‘The Crisis of Democracy’ is designed to make democracy stronger as it grows and becomes more and more democratic. Their conclusions - doubtless in some respects provocative - are designed to serve that overriding objective” p. i Introductory note - Zbigniew Brezinski 
&gt; 
&gt; **Michel J. Crozier - Europe**
&gt; 
&gt; “A principle purpose of this report is to identify and to analyze the challenges confronting democratic government in today’s world, to ascertain the bases for optimism or pessimism about the future of democracy, and to suggest whatever innovations may seem appropriate to make democracy more viable in the future” p. 3 
&gt; 
&gt; “In some measure, the advanced industrial societies have spawned a stratum of value-oriented intellectuals who often devote themselves to the derogation of leadership, the challenging of authority, and the unmasking and delegitimization of established institutions, their behavior contrasting with that of the also increasing numbers of technocratic and policy-oriented intellectuals. In an age of widespread secondary school and university education, the pervasiveness of the mass media, and the displacement of manual labour by clerical and professional employees, this development constitutes a challenge to democratic government which is, potentially, at least, as serious as those posed in the past by the aristocratic cliques, fascist movements, and communist parties” p. 7 
&gt; 
&gt; “At the present time, a significant challenge comes from the intellectuals and related groups who assert their disgust with the corruption, materialism, and inefficiency of democracy and with the subservience of democratic government to ‘monopoly capitalism’. The development of an ‘adversary culture’ among intellectuals has affected students, scholars, and the media” p. 6 
&gt; 
&gt; “In all three Trilateral regions, a shift in values is taking place away from the materialistic work-oriented, public-spirited values toward those which stress private satisfaction, leisure, and the need for ‘belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment’. These values are, of course, most notable in the younger generation. They often coexist with greater skepticism towards political leaders and institutions and with greater alienation from the political processes. They tend to be privatistic in their impact and import” p. 7
&gt; 
&gt; “The new values may not survive recession and resource shortages. But if they do, they pose an additional new problem for democratic government interns of its ability to mobilize its citizens for the achievement of social and political goals and to impose discipline and sacrifice upon its citizens in order to achieve these goals” p. 7 
&gt; 
&gt; “There is deeper reason for pessimism if the threats to democracy arise ineluctably from the inherent workings of the democratic process itself. Yet, in recent years, the operations of the democratic process do indeed appear to have generated a breakdown of traditional means of social control, a delegitimation of political and other forms of authority, and an overload of demands on government, exceeding its capacity to respond” p. 8 
&gt; 
&gt; “The vague and persistent feeling that democracies have become ungovernable has been growing steadily in Western Europe” p. 11
&gt; 
&gt; “…two basic characteristics hold true about the basic problem of governability [in Europe]:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The European political systems are overloaded with participants and demands, and they have increasingly difficulty in mastering the very complexity which is the natural result of their economic growth and political development. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The bureaucratic cohesiveness they have to sustain in order to maintain their capacity to decide and implement tends to foster irresponsibility and the breakdown of consensus, which increase in turn the difficulty of their task” p. 12 
&gt; 
&gt; “Open systems, however, give bette returns only under certain conditions…. European democracies have been only partially and sometimes theoretically open. Their regulations were built on subtle screening of participants and demands; and if we can talk of over, notwithstanding the progress made in handling complexity, it is because this traditional model of screening and government by distance has gradually broken down to the point that the necessary regulations have all but disappeared” p. 12 
&gt; 
&gt; “There are a number of interrelated reasons for this situation. First of all, social and economic developments have made it possible for a great many more groups and interests to coalesce. Second, the information explosion has made it difficult if not impossible to maintain the traditional distance that was deemed necessary to govern. Third, the democratic ethos makes it difficult to prevent access and restrict information, while the persistence of the bureaucratic processes which has been associated with the traditional governing systems makes it impossible to handle them at a low enough level. Because of the instant information model and because of this lack of self-regulating subsystems, any kind of minor conflict becomes a governmental problem” p. 13 
&gt; 
&gt; Another issue with the European system was the lack of consensus between the population and the traditional power elite. The former began to “vote for extreme parties, of the left and to some extend of the right,” and on top of this, “they do not accept the minima requirements of the democratic system” p. 17 
&gt; 
&gt; “Lack of consensus in it’d turn makes it indispensable to resort to bureaucratic rule, since one cannot take the risk of involving citizens who do not accept the minimum rules of the game. Generally, when social control has been traditionally achieved by strong bureaucratic pressure, democratic consensus has not developed fully and consensual breakdowns are endemic possibilities” p. 17 
&gt; 
&gt; Another cause of the crisis was the so-called “increase of social interaction” (Crozier, Huntington, and Watanuki, 1975, p. 20). This resulted in the breakdown of the means of “traditional social control imposed upon the individual by collective authorities, especially the state, and by hierarchical religious institutions” (Crozier, Huntington, and Watanuki, 1975, p. 21). In turn, this meant that citizens “resist any kind of social control that is associated with the hierarchical values they have learned to discard and reject. The problem may be worldwide, but it is exacerbated in Europe, where social discipline is not worshipped as it still is in Japan, and where more indirect forms of social control have not developed as in North America” (Crozier, Huntington, and Watanuki, 1975, p. 21). 
&gt; 
&gt; “The contradiction regarding social control has been amplified by the near collapse of the traditional authority structure which was buttressing social control processes. The collapse is partly due to the disruptive effect of change, but it can also be viewed as the logical outcome of a general evolution of the relationship of the individual to society” p. 25 
&gt; 
&gt; “This is, of course, much more true for young people…. In such a context traditional authority had to be put into question” p. 25 
&gt; 
&gt; “The late sixties have been a major turning point. The amount of underlying change was dramatically revealed in the political turmoil of the period which forced a sort of moral showdown over a certain form of traditional authority. Its importance has been mistaken inasmuch as the revolt seemed to be aiming at political goals. What was at stake appears now to be moral much more than political authority - churches, schools, and cultural organizations more than political and even economic institutions” p. 26 
&gt; 
&gt; “It [teaching and the educational system] has lost is former authority. Teachers cannot believe anymore in their ‘sacred’ mission and their students to not accept their authority as easily as they did before…. Knowledge is widely shared. Teachers have lost their prestige within society, and the closed hierarchical relations that made the powerful figures in the classroom have disappeared” p. 27 
&gt; 
&gt; “We seem to be, as a matter of fact, in a cultural crisis which may be the greatest challenge that confronts Western societies, inasmuch as our incapacity to develop appropriate decision-making mechanisms - the ungovernability of our societies - is a cultural failure” p. 30 
&gt; 
&gt; ""They [intellectuals] are this prepared to expect a completely different pattern of activities and relational ships with the outside world than is actually the case” p. 31 
&gt; 
&gt; “The media have… become an autonomous power. It is not new to talk about the Fourth Estate. But we now are witnessing a crucial change when the profession tends to regulate itself in such a way as to resist pressure from financial or governmental interests” p. 35 
&gt; 
&gt; “Behind all these governability problems of modern Western societies lie some more basic problems of values. Participation, people’s consent, equality, the right of the collectivity to intervene in personal affairs, and the possible acceptance of authority seem to be the preliminary questions to debate before giving a reasonable diagnosis and proposing possible solutions” p. 39 
&gt; 
&gt; On the inadequacy of opinion polls: “For instance, shortly before the French student’s revolt in May 1968, opinion polls gave an almost idyllic representation of student’s docility, conformism, and even satisfied apathy” p. 39 
&gt; 
&gt; “The system has worked well enough as long as societal change was slow, the intervention of public authorities rather limited, and the fragmentation and stratification of society strong enough to insure a pragmatic acceptance of social order and established authority. But once the explosion of communication and social interaction has disturbed the necessary barriers that made societies more simple and therefore more manageable, this basis pattern of rationality disintegrates” p. 41 
&gt; 
&gt; “All over Western Europe the development of social interaction, the disruptive effects of cumulative change, the cultural drift, and the exposure of government to media publicity have made it more and more difficult to maintian [sic] social control and to answer demands of the citizens. Traditional rationality, therefore, disintegrates. But values or core political beliefs are not affected. They may even be reinforced” p. 46 
&gt; 
&gt; “Earlier democratic processes had been built on the separation of groups and classes. They relied as much on institutionalized noncommunication as on democratic confrontation. Authority was worshipped as an indispensable means for achieving order although it was rejected as a dangerous interference with freedom. Such a model could not stand structural changes that destroys barriers, force people to compete outside traditional limits, and suppress the distance that protected traditional authority. A profound contradiction therefore develops. People tend to trey different and more open practices or are being forced into them, but they cannot stand the tensions these practices bring. Since they cannot also stand the authority that could moderate these tensions and bring back order over them, a very resilient vicious circle develops. Little real learning takes place, and authority hides behind public relations and complexity but becomes more vulnerable because it does not dare to assert itself” p. 47 
&gt; 
&gt; “Indeed, all European nations have to live through the same impossible situation: They have to carry through a basic mutation in their model of government and their mode of social control whiles facing at the same time a crisis from within and a crisis from without” p. 53 
&gt; 
&gt; On how to solve the crisis in Europe: “First, they should try to accelerate the shift away from their old model of fragmentation, stratification, secrecy, and distance, which produced an acceptable balance between democratic processes, bureaucratic authority, and some aristocratic tradition, and experiment with more flexible models that could produce more social control with less coercive pressure. Such experimentation, which is bound to succeed in the long run, looks dangerous in the present vulnerable situation when we hesitate naturally to jeopardize what remains of the old means of social control as long as one is not sure of the quality of the new means. Innovation, nevertheless, seems to be absolutely indispensable. It has to be careful innovation, but it is the only possible answer to Europe’s dilemma” p. 55

I'm currently a Junior and I'm applying for internships this coming spring. 

I'm worried I don't have a lot of experience to apply for anything. I'd want to work at a CE job like at Intel/AMD. But I'm afraid that I don't have the qualifications.

About me:
Have above 3.5 gpa at low ranked (but ABET accredited school). I've taken the following courses that I think can apply:
In computers:
Digital Logic, Computer Architecture I, Computer Architecture II. 
Embedded systems:
Introduction to Embedded Systems, Advanced Embedded/RTOS 
Semiconductors:
QM for EEs, Solid State Device Physics

Everything else I'm taking are the usual classes: 
EM, Signals, Control Systems, Power, Microelectronics etc.
I don't take Analog or Digital IC design until Senior year unfortunately because of scheduling. 

I have some projects done for embedded systems using an Atmel chip on AVR and C, along with some ARM projects using the Beaglebone and RTOS related projects. 

I have a single cycle and a pipe lined processor (Correllating predictor, decent Cache subsystem) in verilog. I also have a survey paper from my second computer architecture course over DRAM systems and current advancements, where I learned a considerable amount about DRAM systems. 

I have a LinkedIn account, CollegeFeed, and InternMatch setup. 

I've reviewed my Resume and CV, and have sample cover letters that I can adapt to the company I'm applying for. I've been to some mock interviews held by the career services and my EE department. I have work experience both as a student worker, and a Undergrad Research assistant for 3 semesters. 

I have a decent amount of knowledge of C, Java and Python, with a lot of projects done in Java as I learned OO design and Data structures courses using the language. I have a very basic amount of knowledge using Matlab, just enough to do my signals class homework and my semiconductors homework. So writing a script needed to do the homework sections, nothing more. 

edit: Wanted to add that I also know assembly for AVR, MIPS ( 5 class projects in my 2 comp arch classes) and two x86 homework assignments.  I also know basic scripting with Perl. 

I'm interested in Computer Architecture, particularly uArch (I liked making the processors in verilog and using the FPGA), and Semicondcutors (I like my QM class a lot and liked basic Solid State physics quite a bit). 

I like to state that I know the above two fields are usually Masters or in the case of Comp Arch, a PhD field, but I'm actually looking for any internship at any company, those are just my current favorite areas. 

What should I do to prepare for an entry internship for the coming spring?

 I'm looking at very entry level positions for hardware (actually for anything @) Intel, AMD, Broadcomm, KLA Tencor, GloFlo, Micron, Intel, TI, Freescale, NI, Sandisk, ARM, Marvel, Applied Materials, ON semiconductors, Atmel and Nvidia.

I'm also looking into a REU over the summer at CMU or UCSB and other Universities. 

Thanks for any help reddit!  

Edit: Added Atmel and some missing words. Also forgot to add that I know assembly, although a very basic amount."

My GPA is not so high but not so low neither (~3.1) and I do have internship experience from a big company.

I feel like alot of companies are not looking for new graduates and its getting quite frustrating getting no respond from anyone. Do you guys have some tips for finding a job?"
2kmjgt,2,2014-10-28,[CAN] Should I study ahead for the CPA or take advantage of my last summer?,MissCeec,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2kmjgt/can_should_i_study_ahead_for_the_cpa_or_take/,"I just accepted a Fall 2015 full-time offer from a B4 in a major Canadian city but I'm graduating in December. With a winter internship taking up 3 months, I have to wait 5 additional months before starting full-time. I have the option of starting my CPA modules over the summer and be 2 modules ahead of all the other new hires in September but I'm not sure if I should follow through with this.

After talking to other staff from the office, it seems like being ahead is actually doing me a disservice because:

* Few (if any) study buddies
* Lots of moral support when everyone is going through the same phase
* The firms has a better support structure for people starting Mod 1 in the fall
* I should go travelling because this will be the last time I will ever have this much freedom

Normally I would also choose to start in September but my mom (also an accountant) is forcing me to start early because it provides some leeway in case I fail a module exam (worst case scenario). Getting this B4 offer has been an uphill battle for me since sophomore year, having already gone through 2 failed recruitment cycles. My GPA was bad (low 70s so probably a &lt; 3.0) but I managed to improve significantly during my last year by studying my ass off. I'm obviously super grateful that the firm saw something in me so I don't want to be ""that person"" who fails a module exam and gets left behind. If my grades have been a problem in the past, I'm worried I might not be able to handle studying and busy season very well, and this might actually be a smart insurance mechanism. 

Sorry for the long backstory. My questions are:

1. What's the likelihood of actually failing a module? If you know someone who failed a module exam, what were the circumstances that led to it?
2. Should I give up my last summer of freedom to study? I will have April free regardless so I'm talking about May-Aug.

Thank you so much r/accounting!"
2kmlcz,8,2014-10-28,Become Programmer – No Prior Knowledge – 34 Years Old,MrEric1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2kmlcz/become_programmer_no_prior_knowledge_34_years_old/,"Recently at my employer they were offering to train current employees in programming. Now, it was for COBOL programming. However, it sparked my interest enough to consider applying for it. I ultimately did not do so, however, that process did expose me to the world of programming and planted a little seed in my mind. I never considered that becoming a programmer would even be possible without going back in time to college, getting a computer science degree and a good internship, etc.
 
There seem to be a lot of encouraging voices out there saying “You can do this!”, “Just practice one hour a day!”, etc. These voices come from various YouTube teachers/channels and places like Codecademy, etc. Then there are articles listing computer programmer and similar positions as having some of the best job prospects out of any job. These two variables got me really excited about potentially diving in and changing careers at some point. However, the more research I have done the more unrealistic this seems to be. Employers (understandably so) all want good experience. I’m not sure I could say “Hey, I’ve completed all these codecademy courses and have done some random work on Github” and expect to have any decent response. There is also a hefty dose of real worldism here on reddit.
 
So, my main question is. Do I just have my head in the clouds with all of this? If I only have the time for an hour a day to learn is it realistic to think I could land a job as a programmer in the future? Is it even worth it considering if I’m already 34? It would seem like there would be more than enough young up and comers to fill the shoes of “Junior Analyst”, etc. However, if demand is really so high for these jobs you would think that it would be relatively simple enough to get your shoe in the door. I’m uncertain and confused. All thoughts welcome and appreciated."

I know that some employers will require me to send my transcript at certain stages in the application process, so how should I deal with and explain this to them? The worst thing I want to have happen is have my offer withdrawn after they see my transcript."

I've realized that I like nano, but I'm really passionate about programming and computers, which does not share as much overlap in my degree as my younger self imagined. 


I've decided that my two major career options are to pursue a job in scientific computation, since it makes use of all my current skills (nano+programming), or to pursue a job in the tech industry. I've identified strategies that would help me on these paths, and need help eliminating the choice. 


I feel that in order to pursue scientific computation, I would need at least a Master's degree. I would study something like computational physics or chemistry, and aim to do a project that would help me develop some useful tech skills as well (eg, writing high-performance C++).


I feel that to get into the tech industry, I need a few things. I would want to take a few classes, to enhance my formal knowledge. I would want to build my portfolio and github profile. And I would want to get an internship at a tech company. If I delay my graduation by a year, I could accomplish all of these things before graduating.


So, given that I'm undecided about which career to aim for, is there any obvious problem with pursuing either of the above strategies? I'm looking for any factors to help me eliminate some choice."

2kn4gt,63,2014-10-28,Big 4 - I hate my job 2 months in,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2kn4gt/big_4_i_hate_my_job_2_months_in/,"Hi.

So I've worked at some small (very small, maybe 30 person offices with about 150-200 people across the state) firm. It was great. I worked in tax, people are so friendly, the partners were like real people to us - we BSed, we hung out, they were very supportive and friendly. 
I was just an intern there - but the new associates there seemed to feel the same way. There were months with half-day fridays and the only real busy season was in busy season.

Flash forward, now I accepted a job at a big 4 - Big market. moved from Rural area to the big city.

Everyone seems to be so stressed. I'm out of my house at least 12 hours a day in non-busy season - and the review notes I get are beyond picky. 
Match that with a senior on many of my jobs who just a flat out asshole - who decided to explain that if he comes off like an asshole that's because he's an asshole - who doesn't help me, who gets mad when I ask questions, and generally makes us work crazy hours no matter the time of year or how far we get or don't get for the day.

Am I just being a wimp? I know there is a bait and switch from being a B4 intern to being a new associate, but the difference is NIGHT AND DAY.

I've worked with a few cool seniors - but I can't really seem to get on their jobs. My mentor/coach of sorts tells me to stick it out, and everyone seems to complain about work, but smile and nod their head when anyone above them is around.

What in the fuck?

Seriously,

What in the fuck is this?

I make less money (expensive place to live), I work way more, have a much worse commute (as in, 5 minutes to 45 minutes) and I'm treated like garbage.

Why the fuck did everyone tell me to go Big 4?


Does it just look god awful to leave after 2 months and do something else? 
After being cursed at by my senior for ""not understanding"" and being told to eat hours and charge 8 for 11 hours in October, I just look at myself and I ask myself everyday ""What the fuck am I doing?""

on top of it all,
Audit sucks more than tax as far as the work goes (probably just as bad in the other aspects at B4) - But I feel like I'm documenting the stupidest crap that the senior barely understands just to document it, not gaining a real understanding of anything, and pretending I know more than the client while ignoring them. Maybe I just hate audit and have bad teams? 

I used to be happy to go to work and feel like I'm giving my clients a service or a value.

Now I wake up everyday depressed I have to go to work to get yelled at for not understanding everything when I'm 8 weeks into the job.

What in the actual fuck can I do? 
Everyone at the firm is just going to say I can't hack it if I complain about my team?


I've passed all my tests-  just need the experience to get licensed. 

Is this shit even worth it?

And you told me you feel like you are crumbling on the inside. I wish I could tell you this every day. In different words. But all of this below rushed through my head when you said that to me. It rushed through me in thoughts and in emotions. 

They always say action speaks louder than words. I could never help you when your parents were arguing. I could never help you when your mom continues to be a narcissist. I couldn't help you when your parents were nothing but the opposite of what they are suppose to be. I couldn't help you when all of your friends abandon you. I couldn't help you when you were abused in many ways. I couldn't help you when everyone you loved, including me, were hurting you. I couldn't help you when your parents robbed you of your apartment, childhood, and possessions. 

I can't help you get out of school debt. I can't help you get insurance. I can't help you raise your siblings when your parents are suppose to. I can't help you buy an apartment so you and your siblings can get out of that destructive environment. 

 I wish I could. You know I'd do anything to see a smile on your face. I picked up a third job to save up and treat you to more dinner dates. To buy you gifts for your birthday and the upcoming holidays. I massage you when you have long days. I pick you up from class whenever I can. I cook home food for you when ever I can. I do the bed, and fold your clothes. I try to act like a goof and make you laugh. I try to carry your stuff so you don't have to. 

You have managed to raise your grades up. Learn to become a proficient programmer and inspiring web designer. Get into a tough major. Become a teacher assistant for a course you'd always say you would never be good at. And you manage to get two internships. 

You're going places and I don't want you lose focus. 

I know it isn't much but anything to make your day a bit better makes my day a lot better. 

You have a lot on your plate. More than I can ever describe here. You smile, laugh, and even act silly just so the stress doesn't get to you. Even though you say you are crumbling inside. I want you to know that you are beautiful inside out. You inspire me to be a better person. 

I know I say a lot of words. I don't show a lot of action. I know I did a lot of things I shouldn't have done. 

I should have been more supportive of your situation. I should have listened to you more. I should have been your rock to lean on. And yet you are still with me. 

Through everything you've ever been through. You still wake up every morning with a smile. 


You are my motivation. My inspiration. My star. My perfect silence. You are my everything. En las palabras de Neruda

I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz,   
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:   
I love you as one loves certain obscure things,   
secretly, between the shadow and the soul.



Y de pronto un dia de suerte, se me hizo conocerte. Y te cruzaste en mi camino. Ahora creo en el destino. Tenerte por siempre. Tenerte conmigo. Pero mas suerte es quererte tanto. Y que tu sientas lo mismo. 

I hope one day to save up enough to buy you the ring you deserve and marry you. 




I love you.

2knc3z,4,2014-10-29,It's like I'm the opposite of the Asian stereotype. Everything seems impossible to me now.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2knc3z/its_like_im_the_opposite_of_the_asian_stereotype/,"Hey guys, I'm a senior in high school, but I hope you won't treat me any different because I'm young. 

I have around a 3.2 gpa and scored only around the 1500 ranges out of 2400 on SATs, while all of my friends around me are excelling at everything. It sucks to be left behind in the dust, but I just have no will to do anything. I got cussed out from my mom for scoring 1540, and I haven't even started writing my personal statements or college apps even though applications open on Nov 1st. Whenever I have to do homework, I just blankly reddit and watch twitch streams without really remembering what I'm doing. I don't start my homework until late at night, even though I used to be able to start early. 

I don't even know what I want to do. I'm getting extreme pressure from my parents to go into a university ASAP, but I'm probably not going to be accepted into anything. I know that there is the community college route if I don't get into anything, but my parents will make my life more miserable because I'm a failure. I used to want to be a nurse or accountant, but there's so many horror stories of burning out and the difficulty that comes with it that I'm not sure if I want to go into it anymore. To be honest, I'm not even really that passionate about it. End term, I just want to travel and live in another country and live comfortably or be financially stable in the future here in America. 

My family is quite poor, and I just want the feeling of being debt free for once. My mom has a little rent for my room to help pay the bills, $100 a month, so I have to somehow get that money but I don't even have a job. I ""intern"" at our family nail salon once a week, but it's $50 for all day from 9AM-7PM. Recently I haven't been able to go, because the salon is very slow during the winter so my mom tells me to stay home. My ""rent"" is coming up soon, and although my mom isn't forcing me to pay it (she'll add it up to pay later), I really just want to get my ""bills"" done on time. No store near my house wants to hire a 17 year old, and I don't have any means of transportation to farther places. I still have to buy my graduation gown/tassle/cap, as well as the school yearbook, but I just can't afford anything right now. If only I was 18 already; I would've found other ways to make money. 

I'm also the opposite of the Asian stereotype because I'm pretty chubby asian girl. A lot of guys at my school expect girls to be thin, but I'm just not. I'm 5'5 130LB, but most of the weight comes from fat so I have a lot of flabs. I've been trying to lose weight, but I have to cancel my gym membership this month because I can't afford it anymore. I was going to just exercise in my own house and eat less, but it's been a few weeks and I don't see any progress at all. I've been rejected by 4 guys already, and through a friend, one of them even said that ""even if she wanted to fool around, I wouldn't do it"". 

I feel so stupid and apathetic. Nothing makes me genuinely happy anymore, and I always have to put up a mask of confidence in front of my friends. Whenever I try to vent to anyone, people always just put me off and then start talking about themselves instead. Or people just try to change the subject to something more positive, but I don't blame them. I rarely ever talk about how I feel in real life; it just sucks that no one ever wants to listen. 

Maybe this is all teenage angst, I don't know, but I know that I'm really unhappy, unmotivated, and worthless right now. If I don't get accepted into anything, I think I'd be better off gone. I don't want to continue my life if I don't have hope of being stable in the future.

TLDR: School sucks, life sucks, being poor sucks ,unmotivated, and no will. Tired. Everything is a facade. Please don't say to ""just live your own life, you don't have to listen to your parents"". I know. But it's very deeply embedded in my culture, it's just how I was raised."

2knx3e,1633,2014-10-29,Architects I work for just gave the best reactions I've ever seen in person.,nielzz,oculus,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/2knx3e/architects_i_work_for_just_gave_the_best/,"I work as an intern at an office for a few architects as a draftsman. I make 2D drawings and 3D visualizations. I came with the idea to make one of their project into a VR experience and they liked the idea. They gave me a project to work with, which was a perfect fit for VR (a brand new college in Amsterdam with beautiful inside and outside spaces). 

Getting their huge and complex sketch-up model of the project exported to Unity was quite the chore. After days of remodeling and cleaning I finally got the model exported in different parts into Unity. After that I had to adjust some textures tweak a bit with the scale and baked the lightmaps (which gave a beautiful result) and the first test build was done. I called over the architect whom was the main designer of this project to come and take a look. 

Some people had already seen me working with the rift and didn't think much of it.  got some weird looks and people were just like ""just let him play with his glasses"". The main architect already postponed to see me 2 times due to not having enough time and finally came with an attitude of ""okay just let me see your toy"".

I was really wondering what kind of reaction he would give, as people react very different on experiencing it. Some are like ""okay cool"" or ""this is not for me I'm getting dizzy"" and of course the people that are blown away and yell how fantastic it is. I of course was hoping on the last reaction, but got something way better.

The architect sat down, I explained the 360 controls and what the camera did. After he put it over his head he tried to look up using the controller, and asked me if that was possible. I told him to just look up with his head, after that it was silent for a good 2 minutes. He carefully walked around, completely silent. Normally this man would talk a lot, constantly and really hard. My colleagues looked up with a weird expression, ""I've never seen him quiet"". 

Then a soft ""unbelievable"" came out of his mouth. ""I didn't expect this"", ""not at all"". in the period of 15 minutes he occasionally broke the silence with; 

""How is this already possible"", ""I get it now, I'm so happy I didn't put more bridges in the main hall"", ""I can now finally see how important it is that this wall is yellow"", ""I got to change that, amazing that I can finally see it"", ""this opens so much to me"". And some more reactions like that. 

He finally put the Rift off his head, his eyes were in a total state of blown away. He put the Rift away and just sat there, saying nothing. Some colleagues were giggling and I asked how he liked it. It looked like my question was just some noise to him, and he replied, ""sorry, it's just so much information that I have to process""  after 5 minutes of staring he shook his head and stood up. ""I would never expect this"", ""the building isn't finished, and I've already been there"" ""as an architect, this is cheating, my god"". 

After that my colleagues naturally wanted to try it out too, they reacted like most people do their first time. During lunch people talked with each other like normal, the architect who normally was leading the conversation just sat there staring in infinity. The conversation was long on a different subject and he would just blurt out things he could do with the Rift. At the end of the lunch he asked me, ""I didn't look at a certain part, can I see it again"" and again he was lost in another world for like 10 minutes. 

During the rest of the day he would run around the office telling people to come see me, which they all did, and all with amazing and entertaining reactions.

I know this was a long read, and I thank you if you put trough it. I just wanted to share the most interesting reaction I ever got.  
______________________________________________________________________________________

EDIT: It's unbelievable how much attention my experience got from you Reddit! Just this post and your positive reactions got me a lot of cool discussions and positive feedback. I still occasionally get messages on this post with questions and always help out as much as I can.

Right now my internship has come to an end (it was part of my ongoing study) and I am back studying at University. Besides that I'm starting up my own company to offer this VR experience to other architects and their own projects. If you are interested to see what I'm up to and to see a video of the project I was working on during my internship you can visit www.archview.nl. 

Thanks for all your amazing reactions and I wish you all the best of luck with your own projects. And remember I'm always open to help out people as much as I can, so any questions are always welcome!

From Feb to now I have worked part time for this company earning the same rate I was earning as an intern, which is less than minimum wage, working 9 hour days while studying a couple days a week, and doing the work of a full time employee whom I replaced.

As the company is small I spoke to my boss directly about this stating that I have showed considerable talent and deserved a greater wage considering the guy I replaced was on 40% more than me per hour. He said I was being paid a generous amount and that was the end of it.

I know that I could be getting ~50-70% more somewhere else. However my boss will take it personally that I want to leave and I doubt would give me a reference because without me his business would fall apart.

My question is when I apply start applying elsewhere how do I explain why I'm leaving to the interviewer and what should I do about a referee as this is my first real job?

TL:DR leaving current job in a messy way what to say to new employers.

I currently have two offers for summer internships on the table, one for a non-Big4 international firm in Audit and one with a small (50ish people) where they said I would see both sides of accounting(tax work and audit work).  

I am curious if anyone with experience at a small firm can speak to the similarities of auditing small sole proprietor companies or other smaller clients that a local firm would handle compared with large clients that I would see at a larger firm.

The reason I ask is I still am not sure about tax or audit and I hope to land a big 4 job next recruiting season and want to make the right choice for my future.  Would it be beneficial to work at the small firm for the summer and see what both audit and tax are like? or would the experience there be totally different than what a big 4 or large firm would give me?  Will the experience of a large firm on my resume out weigh any experience small firm can give me? (the small firm sold it to me as ""you will see what it is like to be a public accountant"" but I wonder if this is just for a small local firm)

Any and all help is appreciated.  Thank you"

We're currently living in his home country, but I have lived in other European countries before living with him here. We've been together for over 2 years, have a dog together, and love each other a lot.

This past July we were in the US visiting my family for a wedding, when we started talking seriously about the idea of moving to the US. I'm from a huge family and we're all really close, so it's been hard on me living over here for so long (originally I was supposed to be in Germany for a year, but then I got a great internship so I stayed longer, then met my bf and we moved in together).

That and I am graduating from college this winter and need to find a real job in my field (video games). I've got tons of connections in the US, and know I won't have a terribly difficult time finding a job (I've already received an offer from a AAA company). My bf works in IT (sys admin) who speaks perfect English, with 10 years of work experience, so he will not have a hard time finding work, either.

Well, we've been discussing it A LOT lately, because 6 months after graduation I have to find a job to start paying back my loans (yay!). This is not something he really understands, as education here is free. But we'll have a higher qol in the US and it's a good move for us.

Anyway.. we decided for sure a month ago we were going to do it, so we called my parents, told them the good news.. and my mom cried from happiness. Literally.. she sobbed. This made me super happy. My whole family is ecstatic! My dad has offered to help with moving costs, and it's just been wonderful. We haven't told his family yet, because we know his mom will be particularly devastated (he's her first child, and she doesn't make much money so visiting us will be hard - but we can afford to pay for her to visit, which is one of the reasons we want to go).

Well.. lately my boyfriend has been dragging his feet when it comes to discussing visa options. Really, there's only one choice - we get married. We discussed this and decided we would only tell my parents (as they have to co-sponsor his visa, since I haven't worked in the US in over 5 years) and that we wouldn't consider ourselves really married. We'd have an actual engagement and ceremony much later when we are settled and can afford it. He was super on board at first.. but now things have changed.

Whenever I bring it up he just gets quiet and won't really respond to me. But we're sort of under the gun. The visa takes about a year to process, then we have to make moving arrangements (more difficult because we have a large breed dog). I REALLY have to find a job and start paying back my loans.

Just today we were talking about it and he said that maybe I should try to find a job here.. uhh.. well yeah except I've been doing that for over a year now. We live in a SUPER small country, in a SUPER small town, very far from the capital - which is the only city with any form of game development. It doesn't help that I haven't mastered the native language. My degree is in writing, so that doesn't really open many doors for me here.

I'm getting really frustrated because each day that goes by is another day that I'm further from returning home and starting my career. I just don't know what to do! He won't discuss it with me.

And now he's talking about trying the diversity lottery visa. If you're unfamiliar.. you put your name into a computer that randomly chooses people. You have LESS than a 1% chance of being pulled, and from there you have to go through the green card application. The deadline for applying is in a few days. You find out if you got chosen between October of next year and May/June of 2016!!!! Then you have to do interviews and more applications which take about another year.

I cannot wait this long, and he just thinks I'm overreacting and getting over nervous. He doesn't understand that I can't just ignore my loans. I have to start paying them back or they'll go after my parents.

I feel so overwhelmed and frustrated because he has gone from ""Let's fucking do this! America!"" to ""Well.. why don't you try to find something here. It'll happen when it happens."" I love him, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but I can't do that where we currently live because I won't have a career.

**TL;DR: BF and I live in his home country. We decided to move to the US so I can find a job (I graduate in the winter, loans to pay back after 6 months). He was super gung-ho and now is really quiet and dragging his feet about starting his visa process. Trying to get me to find a job here, which is absolutely impossible.**"

We have a few clusters of hosts where one cluster will be separate and host only the mission-critical core servers while the other clusters will host a combination of Development, Quality, and normal Production VMs. Additionally, each cluster has a mix of Linux and Windows VMs. Management wants permissions to be completely granular in this kind of fashion:

- The different IT teams can have access to their VMs, but this should be able to be segmented by both OS and tier, so for example, some intern could be given access only to Development Windows machines.

- The server team should be able to give access in a similar fashion, but to all VMs (not just a specific team like the Application guys) based on OS and tier. So we might have a Sr. Linux engineer or a RedHat consultant that should get access to Production Linux, but not be able to see or modify Windows machines.

- These ""global"" admins should also be able to deploy new VMs in their area.

- This should be managed with AD groups so that we can easily delegate the proper access to each admin/user without having to touch the vCenter permission assignments once this restructuring is complete.

I've kind of been beating my head against a wall for a while because I'm not even sure if this is possible based on how our clusters are set up (where VM tiers are mixed together in the same host clusters), and even then it sounds like a huge amount of complexity to manage. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get this done? How do you manage permissions for vSphere? Folders are obviously needed here, but how do you manage the fact that they span all clusters in the datacenter?

I also coach wrestling at a private school and this year they are paying me around 5,000 for the season. This would allow me to pay rent until February when our lease is up. Coaching wrestling makes me way happier and is less time-consuming.

Working as much as I do with school is super stressful, but it seems to seems crazy to throw away a $60,000-a-year job when all I have lined up afterward is another possibility for a waiting job promised by the head coach on my team.

If I lived at my grandpa's I could stay in the same city and probably afford to have a car, which would take a lot of stress off of me, make it easier to visit my hometown about an hour away and allow me to get more done. I want to get a jumpstart on internships and stuff also, and the free time would be awesome.

On the other hand I love living with my friends and I feel like it would suck for them to find a place without me. Living with my grandpa is essentially like living alone also and it seems kind of boring for my early 20s. I also kind of like the idea of having my own money and providing for myself in general.

With a wide range of skills and a passionate interest, I will be a valuable asset to Blank Institution as a PhD student. 
	""As an undergraduate, I gained anthropological experience in both field and lab. My field experience was in Sri Lanka under the supervision of Dr. ------- of --- University in January 2013. I conducted a small-scale research project where I observed three populations of hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus). I was interested in the effect of cultural context, i.e. human behavior, on the monkeys’ behavior. Indeed, temple monkeys appeared to exhibit more aggression both towards humans and other monkeys than populations living on a university campus and in a nature preserve. This project gave me a taste of what working in the field is like as a primatologist, and it cemented my fascination with non-human primate behavior. My lab experience was at the --- Skeletal Collection, the third largest skeletal collection in the US, at --- University in Washington, DC. I won the competitive Dana Internship from Ithaca College to perform research in June and July of 2013. For part of the internship, I worked with other undergraduate students, a graduate student, and professors from --- University, SUNY ---, and --- College. My activities in the laboratory included organizational work, a study of nutritional deficiency, and a complete osteobiography of one individual. The latter two culminated in a presentation at ---- College in October 2013. 
	""My hanuman langur project led to my largest independent research undertaking thus far. From my experience in Sri Lanka, I knew that while hanuman langurs were largely tolerated and liked by locals, the toque macaque, an endemic species, is treated with some contempt. These monkeys were subject to the practice of translocation, or capture and release, in attempts to reduce urban populations and human-monkey conflict. Along with a computer science student, I built an agent-based simulation in the Python programming language to experimentally test if translocation has an effect on the demography and social network structure of toque macaque populations. We were able to both build a simulation that produced stable, realistic populations over long intervals of time and perform the translocation experiment with three different experimental conditions. This project culminated in a poster at the American Association of Physical Anthropologists meeting in 2014 and my Ithaca College Department of Anthropology honors thesis. Currently, I am collaborating with ----- (not undergrad institution) College faculty ___ to build similar simulations comparing the evolution of social behavior and structure in hamadryas baboons and early humans. Studies and experiments with simulations can test hypotheses which otherwise could not be tested. My research will continue in this direction towards my dissertation, examining an aspect of social behavior in one or more primate species and simulating that behavior over evolutionary time scales.
	""Simulations and computer science are practical tools in primatology. Therefore, since graduating Ithaca College, I have begun learning in several programming languages. Python is a good language for creating models and simulations. It is complemented by JavaScript for this use, because JavaScript can be used to build animations and visualizations. With these two languages, I have the ability to not just simulate populations, but create reader-friendly visualizations which can be animated or interactive to better communicate results. I have also worked with HTML and CSS to build a cross-platform mobile application called -------. I designed the application for studies and experiments requiring timed observations, like scan sampling of primate behavior. The observation input fields are customizable, as is the observation interval, and the user is prompted by sound or vibration to make each observation. After a maximum of 50 observations, the data are exported into an Excel spreadsheet and sent to either a dropbox.com account or an email address. While this is a small project, it demonstrates how useful and practical the programming skills I now have are. I enjoy working not just with other primatologists, but with any researcher who wants my help with an interesting problem. I can use programming to solve our every-day problems as well as theoretical ones. 
	""One additional skill that makes me an excellent graduate student is my teaching experience. I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant of French from 2011 to graduation, during which time I have taught ten classes. Being a TA involved working with a small to medium group, occasionally building my own lesson plans, engaging students who were often reluctant, and applying my French language skills and experience. I was also a teaching assistant for Forensic Anthropology in spring of 2014. In this position, I often worked with very small groups of students, teaching osteoanatomy and overseeing other lab work. Whatever the subject, I greatly enjoy working with fellow students. Teaching is something I see myself doing as a graduate student and as a graduate of Blank Institution, whether I will be working at another institution or at a museum, zoo, or natural reserve. 
	""I am a hard-working, dedicated student with enough research experience to truly know what I want to do. I will work both in the field and in the computer lab, observing, analyzing, and simulating primate behavior. Not only will I be successful as a student at Blank Institution, I will bring valuable computing skills with me to your department. I am the ideal student for your Blank program.""

2kqaj6,0,2014-10-29,Can I get your opinions on which company I should intern with this summer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2kqaj6/can_i_get_your_opinions_on_which_company_i_should/,"Hey all,

I'm in a bit of a rut. I'm a sophomore (majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Math) right now, looking for advice/opinions.

So far this year, I have two internship offers for summer 2015: one from MathWorks (MA), and one from PG&amp;E (CA).

I interned at MathWorks the summer after my freshman year, I loved interning there, and I would definitely consider working there once I graduate. Problem is, it's too close to home for me (they don't have a CA office I can intern at because it's too small). It's a great company, well-known, and I had a blast working there last summer. If I interned there again, I'd have to stay at home with my parents... not a great situation (look through my other posts if you want more info). They paid $17/hour last summer, and I'm not sure how much I'm getting paid this summer (will find out closer to spring, but I'm not sure how much higher the rate will be).


I want to go out to CA to intern because I really don't want to stay at home this summer. However, I feel MathWorks is better for my resume. I'm more familiar with MathWorks, and I know more about working there than I do about PG&amp;E. I'm torn between getting away from home and being on my own... and working for a well-known company that I'm familiar with.


PG&amp;E is offering $22/hour, plus eligibility for overtime ($33/hour), and $1,000 relocation money. I don't think that would cover much, because I'd have to use that money to fly out to CA and back... which would use it all up, nothing left for housing. I'd have to find/pay for my own housing (they said they'd help out in finding a place but not paying for it). I'd be in the San Francisco area, and I know the cost of living in CA is pretty high, so I don't know if I'd net more or less than I did less summer at MathWorks. I've also never really heard of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, I don't know how good it'd be for my resume.

I have to give PG&amp;E a decision by November 9th, and I'll be getting a formal offer from MathWorks only in the spring (they haven't released spring intern positions yet, but I'm guaranteed getting invited back).

Any opinions or advice? Thanks! :)"

A few days later, I saw her liking another post from our universities' Facebook page. I'm also not at school right now and instead, doing a full-time internship with a company in the same city. This means that I'm not on campus and don't have the opportunity to meet new people there. I said fuck it and sent a friend request. It's been about 5 days and it's still pending. Also to make it worse, we have no mutual friends. 

What do I go about doing now? Just cancel my request? Or should I message her? If so, what do I say without coming across creepy? I'm not a shy person and an average looking guy. I've never done something like this before, but people say you miss all the opportunities you don't take.

2kqp76,24,2014-10-29,Java Robot Class - I designed a Texas Hold'em Poker Bot,cmobes,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2kqp76/java_robot_class_i_designed_a_texas_holdem_poker/,"I figured I should share my Poker Bot Story with Reddit and how I got kicked off of PokerStars.  I wrote a Poker Bot back in the 2007-2008 timeframe (when poker was at it's peak).  I used Java with a lot from the Robot class to take screenshots, examine them programmatically, make a calculated decision, and use the Java Robot Class to control the mouse and make the plays all without touching a thing once it was running.  I had way too much fun with this project.  I will say this, the bot I made was NOT designed to collude with other bots, and that was never a plan.  I really hate cheaters.  I never saw what I was doing as cheating or breaking the rules, but it definitely was breaking the EULA terms, and I totally understand why I was kicked off their site.  I saw this as teaching the dumbest thing ever, a computer, how to read cards and play poker like a human.  This is really what programming is.  Teaching an object that only knows how to handle 1s and 0s how to do something.

There is one remaining remnant of this project.  AndroidPoker.  As the name implies, this is an Android app (that's FREE and in the Play Store - I'm not selling anything) that takes user input for known cards and number of players and tells the approximate odds of winning, and a general idea of what to do next.

I started this project to freshen up my programming skills after doing nothing technical for a semester abroad in Germany.  I began by writing a card calculator (similar results to what ESPN would show during poker hands - Monte Carlo method - lots of random hands) that manually took in the card information from a web page front end (J2EE as I had an internship as a programmer writing J2EE code - now Java Platform).  Then I took that and built a screen reader which would find the location of Poker Table window, read the cards (based on some simple pattern recognition), and input the known cards (mine and the community cards) into my card calculator.  I could calculate my approximate win percentage based on how many people were dealt in, and make some decent play based on that.  I only designed it to play at limit tables first, and never really implemented a way for the Bot to know it's position relative to the dealer button/blinds.  That's one thing I was working on when it all ended.  There was the perfect environment for testing as lots of people played in the play money areas (remember .net vs .com sites that were advertised - couldn't advertise the real money sites on US television).  Anyway, I eventually took the bot to very low real money tables (1 cent / 2 cent), and the bot could be relatively successful when the tables were fairly full, but when down to smaller number of players, more bluffing naturally ensues and the bot was not programmed well to handle this yet (I was also working on this).  I never won or lost any large amounts of money doing this.  Eventually PokerStars caught on, and noticed that my Bot was playing 10+ hours in a row without sitting out a single hand on 1 cent / 2 cent tables, and would throw some popups at it (which my bot never handled properly, it just bombed out and I'd see a bunch of popups when I came back and checked on it).  I didn't think much of these popups until afterward, but they were of course tests to see if I was a human or a bot, and this was what stopped it all.  I shouldn't have been so lazy and not watched the bot while it was playing...

I hope you've enjoyed my first programming post!

Here's the last response I got from Pokerstars on January 24, 2008 when I get booted (I tried to appeal before this email):

Hello Carl,

Thank you for sending your ID.  Everything there looks to be in accordance
with information you've provided us in the past, including your Minnesota
permanent residence.  I wish I could say the same thing regarding the data
gathered from your gameplay.

Unfortunately, your statement that you were not using an automated bot
player is in direct conflict with multiple observations and tests
performed against your account.  An analysis of the many aspects of data
we gather for bot reviews was performed not only by me, but by several
peers on the Game Security team who unanimously concurred with the
finding, including my supervisor, who concurred with and OK'd this action.

As I wrote before, we cannot detail the nature of the data we've gathered
as to do so would compromise the security of future bot reviews against
other players.  We do not wish our bot detection methods to fall into the
hands of bot developers, who would use that knowledge to better avoid
detection.  I will tell you that the evidence against you is not just one
particlar item, but a myriad of different items that all without exception
indicate ""bot"".  You didn't fail just one test, you failed them all,
including several real-time tests.

As such, your account must remain closed.

Sincerely,

Jeff
PokerStars Game Security

2kqrnh,2,2014-10-29,GRE holding me back? (Computer Engineering),[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2kqrnh/gre_holding_me_back_computer_engineering/,"Hi all,

I'm going through the whole grad school process, and I'm afraid I've messed up the GRE twice now. My plans were to apply to Purdue and Georgia Tech (as far as top ten go) for the M.S. program in Electrical Engineering, and several other schools in the top 25. 

For the first run:
163V/157Q/4.5AWA

Second run:
164V/159Q/??? (Just took it on Monday)

The Quantitative section on both of these is below the average for Purdue/GA Tech by a fairly large margin. The first time, I didn't study for the math (bad mistake, I know; I was just very concerned about vocab). Second, I didn't study as much as I needed to -- I didn't realize I scheduled it right in the middle of my midterms. 

Now, for my other credentials:
3.95 GPA, Majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, minor in Mathematics

Research 

internship, studied abroad, eavily involved in on-campus organizations (Engineers without Borders, IEEE)


My question is: Should I retake the GRE? My concern now is that no openings are available until Dec. 1st in my area, and the deadlines for most schools are at the latest Dec. 15th (for priority registration). I just hate the idea of spending ~$600 on this exam, whenever I've already messed it up twice. "

I thought this subreddit would be best for asking the above question, as /r/freelance is not based only on webdev work.

&gt;Context: Can work with CSS, HTML, JS, and Play!. Can write Java, Python, Scala, and some C#. Working on learning C++, C# with asp.net mvc. Currently doing a project in Play! for Scala (I *really* like Play!). I am in general much more interested in back end than front end (especially front end JS), but am fine with doing both and can do both.

&gt;In additional to Programming experience, I also heave over 3 years experience with CentOS server management and have recently been working with Debian as well.

&gt;I've been a software engineer intern at one large corporation as well as at a small company, but both internships were not webdev related.

So here are a few more specific questions:


* How can I know that I am ready for freelance work? What if I fail my first client in some way?
* What are the important webdev concepts to know before I try freelancing?
* How much time would freelance work take from me?

2kr6ex,1,2014-10-30,I need to stay strong for her,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2kr6ex/i_need_to_stay_strong_for_her/,"In August, my fears of going down the same path of my parents' failed marriage essentially started to come into fruition ([post 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2epf21/according_to_my_boyfriends_22m_mother_i_22f_am/) &amp; [post 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fgyq4/update_according_to_my_boyfriends_22m_mother_i/)). Though that had since been resolved, I have accepted that the bridge has been burnt beyond repair and my somewhat optimistic thoughts on my future with regards to love and family may not come true anymore.

If you have decided not to read those threads, it's okay. Most of that stuff is irrelevant. All that needs to be known is that for as far as I could remember, my mom has had lupus, and she has been supported by the government on a disability plan for many years.

Early October, I had caught wind of my mom catching a cold. Her health had always not been the greatest, and I knew that she could easily have that cold worsen into pneumonia. Though I was in another town for college, I did my best to stay in contact and ensure that she was doing okay. 

During this time, she had me edit some emails for her. With English being her second language, she didn't have the best writing, so as her only daughter and also the only person she knows with a good grasp of the language, I always took up the job to make sure her message came through clearly and coherently. Looking back, I almost wish I could have said no.

She had always lived a luxurious life while she was in Korea, and in a sense, she did what she could to retain that sense of dignity and sustain that lifestyle in one way or another. This included playing the ""Buy and Sell"" market, earning a net positive income (an income of ~15k over the course of 5+ years), and also purchasing brand name goods at a cheaper price. Though I was wary of this, and warned her about doing this, she had begun to face the consequences.

A social worker had caught wind of her additional income, and began to run an inspection on my mom (and probably me). Determined to not lose her income and home, she collaborated with her ex-husband and his sister to find an alibi.

She wrote it out to the social worker, and of course, I ended up having to read it and edit it for her. I rarely fight with my mom, but that time, I lost a bit of my cool and fully expressed my concern that this could go the wrong way for everyone.

Then she called me late at night, one day. She told me that she had gotten pneumonia and had just left the hospital. She had gotten some treatment done. So much liquid accumulated in her lungs that she was essentially drowning on land. Worried out of my mind, I saw her as immediately as I could. My mom, who was so dignified and proud, looked so weak. Her breathing was heaved, and she lost so, so much weight. It was almost heartbreaking, but I stayed strong and did my best to make her as happy as I could during my visit.

A few days after, I woke up to another email from my mom. No subject, just content. It was a letter begging the social worker to forgive her and to consider not cutting off the payments from her disability plan. Following this email was a text message from my mom, asking me to edit it for her. Not needing to handle this sort of stress in the morning, I replied I would do it later and stopped reading the email (yes, I did end up editing it later that day).

I've known from a very early age that my parents were not perfect people, and they may not be the best of role models in terms of their morals and choices. But at the same time, I wish to never see either of my parents laying prone, emotionally or physically, no matter how much they deserve it.

The thoughts started to run in my head. My mom is recovering from pneumonia, and within the next few months, she could end up homeless. I'm only 21. I'm in the midst of college. I'm living off of my bare savings, that are to definitely run out halfway through next year. I can barely handle taking care of myself, let alone another person. How am I supposed to sustain the two of us?

The negativity started to seep into other parts of my life. I started to miss class. My sleep schedule was unpredictable. I started to miss things like labs, quizzes, and midterms. I couldn't understand it all at the time. For once in my college life, I had managed to keep my shit together and get good grades. I started to feel optimistic of raising my crappy 2.3 average to a somewhat okay 2.7 - 3.0. Why of all times was I dropping the ball now?

I knew that I needed to get help. So I did. I connected to my professors, and told them my situation, and they were supportive and offered to accommodate my workload. I was starting to feel more confident about just maybe doing well again.

And then it happened.

Last week, my dad had called me to give me some grim news. Though my mom specifically asked him not to, he felt compelled to tell me anyways. She wasn't getting better. Her ribs were fractured. Her lungs weren't even close to recovering. Her physician asked her to get a CT scan. My dad told me that my mom might have lung cancer.

I was studying with my friends at the time, and I left the library thinking that the call was either the usual sad drunk call of him failing as a father, or an attempt to reach out to me. 

It was day time. I didn't need that shit, dad. Seriously.

I ended up composing myself for maybe 10 minutes, and then went on a full blown meltdown with my friends and my peers around me. They were taken aback and confused. I always kept my cool and never really showed that much negativity, at least in front of them. I told them what was wrong, and they gave me a big hug and shuttled me back home.

My boyfriend tried to make light of the situation. He ensured me that it was just a test. And you know, doctors always suspect the worst of situations. He was right in a sense, but I still had grim thoughts. I kept feeding myself that ""it was just a test"" so that I could pull myself together for my upcoming midterm on Tuesday.

Last Tuesday, an hour or so after my midterm, I got another call from my dad. I stared at my phone, knowing that since it was the day time (he usually calls at night), it was either great news, or utterly horrible news.

The results came back. My mom was diagnosed with terminal stage lung cancer. It spread to her bones, and even with treatment, she was told she didn't have much time left, a few months at most.

My dad told me to stay strong. I know I have to. I am the direct influence to her happiness with my successes and my happiness. Her dream is to let me succeed in the best way I can. 

But honestly, I don't know if I can take it. I don't know what to do, yet at the same time, I do. My thoughts are jumbled, and I can't help but think of horrible, dark thoughts. 

My mom won't be around to see my graduate. She won't be around for my marriage ceremony, nor won't she be able to see her grandchildren, who she so badly wanted to meet when the time came around. Those optimistic ideas of the future we talked about, with me supporting her with my income and ravishing her with the brand name bags she so badly desired. Gone.

She is dying. I have until December before my first semester is over. I have so many obligations for school and my extracurricular activities. I have so many things coming up for me and my career path. My life is just beginning, and hers is ending.

I have to watch her die, and hold her hand while she breathes her last breath. I have to set up her funeral, arrange her finances, and deal with her belongings. My dad is on the other side of the country, still dealing with his (other) dysfunctional marriage and family. My boyfriend is abroad in an internship until next year.

I've already contacted my professors, and I'll be seeing my counselor tomorrow to arrange further accommodations for me and my workload. My major is so inflexible that if I were to drop the semester and tend to my mom, who doesn't want me to see her yet, I would need to postpone my already extended graduate date by another year. I'm honestly completely scared to fully face the fact that my mom will pass by next year.

I need to stay strong, and continue to support her as well as I can by continuing to succeed. I don't know if I can."

It makes me very uneasy inside, and I wasn't like that four years ago. I felt that all those years of baggage has come back to haunt me, despite how hard I'm trying to swallow those feeling down.

Looking for inspiration.,lehmongeloh,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2krhrg/whats_your_favorite_bags_for_classes_and_books/,"I've been thinking about expanding my purse collection for more totes/carry alls/purses because I'm not a backpack wearer.  I have a couple that I use for class, but mainly it's my Longchamp bag and I don't mind dropping it on the floor for classes/work.

I would really like a light weight bag (TB and KS are heavy empty) and with a zipper to close since I live in the city now.  I'm in graduate school and intern in the financial district of Boston, so I'm looking for something that translates well to that atmosphere (so no trusty Longchamp).  

I did find out a new to me brand Dagne Dover.  A girl in my class uses it a lot so I asked where she got her bag because I loved the design and the first thing she says is, ""It's an expensive bag.""  With the implied ""too expensive for you"" there. Gee thanks. :/  I really liked [The Tote](http://www.dagnedover.com/products/tote) because it's structured, and has a place for my mac and water bottle!  But the color are meh to me.  I bookmarked it in case they expand, but otherwise I'm still on the hunt.

Anyone have a favorite bag/brand/suggestions?  

&gt; **Requirements and/or Preferences**

* $500 and under
* No messenger style bags (I have enough)
* Can close fully (no snap/tie/open)
* Can hold at least a notebook, folder, wallet, pencil case, and 13"" Mac
* Does not weigh a billion pounds even empty   
* Professional/sophisticated
* Structured (no more flopping)
* Preferably friendly material (I walk a lot, so some bags I'm very careful to only use when it's clear skies without the potential for rain/snow)

I'm not afraid of prints or colors, even though I usually lean towards solid colors with visually interesting details.  I just don't want a carryall that's similar.  For instance I really like the tan ""The Tote"" bag, but my TB bag is tan and similar shape.  

Or if you don't have any suggestions but want to share what you have then feel free!  What's in your closet? :)

I have been at my property for around 9 months now and have seen the front desk change completely...bar 3 employees (though, even one of those left and came back...).

Let me give you a run down...this is the kind of place where management are NOT there to back you up, but are infact there to side with the guests and penalise you for having one printscreen missing at the end of your shift.

I worked nights and was made to stay late on a daily basis for the most insignificant things, only to be chewed out like it was the end of the world.

This is the kind of property where the FOM out-ranks the hotel DM, this is the kind of property where you are penalised for trying to move up in the ladder, this is the kind of property where the FOM will fire a bell team member of over 20 years service, for having coffee with a friend in the luggage room out of view from guests, this is the kind of property that the FOM will fire one of the DM's for napping on night shift (even though there were never any tasks left over for his relief and you anly had to call &amp; within seconds he would be there...unlike some others).

This is the kind of property, that if a guest hasn't paid the full total of over 20 indevidual transactions and you notice it straight away, inform management of the situation and get told 'ok we are dealing with it' you will recieve a final written warning and be forced to pay the money on behalf of the guest.

This is the kind of property that staff's it's desk with interns and then reduces them to tears when they make mistakes...even though they have recieved 0 training before joining.

Yeah...this property sucks....



UPDATE:

I went back to the property today to sign all the end of cantract paperwork. They had 'forgotten' to add onto my final wage my remaining holidays and the extra payments that I have accrued for working public holidays...when questioned, tried to buy me off with a fraction of the outstanding total, but after a couple of minutes pressing them, they begrudgingly accepted."

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am _____  and a student on the verge of graduating from the college institute _____ , with a focus on Banking, Finance and Accounting.

I was very happy to hear about this opportunity for doing an internship in Germany. I think this is a unique opportunity to further combine my studies with first-hand experience.

The only professional experience I have so far is from a paid internship I’ve done in the bank institution ______ .  Jobs and internship positions in _____ are scarce, so I am proud that from the hundreds of candidates, I was chosen to be the most suitable candidate for the internship.

Even though the internship lasted two months, I learnt a lot there, perhaps more than I learnt in one year of college. I quickly adapted to the work environment 
and to the ever-growing responsibilities that were given to me.

As much as I am eager to gain new experiences and knowledge in the field that I have been educated in, I am also interested in the fact that the internship you’re offering will be done in Germany.

I have never left my country, and Germany has always been my first choice destination to visit. Perhaps, the reason I feel so drawn to Germany is because I grew up watching German television. This is also why I have a very good command of the German language, which in turn would enable me to adjust easily to a German-speaking country and workplace. 

Finally, I would be very happy if I could do an internship in Germany and I think that I am very suitable for it.

Yours sincerely"

Writer explains the trend of more younger/college aged women wanting casual sex and abandoning LTR",smith5ar,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2ksf3p/sex_on_campus_she_can_play_that_game_too_writer/,"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html?pagewanted=6&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnlx=1414661821-OUsj/Ak0Tfhr7HMNIflwmQ

...

As a 22 year old college student in MGTOW/in monk mode, I’m torn about this article. Sex on Campus: She Can Play That Game, Too is another article explaining, from a woman’s perspective, on why “hook up” culture is dominating college campuses. I believe this kind of trend is why the American Family will continue to be destroyed in the future and why TRP is so important in this day and age of sex.

One of my first posts, so sorry if there are any mistakes. Feel free to skip around, I tried extracting RP truths throughout the article.



&gt;Ask her why she hasn’t had a relationship at Penn, and she won’t complain about the death of courtship or men who won’t commit. Instead, she’ll talk about “cost-benefit” analyses and the “low risk and low investment costs” of hooking up.

The article goes into women’s economic side of hooking up. Since the work of developing a relationship is too emotionally taxing, and since it takes away from her ability to focus on her schooling/career, it’s easier just having casual sex. Since it’s a woman taking a hard look at the economic sides of dating, she’s making a smart move for her career. When a man looks at the economic side and potentially gives up/postpones marriage, he’s seen as giving up or “not being a man” anymore. 

&gt;Until recently, those who studied the rise of hookup culture had generally assumed that it was driven by men, and that women were reluctant participants, more interested in romance than in casual sexual encounters. But there is an increasing realization that young women are propelling it, too.

The debate over who’s driving the trend of “hookup” over “dating” is settled right here in the article. After reading this article, how can anyone agree it’s still men driving it more?

&gt;Keenly attuned to what might give them a competitive edge, especially in a time of unsure job prospects and a shaky economy, many of them approach college as a race to acquire credentials: top grades, leadership positions in student organizations, sought-after internships.

I will throw a legitimate argument out there, though. The economy has played some part in shifting attitudes towards women in the workplace. The cost of living has made it so people (women, men, whoever) do need to work more, so it’s not a 100 percent conscious self-implosion of women. More women working Is fine, but the pendulum has swung too far and mixing that with militant feminists’ attitudes towards men is doing more harm than good.
&gt;Almost universally, the women said they did not plan to marry until their late 20s or early 30s.

After their careers are stable, or after they’ve hit the wall…?

&gt;“We are very aware of cost-benefit issues and trading up and trading down, so no one wants to be too tied to someone that, you know, may not be the person they want to be with in a couple of months,” she said.

Bit of hypergamy mixed in, too. Apparently, as this girl, “why even get in a relationship and have to break up with him when I’m ready to move up the ladder? I’ll just keep fuck buddies around, that way I can move up the ladder with less drama.”

&gt;Instead, she enjoyed casual sex on her terms — often late at night, after a few drinks, and never at her place, she noted, because then **she would have to wash the sheets.**

…You lazy bitch

&gt;Nationally, women now outnumber men in college enrollment by 4 to 3 and outperform them in graduation rates and advanced degrees. Some researchers have argued that the gender imbalance fosters a culture of hooking up because men, as the minority, hold more power in the sexual marketplace, and they prefer casual sex to long-term relationships.

Now this is interesting. This says men prefer the casual sex over LTR, but this article is explaining why that’ the exact opposite. It also says men are the gate keepers, now. I think the writer might be confusing that the top 10 or 20% of the men are the actual gate keepers (or really, just the guys with the most plates, and women have a tough time getting a ticket for that line)

&gt;Increasingly, she said, many privileged young people see college as a unique life stage in which they don’t — and shouldn’t — have obligations other than their own self-development.

The age of “me.” Everyone needs to get theirs I suppose, but gone are the days where people agree that real relationships demand *some* level of sacrifice.

&gt;Women say, “ I need to take this time for myself — I’m going to have plenty of time to focus on my husband and kids later”

When?? When you’re about to hit the wall, yet your workload becoming “doctors, lawyers, politicians, bankers or corporate executives” (page 1) won’t even allow you to have time for finding a husband or kids?

&gt;Some women also want to wait to see how men turn out as they advance through their 20s.

That’s right. Women are getting theirs while us as men have to prove ourselves worthy like a focus group being watch behind a one way mirror. Also, bit of hypergamy? Woman waits around hoping for that Phd, and if the orbiter from 3 years ago gets his PhD first….”Oh hey!!! We should totes grab lunch soon! :)”

&gt;“‘I’ve always heard this phrase, ‘Oh, marriage is great, or relationships are great — you get to go on this journey of change together,’ ” she said. “That sounds terrible.”

You remember that time when you thought you could be with a girl, and go through the ups and downs of this thing called life, together? You can forget that.

&gt;“I’m a true feminist,”. . .  “**I definitely wouldn’t say I’ve regretted any of my one-night stands**,” she said. . . At the same time, **she didn’t want the number of people she had slept with printed**, and she said it was important to her to keep her sexual life separate from her image as a leader at Penn.”

Can feminists and women in general just finally admit that their number does affect them psychologically and that it does in fact represent how you come off to other people? The bitch is speaking anonymously and still won’t spill the number because people WILL look at her differently. 

&gt;“It’s kind of like a spiral,” she said. “The girls adapt a little bit, because they stop expecting that they’re going to get a boyfriend — because if that’s all you’re trying to do, you’re going to be miserable. But at the same time, they want to, like, have contact with guys.” So they hook up and “try not to get attached.”

Plate spinning. Can we all just get a long and say this is all we want. Men and women, without having this gender war on our hands.

**Rape Culture**

&gt;she went to a party with a boy from her floor. She had too much to drink, and she remembered telling him that she wanted to go home. Instead, she said, he took her to his room and had sex with her while she drifted in and out of consciousness. She woke up with her head spinning. The next day, not sure what to think about what had happened, she described the night to her friends as though it were a funny story: I was so drunk, I fell asleep while I was having sex! Only later did Haley begin to think of what had happened as rape — a disturbingly common part of many women’s college experience

Not enough info to make a call on what really happened. But, it’s her words, so I’ll call bullshit. Also, it’s her word, so that means this guy could probably end up in jail/expelled, realistically these days. 

&gt;The close relationship between hooking up and drinking leads to confusion and disagreement about the line between a “bad hookup” and assault.

They acknowledge this “disagreement about the line” exists but will not admit it’s skewed to get more men in trouble while absolving women of guilt. Not saying real sexual assaults don’t happen or should be ignored, but this “bad hookup” shit has gotten out of hand and is being abused by women.  

&gt;She had been making out with a guy at his house, not sure how far she wanted to go, when he stood up and told her, “Get down on your knees.” At first she froze. “I was really taken aback, because I was like, no one has ever said that to me before,” she said. Then he said something like, “ ‘I think that’s fair,’ ” she recalled. When she still hesitated, he pushed her down. “It was at that point that I was like, ‘I’ll just do it,’ ” she said. “I was like, ‘ “It will be over soon enough.”

Some alpha had her way with her most likely. Instead of just (seriously, and don’t laugh) saying “no,” his aplha dominance gave her pussy tingles. But since she’s talking to a reported about girl power, “yaaaa, he took me against my will.”

...

...

Even if this article is sad for future families, or idea of a family, and is bad for guys who prefer a stable long term deal, this is why TRP is so important on a couple of different levels. TRP preaches focusing on yourself, but also how to spin plates. This article is describing that there are an increasing number of women who only want to be plates apparently. For me, that’s a little depressing, since I was more of a LTR relationship guy before going my own way. (Couldn’t stand the game, but I still read up on it.) This is bad for me, but I like hearing plate spinning stories. If women want to play this “Fuck men, we don’t need ‘em! (But we wanna fuck ‘em)” game, then shit, I say let the games begin (or continue). This is where the “focusing on yourself, learn the game, lift, be the man she wants to fuck” is so important. She wants to fuck guys, no matter how much she won’t admit who that type of guy is, and so **be one of those guys**.

See, this is the thing beta’s don’t or can’t understand. They’re out there pleasing women, treating them like a queen, praising them in validation, showering them in attention, while he gets nothing. It’s ALPHAS girls like this are talking about. If they want that quick fuck, they’re going to get it from a stud since it’s only short term. They get the weekend AF and weekday BB from orbiters and her social media. All the while focusing on themselves and getting a ”you go girl!,” while men focusing on themselves gets a “you faggot, not chasing after women. Where are the real men (that are supposed to be pleasing us women” 

This sets the beta up for being a pussy all throughout college trying to court girls by being romantic, trying to demonstrate he’s LTR material. The bitch wants NOTHING to do with that. Mr. Beta, she wants your time, attention, money, validation, shoulder to cry on, etc. but just not your dick. For that, she’ll go seek out the ALPHA OR…untill she’s about to hit the wall.

The article ends with a save face, reconciling story about a girl who found hooking up to be almost degrading. She thinks casual sex is odd and immature and longed for a real relationship among all this superficial fucking. It’s a nice attempt by the writer. After shoving this “new age” way of thinking about sex/relationships in our face, claiming women are just adapting instead of being the exact reason relationships/families are crumbling, she ends with a story about a girl who liked the old kind of relationships. The writer’s attempt at claiming not all women are like that even though you spent 95% of the article claiming this is what women are turning relationships into.

Also, with this kind of culture going around, it obviously opens up more trouble in the false rape bullshit going on. Some guys may say it’s not worth the risk finding a girl like this, who is actively seeking out the AF. I’m just saying that if you’re going to hunt poon like this, it is potentially dangerous since more women are opting for casual sex only. 

I weep for the future. My potential future (ex) wife will be a used up, shallow, self-serving cunt who has no relationship building skills, works 60 hours a week, and wonders why she's depressed and wondering when the ""this is awesome being a man"" feeling is going to sink in.  


**TL;DR College/younger women are giving up on the idea of long term relationships, instead focusing on their careers. Adopt TRP, be someone she wants to get spun by, and get to spinning.

I'm finishing up my masters in a small engineering school in Paris, France.
To finalize my masters I have to find a 6 month internship, which I aim to complete in the US. I'm hoping this will lead to a junior position so I can make my stay permanent.
I'm mostly aiming for a web development position in a small scale company or a startup, and I think I'm not a bad candidate (3 solid internships so far, multiple personal projects and very relevant skills)
What I'm mostly getting is ""we're not looking for interns at this moment"", so am I too late? Too early? Or is it just too much of a hassle to hire a non-US citizen?

I can't really drop everything and move to the US on a whim, I'd like something stable to land on if I do. I know some companies are ready to sponsor students for J-1 visas, but is that only for large companies who can afford it?
Or should I take a leap of faith, move there after my degree and hope for the best?

This is a dilemma I am currently wresting with, as I received offers for full-time at a local firm as well an internship at big 4. Naturally, the Big 4 internship is enticing, but the one issue that's holding me up and making me consider the full-time offer is the uncertainty of how I will get money to pay rent/bills/tuition during the several months between the end of my internship and the start of a full-time position (assuming I get an offer).

The internship is for busy season, and after that ends I will need to take 8 more classes to finish grad school and get my 150, so I am assuming I would be starting full-time in early 2016.

Most of the people I talk to in my classes who interned at Big 4 and received full-time offers for after they graduate seem to just be in school full-time and working on the CPA exam. Do most of you live with your parents during this stretch, or rely on student loans to finance it? I'd love to come back to my current employer in the interim, but once I leave for the winter internship, they will need to hire a new person to replace me and spend time training them, so I do not expect that I will be able to just come back to my current role.

I have money saved up, but without any continued income, that savings will disappear in a hurry due to tuition, rent, etc. I am interested in hearing how some of you guys have tackled this situation."
2ksqnb,3,2014-10-30,Me [21 M] trying to get back together with [F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ksqnb/me_21_m_trying_to_get_back_together_with_f/,"I am an idiot, which I define as follows: An idiot is someone who knows what he is supposed to do, but does the opposite. I blame this on being an emotional creature that does this in the stupid hopes that what the girl says was truthful and not just some way to break up with me in a non-confrontational manner. It was to be expected, as she is a very caring person and I don't think she would want to hurt anyone.

Problem is, if I take what she says literally, which was that she had a ton of schoolwork and simply didn't have time to pursue this, I can easily make myself believe that she is still somewhat interested or could be in the not too distant future. And man, I really do want to believe it, and being an emotional idiot, I will definitely believe it, while knowing it probably isn't true.

Anyhow, we met back in September playing DnD, exchanged phone numbers, I invited her out, we went out three times and texted constantly from when we met to the last date, over a duration of three weeks. It was awesome, we got along great, had similar interests and I could really feel a relationship start to develop, but then I was an idiot on the last date. Well, not technically, but I should have known better. See, I'm new to this dating game, so I did what I usually do when I want to learn something: I search the internet. 

And found seddit. And really, I shouldn't shit on that sub, since I am certain it has helped a ton of people find confidence and get on in a lifestyle that interests them, and really people can decide however they want to live their lives, and the PUA one does have some advantages. But then I should have realised that's not what I'm interested in. I already had her number, she was already interested, I didn't need to learn to flirt and all that, I needed to be myself and we would just have a good time. Instead I tried being flirty with a ton of ""kino"", which in retrospect feels more like smothering her and somewhat clingy. Obviously no one wants that. 

I like to think it really wasn't all that bad, as I tried to make it natural but really, it wasn't good. Playful contact is what I should have just sticked too, as that just feels natural and can't come off as clingy. Just writing this makes me feel like an even bigger idiot, trying to be something I'm just not and thus definitely bad at. And she didn't say anything, because that would have been awkward and I doubt she would have done anything to hurt my feelings in any way.

Date still lasted a good 5 hours where we kept talking and enjoying each other's company, but we took the metro home, hugged, and that was that. I knew she had a ton of assignments and exams (I'm in an internship so have none of that),and acknowledged that she couldn't communicate as much. So from texting constantly on a daily basis it went to a few texts a week. I started worrying, as the texts were pretty short and  lacked the emoticons and exclamation marks that used to be all over the place, which is really just a style to give more emotion in a pretty boring medium.

I guess I kinda knew it was over, but gotta stay hopeful. Invited her out, she said she had too many assignments. No prob. Texted her later that week to go out for a drink, she said she didn't have time to pursue this with her workload, so I just said I understood (and really, assignments are killer) and she could contact me if she wanted to hang out again. As I had been expecting it, it only took me hard. Felt horrible for a week, but I'm pretty happy with myself so went to bars and drank more than usual without getting drunk, met some people at some events. Also found /r/relationships on which I've posted a bit and got some nice insight.

But then I'm always thinking of if and how I could get back together with her. I feel like she isn't interested anymore, and with reason, but I would really want to get to know her better and see if a relationship would be possible. We really didn't date for long, but I feel like I've ruined that with one date after getting along great for three weeks.

At first I really only wrote this because I needed to vent, but I guess I have a few questions. When I met her, I really wasn't looking for a relationship, I just happened to meet her and we clicked, and now don't feel like going out tofind someone as I believe the best relationships should start with finding someone without looking. I know the smart choice would be to just move on, forget about her, I'm young and there are a million fish in the sea and all that stuff, but really, I'm an emotional idiot and want to try to get back with her. Not right now, as I'll respect her saying she doesn't have time to pursue this right now (let me just assume she was being truthful about this and wasn't just breaking up with me from lack of interest). Probably around December after the exams, or around January when we are both in school (different Universities, but close enough).

I'm mostly wondering what I should say. I'd want to apologize and say that I won't be that smothering idiot again, but don't know how to bring it up since she definitely won't no matter how I contact her. I'm thinking of texting asking to call her, since I never did ever call her, then talking it out and seeing if she'd be interested in getting together. Not apologizing feels like she would just find an excuse to not confront me about my idiocy, and I'd doubt she'd want to meet up just like that.

Oh, and I'm also an idiot because I asked her some questions last night, and she answered them in a nice  but curt way. I figured since she dumped me, making the first contact so she can feel free to contact me afterwards. But again that's with the assumption that she only dumped me because she had too much work.

TL;DR Went out on three dates and had great chemistry, I was a smothering bad flirty idiot and she dumped me 2 weeks later to concentrate on her schoolwork, which she did have plenty of. Wondering how I can approach her to try and start going out again, apologizing somewhere along the way for being an idiot instead of being myself."

I recently completed several comprehensive web development courses (Front-End, Ruby, Ruby on Rails) and have a few user facing web apps deployed to Heroku ([my portfolio](http://dbogs.com), [Swelfie](http://swelfie.us), [Moving Bro](http://www.movingbro.com)). I feel comfortable with all the standard Rails CRUD operations, MVC, PSQL/MySQL, TDD, using gems, and styling with front-end languages and frameworks like Bootstrap. 

I'm doing a few contract projects, but it seems like the next step to really grow is to get a junior level job or internship. I attend all the Ruby and Rails meetups in my area which has helped me land a few interviews. So far I've interviewed at 6 places in my area (San Diego, CA), but they all seem to be looking for mid or senior level developers. Does anyone have any recommendations on where to look for the more junior level roles? I've used AngelList and a few other job sites, but to little avail. Thanks!"

Need advice,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2kt0bm/me_to_software_need_advice/,"In May I graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering. In my last semester I discovered python. I spoke with a friend in CS about the software development cycle and was hooked. I spent my time since then struggling to decide which path to take which amounted to much floundering and no job in either field. 

It's not that I did poorly in school. I graduated with honors from a prestigious engineering school, but my heart was never in it. I didn't bother getting internships and now it's coming back to haunt me.

I've been working odd jobs to pay rent as I'm underqualified for software dev jobs and I'm running out of money. I don't know how to enter the field and I'm afraid I'll get stuck doing work that isn't challenging or creative. 

I'd like to program full-time, but I'm new to it. I have personal experience building PCs, running Linux, and I worked the summer installing windows in an IT environment. I was thinking about starting in IT and working my way up. Is there much programming in IT or is it mostly tech support, tickets, and maintaining a network? I'm not interested in Grad school.

TL;dr
*is there an entry level job title where I can apply ME knowledge while practicing python?*

2kt8fj,3,2014-10-30,How should I handle a job offer with future potential offers?,multjobsprobs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2kt8fj/how_should_i_handle_a_job_offer_with_future/,"I am currently a senior in college, graduating in May 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. Last summer, I interned with a fairly large company (let's refer to them as company A) relatively close to my home. The commute wasn't terrible and, for the most part, I enjoyed the work that I was doing. At the end of the summer, it came time for them to make decisions about hiring but I let them know that I had a six week winter break in which I would be more than willing to work a second internship (I assumed it would give me more time to impress them and provide me with a source of income over my winter break). They agreed and we went on our separate ways for the next few months. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I participated in a programming competition sponsored by another large company (company B) and our group managed second place. Two days ago, I received a job offer from company B and am now kind of stuck on what to do. I have until next Friday to accept my offer from company B. My main problem with it is that it's in another state. After graduating college, I intended on living at home for a year to pay off some loans and save some money by not having to pay for rent.

I'm ecstatic with my job offer from company B, but with another internship to work before I graduate, I almost feel as though accepting B means I can't do my internship for A. However, my contract with company B states that my position begins with them in June 2015. I want to work my internship this winter because I want to see if company A gives me an offer as well.

How should I handle a situation like this? Both companies are big name companies, have great benefits, etc. But if I let company B slip away, I won't have their offer on the table after next Friday. If I accept B, can I still work for A this winter? If A offers me a job after this winter, would retracting my acceptance from B to accept A (and in turn staying closer to home) burn bridges with company B?"

me and my ex-gf spent 2,5 years together. Overall we had a good time. But the last 2-3 months were rough. I had to move away from the town where we both studied and we talked less and less. Our sex life was pretty much non existant and because I had an internship 600 km away we didn't see us for 1 month. We both pretty much knew that it was over. So we ended our relationship consensual (per mobile) and in the first 2 months I was doing pretty good. We texted from time to time and I started getting feelings for her again and because our ending per mobile was embarrassing we met again.

We talked for 2-3 hours and we both decided that we should try it again. Because we were a happy couple and we both thought that we are able to do it if we avoid our mistakes in the past.

Well that was last month and after 1 week were we texted and phoned regulary everything went to shit. I gave my best to be a good boyfriend but nothing came back. Yesterday I got a message where she told me that she doesn't have time for a relationship right now and therefore can't be together with me.

I always thought she is an honest and kind women but I feel cheated because she left me hanging in the air for 3 weeks. It hurts to be treated like that from a person you trusted and loved. For the first time in over 10 years I had to cry for a good hour.

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to write that from my chest. Time for me to find a hobby that distracts me.

Question 2:
If I stick with them for the year and summer, will I have trouble finding work as a software engineer/developer when I graduate next year with only a software test internship? i.e will companies only want me for test/QA positions?

Our anniversary is in less than two weeks. We've been dating since high school and because of that, we've both changed a lot... and I mean *a lot*. She's so much more cynical than when we were in high school. She's always been sarcastic, but now it's more dark and sometimes it just makes me feel like shit. She also has no filter when it comes to telling me about shit that I do wrong, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it always comes off in the worst way possible. The other day, I was complaining about how shitty our town's traffic lights are - a really insignificant complaint in the grand scheme of things. She said, ""Oh yeah, complain some more, that's really attractive."" I told her that that wasn't nice and she just said, ""well, would you rather me be all fake and not say a word?"" I just said no, but I don't really like it when you're so blunt about it. She just kind of brushed it off. I don't know, maybe that's on me. 

It's also gotten to the point where if she has a bad day, I have a bad day. She takes everything out on me. Just the other day, I was having a fantastic day. I got word that I'm getting an internship with the company I wanted and I got a pretty significant raise at my current job, all in one day. I took her out for lunch today thinking I'd be able to share my happiness with her, but no. She took an exam this morning and bombed it and, understandably, she was in a terrible mood. I used to be able to cheer her up from things like that by making her laugh and whatnot, but none of those tactics worked today. She just told me that I was being annoying. I don't get it. This has been the case for quite awhile, too, and this case isn't isolated.

I've tried breaking it off with her a handful of times, but I just can't ever let her go. She always winds up crying, which is my kryptonite, and then it eventually always somehow turns into being my fault for not communicating despite her getting mad at me when I tell her that she's doing something I don't like.

Fuck. I don't know how to get out. And there's this great girl that's been talking to me and shown a lot of interest in me in class over the past few weeks. She seems much more happy and less sarcastic/dark/cynical. She's also quite a bit more attractive physically, but that's not the point. I want to be with someone who is going to make me happy. It doesn't have to be this girl, but she's reminded me of the type of girl I used to strive for before my current girl changed.

It also doesn't help that my aunt, who I'm very close with, has figured out that I'm not happy with her. She's also in cahoots with my mom about it, so both of them keep trying to find girls from me. It's really frustrating to have either of them try and undermine my relationship, but at the same time, they've had some very persuasive arguments.

How do I escape? I feel like I keep letting myself down by not being stronger about leaving her and my best friend, who I'd normally get great unbiased advice from over anything, isn't a great resource because he doesn't like her and he hasn't ever had to deal with a breakup."

2ku215,8,2014-10-30,Not motivated to get motivated,blergggggggg,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2ku215/not_motivated_to_get_motivated/,"Where to even begin....  I don't even really know what my point is in writing this, but I know I want to put down the pipe for a while, and I thought maybe just putting in to words what I was feeling would help.

I first smoked pot when I was 12 years old.  I am now 32.  I have smoked pot almost every day for the last 15 years.

It definitely caused some obstacles in my life when I was younger.  A few run-ins with the law, dropped out of high school, spent some time without a home to call my own.

But a lot of that was just the rebelliousness of youth.  I can't really say that those things wouldn't have happened had I not been smoking, but it certainly didn't help.

After a few years of working shitty jobs and renting cheap rooms I went back to school.  I graduated college, landed a programming internship in my senior year that turned into a full-time gig, and now I'm making a very comfortable living as a professional web developer.

In the last year I also got married to a beautiful loving woman, and bought my first house.

So, in many ways I feel like weed hasn't really held me back.  I've accomplished pretty much everything that I feel I should have at this point, and I've had a lot of good times, and made great friends along the way.

However, lately I've just been feeling bored and unfulfilled. Nothing really interests me any more.  I used to smoke pot and feel energized, intellectually curious and creative.  Now I just feel bored.

But I can't seem to stop.  I recently went a few days without smoking and it was almost unbearable.  I quickly fell into a deep depression.  That feeling of complete emptiness.  It's not a sadness, just a sensation where you feel like you've never had a single emotion in your life, and that life itself is pointless.  I couldn't eat, my appetite was completely gone.  I immediately got incredibly constipated and had stomach pains for the whole duration of not smoking.  I was extremely tired to the point where all I wanted to do was lay in bed, but when I did I found myself incredibly restless and unable to fall asleep. I just felt constantly uncomfortable.

As soon as I smoked again I felt better.  I took a giant shit.  I was able to eat.  I was laughing and smiling and enjoying life once again. I was able to listen to my wife vent about her workday without getting agitated.  I honestly felt like a better, more tolerant, happier person.

But shit is is starting to pile up. Owning a home is a lot of work.  There is still a bedroom in our house without a door because I've been too lazy to hang one.  Our bedroom doesn't have a light fixture on the ceiling for the same reason.  I have a list of about 30 things I need to do and I just can't find the energy to do them.

I feel like a depressed asshole when I'm not smoking.  And I have very little ambition when I am.

Perhaps the hardest part about all of this is that if I'm doing my hardest to not smoke, all it takes is one moment of weakness.  I can drive 1 mile down the road and buy weed legally from a store without a prescription or anything.  There's another store literally next door to my office, and another that I pass on my drive home from work.

I feel like in order to really stop, I have to perceive the benefits of quitting to be greater than the benefits of not quitting.  And right now I don't know how to do that.  I have this idea that everything in my life will magically become better if I just do this one thing.  But another part of me says that I'll be just as lazy and unmotivated if I quit, but I'll also be pissed off and physically uncomfortable.

I know I'm probably just rationalizing my addiction to a small (large) degree.  But knowing that you're rationalizing doesn't necessarily make the rationalizations any less convincing."

Tuesday through Friday I work part time from 2:30 pm- 6:30 pm

I usually study around 10pm-11am  (willing to change that too), I also use the weekends to catch up on sleep and study more. I basically have no life. =/. But it will be worth it in the end..=]

I workout every Friday 8pm (cardio for 1hr follow by 30 min of yoga), Saturday and Sunday 5:30am (cardio for 1hr follow by 30min of yoga)

My diet is mostly: whatever mom cooks, Water w/ apple cider, Greens, Meat, CHEESE, BACON, Folgers Coffee w/Almond Milk (original) and if no milk is available I'll have Coffee w/ no sugar (I like the bitter taste.....I don't drink coffee as much...only when needed)....I don't eat any junk food.....but I occasionally will binge on PIZZA....as a last minute meal....

Months go by, we get to know each other more, and we end up (or at least I do) liking each other. But then as soon as he gets what he wants he says he wants to be distant, and all the other dbag stuff jerks say to try to ensure a consistent, nonserious fuck, without regard to another person's feelings. This was after 3-4 months of doing some serious emotional investment with me presumably because it was the summer and he was bored so whatevs.

Now that I am not blinded by like....I am going to break this guy down, and I hope this works for any other guy/girl dealing with self-esteem issues caused by some sort of romantic interest gone awry. I will divide this (rather subjective) analysis into subheadings. You shouldn’t spend weeks (like me) struggling to realize that you ARE good enough and that you are not worthless. 

*clears throat*

ROMANTIC INTEREST POST-ASSESSMENT

For the purpose of not revealing identities... I shall call him '#6'.

INTELLECT (5/10)
#6 isn’t smart… honestly he is mediocre even though he takes Adderall for his ADHD. He once told me that he thinks he got into our college (its pretty competitive to get in here) because of his essay on dealing with ADHD and how it helped him (he went from lame grades to getting 5’s on AP tests within the span of a year) and I doubted it! I thought he was a smart dude… but I totally see it now lol. However, if you dare try to test his critical thinking skills you will be sorely disappointed (assuming you expected him to have some sort of depth beforehand). 

ACADEMICS/CAREER PROGRESS (7/10)

Average, but he has nothing spectacular going for him. If I had to compare him with others that were born in his circumstances I would say he could be a little brighter haha. The only reason he was able to get an internship this summer was because his parents had to find one for him (for something completely unrelated to his major) and he still didn’t get the first couple of internships that were handed to him.

SEXUAL PERFORMANCE (6.5/10)
It’s really hard to be objective about this because I def had feelings for the dude at the time so my natural reaction would be “yes he was good”… But feelings aside he was probably the least fun in bed. He has this knack of going to the missionary position like most of the time and it gets boring! I mean it was nice that he would get turned on when I bit him… but I am learned enough to know that he isn’t the only one out there into that shit lol. He has stamina but no creativity so…. if you are a sucker for fucking in the same position for a long time then you would enjoy it, but if you (like me) like to have fun with the guy before/during/after sex I would not recommend. 

SEX APPEAL (2/10)
Slim to none. I am 90% sure I took his virginity… if not, then he probably had a 1-night stand before me, but he was probably way too intoxicated, or it was way too long ago for him to remember the mechanics. Anyway, he can literally prance around naked or half-naked in front of me and I legit won’t be tempted. I was tempted before because I liked him and I thought moments with him were pretty special but now that that’s gone I can honestly say he is one of the least attractive men I have been with. Now that I think about it… he IS the least attractive man I have been with lol. Wait! No he is tied for last with some guy I dated years ago. Seriously though since our unofficial relationship fell apart I noticed that every dude I have hooked up with after him has been hotter. Actually... even when I liked him a lot I still didn’t think he was hot. At most I thought he was cute, but like I said…. I definitely liked the dude a lot. My guy friends were actually surprised when I told them we were fooling around because he is juuuuuust pretty average-looking. Definitely not unattractive, but not someone I would hook up with for shits and giggles unless I were completely smashed (which ironically is how I met him haha).

EMOTIONAL AVAILABILITY (3/10)
Well this is hard because if you happen to be around him a lot and at the same time expect him to show the least amount of effort as possible -and be chill about it- then (9/10). But this isn’t an ideal world so you probably are human, and you also probably have a life, conscious, worries, problems, and stuff do so you should probably try not getting too close to this dude if the latter sounds more like your situation.

WORK ETHIC (7/10)
Eh, I guess….he studies a decent amount so I will give him a (7/10). That being said, he has no job, takes 3 classes (real classes anyway) a quarter, barely plays a club sport and still isn’t doing so hot in his major-related courses so I really don’t think he has no motivation or intelligence to be labeled anything other than a little above average (at my college anyway). 

SENSITIVITY (10/10, 2/10)
(a) Received (10/10)
	He will eat compliments up with a spoon.
(b) Reciprocated (2/10)
	It took about 1 month or 2 for him to finally say I was ‘cute’. I don’t even care about compliments much… but that’s markedly less than all of my ex’s and SO’s. 
PENIS SIZE (5/10)
I’m not saying he has a small penis… but I am going to admit that of the 6 men I have slept with, his has been the smallest. When I first saw his penis I didn’t think it was fully erect…. it was lol. 

TLDR: If you are looking for a fuckbuddy then be honest to your partner BEFORE you do shit... also women have standards jeez... even if its just a fuckbuddy u should at least be as hot as her or awesome in bed if you expect a nice fuck."

I'm not sure if one week is enough for me to prepare, especially in the midst of two class projects and my other extracurriculars. I actually requested to be considered for their paid internship program because I'm not too confident in my programming knowledge compared to those of my peers. It's also been 6 months since my algorithms course and I don't remember much.

I'm afraid that if I re-schedule for a later time, it will be a phone interview and I think I'm terrified of doing poorly and not getting a second interview. Oddly enough I don't feel as terrified at the prospect of coding on a board. I'm going to email the recruiter asking if the interview is for the internship program or an actual dev position since we never discussed that, but I just wanted to hear your thoughts first. This would be my first technical interview, if I decide to take it.

Thanks in advance."
2kvike,0,2014-10-31,My open letter to Vince McMahon,[deleted],SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2kvike/my_open_letter_to_vince_mcmahon/,"Dear Vince,

Have you been reading the news lately? Things are starting to look bad… You’re nowhere near enough subscribers on the network an you’re company is bleeding money. Even you, up in your ivory tower, must feel there is something that you’re doing wrong. I can’t say I speak for every wrestling fan out there, but I think my views convey the general feeling there is in the wrestling community.

First of all, I must say there are many things the WWE is finally doing right:

- You finally started pushing new talent. The wyatt’s, The shield, Daniel Bryan, Cesaro, Ziggler (finally) getting a chance once again, Rusev, …. A step in the good direction.

- AJ and Paige are putting on diva’s matches that are actually worth watching

- Bringing back your legends for shorter runs and short appearances (the execution is not always great though, but more on that later)

Now, you’re probably sitting there wondering: If I’m doing so many great things why is business going downhill? The answer to me is quite simple: you have no clue who you’re audience is and how they’re going to spend their hard-earned dollars, and what is going to get them so far that they will cough up 120$/year.

Although you might think there are many 8-year olds that pay the bills and just might want to subscribe to the network, little kids have very limited access to money, and many parents aren’t willing to give it to them, they can watch wrestling for free. And no kid is going to “re-live those classic moments” now are they? 

Let’s say for sake of argument that there are 10 million active raw-viewers at the moment world-wide, that means for every 100 viewers there aren’t even 8 people subscribed to the network. And It’s soooo cheap. You even catch-phrased the price: 9,99… But it’s not selling so well is it? 

The WWE has in its possession the collective wrestling memories of almost every wrestling fan there ever was. Whether it’s ECW, WCW, NWA, SMW. You own nearly everything. And that’s something people are willing to pay for. You want to sell your network? It’s not going to happen through Total diva’s… Get some interns to watch everything in the WWE library and give it to us. 

There are literally 1000’s of hours of wrestling that I would love to see, but can’t. Instead of shoving all current stars down our throat, or selecting episodes for us (really, how arrogant is that!), let us choose. You want to see every Smokey mountain wrestling tape *check*. You want to see every match we own of Eddie Guerrero *Check*, you want to see every match there was for the Cruiserweight Title *check*. Yes it’s a lot of work, we get that, you’d have to label and organize everything, but that’s a job anyone can do, and a lot of people would want to do, so get cracking! 

But wait! There’s more, I’m on a roll, so let’s fix the waning viewership numbers as well! There is 3 hours of raw every week, of which 1h-1h30 is actually worth watching (as the average show only has about 55 minutes of wrestling in it). The only way I’m watching that is if I can fast forward A LOT! Do you ever watch an episode of raw from 15 years ago Vince? It was entertaining, there were great matches, great skits and you know what I’ve noticed? You’d rarely get the exact same matches for weeks in a row!

Last Sunday in HIAC I was watching the promo for the match to come Orton/Cena. Oh, How they were gonna settle the score this time! This time… This time? Vince, Have you any idea how often these guys have finally settled their scores in the last year? It was the 5th time they went 1 on 1 at a ppv in a year. They also met in a fatal 4-way, MITB and Elimination chamber, Went head to head on raw 2 times and were in opposing teams on raw 8 times. I’m starting to get the feeling that if they really wanted to settle the score they would’ve by now. 

You know how many times we’ve seen the Usos vs Rhodes in one way or another? The dance between Miz, Ziggler, Sheamus &amp; Cesaro? AJ vs Paige? Ambrose vs Rollins? The last months this is the raw card we’ve been getting (slight deviations are possible):

-	Uso’s &amp; Sheamus or Ziggler vs Star and Golddust &amp; Miz or Cesaro

-	The ones that weren’t in the match above

-	AJ – Paige (with or without partners)

-	Rusev wins against an American

-	The authority vs Ambrose &amp; Cena

And you know what, that’s a good card. Most matches were great, the level at which all of these superstars are competing has been awesome. BUT do I need to see it every week? No! If you count really well the card above contains 15 men and 2 women. Not counting the injured and Part-timers you have 40 men and 12 women. Use them! I get that not everyone has to be on every show but some change in scenery is never a bad thing.

You know how you’ve been trying to go for a change of scenery? Bringing in some part-timers. They get great pops, and I bet they sell some decent merchandise as well. Jericho’s run was pretty good and It’s nice to see Rocky and Foley show up, but let’s be honest. Do you still believe it’s ok for your big champion to not show up week after week? You even shut Paul Heyman up for a while because he made it painfully obvious how bad for business that is. Do you have any idea how dumb it is for Seth Rolling to be carrying his briefcase everywhere? Doesn’t he know the champ is not going to be there? I mean we all do… And how big of a slap in the face is that for all those guys travelling each week, working hard on house-shows, to then never get as much as a televised match? How big a slap in the face is it to fans to just say that you’re champion is “too good” to even have to appear? At least have the decency to write it into a decent storyline. Why didn’t you do a storyline where your champ gets injured and can’t compete for a few months, but you don’t want to strip him from the title. Oh right…

How lazy exactly are your writers?

I’m not saying I would do a better job, I know I would. I’m actually sure that if you would take any 5 redditors from the squaredcircle and ask them to write the next episode of raw it would be better than anything those typewriting monkeys of yours are copy-pasting week in, week out. 

All I’m trying to say, Vince, is that if you want to attract a bigger audience try to aiming for a broader audience, I truly believe there is a possibility to create a show that has great storytelling, a funny skit every now and then, great wrestling matches and, just to please you, can even make captain fruit-loops look so awesome for kids that you will still sell his T-shirts.

Maybe you no longer have it in you, maybe you lost the connection with your audience, or maybe you’re just surrounded by idiots and Yes-men, but by now you really should see that something has to change. You don’t have to listen to me and I may very well be wrong (and if so I’m very certain the Reddit-community will tell me how and why), but I do believe that I’m quite close to the truth here.

Best regards from a still hopeful WWE-fan

I've had an abusive childhood until I was about 12 when I learned I could fight back. My first attempt was when I was 7. I still remember this fairly clearly.

When I was 14 I was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD. I was a very violent teenager, I destroyed stuff at home and in school, threw punches, including at teachers. I've been suspended countless times, at the end of 10th Grade I was placed on an indefinite suspension which lasted 9 months, out of nowhere I got a call to come back for 11th in September - where I got kicked out at Christmas.

I had an overwhelming drive to succeed because I had a money or die attitude, during 9th, 10th and 11th Grade I studied from 4PM to 4AM with only a break for dinner. I got between 3 and 4 hours of sleep and failed everything. My highest mark was 13%. There was also a girl I liked who was very smart and currently studies at Oxford, I tried to compare myself with her, not because I wanted to prove anything to her but because I wanted to be better. 
 
Since I've been kicked out of school I've tried various internships and I currently manage my Father's investment portfolio and take a cut, I've beat the market 3 years in a row. I got fired from two internships for destruction of property. I had to pay a settlement on both occasions to avoid police action.

I've slept with hookers when I was 17 and became a heavy smoker at 15 which caused me to drop my sport where I had a prominent position. 

I've put on 88lbs in a year, been through 4 doctors and psychologists, ECT and several stints in a high intensity ward at our mental health institute. I have made 3 attempts since then, ended up in hospital twice. 

Then there's the usual relationship and friendship issues. Naturally, I drove people away with my negativity. I still live with my parents but they're extremely disappointed with me and don't really interact. I can't do anything, I feel paralysed by what's going on in my head and the effects of stress on my body. I feel like I'm just going to repeat what's happened in the past. "

2kvwm5,21,2014-10-31,What should I do next / when do I know that I know enough to start applying for jobs?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2kvwm5/what_should_i_do_next_when_do_i_know_that_i_know/,"This is a long post, but I genuinely don't know what to do next, and yes I have read the sidebar.

I've been messing around with computers since my early teens, and now I'm about to finish my CS degree, but in a terrible college with terrible teachers with no real job prospects (not even internships), so I've been trying to learn everything on my own from the internet instead.

When do I know if I know enough to start applying for jobs? And if I write here what I have already learned over the last few years, could someone tell me what I'm lacking and should learn next in order to be able to apply for jobs? I just never feel like I know enough, and like to learn more. I'm kind of a jack of a few trades and a master of none.

I've divided it into sections so anyone with knowledge of either can focus on that part instead, since this is a long post and I can't expect people to read all of it.

**Web**:

I've been messing around with HTML and CSS, and a little bit of Javascript for years, and I can implement any old world static site with relative ease. Responsive layouts are a bit of a mystery to me. I do stick to the HTML5 standard, and do often use percentages and ems, but I'm not sure when to use which one, and how font sizes related to that. JQuery usually just for animation and AJAX. Should I learn AngularJS? Heard a lot about it. Have never used Photoshop, Illustrator, etc for web design, which I hear is very important in the front end business.

I can use basic PHP to include stuff and do basic behind the scenes programming, and have made basic dynamic websites using it (including working with MySQL). There was an online course of Harvard's CS50 course which had fun little PHP projects. I have messed around with Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET (I technically have a Microsoft Certified Professional and Microsoft Training Associate certificate for it, but I don't actually know much, and I suspect they're not that important anyway) and JSP.

Questions: I don't understand how the regular users update sites though. As in say I write a PHP based website for a local small business and do stuff like using controllers and views to implement it along with a small MySQL database, and say I upload it on a server and give it to the client. What if that person wants to update the site? Does he have to manually open the php file and make changes and manually upload the file to the server? I suppose I'll have to use a CMS for that like Wordpress and just instruct the client how to operate it? What if I'm making a blog for a friend, same deal? Use some kind of a ready made CMS or some kind of framework and tell them how to use it?

What should I be looking to learn in web dev? Should I focus on learning stuff like Wordpress? Should I focus on Rails or Django? Is there any real preference between stuff like PHP, Python, Ruby, etc and should I learn stuff about that? How about Node.js?

**Mobile**:

I've been doing a bit of Android programming the last year or so. There's so much stuff in it! I have to Google almost every little thing, and stackoverflow and the Android Developer site become a highly visited sites for me. Is it cheating to refer to stackoverflow?

I've made a few simple apps, one for finding Instagram pictures posted near your location (thought it was simple, took weeks to actually do), one for sending commands from my phone and controlling my PC with it using socket programming, and a minimal app I made last night to type in a name of a TV show and display basic information about it (where a lot of the APIs were not that good for me so frustrated, I just wrote an IMDB web scraper instead which somehow ended up faster than the third party IMDB APIs). Some smaller apps for testing features and completing two of the courses on Coursera in the last year.

Haven't submitted an app to the Play Store yet because of the entry fee and some kind of incompatibility with the debit card I have and Google Wallet. Should I get a credit card for this instead? The entire reason I got a debit card was to avoid credit cards.

Even though Android is quite frustrating and it literally takes me a week to do something that I could do in a day in HTML, it's still very fun to do.

No experience with iOS or any of the cross platform SDKs.

What should I focus on learning next in mobile (specifically Android)? Any apps I should try building for practice? Maybe learn the NDK?

**General Programming**

I had basic Java all four years of high school so that's fairly strong, and working with Android has given me better understanding of inheritance and interfaces.

Basic C and C++ were taught in college so I suppose I know that but pointers still often give me the heebie-jeebies although I can use them. Basics are fine, although I'm not that well versed in STL and have to look things up all the time.

I started learning Python to pass the time and find it amazing, and constantly use it to write smaller programs and scripts. I exclusively use Python to solve the Project Euler problems, and write little scripts making use of APIs like imgur and gfycat using Python. Not a lot of experience using classes, or even more than a single python file in a project really.

I have messed around with C#, Scala, Ruby, Racket, 16 bit Assembly, as part of coursework of either college courses or online courses (like [this](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang) amazing one).

I take part in the kind of competitions where you have to take in an input and get a specific output, but I tend to brute force my way through the problem, which is fine for local competitions, but leave me with O(n^2) solutions which don't really fly in online international competitions. Any particular things I should look at to improve that?

Which languages should I look to focus on primarily in terms of employability?

**finally {**

This ended up being longer than I initially thought it would, but I thought someone with knowledge and experience could tell me what I need to focus on learning or improving to be employable if they read what I know.

A part of the reason it may seem a bit less for someone who's about to graduate with a CS degree is because the place I'm at is really not conducive to learning about computers. The college is suppose to be in English, but most of the teachers aren't comfortable with the language and neither are the students. Most of the students themselves are not interested in computers at all, but are doing this because they were told they'd get great jobs in engineering, or because their parents wanted them to go into a 'respectable' field. The teachers themselves tell us that the only reason they got into teaching was because they were rejected by the companies and had no other choice.

I have nobody to guide me, which is fine, I'm not a baby (barring this post), but I just need to know where to focus my efforts. I'm comfortable with  all three main topics as a career, so I'd appreciate any advice for each of them.

I don't even have a resume. All my stuff is quite general so what stuff should I actually put on my resume? I'm guessing the stuff with only basic familiarity should be excluded completely? I've taken some 15-20 free online courses with certificates (which don't mean much since people could potentially cheat and get the required score to obtain them), I realize these are inconsequential to employers, but I've honestly learnt more from them than I have from college, could it at least merit a single line in the resume as an indicator of active interest in learning more?

I'm not here to look for a job, I'm here to find out what to learn and know in order to get one.

2kwtao,4,2014-10-31,Sober for two months. Thoughts on quitting young (age 23),squatmeyeah,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2kwtao/sober_for_two_months_thoughts_on_quitting_young/,"I quit drinking after Labor Day Weekend this year, which puts me at almost exactly 2 months sober. I turned 23 in August. 

It's been an amazing two months. I don't have a horrible rock bottom story and probably have a late high school - early postundergrad relationship with alcohol that's familiar to a lot of you. I hope this will help someone who feels like something is wrong in their relationship with alcohol, but doesn't want to make the leap because he/she is young or the binge-drinking culture is so familiar that it seems normal.

I started drinking with my friends when I was about 16. We didn't start with sneaking a few beers here and there, we basically got someone's older brother to buy us a handle of vodka and drank till we puked. Very 0-60. I continued in that kind of binge-drinking culture through college, a major state school in the Midwest. The kind of culture that tells you over and over you-can't-have-fun-without-alcohol, bros-go-hard, and that drinking cheap liquor from the bottle 4 or 5 nights a week is normal. That kind of environment numbs you to seeing people puking, going to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, and makes you think ""it's college"" is a valid excuse for all kinds of horrible behavior. If you have recently gone through one of these State University degree factories it's probably a pretty familiar sight.

I made a lot of bad decisions during those times, arguably more than most people. Drinking and driving, injuring myself, even getting violent once or twice in a state of complete blackout. I was surprised to find that college wasn't like the movies, with hot coeds throwing themselves at me for just showing up to the party. I didn't have that rare ""bar charm"" (what I like to call it) that some guys seem to have and my brand of belligerently drunk was not doing it for the ladies, so I didn't get laid that much. That resulted in me drinking more which made me broke and get mediocre grades, which made me drink more. Rinse and repeat. 

Admittedly, this resulted in the stereotypical modern day entitled white boy anger that is the bane of today's college campuses. Symptoms: destructive behavior, being bitter about women, and generally being an asshole. I struggled for years trying to ""cut back"" but I didn't stand a chance. I didn't have the courage or emotional maturity to walk away from the scene. 

Things started turning around my senior year. I stumbled into a good internship, cleared up my acne (another source of great anger), and got a girlfriend. Most of the time I could keep my drinking under control, but I noticed there were still stretches of weeks where I drank constantly, and certain nights when I would get out of control and act a fool.

Getting out of college and into the working world was a huge relief at this point. I could walk away from the location of most of my life's shame. I reconnected with an amazing woman from my past. I really, really tried to pump the brakes on the drinking, but it was too late. Work functions and dinner with my gf's parents were excruciating. I had never really just ""sipped"" a couple drinks before and it took all my mental energy not to drink too fast or too much. I couldn't loosen up until several drinks deep when I truly started losing inhibition because I was too afraid of embarrassing myself, since embarrassing myself was my reality for years. I never drank too much at a work function or in front of my gf's parents thankfully, but when I would reconnect on weekends with old friends sometimes I would still black out and lose it. It felt inevitable.

I happened to be reading about John Mulaney quitting at 23 the week before Labor Day. It gave me hope that this cool, smart, famous guy could be cool, smart, and famous without booze. That weekend, in NY, I blacked out, acted like an asshole to my girlfriend, pissed on the hotel room floor, simmered in that familiar stew of shame, and decided enough was enough. These incidents were starting to feel inevitable and I wasn't really enjoying drinking anymore, just trying to avoid humiliation. Plus if I'm honest, I really only feel good from drinks 1-5 on the way up, the rest is just trying to avoid disaster.

In the last two months I've felt much better than I have in the last 5 years. I'm healthier and I'm able to get on top of esophagus issues I caused during college. I'm a better employee. I have a better relationship with my girlfriend. I’m having better conversations with literally everyone I meet. I'm forced to have more interesting things to talk about besides how wasted I was this weekend. I can do fun activities on weekend mornings. 

The biggest, most satisfying changes aren't on the outside though. It's not my energy, my performance at work, my improved conversation skills. It's the inside. I'm much less angry. I'm much (MUCH) more confident. I finally had the strength to say no thanks, I respect myself too much to drink. I have better things to do with my time on this earth, and that feeling of shame is never, ever worth even the most perfect buzz. I feel like I'm a man and I'm in control of my life now. 

About quitting in your early twenties: NO ONE CARES, especially your real friends. The biggest mental hump to get over for me was thinking that I was too cool to quit drinking. I had to accept that when I'm drinking I'm not a rockstar, I'm a bad “angry white-boy” cliche. Being a ""degenerate"" isn't a badge of honor. Stop trying to act like Don Draper or Hank Moody.

In fact, I've gotten a lot of respect from people, young and old, and received a lot of ""yeah I'm trying to slow down"" from people who I know drink pretty heavily, like they’re confessing to me. People respect those who are true to themselves and have values and draw hard lines in their lives and don't cross them. They don't respect you being from ""Up for Whatever, USA"". Also, there's a whole world of people who have fun without binge drinking. Sign up for organized activities. Stop pretending like you're too cool for that shit. I've got floor hockey playoffs this weekend and it's way more awesome to spend a clear-headed Saturday morning competing than a late Friday night at the bar. Plus let's be honest, you have to be kind of crazy to REALLY love the bar scene. It's aggressive and ugly and vapid and expensive.

I read this book called Unwasted: My Lush Sobriety by Sacha Scoblic that really, really helped me solidify my decision. She quit drinking in her early thirties and my journey’s different than hers, of course, but if you feel like you relate to my story much more than “I wake up in a pool of vomit and blood three times a week” then you should check it out. I think she’s beautifully captured how binge-drinking is kind of this insidious poison on your social life, your self-respect, and your ability to grow into a decent human being."

If I want to start looking for jobs after college how can I go about getting myself known in other states. For example if I want a job in Seattle what is the best way to get companies to look at me?

Anyone who has helped an abused friend cut contact, please help.",asdfghelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2kx1tu/my_friend_20f_has_an_emotionally_and_verbally/,"I'm 20f and I've had this friend for about a year now. We don't live in the same state anymore, but still talk a lot online. We met during an internship as roommates at a major amusement park, and shared a bedroom for about 6 months. I consider her one of my closest friends.

My friend, who we will call Jane, has known this guy, who we will call Hans, for about a year now. They dated for about a month, without actually knowing each other in person, and then he randomly stopped talking to her, came out as bi, then came out as gay, and then they eventually were friends again. It was complicated and weird, but none of us believe he is actually gay. That's besides the point, but he's just a really sketchy character with a sketchy background.

He moved to this major amusement park to work in about March and they met in person for the first time, and started to hang out multiple times a week. I got really bad vibes from him before I even knew him. He's the type to be really sweet and affectionate and acting all close with Jane for a few weeks, and then treat her like absolute shit for a few weeks. It's just gotten worse and worse the longer I've known her.

In the past couple of months, the emotional abuse has been ridiculous; he sometimes acts like they're in a couple by holding hands with her, telling her he loves her, and otherwise being affectionate to keep her holding onto some sort of hope that something will happen with them (which I think she's since lost). He's *very* manipulative.

But he's verbally abusive and insults her openly, calling her ugly, fat, telling her she'll never find a boyfriend or make other friends, 
telling her she's bad at things, etc. None of it is true and it breaks my heart because I know it gets to her. Of course it does, he's one of the most important people to her, even though he absolutely shouldn't be.

He's been physically abusive to the point of leaving bruises a couple of times. He slapped her across the face once for something very, very trivial, to the point of leaving a bruise on her cheek, and acted dumb afterwards by asking ""Did I just hit you?"" and then apologized. 

He also read a bunch of her Facebook messages last night without her permission and for all of the ones saying bad things about him, some of which were mine, he put the blame on her. It was really emotionally taxing on her from what I heard.

He's a terrible person. He treats her so badly and she doesn't deserve it at all. No one does, but she's such a sweet and good person and I've always been telling her how bad he is for her and that she should cut him out of her life. I've been especially proactive in that department since he hit her. She's gotten a lot of long messages from me saying he's not going to change, she doesn't deserve it, that she should cut him out of her life, and that I'm there for her.

What else can I do? Anyone with experience with abuse, please help me. She doesn't talk to her family about these things and I know I'm one of her closest friends.

**tl;dr**: Friend has close friend who manipulates her constantly, verbally and emotionally abuses her, and has physically abused her and I expect he will again someday. What can I do?"
2kx2d0,0,2014-10-31,"A long shot, but I have a question about a university",djp06475,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/2kx2d0/a_long_shot_but_i_have_a_question_about_a/,"##ABOUT ME

[almost] 22 year old American male. Currently in year 4 of college, going for two bachelor's degrees (computer science and computer engineering, with a growing interest in embedded systems). Japanese ability is relatively minimal, but I am studying when and where I can (&gt;tfw no Japanese classes nearby). I am considering a master's degree, and I have always wanted to study abroad in Japan (could not go during undergrad as credits would not be transferred back).

##WHAT I KNOW

I'm looking at the University of Aizu in Fukushima, and I noticed that they have a master's available in computer systems (which is, according to my advisor who reviewed the curriculum notes, more CEn centric with some elements of CS). This sounds like something that matches my interests.

According to my research, UofA is a little bit different from a standard Japanese university. The university is strictly for computer technology, and is pretty small (I come from a relatively small elementary school, middle school, high school, and university, so I'm used to small schools). They are also apparently BIG on international collaboration; 40%+ of their staff are foreign, and almost all of their classes are additionally offered in English. I've read a few of the papers that the faculty are publishing, and they're pretty interesting to me.

##MY LONG TERM PLANS

I have to stay an extra semester because of my class load, so I would probably start *next* spring, which gives me about a year and a half to get all my ducks in a row before I would head over. I would try to work while I'm studying for additional experience (I'm in an internship now), and I intend to start my own business someday after I graduate, regardless of the master's. I could see myself working in Japan, or having a business that does work both in the USA and Japan.

##WHAT I WANT TO KNOW

I'm having a hard time getting actual reviews on the university's overall quality. Ranking sites in English have extremely limited information, and even if knew exactly where to look, my Japanese is obviously not the best. Therefore, I was wondering if anyone on this sub, or someone you know, had any useful information on the university, or could easily find information. I could look at the literature on their website all day, but it won't tell me about what going there is actually like.

##ADDITIONAL INFO

- Yes, I am aware of the international wage differences. I am also apathetic about them. As long as what I do provides me a steady living income, I couldn't care less about where I work. To me, money is nice, but my field is much nicer.

- Yes, I have been actively checking the sidebar and the Search bar. There was one other post on this sub mentioning UofA, but that was for study abroad and more about whether or not Fukushima was literally DC from Fallout 3.

- No, I have never visited Japan before. I'm trying to save up for a ticket for this summer so I can actually go and see what the university and the country are like. Airfare is expensive, and living on the Eastern seaboard does not help this.

There is a very unlikely chance that asking here will bear any fruit, but it is worth a shot. I greatly appreciate any help."

I am writing this in part just to express my feeling in some way, but if someone happen to read this, care to share your experience during recruiting or any advice is greatly appreciated. 
Thanks

This is also my first post here, so go easy on me.
