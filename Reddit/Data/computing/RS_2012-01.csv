My question is as stated in the title: How do you rationalize the new build?  With a joint income (both with professional degrees and good paying jobs), I'm not really sure how to approach the, ""I need..errr Want a new computer.""  Being that she, as most people, only use computers for internet surfing, and/or work, the next response will must undoubtedly be: ""What's wrong with what you have now?""


I'm sure the foreveralone.jpg would say ""THATS WHY I'M SINGLE!"", but trying to tell the woman you love that the build is required to reduce battlefield 3 lag is hard for me to put into words.


It's funny how relationships work really..I could use my summer internship money to build the uber machine, but now that I have a full time job, I can't seem to find the funds.  Why must women care about food and clothing and the sorts!  Building a gaming rig was so much easier when I lived off peanut butter sandwhiches and wore my one pair of jeans!"
nyel1,0,2012-01-01,Software Engineering(internship) opportunities in Maryland,[deleted],maryland,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/nyel1/software_engineeringinternship_opportunities_in/,"I'm currently a junior Computer Science major at UMBC looking for companies to pursue for summer internships. I've been having difficulty coming up with a decent list of places to look, mainly because I don't think I can qualify for government(DoD related) positions which seems to cut my options dramatically. I've attended career fairs and searched through my University's career site and I'm usually greeted with a requirement of some sort of government clearance. 

The following places is what I've come up with:
Paypal
Prometric
MICROS Systems
OPIS
AOL

With the exception of Prometric, the rest of the companies were the only non-government positions at our career fair that were actively looking for CS students. I'm primarily looking for places to apply within Baltimore City or Baltimore County, but anything reasonably close to that area would help. Companies like Lockheed, Northrop, SAIC, ect are all no-go.

Does anyone have any suggestions?"

I started dating my ex-gf in hs when we were both 17 and seniors.  It was the first and serious relationship for both of us.  6 months later we graduated hs and ended up going to separate colleges 8 hours away from each other, continuing our relationship.  She hated her university, and after our first year, she ended up transferring to my school.  I did not give her the idea, nor did I encourage it, in fact I tried slightly to sway her to go elsewhere, but she made up her mind and of course I was happy to be closer to her.  After the first semester she very strongly persuaded me to move out from my apartment w/ friends, and in with her.  After the second year of school was over I ended up in the midwest for a summer internship (home being the east coast).  She was happy for me to a point, but she was also a bit jealous of my success.  I noticed through texting/calling during this time that she wasn't as close as before.  When I come home I still noticed she was a little distant, and she tells me that she ""got used to things without me"".  That really hurt and I handled it passive aggressively, we were okay for the next year with usual ups and downs but were pretty happy overall I would say.    
    
    
Fast forward to this last summer where I returned to the midwest for another internship (this time for 6 months).  In June I fly home to see her for her birthday.  We have a fight that I can't even remember what about, but just remember feeling worse than I ever felt before.  We didn't resolve it and she left for her destination, as I headed back to the midwest, and I texted her to make sure that she made it safely.  We didn't call each other for a day or so, and then she texts me that she wants to call.  I say call whenever, and she says that she is nervous.  I ask why and she says because of the email.  Very confusingly I check my email to find that she wrote an email to me essentially breaking up with me stating ""I don't want you to be upset or sad, because no matter what I will always be there"".  I was so filled with emotions (anger, confusion, sadness, etc.) I don't even reply back (call/text/email).  I delete her from all connections (cell/fb/email).  I text her a week or so later asking ""Are you okay with this?"".  And she texts me back ""Well it seems you are .. blah blah misdirecting the question crap"".  
    
     
We text very strangely back and forth every so often for about a month, then she stops responding altogether.  I get an email from her saying it might be less awkward for her roommates if I moved out of the apt at school.  I thought the same (that it was a good idea for us not to stay in the same apt, I could care less what her roommates thought), but the fact that she said at first it was okay, along with saying that she would come out to the midwest (giving me hope that we could talk in person to work out the end of our relationship), and then changing her mind really upset me.  We didn't physically speak to each other for 5 months when I got back from my internship (it was me who initiated contact to meet up and talk).  We're talking and catching up for about an hour.  Then the first part of actually talking about the relationship was her apologizing for ending it the way she did, the whole time she can't even look me in the eye.  I said it was okay and that it was partly my fault that drove her to do that (I regret saying this now).  We talk for a pretty short time after that (mostly me) and she says that she has to leave to a relative's house.


After she left I didn't quite realize how I felt, but after the next day or two passed I realized I still wasn't okay.  I felt like I gave her just enough closure to be happy, while I'm stranded with none whatsoever.  I ask her that I want to talk, she says okay, but in a week and a half she can't find any time at all to meet.  I'm thinking this is an excuse as we're both on break and she's not working.  Every day is something different that she has 'possible' plans and I feel like I need to be on call for whenever she finally gets time to talk.  I even got so frustrated at this that I texted her back telling her that I can't just be on standby for her whenever she ""gets around to talking to me"".  She took it a bit more seriously and we plan on meeting tomorrow night.  I feel that talking to her (hearing more of her feelings/thoughts) is the only way to get this spiraling unhealthy ending of a relationship done and over with (Am I wrong?).


Throughout the relationship I regrettably shut out a lot of my friends and family.  She was hard to make compromises w/ spending time with my family vs. hers and as a result I got pretty close to her family.  Ultimately I know I am to blame for not being closer to my fam and friends while we were together.  Now I feel like I have no one to really talk to.  When I was interning it was easier to deal with because I was distant, I suppressed how I felt (still haven't really spoken to anyone about how I feel about this all), and because she had no influence to my everyday life there.  But now returning home/school it's awful since she was such a HUGE part of my life there, everything that I've known is gone.  I lost my best and closest friend and it just hit me all of a sudden.

It sucks because we have been through so much, and legitimately my happiest times have been with her.  Obviously not every part of our relationship was explained here so this might not accurately portray what we had.  Part of me wants to tell her to fuck off, but a bigger part wants to talk to her and try to work things out to an amicable state where I can feel better.  Either way I understand that it's over, I think it's for the better, and I personally don't have any temptation to reconcile the relationship.  But I just feel so unresolved.  Thoughts about what I should say/act or if this is even a good idea, or any general thoughts at all?  Thanks!

For the past 5 (I'm currently 19 and a guy) years I've been constantly attempting to talk to people, yet time and time again I get ditched, girls consistently lie to me. Providing false hope and alluding to possible relationships, only to later blow me off and avert their attention elsewhere. I haven't even been with someone in over 3 years! 
(My last relationship ended by my girlfriend cheating on me)

I just want to know why. What is not to like about me?
Raised in a military life I attend a school in the Big 10, I have an internship to be a Life Coach, and my Double major is Physical therapy which means I work out on a constant basis thus resulting in me being more, well endowed so to speak in all areas. I will always act and present myself as the sweetest of men, always listening, respectful, opening doors for girls etc. I am highly educated (2080 SAT) but down to earth, I listen to trance and LOVE games. I only drink or smoke on occasions, hardly ever actually. I give out a lot of attentiveness towards others. 

But girls, such as this most recent one... Will ditch and deny me despite my best efforts, to have relations and be around pot smoking, cheating, disrespectful and the most downright baneful of people.

I really don't understand what is going on... What is it that these people have that I don't?!"

I’m very much interested in a biomedical-related internship, specifically something with a medical device company (Baxter, GE, Ethicon-Endo Surgeries, etc). Though I definitely will apply to more conventional ME companies considering the lack of exposure of BME material in undergrad. (Kinda hard to gauge what BME companies would want from undergrads)

-I’m currently debating whether to take an Introductory CAD course (a very time consuming one at that) as sixth class next semester, as I’ve heard from some friends that almost the entirety of the course is taught with NX. Up to this point I’ve always gotten the impression that 3DSolidWorks is where it’s at. Is it fair to say that some design software get more light of day than others? How about programming software (MATLAB, LabView, etc)?

Other than that there’s research experience (which I do have a semester of from last year, but it was back when I was in Civil and thought I would be an environmental engineer, not much pertinence there), and Excel skills. Someone mentioned in a previous thread about familiarizing yourself with [FDA regulations](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/default.htm) if you want to try the medical device field. Would this be impressive to know from a hiring stand point? Or would they think that as an undergrad that I'm blowing smoke out of my...well you know.

Sorry for the length here. Any other ideas? Or is it really as easy as making sure my name/resume gets seen by the right people?

nzt4k,4,2012-01-02,We were beaten to it because we took to long and were afraid. My biggest regret of my life this far.,businessmodel_bye_by,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/nzt4k/we_were_beaten_to_it_because_we_took_to_long_and/,"A friend propositioned me  on a business idea last February for a mobile application when we were both just 18 and finishing our final year in school.

The idea was for an app that ranks drink deals in your city's Night Clubs from cheapest to most expensive. The app would be free to download and free for the club for the first 2 months. Then after the 2 months were up we would charge a nominal fee for each drink deal the club wanted to submit. We would have location based services built into the app so that users could not only see what the drink deal was but also how far away the Night Club was from your current position. Via the app you would be able to put yourself on the guest-list too. We had a lot of different ideas and plans for the app to add on after it had been created and published. We were to split the ownership 60-40 in my friends majority.

We got very excited from February on wards about the potential of the app. We started doing mock ups of the app in classrooms around the school after hours. We had a plan of action by April 2011. It was at this point procrastination began to sit in. We had exams in June that would determine what University we would go to. We said to one another that we would only spend non-study hours on the project and that it would not get in the way of our studies. We soon discovered that app of this size would cost in the region of 7000 to 12000 dollars.
The combination of these two factors left the two of us concerned about whether the app was worth it. 

Fast forward to Mid July 2011 after our exams. My friend came back from an Internship in Singapore for a start-up social networking site where he had met some multimillionaire entrepreneurs who had inspired him to go all out on the app. His motivation rubbed off on me when he got back. We sat down and planned what things needed to be done by when. We both downloaded Photoshop and began designing every page of the app over the next month and a half. We decided that we would have to get the app sponsored in order to be able to pay for the programming of the app. We were going to get the leader in drink distribution of our country to sponsor us.

We got our College places at the end of August and not much work was done on the project until end of September because we wanted to settle in. 

Then it all went down hill. On October 5th 2011 I walked into College with a different friend. We were approached in the main square by some promoter and a conversation like this occured:

Promoter: Hey Guys! Do you have a smart phone?
Other Friend: Nah, getting one soon though.
Me: Me neither, I have a Blackberry, why? ( I asked why just out of curiosity).
Promoter: Oh right, ok well if you 'like' our page on Facebook you could be in with a chance to win an iPhone 4. A friend and I basically just made an app for Android and iPhone that ranks drink deals in Night Clubs from cheapest to most expensive.
Other Friend: Oh coo-
Me: What! (Grabbed the promoters phone to see it)
Promoter: Yeah its really cool!
Me: Is it successful?
Promoter: Well we released last Thursday and it has over 2000 downloads.

The design of the app was identical to what we had been designing except for the color scheme. My stomach sank. I ran out outside, my friend I was with had no idea what was going on. I rang my partner but he didn't pick up so I rang him non-stop for 10 minutes until he did. He was gutted and so was I. I wish them all the best though and according to the promoter he and his partner had spent their life savings on the app and had thought of the idea in February 2011 too.

As of today they have 25,000 likes on Facebook and the app only works in our city. So there is some serious potential for the application. It's called GreatNite if you wanna check it out.

TLDR; A friend and I procrastinated on an mobile application that had huge potential and someone beat us to it."
nzjxi,0,2012-01-02,Starting to get more involved with my workouts and I could use some advice,Phonervia,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nzjxi/starting_to_get_more_involved_with_my_workouts/,"A few things first off I want to make sure I don't offend anyone before posting this but I have a lot of questions 
 
* I am not doing this as a new years resolution, it's just falling in line with the timeframe - I've been training and making minor lifestyle alterations as I go - my current targets are going to be sleeping on a regular cycle and eating healthier - small steps - it's one of the biggest things we preach as healthcare providers and yet so few of us actually do it. 
* I have been training in Brazilian Jujitsu for around 3 months now, usually 3-6 days a week, and the weight has been coming off.  Slowly. I want to speed it up, and something that has been very prevalent here has been proper diet. I signed up for FitDay and am planning on using that to track my eating patterns and hopefully help me change the way I eat to a healthier pattern
* Supplements - I currently take 5000 IU of vitamin D, a spectrum silver, and am considering starting to take Yohimbine HCL, will definately be starting fish oil again, and am hoping to make sure I cover all my bases.  As a pharmacy intern one of my goals is to make sure I'm healthy overall, and want to make sure the supplements I'll get are going to be what they claim to be (we talk about how there's very light regulation on supplements, and none by the FDA so I worry about drug interactions, etc) so I was hoping I could get some more guidance in this regard.  This subreddit has a lot of information in it and it got a little overwhelming. 
* Eating.  This is more specific than eating healthy.  One of my biggest problems is that I never really learned portion control as a kid so my diet has been historically pretty shitty.  When I was younger I trained around 7-8 hours a day so my awful diet wasn't an issue because my MMA training was pretty intense so it wasn't a big deal - I was never 8% BF but I usually hovered around 10-12% which I was satisfied with (I was only in HS so getting shredded was not my goal, just to have fun fighting)
* My last question is this - I have started doing a program similar to crossfit prior to my jujitsu classes so I train from 5-8 3-5 days a week and from noon to 2 on Saturdays.  Am I going to want to supplement that excercise with running / lifting in the gym or am I going to want to just stick with what I'm doing now and with the modified diet just see what happens?  I don't want to overdo it and hurt my progress. 

Thank you /r/fitness and I look forward to learning more from you - I've spent a few hours reading and I've already learned quite a bit! 

Edit: I'm sorry but could someone link me to a good source for where I can learn more about Micro:Macro nutrient ratios? This is something I've literally never even heard of before... Makes me feel like I have a lot to learn - and this is disconcerting, I'm going to be a licensed pharmacist in a year...

Edit2: I found Swole.Me reading through the FAQ once more - it seems I misunderstood the micro:macro thing I suppose, just mineral/vitamin dense food is what I'm assuming it means.

nzb6r,9,2012-01-01,How do you motivate yourself?,anotherconfusedsoul,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/nzb6r/how_do_you_motivate_yourself/,"I'm not a genius, but everybody around me thinks that I am.

I breezed through high school, acing standardized tests and mastering concepts (except ochem, holy fuck is ochem hard) without any real effort. My parents aren't rich, but I have a nasty case of white privilege, I've never applied for a job but through high school always had nice internships in engineering firms, and I'm not doing so bad now either. (a friend of a friend knew somebody who knows a cofounder...)

I have rarely had to do something I didn't want to do. Homework? My teachers let me slide because I did so well on tests and was really good at kissing ass. 

This has fucked me.

When I try to do something, if it takes more that a little bit of effort I almost immediately lose interest. I decided last week to ask you for help reddit, and every day since then I've started writing only to delete my draft 10 minutes later and start browsing /r/funny . I dropped out of college, because they weren't so lenient about homework, and I just couldn't sit down to write papers and solve tedious problems. I've gone through a few jobs now, because after a month or two I get bored and just stop working, having solved all the fun parts of their problems.

Luckily I'm a computer programmer so I could keep this up for the rest of my life if I wanted to, computer programming pays ridiculously well. But I don't want to be so lazy! I want to start my own business, or go back to school and get a PhD in math! I want to reinvent the internet or play a big role in the creation of strong AI! 

It's gotten painful to meet anybody form high school, they all talk about how much potential I had and have, then I have to tell them I'm between jobs or working for some startup that isn't solving anything useful. It's painful not just to face my friends, but to face myself. I feel like I'm throwing my life away and badly want to stop.

tl;dr 

How do I keep myself motivated in the face of doing real work that isn't necessarily fun?
How do I train myself to delay gratification? At the moment, I can't for longer than a few minutes.

However, during my internship I've never had to do a proof to figure out if it'll work or not.

o1bxl,6,2012-01-03,I've lied myself into a situation I cannot control,CannotTellATruth,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/o1bxl/ive_lied_myself_into_a_situation_i_cannot_control/,"I have a bad habit of lying. I exaggerate truths about my life, or just make things up entirely and spread it to my friends and family as if it were who I really am.

Most of the time, the lies are who I want to become, and by telling them I force myself to become that person to avoid humiliation with those I know finding out it wasn't true. Other times, they are lies that build on top of the initial lie when I cannot actually do what I wanted.

These lies started out small enough, lying on grades that I was getting in college to avoid uncomfortable moments with parents, lying to friends from home about college to be more of a life of the party, lying to friends from college about home to do the same. It was easy, most lies didn't require follow-up to turn myself into that person since they were stories about the past, not present. Then I started lying about jobs I was getting, telling friends from college about internships I was getting (that I wasn't even close to getting from my poor grades), lying to my family about the amount of money I have (next to nothing).

Last March, I lied to just about everyone I knew saying that I got an internship with a local company to my college, that their plan was to keep me working while I finished college and eventually start full-time. None of this had happened. I frantically applied everywhere trying to turn this lie into a reality, dreading what I would have to do if it didn't happen. Miraculously, in May, I found a company that would do just that. It was one of the happiest days of my life. I could finally get out of this rut and start living in the truth.

I worked for them during the summer, they told me to let them know within 2 weeks of the semester starting if I wanted to do part-time. This was to be my last semester. When I began the semester, I realized I wouldn't be graduating in December. I still had more requirements, more than I could take in a single semester. Depression set in, I didn't contact the company, but I kept telling everyone I knew that I was working for them remotely. I was so depressed that I stopped going to most classes, just wasting away the days.

I finally had to tell my parents that I would be staying another semester, still lying, making up an excuse that shifted the blame from myself to the school. No one else knows except them, but that's all they know. As far as anyone I talk with is concerned, this is my life:

I am done with college, starting with the company I interned for as a salaried employee, have an all-around great life.

What my life actually is:

I still have a semester left (maybe more), I am in contact with the company hoping to get part-time this semester, I have no money in my bank account, I am moving into an apartment by myself this semester, my family knows I still have more time at college and I have to start paying for that soon, but I'm not even registered for classes yet so I might not even still be enrolled. My family thinks I need to apply for a student loan to pay for this semester (which I will have to) but the amount they think it's for is 1 class, when it is much more than that, and they think I have a job, so getting a loan would be easier than it is in reality.

So my situation, the way I see it, boils down to getting this job and being able to register for classes. If I get the job and can register, I can apply for a student loan to pay for those classes as well as my apartment. I might not finish this semester, but could graduate with the promise of finishing up credits with night classes over the summer. That would allow me to become salaried at this company (if they would take me) and start paying off my debt and living the life I have made up for myself.

If I don't get this job, I have no idea what I am going to do. It really all boils down to that. I have no control over my current situation, and it's driving me into the deepest depression of my life.

The worst part of it all is that this job isn't even what I want to do, it's just the only company I can find that will hire me. I have so many dreams and aspirations but I feel locked into this situation through debt and college. I just want to get out.

TL:DR; I have lied so much in my life that I have cornered myself into a situation that is controlled by a company deciding to give me a job or not. If they do, it should work out fine, if they don't, my life will unravel."

I'm worried that my B.S. won't be worth as much because it's not a top 10 CS school, but I don't live near one and even if I did, the amount I save by going to a local school is tremendous.

So I had an idea to build a simple wordpress site consisting of my resume, an ""About Me"" section, and another section with flash videos of me walking through different school/personal projects I've completed. I've also considered blogging about computer security as it's my main passion and career goal. 

My biggest concern is, will it be overlooked completely or could it possibly be seen in a negative-light? Would I be completely wasting my time with this venture?"

I'm an american citizen, who has just completed a masters degree in Media Innovation from the NHTV University of Applied Sciences in Breda, NL.  I have applied for and received a 'zoekjaar' visa from the Dutch government that allows me leave to stay in the NL for one year...  However, I have decided that I'd like to live and work in the United Kingdom, preferably London.  The language barrier in the NL will always pigeon-hole (sp?) me as a non dutch speaker and I just feel that there are more opportunities in the English speaking country.  On top of that, I have a large group of friends and an SO in London, so I selfishly want to be closer to them, if I'm not in my home country.

I've just had an interview for a position with Sony here in London (i came over for NYE) and they really liked me and wanted to plan a second interview until they discovered that my visa only allowed me to work in NL.  I was had a feeling that the visa was NL-only, but have just received it a few weeks ago and hadn't really tested the waters yet to discover what I could and couldn't do with it.  Needless to say, it was devastating to hear that I've been stopped in my tracks on moving to London to be near all the people that I hold so dear.  :(  

Does anyone have any advice regarding what my options are?  I've got a masters degree from an NL uni, a bachelors from an american uni and really REALLY want to do this.  I can't be the only American kid looking for the chance to live and work in the UK, but sometimes it feels like it because no one can really recommend any viable solution.  

Hopefully one of you can give me some ideas... I'm considering BUNAC, but am afraid that after the 6 months internship that I'll be in worse shape than I'm in now, as i'll have already 'used up' my chance and the UK govt will be less likely to grant me anything.

Any help/advice is so much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I've been lucky enough to land Canadian jobs that allow me to work remotely, so I've been spending my summers and Christmases in the states-- the East SF Bay Area to be specific. I would like to move there after I graduate and eventually become a permanent resident.

I'm not concerned about being able to get a job once I graduate; my grades are good and I already have a fair amount of experience in the industry. Computers / problem solving have been passions of mine for the majority of my life. However, I'm wondering if it's realistic to expect to land an international job or internship so soon. I don't even really know where to begin looking. As far as I know, a prospective employer would need to be willing to sponsor me for a TN-1 visa, and an H1-B visa could be applied for while I'm working.

Do any of you have experience with this, or some ideas about where to look for American employers that are willing to hire from Canada?"

I've been having issues on and off with this since my second semester of my freshmen year, and I'm now a second semester senior. This is going to be a long read, as I'm just going to type everything while I'm actually mustering the courage to talk about this.

**TL;DR**
First year: No friends, felt alone

Second year: met girl, girl broke up with me, got depressed, did bad in class, made a lot of friends who picked me up, then got kicked out of school, got back in, retook classes and did great

Third year: average, made a lot more friends, did okay in school, start drinking a lot more.

Fourth year: losing contact with friends because of living off campus (we all used to live on the same dorm floor), heavy drinking, doing terrible in my classes, bad anger issues, hopelessness feeling for school where I just give up for periods and then franticly try to get the work done, while getting bad grades on it 


I feel like I just cant do school anymore. I've never really liked school and homework. I'd rather just get out there and work. I was very successful at my summer internship, and I also waited tables at a restaurant I've been working at for eight years. Hell, I'm at the internship place right now for winter break working on more projects for them. (restaurant is in a tourist town and is closed in the winter) I like what I'm going to school for, but I just can't do good in my classes it seems... My failure in school leads to depression, which usually leads to me drinking more, and then raging, and then feeling depressed at how much of a fucking idiot I am. I don't know if its depression, anger issues, or both. I just want to get out of school and do something with my life and make my family proud. I don't want to put my mom, dad, and sister though that shit of getting kicked out of school again. Any advice would be appreciated, because I really have no fucking clue on where to begin...I don't have that depressed feeling all the time, it comes in waves, but when it does I'm the most unmotivated piece of shit in the world.



**Below is my original post. It's long.**

&gt;I guess this whole feeling can go back to my freshmen year. The first semester was just getting used to being on myself. Everything was fine in my books. Got along really well with my roomate, we did a lot of things together. Had three people I knew and would hang out with about once a week for a little bit. Not really friends at the time, but more like people you sat next to in class and would walk back to the dorms and talk too. 
&gt;
&gt;Fast forward to second semester, and I start to feel down. I had failed my math class first semester, and stupidly retook it, but skipped almost all the classes because I was just disappointed in me failing it. This was also the time I noticed that I was becoming more and more distant with my high school friends, and that I really only had 4-5 friends at college, and some of them weren't even really close.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways, got though the semester, failed the math class, and enjoyed my summer. 
&gt;
&gt;Second semester comes, and the beginning of the semester was great. I actually met a girl, and a few weeks later we were dating. This was also my first girlfriend, so that was an exciting time for me. Fast forward a month and a half later and we break up after spending thanksgiving meeting each others families. It came out of no where to me, and for some reason, even though we had been only dating for a month and a half, it crushed me. I became dopey for about a week, skipping almost all of my classes and falling extremely behind. 
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately for me, I was blind as to how great our dorm floor was, and they quickly befriended me and pulled me out of my slump. I went from having 4-5 friends to having 20 almost in a weekend. Some of the people that helped pick me up are some of my best friends today. Although that social need was filled, my grades still sucked balls, and the only class I was passing was my math class, which was a remedial class and didn't even count in my GPA. I just blew everything off, saying I'd get a fresh start the next semester.
&gt;
&gt;Wrong.
&gt;
&gt;After going home for break and having a great time with my family and friends(Sister got married, 5 days later Christmas), I get a letter from school saying I was academically dismissed because my semester GPA was below a 1.0
&gt;
&gt;This letter fucked me up so much. I became crazy depressed at the time. It took me two weeks to write the appeal letter. I was also 40 minutes away from home at the time of this house sitting my sisters house and her pets while she was on her honeymoon. I remember constantly arguing with my mother on the phone, often times just hanging up in a fit of rage and sadness. (Un)Fortunately, one of my good college friends was also in the same boat, and together I think by talking to him, I was able to write the damn letter, and do the interview and get back into school.
&gt;
&gt;Spring semester comes and I do fucking great. I'm on top of the world, retook a lot of the classes I failed, solidified my friendship with my dorm buddies, and become a overall more social person. Instead of spending my spare time gaming, I'm out hanging with friends and enjoying life.
&gt;
&gt;I should also mention that I had a successful internship over the summer here.
&gt;
&gt;Junior year comes, I hang out and party a lot with my friends, probably because I'm trying to catch up with the first year of college I missed partying because I didn't know anyone. Second semester I turn 21, and even though I am drinking a lot and blowing money out of my ass on booze, I'm still doing relatively good in school. (although my 5k surplus I've had since I was a freshman is now down to 2k because of drinking, and careless spending on games (rock band and a TV).
&gt;
&gt;Now its this past semester, my senior year. I'm not in the dorms anymore, I'm living with 4 of my friends in a house. Whole new experience for me and I'm pretty excited for it. Living off campus is fine, but school isn't going so hot. Two weeks into the semester and I'm already failing my final computer science course. I'm spending 30 hours a week in the lab working on assignments for this class and I'm not even getting them done. We're also doing a HUGE group project for this class, along with the individual assignments, and I feel like I'm useless, and that I should just drop the class and change my emphasis so I don't have to take it. But then I realize that I'd have to go to school for another two years if I did that, so I decide to just man up and keep chugging. Things get a little better, and then they just go to the shit. I start doing bad, get frustrated, started drinking a lot more. I'd go out to the bars with friends and just come home and explode, going fucking apeshit. First outbreak resulted with a hole in the wall because I got pissed off at one of my roommates comments.
&gt;
&gt;After the first outbreak, I get a little depressed. Memories of that fall semester and the fear of getting dismissed hit me, and I feel like I'm just following that path. I have two big assignments and I just push them to the last minute. Somehow I pulled myself out of my hole and did the bare minimum on them, getting shitty grades, but better than a zero I guess. 
&gt;
&gt;While I'm trying to get a passing grade in this class, my other classes are taking hits. I'm taking the second math courses for the third time, and was actually doing fine in it, but after trying to dig myself out of the other class, I'm now failing that. Instead of actually trying I get in my mode that it's hopeless and just start skipping the class.
&gt;
&gt;Skip to the weekend before finals, my friends and I decide we're going to go to the bars. It's chilly, so I take a coat, and while downtown someone stole it. This has happened to me before, so this time I got really fucking mad. I had lost my roommates while searching for it, they had went home. I tried calling them to see if they had it, but they wouldn't answer there phones. Instead of being rational, I decide to build up this massive anger on the way home, and just go berserk. Smashing two lamps, two chairs, kicking a hole in the wall, and flipping the table. My roomates then call the cops on me right as I'm calming down, and then tackle me to the ground until I get there. (This just makes me angry again) They didn't press charges, but they wanted top kick me out of the house unless I agreed that if I outburst again I'd have two weeks to get out, and they would press charges.
&gt;
&gt;So now I've alienated 3 of my roommates, got a 1.4 semester GPA this semester and almost got kicked out again. What makes me even more sad is that I didn't even pass the class I worked my ass off to salvage, and it just ended up shooting me in the foot. On top of that because of my low GPA, I might be losing my financial aid, and my parents don't have the money to put me through school. I pay for it all myself, and my drinking habits have drained my funds down to 2.5k at the writing of this post.

o24js,1,2012-01-04,I will tell my kids NOT to go to college and other rants from NYC Gen X Parent,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/o24js/i_will_tell_my_kids_not_to_go_to_college_and/,"I will be the first generation from my family to tell my kids NOT to go to college.
Let me start with some background info so you can see my reasoning.
My Parents were immigrants from Europe. Both have Masters Degrees. They lived with their parents until they came to the US. They left Europe because they could not make ends meet as Teachers and came to the US legally and are US Citizens. Because they didn't speak English this was a major block to their potential employment prospects. My mom was a housekeeper for years and finally moved up the ranks to that of Supervisor. She currently makes about $40K + benefits. My dad did various low paying jobs and eventually got into construction: working for a General Contractor for over 20 years. My dad has never made more than $35K and has never had benefits. It makes me sick to my stomach that even though he has all this experience he gets paid so low.
Like most people on here I was told the same thing about going to college and getting a good job afterwards! I had dreams about getting a good job so that I could help my dad retire early. I was so sick of my dad being taken advantage of that I was willing to support him if I made enough money. My dad is a very hard worker but he is just not a people person. There is no way he could ace any interview.
Even though both of my parents don't make much money [ New York City standards] they live what I would consider a middle class life: They have a house with a mortgage, a used car, cable tv and cell phones. They bought their house in Queens in 1994 and got a 30 year mortgage. They have about 13 years left or so on it. The house was $195K which was the most they could afford at the time. Same house today is about $450K. They were forced to buy outside of the neighborhood where we originally lived - Greenpoint, Brooklyn. If you are from NYC you know that area along with Williamsburg has exploded ! The price for a house now in that area is at least $750K and I am talking a piece of shit wooden house with no garage. There are condo buildings going up left and right all the time and I think the minimum is about $500K [ but I could be wrong depending on the size and # of bedrooms etc] Basically if you want to live as a family in that area be prepared to spend at least $750K.
OK back to me. So my parents thought that I should go to college and I would be able to get some good job and be better off than them. That was the plan. For my freshman year I went to a reasonably priced school called Hofstra University, which cost about $14K for the year back in 1995 - 96. I had to commute everyday and lived at home to save money. I also worked pretty much everyday to cover whatever scholarships and loans didn't. The commute from Queens to Long Island to school and then the commute from Queens to Manhattan to work took its toll on me and I decided to transfer the following year to a school in the city.
Here is where I started making major mistakes. I ended up going to NYU where tuition was over $25K if I remember correctly. Of course I got some grants etc, more loans but I was always short. Whatever money I made I was constantly paying it to the school to cover the tuition, books, etc. After I graduaded in Fall of 1999 I had student loan debt of approximately $50 - $60K. There were so many loans it was confusing to keep track of all this stuff. For the first few years I remember making only the minimum payments because my income was just so low. Finally in 2004 I made more money and increased my payments and by October 2009 I actually finished paying off my student loans. Yes it took exactly 10 years to pay it all off.
I have a Bachelor of Science in Finance. This is a hard major and people are supposed to make good money with this degree. Never happened to me. I do blame myself though - but only to a point. You see, I didn't even want to go to college and I really hated Finance after studying it. I only went because everybody including my very successful boss was telling me that is what I needed to do. I saw college as expensive and in the way of my job but I didn't listen to me, I listened to them. I started working at age 14 and at age 16 I met my main employer. This would become my employer for the last 17 years! Yes, I started working there at 16 in 1993 and finally lost my job in 2010. What's hilarious is that I was already there working at 16 yrs old so technically I didn't even need to finish High School! I could have dropped out in my Sophomore Year and nothing would be different. I learned everything I needed to learn on the job and eventually trained other employees.
After I got my degree I realized how hard it is to get a better job [i.e. with health benefits and opportunities for advancing an actual career] than the one I had been working at since age 16. I had no industry connections, my parents had none either. Actually I had 1 contact in the finance world and even he couldn't help me although I offered to work for FREE to get experience. He and other adults told me that most of the finance jobs go to the kids of the parents / relatives already working there at those firms. So the only other slots left were for students with very high GPA's that had managed to get industry specific internships at those firms. So if you didn't have that internship - you were toast. I would have gladly done an internship but that was out of the question because I was working to cover whatever the loans didn't. The big companies already had online recruitment then and after I submitted my applications I never heard back from any of them.
So here I was working the same job since High School and here come some recessions: 9/11 attacks, dot com burst etc. Had to take a second job during those bad years to survive. I even went to some computer retraining program on Sundays for several months during 2002 that was funded by the State. Didn't learn anything useful that I could use at work or to get better work. Turned out to be a scam school of some sort. I feel bad because the State was scammed along with the tax-payer and I.
So to sum this up I went to college but never got a job in my field or a remotely related field and never got a job even utilizing anything I supposedly learned in school. I was essentially cornered into holding on to my job until things improve. They never did. I was one of the unlucky graduates who fell through the cracks of the system. I was lucky that I did manage to pay off my student loans during the better years when the economy was good for all companies even the shitty ones. Then I lost my job the following year. And I ask: What the fuck happened? I just wasted 10 years of my life working and paying off some shit that hasn't done me any good. Negative return on investment.
During the busiest years at my old job I didn't have dinner with my family for 2 years! I only saw my kids in the morning when they went to school and then on Saturday and Sunday nights. It was like having ""visitation rights"" with your own family even though we lived together.
I want to puke everytime I see some ad in the subway for such and such college. Pictures of smiling kids with Graduation Caps. Such false hope !
One thing that I want to clear up is that I am not jealous of anyone else. I am pissed because others have figured it out before I did. I believe that everybody who works hard and is interested in working should be able to get a good decent job. And if you want to be exemplary then be a star performer and get the best compensation. But the average people don't even get a fair chance at average pay. Everything seems below average with no benefits and no stability.
I tell people that I totally fucked up when it comes to the whole college thing. I have a laundry list of what not to do. I am convinced that college is for few people either the priveledged ones or the lucky ones or the dirt poor ones that can get a full ride. College is not for the average person with no connections -- only to be saddled with debt.
You know, when it was time to go to college, everybody said ""don't worry, just go, you'll get that fantastic job later"" Now that we're out ""oh no, there was no guarantee of a job"" . Hey - Fuck You ! You should have explained that more clearly in the beginning and I would have never went. You should have explained that some people get good jobs with signing bonuses but some graduates get crappy leftover jobs and they're underemployed perpetually. There will be incredible competition for jobs - translation: there are NOT enough good jobs for everybody. There's no rhyme or rhythm. I feel like the whole jobs situation is like a Ponzi Scheme. The people at the top are the lucky ones and cash out. It's a combination of connections, luck and street smarts. I obviously have none.
Update on characters in my post: That 1 contact I had in Finance: Lost his job at Bear Stears when Bear crashed, now lives and works in Asia. His wife lost her job at Lehman Brothers, works somewhere in NYC doing something similar to her old job, their relationship soured from being apart, most likely will divorce in the future. My ex Boss: his company finally closed in 2011, getting divorced. My Mom: After she lost her job in 2008 [ at the place she worked at for 25 years] she rebounded and found a similar position in 2010, still there $40K + benefits. Dad: no change, still underpaid, still no benefits. Myself: A year ago I got my security guard license but couldn't find any legit guard work. Zero. Currently selling things online and in person to barely make ends meet. Studying for a CDL to see where that goes. I don't think I will ever use my degree for anything. It's too late and I don't remember jack shit anyway because I never had the oppurtunity to use and build on what I had learned.
Am I going to tell my kids to go college? Hell fuckin NO."

I get my diploma this month in Computer and Information Science. I'm a decent programmer, but I've absolutely 0 real world programming experience.

I also haven't been doing many programming projects on my own time.

I don't know what job I should be looking for, now, much less where to find them. I was hoping there'd be internships related to CS/programming on CL, but I haven't found many.

So, she was informed of the robbery and told about some ""investigation taking place soon..."" and was reported by the mother as ""not nervous"". She's been the only house keeper, except for...

#2 The one off maid: She was hired 1 time, when suspect #1 wasn't assisting to her expected schedule. Her one recommendation only hired her to do her ""outside"" work, plants and such. She has come back after ""the incident"". And is still looking for a steady job.

#3 The adult worker: the family has a ""home lighting business"", installing indoors &amp; outdoors lighting, shades, etc. They have people who help them install and visit the different locations. This worker has been doing jobs with the for the past few months. But he did put up a few lights in the family's main bedroom (where the box is). And at one time was all by himself in the house.

#4 The young worker: A young (20s) working intern. He has been working with the family for almost a year now. They lend him the office truck and also visits sites for installations &amp; repairs. He also did some installations in the main room (where the box was) and was by himself at one point or another.
These are all the possible suspects, since they all at one time had the opportunity.

Lately I've been in a rut.  I've been doing alright in my studies (3.5GPA) but that's all I've been doing, which is what is making me feel bad. I feel like I should be looking into internships, but the few that I have looked into require alot of CS related things (like multiple languages) that I haven't been studying. I've been meaning to teach myself Python and Java (in addition to the C++ that I've been learning in class), but I find it hard to get motivated.

I was wondering if there were any computer engineering related internships that I could be looking into because the few that I have been looking into are mostly CS related, which I can do, but I prefer some thing more geared toward my major. I'm thinking that if there was a clear goal (like an internship) to work towards, I'd have more motivation to learn more things outside of class.

Also am I the only one that finds the requirements for application for internships pretty high? Like multiple languages, project experience and  leadership/extracurricular... I can't be the only one that hasn't done these things...

Background: 22, female, in college


I'm sitting here absolutely terrified of the next couple days.  I did pretty terribly this semester and I don't want to tell my parents in fear of yelling, name calling, and hitting.  I've been applying for jobs and looking at apartments and loans and on-campus housing but I don't think I'll be able to move out as quickly as planned.



My parents are good in a lot of ways - they help friends out, they are charitable, but they have never 
been...emotionally available.



They are stuck in their ways, racist, and very controlling. When I was a kid I remember not allowed to do normal kid things, like sleepovers, because they think ""white Americans"" are sick people and can't be trusted. They both are South Asian immigrants. My dad came here to go to school at an ivy league institution and they are both are conservative; this also meant I was not allowed to have guy friends over. When I started high school I wasn't allowed to go to parties/hangouts for this reason (It took a lot of convincing but I managed to fix this). I am not allowed a boyfriend (although I have had a couple behind their backs starting college). 
They don't see why I should need to be independent. I was not allowed a small job during high school I don't have my license; they say I can just ask them if I ever need anything. My friends have been giving me driving lessons when they can. Since I live at home now I am confined to the parents' rules and curfews (can't be out past 9 even if I'm on campus, no parties). I don't drink or do any recreational drugs, and I've never gotten into serious trouble, or trouble at all. Usually my parents' plans trump mine to I'm forced to sit at someone's house and stare at a wall because heaven forbid I'm not in their sight. I can't be home alone for more than 12 hours, so if they are invited to stay at a friend's place over the weekend I am dragged along even if I have no business being there.



They are harshly critical.  My dad always has had high expectations of me in terms of school; I remember them telling me they were ashamed if I didn't meet up to their expectations. By the time I got to junior high I had huge test performance anxiety. I have never been an unmotivated student; when I'm not feeling terrible I get straight As...but my bouts of anxiety have increased over the years and it effects my grades.  My parents reactions certainly did not help. When it got really bad (this pat year) I started losing a considerable amount of weight and having panic attacks but my parents had their own diagnoses for those too. It is always that I don't care enough or study enough or that I should ""just turn off your so called thoughts"".  Whenever we have an argument and I raise my voice out of being upset I am met with a slap to the face. I am threatened by a slap or worse if I don't behave like they want.



By the time I was a senior in high school none of this changed; in fact it got worse. I remember that the school counselor wanted a list of good attributes from my parents about me so she could better write recommendations for my college apps and they told me they didn't have a single good thing to say about me.



For my first two years of college I went to an out of state university that I fell in love with. The only reason I was even allowed to be so far away was because my dad had a friend who was a professor there and they found an all-muslim apartment for me to stay in so other people could keep tabs on me. Despite this I was able to lead a fairly independent life. I had a job relevant to my degree and a good social life, which I had never had before. My anxiety worsened though and I ended failing a couple classes in those two years. I tried to explain to my parents how I felt and about my anxiety but I was told that anxiety and depression don't exist, and that if I wanted to see ""real"" problems that I should go to a third world country. They think that antidepressants and therapy unnecessary and ""turn you into a zombie"". Their solution was to take me out of college (they did not allow me to have loans in my name) and make me go to an in state college while I lived at home. This was summer of 2010.



I was very distressed by this, but my dad had opened up a chance for me: If I finished all of my gen eds at a community college in one semester (fall 2010) I could go back and I would be able to graduate by the summer. Motivated by this, I took more than the allowed number of credits and got straight As. I was so happy and I had started planning to go back to my old college and applying for readmission. However, whenever I tried to talk to my dad about this he ignored it until I was running out of time and I confronted him. He then changed his mind; he said I could go back if I attended a local 4 year college and took many high level courses (more than I had ever taken in one semester) and get straight A's. I was crushed but I still had that opportunity. So this spring 2011 I worked hard, found an internship, despite having massive panic attacks and losing about 15 pounds. I started seeing the school counselor, going to group therapy and taking medication for my anxiety - all behind my parents' backs. All during the semester my dad kept reminding me about my past failures...like that was supposed to be motivating or something?  They started betting that I would fail.  I ended up taking two incomplete grades for 2 classes with the understanding I could work on the final projects during the summer. My parents gave me so much shit for this. There was a point during the summer where they sat me down every day and yelled at me for being a failure on purpose and saying that I didn't intend to graduate. I would be terrified when my dad came home, not wanting to hear it again. I was not allowed out of the house, the couple times i did go out in those 3 months I was yelled at and called lazy. They made me drop my internship opportunity because it was too far for them and I couldn't drive there (again, no license).  I kept seeing my counselor while I could but it got harder and harder to apply the coping techniques I was taught in therapy. Unfortunately I ended up failing one of the classes and taking a C in the other. This Fall semester was difficult for me. I felt like I had been pushed too hard and I'm just not motivated any more. 



A couple of other things my dad did to 'help' me: child block on internet, can get to barely anything other than gmail; threatened to delete my email/facebook/etc account by force and have my computer usage monitored (this terrified me as this was my only way to talk to friends), because apparently I waste too much time on the internet and he thinks that is the issue.



I failed half of my classes and I am trying to care but really I just want out of this house. I haven't told them about my grades because I'm scared of them and my own reaction. When midterms came in I had a panic attack and went to see the emergency counselor and called up my friends if I could stay over for a couple days...I had never felt so terrified and hopeless. I don't want that to happen again. I don't want to be called names or be taken out of school or be hit. I don't want to be confined.



This fall I started looking at jobs and planning to move out...parents would never approve of course so I will have to do this when they are out of the house. I haven't found a job yet so I'm hoping that I get a room in a dorm on campus. I am currently on that wait list and I was told that I would know my assignment by this week, however they're behind and when I called them up they said I would know if there was a room for me in the dorms next week. I have been putting off the grades discussion for a while now and I don't know how long I can keep it up. I was hoping to never have to tell them ""I failed because I am angry and scared and resentful towards you"" but since housing is taking so long I don't know what is going to happen. I was hoping to move out next week. I just don't want to be in this environment any more. I am an adult and I want to be treated as such.


TLDR: My parents are controlling and critical people, and I want out. I have taken steps to remove myself from them but I still feel hopeless."

I want to grow in 2012",pmm621,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/o638s/please_help_im_a_serial_entrepreneur_that_needs/,"I just realized I put SOO much text (sorry).  If you don't want to read my entrepreneurial background (life story), please just see the last two paragraphs for a more in-depth description of my question.  Thanks for ANYYY help Reddit! 

All of my life, I have had crazy fun idea's on how to make money, and start businesses.  Most of the idea's I would start to plan out too much, and I would never get done.  Then, I thought, O.K I need to look more into Entrepreneurship, and learn from books.  Books told me I should create a business plan for the idea, and then tried to pitch it to investors and businesses.  A friend and I had an idea about offering car insurance as a company incentive for industries that are very competitive.  We literally worked years on the business plan, and getting everything all together.  Once we had everything together perfectly, we got together with someone in UPMC's financial department only to be told it was a good idea, but if they liked it they would just steal it.  (SHIT!)  Since this didn't work out at all, I said forget it, I'm just going to get into any idea I have.  Luckily this was at the same time Nintendo decided to come out with the Wii, and royally under-stock inventory.  I started buying and selling Wii's during this crazy time, and making good money (so this is how you do it, I don't need a business plan at all).  

From here, I invested in a horse, started importing blue-tooth headsets and gucci necklaces, and started creating t-shirts for different collegiate groups.  I became a serial entrepreneur within 6 months, and learned everything I was read about was bull shit!  Also, I learned that you can work on all of your ideas at the same time, and hustle at all of them.

That summer I filmed a feature length movie, and sold products online to help fund my summer.  (www.laidoffthemovie.com)  From there, I kept up with different online sales businesses until I graduated from Penn State in May 2010.  

Now I had a dilemma, either go after a business idea I was very passionate about, and had been working on for my whole college career, or trying to create an automated income to survive?  I figured I could possibly get investors to invest in my business plan and idea, but didn't want to go through the trouble I already faced with my first attempt.  I also thought it may be a better call to create some income first, and then I wouldn't have to worry about financial stress of investors.  Lastly, I had just read ""The Four Hour Work Week"", and Richard Branson's autobiography ""Losing My Virginity"", and thought this was the best call.

I stayed at Penn State during the summer (nobody is there), and brainstormed for a month about what to do (after taking a nice 10 day graduation present to myself trip to Ireland).  I created another online company re-selling ionic foot detox baths, and bulk orders of vuvuzela's, and occupied my time with those.  I learned how to create online presence, manage inventory better, and this time I actually went through all of the legal aspects of creating a business: tax ID number, fictitious name, etc.

In February, two friends and I created a shuttle company in Panama City Beach for spring break, and had a blast while making some money.  During this time though I didn't put enough time into my two online businesses, and not thinking to automate better, lost a majority of the long worked for progress I made on these.

From there I worked with creating different transportation companies in Florida, and then went out to California to start an amusement park ticket broker company with my brother and my best friend who worked with me at Panama City Beach, my other friend went to Peru to start a clothing company (www.indiesourceabroad.com).

I have now been working with my brother and friend on this ticket re-selling business and it has been great.  We have 4 employees, and are able to get them to work on some tasks.  I also work a lot on this clothing business with my two friends.  

Throughout reflecting over all of my business ventures, I see myself as a creative entrepreneurial visionary who gets tied down by the day to day tasks.  Every business that I brainstorm and get on paper has perfect goals, and plans for success, but if I am doing day to day tasks on any business, it seems these don't get done.  I would love advice on how to manage multiple businesses, and pretty much just brainstorm the business idea, plan out everything that needs to get done, and find a way to get it to the place it needs to be.  I think VA's and interns could be a great way to start (I've never used either), but would love all advice on how people have overcome this.  (I know focusing on one business all the way through towards automation or selling it is probably a good call, but I'd like to see other options first)

Thank you sooooo much for any help, this would honestly be a great thing to figure out for my future success, and I would be indebted for life to anyone that can help out.  I wish you all great success in 2012, and would love to give any advice I can as well"

Then she had a minor surgery, and he was there with her the entire time, and she began to have feelings for him again, which is understandable (I was not allowed to see her because her family doesn't know about me, and still thinks she is in love with him).


So yesterday she decided she couldnt handle the pain anymore, and that if she is starting to have some feelings for him again she should see how that goes.  I know for a fact that she is still in love with me, and that she is looking for the easiest end to the pain. I have explained this and countless other things too her.  Aside from email me and her will have no contact for a week, and then she will make her final decision.  I have dated many girls and would not have gone through this for anyone else, she is literally the perfect girl for me, and I the perfect guy for her. I trust her completely. She is not using me and I cannot let her go if there is still a chance. Oh, and she has an internship this semester, so she won't be here with me for college again until summer.

So reddit, I am here begging for your help. How do I convince her that what she is thinking of doing is wrong, and that she needs to stay with me.  I don't care if you downvote me, little else but resolving this situation matters to me at this point."

The program that I want to apply for is a 4 hour flight from my boyfriend. There aren't really any comparable programs in his area, so my alternative would be to try and get a job near him.

I know that grad school will have a long-term benefit over getting a job right away (at least, I hope so... can anyone speak to how useful a master's really is?). At the same time, though, I'm hesitant to ""waste"" 2 years of time with my boyfriend, the person I'm going to marry, while we're both young. I'm nervous that I'll be alone in a big city, missing out on experiences with him, and that I'll regret it. It's not that the time apart will hurt our relationship; it's just that I'm worried that it'll be 2 years of unhappiness (especially for me), and I'll wish that I had just gone for an entry-level job or internship near him and had more carefree good times together. I don't want to feel like I wasted our time together as young people by being away.

At the same time, I'm concerned that if I opt for a job and then decide I want to go to grad school later, it'll be much more difficult to get letters of recommendation.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I feel like someone with more life experience might be able to give me some advice, can't talk to my parents about it (because they want me to pursue my career at all costs, without considering my concerns).

Thanks for any advice."
o531k,9,2012-01-06,"Paul Against ""the Family.""",SyntheticSylence,Catacombs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catacombs/comments/o531k/paul_against_the_family/,"I have an internship this year in a United Methodist church in the rural South.  It's a fairly small church, with about 90 people attending any given Sunday, but steadily growing.  They've focused their efforts on building a large youth program.  The idea, as it's been explained to me, is that if they get the kids in the church with games, food, and other fun things, they also rope in the parents.  Two for the price of one!  They also have a fixation on building a million dollar ""family center.""  Certainly, I thought, this is an odd thing for a religion founded on a celibate homeless man to do.

Paul, himself, was celibate and suggested that others should be as well.  ""It is perfectly all right to marry, but it is better not to get married at all."" (1 Cor. 7:38)  Christianity was radical in that it suggested that not having a spouse is a perfectly normal and fine way to go through life.  In fact, certain people are called to live such lives as a witness to our hope.  We do not need sons to live forever.  We do not hope in our children to carry on our family name.  We don't need to procreate to continue to grow.  Our hope is in Christ, who has defeated the powers of death and will come again to set the world to rights.

This was also in direct contrast to the logic of Empire.  Augustus was rather concerned with the decline in ""family values.""  After all, the family is the foundation of the state (especially in Roman times when the *paterfamilas* was a sort of emperor of the household) and the more families, means more children, which means more soldiers to fight for the *pax romana.*  This logic has not gone away.  When politicians tell us about the importance of the family, and how it is the foundation of our civilization, this is what they're getting at.  We need healthy families to produce healthy children so we have healthy adults to run our nation.

I don't think the church is meant to support the state.  And certainly a strategy built bribing kids with fun so we can drag their parents long is more cynical than hopeful.  But I also think our present fixation on ""the family"" is what Paul would call a ""work of the Law.""  The works of the Law are those ethnic markers by which a Jew could be said to be in the covenant.  The most obvious of these being kosher and circumcision.  The idea that a Christian would have to become an ethnic Jew in order to be """"delivered from the present evil age"" was absolutely repugnant to him.  Indeed, he called it another Gospel!  

&gt; You irrational Galatians! Who put a spell on you? Jesus Christ was put on display as crucified before your eyes! I just want to know this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the *works of the Law* or by believing what you heard? Are you so irrational? After you started with the Spirit, are you now finishing up with your own human effort? Did you experience so much for nothing? I wonder if it really was for nothing. So does the one providing you with the Spirit and working miracles among you do this by you doing the works of the Law or by you believing what you heard?  Understand that in the same way that Abraham “believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,” those who believe are the children of Abraham. But, when it saw ahead of time that God would make the Gentiles righteous on the basis of faith, scripture preached the gospel in advance to Abraham: **All the Gentiles will be blessed in you. Therefore, those who believe are blessed together with Abraham who believed.** **Galatians 3:1-9**

The works of the Law functioned as an instructor, given to the Jews in order to prepare them for grace.  And now with grace, deliverance does not come from being a Jew, deliverance comes from belief in Christ crucified.  So that ""It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."" (Galatians 2:20) and ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" (Galatians 3:28)  The message is universalized.  Christ is for all regardless of status.  All that is asked is that you repent, believe, and are baptized.

And Jesus, himself, was celibate.  His mother was impregnated out of wedlock.  And to make matters more complicated, Jesus' mother is also his wife (so to speak).  This is, after all, why she came to represent the Church.  She says the ultimate ""yes"" to God, and becomes the bride.  But I digress.  The point is that often churches are inhospitable to single parents, or single people in general.  I know this is a big problem in the church I am working.  I know this is a common problem across all denominations.  (Perhaps it has something to do with our evangelism strategies?)  Family values is, with this reading, unbiblical.  This is because the nuclear family is a symbol of middle class respectability.  It is a status symbol.  There are perfectly Christlike people who don't bother to get married (in fact, as we've seen, that makes them all the more Christlike), as there are Christlike people who through circumstances they could have helped or couldn't have helped, are single parents.  This, of course, is not to say marriage isn't an ideal witness to Christ's love for his church.  But it is to say that another witness is our love for our own who are broken by sin.

Too many people seem to think you need to be married with two children (brother and sister, preferably) in order to be a good Christian, and we need to knock it off.

I've worked extensively with java, even getting 'paid' to teach it at a summer program but I have never really undertaken (and completed) a large or complex project.  Right now I'm trying to get up to speed on C++ largely because it looks to be a good place to start.  I genuinely hate web and mobile development as I view the platforms to be too much of a moving target to go after at this point and if i stick with the basics I can easily adapt down the road (right?) though I have the ability to do it (I currently manage two separate sites).
I just started looking and stumbled upon an internship opportunity for a game company caught.  Unfortunately they indicate that they are looking for full year interns and while I could maybe pass as having the proper skills (algorithms and c++ knowledge) I'm afraid to try.  For the record, I'm not even a gamer.  I enjoy and am reasonably familiar with the company's product and I like game development for the challenges (I've been messing with SDL in C++ and JOGL recently).  It is, however, not a career I'm dead set on yet and I'm told that its wildly competitive given the influx of crazy-gamers-who-want-to-make-games.

o705x,5,2012-01-07,"My ""I'm tired of looking for jobs"" rant.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o705x/my_im_tired_of_looking_for_jobs_rant/,"Forgive the bluntness, but I'm really sick of looking for jobs. I graduated from college december of 2010, as a late 20's graduate, who paid their own way through college, working the whole time, taking an internship in my desired field, while still attending classes full time after the 40 hour work week at my internship.

And I didn't expect to have jobs thrown in my lap, and I still don't. But I am so sick of the (already tedious process in itself) browsing all the generic places to look for jobs, sending my resume out like a shot in the dark, hoping someone somewhere offers me something. I've applied for unpaid internships on top of working the crappy jobs I was working this last year just to have some form of personal progress to a field worth working, to no avail. 

And the crappy jobs I've had, it amazes me that some people seem(ed) almost surprised that the economy is going into the toilet. The minimum wage has barely been touched in decades, while cost of living goes up and up, even for the two miserable retail jobs I had last year, you have to know that for every position you apply for, whether it's toilet scrubber or fuck, even president,900 other people have all ready applied, sent in their resume, etc. 

The first shitty job, I learned every aspect of this retailer, went to their ""training"" thing to be a better person at the part of the job I did, all for less than a dollar above minimum wage. And when I found out someone who didn't know or do a quarter of the jobs I did made a dollar more, their response was ""well you shouldn't know that"" and ""we only give raises once a year"" and I believe they even said they don't give raises that were more than that. This same employer proceeded to then ask me if I was ""dedicated"" to this less than a dollar above minimum wage job, when I took my second job, and that jobs hours conflicted at times with this job, a second job that paid a dollar fifty more.  On top of that, the GM literally yelled at me and an employee from the vet that is inside our business because as I was walking by she gave me info on my pet, and then proceeded to just talk for less than 20 seconds, despite the fact that at my wage, I could sit there and do nothing for an entire hour, and they'd still be out less than a 10 spot, god forbid I converse with a coworker, why that's almost 20 cents of lost time.

The other job was slightly better for a while, but even there, I know when business slows you have to cut employees hours, but i went from working 6-7 days a week and forty plus, to working a 2 hour shift. All this at a business which when I was hired mentioned they were opening I believe 50 new locations in the next year. Maybe you shouldn't be opening 50 new locations if you can't afford to pay employees for 2 hours of work. 2 hours necessary to make sure that everything is ready for an entire 13 hour day of business.  And it's always interesting to me to work a job where the district ...whatever unique name they give them.... making certainly somewhere in the 60-100k range tells the GM making 35-50k a year to tell the back manager making about 30k to tell the hourly employees who if they even got 40 hour weeks would only make about 13k a year, that the labor costs are way too high. In that situation, I know a real quick way to trim about 150k of fat.... 

Additionally, after several months of working often 6-7 day weeks at this job, picking up every single hour I could get, offering to help in any way possible, when I told them after a week where I got 12 hours that I was going to move out of town to stay with the rents to save money, unless I could get a raise and more hours (because where I was living wasn't cheap), they told me they could give me, maybe,...a quarter raise maximum. Now I understand all the basic arguments about economics, worth of labor, etc...but there has to be at the same time recognition that in 2011/2 what can a quarter get you? As Wyclef Jean once said, NOTHING, motherfucker. If I even got 40 hours a week at this job, which I didn't, that'd still only be 10 dollars. So to offset the cost of living, I can now have an additional 40 dollars a month. Maybe. Sorry I'm not jumping like a pig in shit for your trickle down pennies falling.


I admit, I am particularly (some would say VERY) recalcitrant, and a stubborn prick at times. But how much do you have to be shit on for less than a livable wage? Wages in this country are a joke. If I were making a decent wage, enough to pay my bills, eat food, and not live in squallor, god forbid, I could probably say yeah, some bosses are dicks, and deal with it. But that's where we are a society. Anyone who DOESN'T view 8 dollars an hour as a positive thing is somehow an entitled piece of shit. It's like that Doug Stanhope bit ""How much is it worth to have your life suck? 13 bucks an ow'a..."" I don't want a handout. I've never gotten any aid, any unemployment, all I want is to work 40 hours a week at a wage where I can actually keep my lights on.

/end rant.

I'll go back in my little corner and listen to my angry david cross and doug stanhope bits

**TL;DR** I'm a stubborn recalcitrant and at times a prick, but begging and groveling to shithead managers for 8 bucks an hour? What fucking planet is this?

I go to school in a city. A relatively big college, and at the start of this story I had a few close friends, but two friends were closer then everyone else. We'll call the first close friend, Friend A, and the second Friend B. Everyone else I know through conversation or school. 

I'll be trim with the details. Friend A is a notorious jerk (he has classified himself as a douche, but a good kind of douche) from overreacting to going too fast with girls too quick, as well as lying and other things. I've been friends with him for a little over a year or so. I was friends with him because I felt bad for the guy, and knew that other people were shitty to him, so being there for him would be the right thing to do. Friend B had been friends with him for a long time, since junior high, and said he's been like this for a long time, and like me, he was nice enough to put up with him.

Introduce Girl A. She's really cute and nerdy and awesome. (she's a fellow redditor) I know her from last year, and she knows me somewhat. Friend A takes notice of her more and starts talking about how cute she is. I 'take notice' her as well. During this, Friend A goes through constant 'likes girl + creeps + goes too fast = ends bad' stages. 

Needless to say, Friend A and Girl A don't end up. Friend A goes way too fast, does many shitty things (but doesn't realize it right away) Girl A mistakenly leads him on a bit and that turns into a mess. Throughout this, he realizes I like her, and I can see he's bugged out about it. About a week or two after I tell Girl A that I like her (after we flirted, but still after her and Friend A didn't end up together) and she likes me. She's liked me for a long time. We start dating, and currently, we are in a relationship (which is awesome).

However. Shit changes. Friend A is pissed off, and he has a right to be. I have a talk with him and he says a bunch of things, and we talk it out.. at least I thought we did. I promised not to be couple-y about it and not to rub it in or mention her. I keep my promise. He starts messing around with this girl (we'll call her Girl B) I had a short fling with. 

Friend A and Girl B are messing around, and Girl B tries to end it, but lo and behold, they end up in a relationship a short while later. During this, he talks about how pissed he is at me and how bad of a friend I'm being behind my back. I confront him about it and he says how shitty I'm being, how he really feels, a bunch of stuff. I tell Friend B this, and he agrees that Friend A is being shitty (Friend B and I would rant sometimes about A's antics here and there. Sidenote: Friend A &amp; B and I have two other friends, which I will call C &amp; D) 

It's still pretty rocky after the talk. Friend A doesn't talk to me as much anymore, Girl B and her friends (who I used to get along with rather well) act weird around me, and act offstandish to Girl A. Friends A, B, C, &amp; D, along with a few other friends, have a party and don't invite me. They go out and neglect to invite me. But after shit had cooled down, finally Friend A talks to me and it gets a little better, even though I'm still wary of him and our 'friendship'. 

Cue winter break. Girl A and I are doing great. Talking about our relationship and dating and awesome shit like that. Friend A and Girl B seem to be doing good too. But it's weird, Friends A-D don't try to get a hold of me at all during break, or speak to me (except for one time for Friend A &amp; B. A, I wished him happy birthday, and B, I asked him how he was doing. Short conversation.) Finally, the tipping point, Friend C makes a post on FB, saying something to the point of me not being their (A-D's) friend anymore, and Friend B agrees. 

At this point, I say how close me and Friend B had been. We were friends for a year, but we talked and had deep conversations and I said how I depended on him and how we were best friends. And this happens.

So now.. I have no idea what to do. Break is over in a few days. (We're a state school, western state, but I won't say which because that's silly anyway) I don't have that many close friends, my really close best friend being far away in an internship. I talk to other people, sure, but they weren't as close as Friends A-D. 

What do I do? Am I being melodramatic? How can I get closer to new friends? Sorry if this isn't the right section.

TLDR; Lost friends who I thought were close, who I could depend on. At a loss. Help?"

I talk to other people, sure, but they weren't as close as Friends A-D. 

What do I do? Am I being melodramatic? How can I get closer to new friends? Sorry if this isn't the right section.

**TLDR;** Lost friends who I thought were close, who I could depend on. At a loss. MMFB?"

I know this would have helped me *tons* if I read this before I started hunting for a career in Investment Banking. Other users, feel free to call me out on things you believe I am incorrect on, add more information or ask questions.

The topics of discussions will be:

* Background
* Essentials on your Resume
* Networking &amp; Getting the Interview
* Getting the 2nd round (Super day)
* Professionalism

***Background***

As a background, Investment Banking is basically the crux of what a Finance position is. This includes Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Restructuring, Financial Advisory &amp; Services, and many more. You do not need to major in business to get into Investment Banking. I have seen people with a Music major, History major, and all sorts of different majors go into Investment Banking. What you do need is a stellar GPA - 3.5+ is normally the requirement, but it can vary. Anything closer to 4.0 increases your chances for an interview.

At the lowest level of an Investment Bank, you have Analysts that do the brunt of the work - pitch books, modeling, talking with clients, etc. Associates are the next level up, and have more responsibilities but I believe do the same work. Then you have Vice President's, Directors, and Managing Directors. Managing Directors work the 9-5 basic schedule normally, but their job is to maintain relationships with people and get deals. You will probably start off as an intern or an Analyst.

Investment banking is grueling hours, normally 80-100 hours a week. You will likely work from around 9 AM to 12 AM, that's the standard cycle. Weekends are fair game, I have heard Saturday you may come in for half a day, and Sunday it depends. I have heard people work Monday – Sunday, 9 – 12 AM… so basically expect no social life. Even if you finish all your work by 8 PM, you normally stay until 11 PM just in case any work sparks up. Lunch is normally skipped unless you could probably scarf something done at your desk, and there is normally time for dinner.

***Essentials for your Resume***

To be remotely considered, you need a good set of experience and extracurriculars. You want to get *involved* and hold leadership positions. It is important you do not waste your summers… You need a go to plan BEGINNING your freshman year, because it will make your life much easier the earlier you plan. For a Freshman, try to get some internship or leadership program over your first summer. This increases your chances of obtaining a better internship your Sophomore summer. For your Sophomore summer, I have seen Sophomore investment banking internships at some places, which is crazy because they are starting at such a young age. Experience is probably the best thing for investment banking – they will see your head is in the game and you know what you are shooting for. If you obtain a Sophomore IB internship (very few out there I believe), I can guarantee you that you will have a huge advantage over a ton of people.

Junior year is your last year for an IB summer internship (technically whatever your 2nd to last year is). Make sure you have extracurriculars as well, because they want to see you can balance school &amp; activities. Frats/Sororities can be very helpful since there may be people in the frat/sorority going for IB, so you can have a helping hand. This is another way to network Remember, your resume speaks a lot about you. It is the entrance exam – the more and better extracurriculars with a high GPA, the better your chance of getting the first round.

***Networking and Getting the Interview***

The first basic goal is to obtain an interview. This normally happens by networking. If you have some investment banking club, workshop or seminar at your school, that is where all the networking will likely happen. The resources provided by your school can be extensive, especially if it is a top undergraduate business school. Getting involved is the key, knowing the Director of the IB programs is a huge plus. Once you get into the program, you should be given tons of names. It is basically cold-emailing people, asking for a phone call. To stand out and have your Director like you, *get involved in the program*. Answer questions, ask questions, just participate by raising your hand. He will note that you are taking this seriously, and will refer you to investment banks who will be asking him/her for the best students.

Networking is extremely important because it gets you the interview - *your first goal*. You want to talk to as many people as possible in the company without sounding obsessive or annoying. I normally shoot for 2-3, but 3-5 is probably good too. Normally you want to talk to Analysts before you make your way up to Associates, VPs, and I would leave out Directors/MDs because they're extremely busy. 

If you schedule a phone call with them, call them at the time you scheduled. If they do not pick up, leave a voicemail and e-mail them saying that you left a voicemail and hope you can speak with him/her later on in the day or week. If they pick up, introduce yourself. Ask them if they’re still free to talk, and if they say yes, just act normal. Ask them how their day is going, what they’ve worked on today, etc. I would say include some small talk before you begin actually networking. Then say something like, I’m interested in working/interning at BLAH, and I was wondering if you could tell me more about the program. Listen, I would try to take notes, and then just ask normal questions that pop up into your mind. You can ask them about their experience so far and some of the deals they’ve worked on. I would try to act more informal after all your informational questions are answered (near the end of the interview), what they like to do for fun, some of their interests/hobbies, etc. End with if they have any questions for you, answer, and then thank them.

Normally they might ask you behavioral questions such as, why do you want to do investment banking, why our bank, or even tell me about yourself. Have good answers to these questions and any other questions you can think they might ank. You really want to be seen as a person someone can easily get along with – fun, confident, smart, etc. This is really important, because no one wants to work with someone they cannot get along with. If you are working with someone for 100 hours a week, you want to be able to get along, so THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS BEHAVIORAL/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS!

If you don't have the resources to network, I don't really know what you can do. Apply online, try to call their offices to speak with an Analyst maybe, try to do something. Doing nothing is the opposite of what Investment Banking is. 

***Getting to the 2nd round***

Your second goal is to get to second rounds (after getting the first inerview). This normally means learning your behavioral and technical questions. Behavioral questions are questions such as, ""Tell me about yourself."", ""Why our bank?"" and ""Why investment banking?"". Those are the most usual behavioral questions, but it can extend beyond that. Technical questions are basic finance/modeling questions. Questions such as, ""How do you calculate WACC?"", ""Explain to me how a $100 deprecation expense flows throw the three financial statements with a 40% tax rate.""

In my opinion, technical questions get you to the second round. You need good answers to those three behavioral, but from what I have heard, technical questions is what separates you from everyone else. Ways to study for technicals are through books - Mergers &amp; Inquisitions (website), a Wall Street Oasis Study Guide, and you could probably just search it online. I recommend the first two books because they really have a lot of technical questions. However, searching advanced/unusual technical questions using Google will be very helpful.

There may also be brain teasers as some types of questions. One question I got was, ""Determine how many fridges are in the US, and show us your thought process."" Other may be quantitative such as, ""What is 9^3?""

***Professionalism***

Professionalism is crazy in investment banking. There is no horsing around when it comes to people. One mistake can really fuck you up. I have heard stories at my school where a student sent an e-mail to an Analyst at Goldman Sachs, but he had BAML (Bank of America) in the paragraph. He was obviously copy pasting the same message to everyone, thanking them. This spread like wild fire to the university alumni, and he was basically denied a lot of interviews for that. Do not do anything stupid, TRIPLE AND QUADRUPLE check every e-mail. Make sure you have your resume attached to the first e-mail, and make sure the file is in PDF and its name is LastName, FirstName. 
Make sure you thank people, and be grateful for the chance to speak with anyone when networking. If there is a presentation you are attending, THANK THEM after the presentation. This is also a great way to network at presentations, be the first one to go up to people and begin talking, thanking them for coming down and whatnot. 

TL; DR - There is no TL; DR for Investment Banking. If you scrolled to the bottom to only read this, you probably aren't determined to go into the field.

If you message me, I could probably just send you all my books on Investment Banking. They may be outdated, but it's a start.

o675t,2,2012-01-06,PED issue in MMA - Is it being taken seriously enough? Do you care? ,zxeuk,MMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/o675t/ped_issue_in_mma_is_it_being_taken_seriously/,"General question for debate really. With the news of Cyborg testing positive, what is your feeling of PED (Performance-enhancing drugs) use in this sport? how much do you care as a spectator or as someone who trains/fights. Can more be done about it, is there enough awareness etc? 

I'm just interested to know what people think about it. It seems like this issue is kept in the shadows until only when a fighter is caught. Lets be honest for a moment and not kid ourselves, even though we cannot prove it, we can likely assume there have been many top and non-top level fighters out there, past/present who have likely used PED's at some point in their careers. But as we only have the current state regulators/commissions to rely on, it seems we can only just accept/turn a blind eye until something official comes out and a fighter is banned from testing positive. Basically there are fighters who chose to take this  advantage, whether large or small which goes against the point of sport and competition, but also putting their opponents at a disadvantage and risk of getting hurt. Does it not bother anyone else slightly when you really consider it? There are many fighters I love to watch, but at the same time when you see Cyborg in the news, they too could also be. Just because they haven't been caught doesn't not mean they aren't doing anything or haven't done anything before fights. Which ultimately leads me to think more needs to be done, such as stricter penalties. It bothers me that some fighters have or will take damage during a fight with someone who could be potentially cheating and intern have a strong advantage over them, it just isn't right and hurts the sport and the fighters. Anyhow this is just my take on it all. "

I would also have liked to follow some English written news on current events in Lithuania, unfortunately I haven't found any. I will be taking courses in Lithuanian while in Vilnius, but I don't expect to reach a level of proficiency in 6 months that would make it possibly to follow Lithuanian news in the Lithuanian language. If any of you know English news sources for Lithuanian news I'd be very grateful!

I also know that there will be elections for the Seimas in 2012. When exactly will they take place? What are the main issues and the prognosis?

And since Denmark will be chairman of the EU while I'm in Vilnius, I'd of course also like to know what Lithuanian attitudes towards the EU and Denmark is. And what are some important EU issues to Lithuanians?

Any help and information you can give me will be much appriciated, and I would be happy to buy you a beer (or several) as thanks in Vilnius :)

o8ecd,1,2012-01-08,"Intro: 25/m/6'5""/215lbs (Jan 8. - Apr. 1)",dukew008,BTFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/o8ecd/intro_25m65215lbs_jan_8_apr_1/,"So, last semester I had my internship in a high school for my education degree. Between being at the school for 10-12 hours a day, coaching, and working at the campus bar, I had almost no time to make it to the gym. My diet also fell to pieces because of time and money constraints. Consequently I've put on about 10 pounds, and lost a considerable amount of strength and muscle size. Now it's time to right the ship.


**Goals:**

1. Get my weight down to 190

2. Stay consistent with my workouts, don't miss a day

3. Stay consistent with my eating, only 1 cheat meal per week

4. Get my Squat up to a 5RM of 205


My plan is to attend BJJ three times a week, and to do a modified Stronglifts program in between training days, and to do some light yoga in my basement on my rest days. I've whipped together a basic diet plan on Fitday that has me eating around 2500 calories per day with a 40/30/30 macro ratio. That should have me dropping a couple of pounds a week, but if necessary I will add a tabata workout at the end of my lifting days or decrease my calorie intake. 

I spent 6 weeks preaching at a bunch of Grade 10 students about fitness principles, so it's time to put my money where my mouth is.

o89hx,1,2012-01-08,I hope this provides encouragement to the musicians out there and insight to the music lovers.,[deleted],Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/o89hx/i_hope_this_provides_encouragement_to_the/,"So I felt like Reddit would be an awesome place just to talk about what it's like being an aspiring professional musician/songwriter/producer. I hope that what's happened with me in the last couple years can help some other people who are pursuing similar interests, as well as those of you who just love and consume music but may not think about or fully understand what goes into making it.

I've been making music my whole life and realized - luckily - pretty early on that it is what I wanted to do with my life. There is no road map for a music career which scares many parents, including mine. When I graduated from college (not a music college), I moved to South Korea for a year to teach English and see the world. I was afraid I'd lose either my passion for music or not have the time or people to play with over there to facilitate musical growth. Turns out, that motivated me even more to get it going. I had a band in South Korea. We toured all over the country and I cut my first full length record as the chief songwriter, producer, mixer, guitarist, vocalist, all that jazz. It was a great experience and I had a great time.

My girlfriend and I returned to the states and decided to move to Austin, Texas. She liked the city and I felt like it'd be a great place to pursue music production and songwriting. I quickly got a job at songwriting demo studio through sheer luck on Craigslist, which just goes to show that you never know which outlets or connections are going to help you out so work hard at all of them.

This is not meant to offend any of you who pursue popular songwriting as a career in the vein of Dr. Luke-type stuff (who I definitely respect), pop country stuff, all that jazz, but I was turned off very quickly to the attitudes of my coworkers. Everything was money driven and the passion for music was buried under a passion for money and fame. These people were shallow and worst of all, very ignorant and lacking in the compassion department. However, we had some pretty big time people contacting us for tracks and I felt fortunate to be there. I viewed the experience, and still do view pop songwriting, as kind of in the vein of advertising: it is not necessarily art but it requires a challenging composite of artistic ability and more pragmatic reasoning and I very much like that challenge. I worked very hard and tried to write songs but there was almost an immediate lack of respect from the guy who ran the studio. When someone doesn't respect you, it doesn't take long for you to reciprocate. This is a LOOOONG story in and of itself but let's just say there was an incident over songwriting percentages (we're talking 2%) and I was physically threatened so I quit working there.

The next year and a half was really dark for me. I was in a pretty deep depression. Not suicidal but music, the thing I love most, had caused me real pain. I had bought into a lot of the bullshit I hated about the music industry, hadn't written anything decent in over a year, and couldn't get any clients to produce or mix. I thought about giving up, I barely even listening to music. However, I did manage to get a great gig touring as a guitar player for a terrific folk singer who pays me well and respects me, and vice versa. Holy crap, a real musical relationship with integrity! This slowly started to turn it around. I got to tour all over the country, meet amazing people, and get paid. She also valued my production and mixing skills and started hiring me to mix and master her music. Score! When I wasn't touring, I started making a conscious effort to let music back into my life the way I used to. I started seeking out new music, started listening just to listen, to feel something instead of dissecting it, trying to figure out how to sell it. I can honestly say that one random day, I heard the song ""Burden of Tomorrow"" by The Tallest Man On Earth and that started my rise out of depression and back into exploring the beauty of music. What a gorgeous song, it made me feel something from music again!

About 5 months ago, I got an unpaid, demanding internship at a reputable, local studio and started working my ass off. Things are going well there. I also found out recently that one of the songs I wrote on at the aforementioned songwriting studio got picked up by an artist on Mercury Records as her first single. That's huge! My first major label credit! Most importantly of all though, I started making my own music again which has honestly been the thing that has brought me back to who I really am: someone who loves music and wants to make it for his own sake. Music finally makes me feel good again!

To all of you who are pursuing music in any way similar to me, keep at it! The low points will make you stronger and you'll break free sooner or later. I don't anticipate staying up forever, I know it'll be up and down the rest of my life, but I have cleared the first hurdle. No longer depressed, feeling great about things and ready and confident to keep at it! For those of you that love music but don't aspire to do it as a career, remember how hard the artists you love work at their music and appreciate it and how much emotion goes into every sound you hear.

I know this is longwinded and it is only self-serving in that I am getting a load off my chest. I hope it helps someone. Here's the first song I've produced as my alter ego, Lonely Child. I hope you like it, just making it has helped me tremendously and that's what it's all about!

o7s9v,9,2012-01-08,Wanting to be a Network Engineer.,shael_at,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/o7s9v/wanting_to_be_a_network_engineer/,"Hey guys, so... I've been involved in IT for 4 years now. I started off scraping by to make rent and made a little consulting business of my own for 2 years fixing peoples PC's and doing light SOHO networking. I lived near a rich community full of tech illiterate people. I went to school full time after I had enough to live on part time and pay for classes, and did 2 Internships and a lot of volunteering for my technical degree on campus, getting an  A.A.S. in Network Administration. Currently I am attending WGU, with 6 'classes' to go. 

Over the last 1 year, I've held 2 corporate jobs. First one as Helpdesk before I was head hunted for a Datacenter/NOC position. Been here for 7 months, but the shift hours and lack of upward potential (absolute lack, no way in hell I can move up. This has been made clear to me....) has made me begin to look elsewhere.

Was wondering if you guys could give me some honest feedback on my resume?

EDIT:: I should clarify, I did not mean I want to be a Network Engineer right now so bad asap omghalpmeplz. I am interested in Network Support, Analyst, Technician and even Network Support Engineering roles, those are what I apply to, even if they seem more diluted than what I'm doing now.

EDIT 2::: Thank you for all of the input. Here is a revised version of my resume, I was wondering if I could get a feel for it now. Reduced it to 1 page and cut out all the trimming and fat. Revised some grammar... x.x

o948r,4,2012-01-09,Oh really?  What about the wife's side,suziehomie,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/o948r/oh_really_what_about_the_wifes_side/,"This is a throwaway because I am pissed.

Yeah, sure, I ""follow him all over the net"" because he does the exact same to me.  He can even see what I am doing because, unlike him, the computer I use is visible from where the other person sits.

I bring in 90% of the income.  His amount, most of which is tied to what I get through my disability - a whole whopping $173.  The rest is from his paperroute OF WHICH I DO NEARLY HALF!  He does 60 papers, I do at least 45.  The route is about 110 papers.  That's it.  That's all he does.  He gets about $100 for 110 papers and I do nearly half the route!  Guess what I am not going to do anymore?  Yup.  And he has said for years, he'd be happy to be ""househusband"" if I brought the money IN.

Well, guess what, boys, I do.  And I do chores too.  I just don't stop when the chore is ""done"" like leaving dishes to dry on the dish rack and a dirty kitchen.  I leave a nearly spotless kitchen, to the point of washing the floors if they need a wash.  Hell, I have been scrubbing out the toilet once a week, if not more often, just to make sure &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; have  a clean toilet.  I'm also the only person of 5 people in the house, 2 adults, who manages to put a new roll on.  I ask him to do something and it takes months if not years to do it.  I wanted pictures hung when we first moved in 13ish months ago - he finally did it today after I got the second hanging kit!  The first kit ""disappeared.""  I wonder why?

""Hypochondriac""?  I noticed he didn't bother to mention that we had a flood over the last few days coming in from outside and enough mold/mildew/damp spores have come in or were created to make my allergies go nuts.  I am HIGHLY allergic to mold.  To the point of deathly allergic and needing an epipen.  I took my allergy pill and several other medicines today just to be able to breathe, but they took hours.  I woke up this morning and nearly threw up because of the size of phlegm balls that were trapped in my throat.

Oh, noes... poor him.  Poor widdle man who cleans and doesn't even do it properly.  Widdle man who says ""I'm gonna get a job"" and never bothers to even bother apply because ""there are too many barriers.""  Excuse excuse.  I got myself an intern position at a farm that has lead to a potential job for him too!  I'm handing raw fleece, and prepping it to be sold to crafters.  He has the option of joining in on the fun and getting paid for it - while I do it for free!  I was supposed to be THERE at my job today, but could barely move when I got up because I could barely breathe!

I used to take pain pills to help me move and do the chores I was supposed to do as ""wife and mother"" until I very nearly fried my liver.  I still can't drink anywhere near as much as I used to and I have to be careful how much and what type of painkillers I take now.  I'm lucky I can walk and he's complaining about how bad he has it?  I spend most of the day in various amounts of pain, and have been for over a decade.

Oh yes, let him cry on your shoulder.  Let him whine about how hard his life is.  I don't force him to look for work.  I don't force him to go to the local job club.  I don't make him pound the pavement.  If he worked full time, or even with a part time job - not a paperroute - I could see where this whine is coming from.  He's just feeling sorry for himself.

You guys don't even see the other side of the story.  The fact that I have to tolerate his sexual fetishes is just the start.  Or how about how I birthed 3 kids for him when other women wouldn't even look at him twice.  I knit for him.  I buy him clothes to wear - which he refuses saying they belong to me, even though they do not - shoes, socks, underwear... I buy him the toiletries he says he likes.  I let him buy beef when my stomach can't handle it, and not just a small steak, he buys giant roasts.  I've tried to be loving and supportive about everything he has ever done, even when he's messed up royally about it.

You want to talk ""hypochondriac"" then let me point out that he had atrial fibrillation a few years ago and ever since then, anytime his heart beat is even slightly weird, he freaks out about it.  Yes, he's on blood pressure meds, so what?  At least he can take the pills that help him out.  I can't.  He injured his arm catching a running kid.  I nearly broke my hip trying to protect our newborn when I fell carrying her.  I also fell up the stairs trying to get our then 4 year old back in the house and was stuck there for 20 minutes because he couldn't be bothered to listen to his little girl say ""mommy fell.""  It was another 20 minutes before the ambulance came!  He has ""degenerative disk disease.""  Well, I have ""congenital hip defects"" and ""abnormal bone growth"" in my lower spine.  I also have problems with my knees - also congenital - and dislocated my shoulder and other problems, one of which is causing my headaches... Basically, I am in pain 24/7 and can't take pain meds or antibiotics for what ails me, and his ailments, not only can he take the pain meds and blood pressure meds, he is too stupid to remember.  I am not going to make one of those weekly med kit things again - our kids could get into the meds and that would not be a good thing.

I spend days trying to kick him out of his depression.  If you only knew the lengths I go to to try to get him out of his ""funks.""  Guess what?  He's not the only one who has had to fight depression all their life.  I do it too!  He can at least take the psycho meds the docs scripted him but refuses.  The ones I was scripted made me manic.  His make him feel like he's slightly out of sync with his body.

Yes, our landlords are inspecting tomorrow, but gez, they've had the house on the market for over 6 months now and it hasn't sold.  Why?  Because the rents on the suites are less than what an owner would have to pay for a mortgage because the real estate prices are way too high and tomorrow, someone is supposed to be coming over to help ""dry out"" the carpet.  The handy man was supposed to fix a bunch of problems and he hasn't bothered to book an appointment to come in.  This place can't be sold with the holey floor or flood damage or blocked pipes or wood bug and ant infestation.  Those problems, and more, have to be fixed first before they can even think of selling the place.

Well, boys, guess who is sleeping out in the car tonight.

td;tl:  Pissed off wife is pissed because husband whined when he really has nothing to whine about."

What do I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ob7hd/reddit_my_mother_seriously_hates_my_sister_and/,"My mom is currently going through a divorce that started as a result of her walking in on my stepfather (my sister's father) beating my sister. My sister has developed serious emotional and behavioral issues because of this. Our mother has been incredibly apathetic toward the fact that my sister has these issues, and when we tried to report the abuse or tell her, she would tell us we were lying and refuse to discuss the issue or bring us to a family friend nurse that would overlook our bruises and cuts. Throughout the divorce, though, my mother has been guilting me into watching my 16 year old sister on weekends because she can't handle my her moods and behavior. My mom goes on ""overnight work bonding trips"" and ""just needs a night off"" every week complaining that my sister is too much to handle. I feel like I'm being selfish telling her that as a 20 year old, I'm parenting her daughter more than she is, but I buy all my sister's food, make sure she's on birth control, picking her up from dances and work, and I'm the one she gets pawned off on at any given moment when our mom wants to go out and party.

For example: This past weekend my mom decided to have a date stay over, but didn't want my sister at the house, so she asked me to watch her. When I said no (simply because I wanted a weekend to myself), she left my sister waiting for someone to pick her up from work. 

I love my sister and I don't mind seeing her every week, but with two jobs, an internship, and college full time, I can't worry about babysitting my sister because my mom doesn't like her. What do I do?

TLDR: My mother doesn't want to take care of my sister because she doesn't like her, so she pushes her off on me. What do I do?


EDIT: My sister needs to be watched because of her self-destructive behavior. She has a lot of emotional and behavioral problems that cause her to need ""babysitting"" to make sure she doesn't cut herself, get pregnant, get into serious drugs, or anything you wouldn't want happening to any other teenager. She has so far proven herself incapable of keeping herself out of trouble at and outside school because her own mother doesn't give a shit."

**Background**
A take night classes at my school and my teacher told the last 3 of us before we left class that his primary job has openings. One of which is a php programmer position (Which is currently what I am doing.) My current job pays 35k a year (I am basically an intern but my job title is Applications Developer). I am just under 1 year of experience and do not have a degree but I am seeking. 

So onto my questions:

* I am in Omaha, NE what salary could/should I push for. The company is very large.
* What kind of skills are important to put down? (Should I put down programming languages I am comfortable in or only those that really apply?)
* What benefits should I be looking for?
* Do I need some sample code?
* How can I show that I am skilled in the required field?
* What questions should I ask about the job? (I am kinda lucky in that my teacher is department manager so I think I can find out a bit more about random stuff through him and it sounds as though php position would be working under him.)"

We met at work (me 22F, him 21) where we both had internships this past semester. We didn't work together that much but the times when we did we had some pretty good conversations, and most other days we got to have a quick chat together. Eventually, after a few months, he suggests we have a movie night some evening (at this point he knows I am a HUGE fan of movies).


Since then - except for a gap around the holidays - we've been hanging out about once a week, and each time it's been just the two of us watching movies/tv, playing video games, or playing piano and billiards together. Also since then, I've been trying to figure out if he's interested or not, and there are a few things that are making it difficult:


* **We are both stereotypical shy and awkward engineers.** He's given me the impression that he's just as inexperienced and out of practice as I am, which means both of us are too afraid to make a move (and I'm not even sure if he actually wants to make one).

* **He is the nicest human being I've ever met.** Seriously. I'm surprised he's not Canadian and if he were, they would probably also be astounded by his kindness and generosity. This is something about him that I'm very attracted to, but at the same time he's so pleasant with everyone that I cannot tell if he's flirting or just being friendly (plus he's shy).

* **We've never spent time together in a grown up date-like evening.** He has a second job and his family and old friends keep him pretty busy on the weekends, so we've only hung out after work, during the week, and (to top it all off) at our parents' houses because we're both living at home during our internships. Hence, it's kind of hard to even get a hint of a romantic atmosphere when one of our mothers is 50ft away and can probably hear us talking. *sigh*

* **He's told me on a few separate occasions that he really likes hanging out with me and he enjoys our time together.** But that's mostly the extent of the affection that he's shown (again, shyness is a bitch). There was one evening right before Christmas when we hung out and at the end of it he gave me a hug. However, the next time I saw him we didn't hug, but I'm wondering if that was because we greeted and said goodbye in his truck which is large enough to make hugging awkward.



As you can tell, I've probably over-analyzed the hell out of all this, but I'm just looking for some extra insight since I'm (obviously) not very good at these types of things. I have been trying to subtly flirt with him by making a lot of eye contact, touching him when we talk, laughing a lot, etc. but it's hard to gauge his responses.

**tl;dr** He's so nice and shy that I can't tell if he's interested or just really friendly.


Thanks, Reddit! Your advice is greatly appreciated :)


**UPDATE:** He said he's open to the idea of going on a date, but he doesn't think he's romantically interested in me yet - a polite way of turning me down. He did add that he really does like me and thinks we make great friends and I happen to agree. So things didn't go as badly as expected."

They were annoying, but manageable, and they didn't really impact the quality of my life all that much. But when my best friend died from cardiac arrest a few years ago (he had a minor heart condition but it wasn't thought to be serious) that pretty much sent my ""OCD"" into overdrive and now my anxiety is well over 9000.

I'm a junior in college and last year I went to the counseling center to see a therapist for the first time (a little more than a year after he died and I basically went insane). She was an intern so I'm not sure I really got the full experience of being in therapy. She was nice and gave me some handy short-term relaxation techniques (clenching fists then releasing, etc.) but I am definitely not any better for the long-term. She also told me, during our last session, that she was leaving the school, so if I wanted to continue therapy there I'd have to be switched to someone else and essentially start from scratch, which pissed me off to no end. Since then I haven't gone back to the counseling center at all.

I have absolutely *crippling* bouts of hyponchondriasis. Sometimes they just pass when I occupy myself with something like a movie or a video game, other times they lead to full on panic attacks. Because of my friend I have become incredibly obsessive of my heart. I constantly check my own pulse to make sure it's good. But if it's too fast, I freak out. If it's too slow, I freak out. I don't like to sleep directly on my chest because I think that somehow that could put a strain on my heart. Sometimes when I feel a minor twinge or tweak in my chest area I have burp to ""clear the area."" This obsession has basically spread to the entire left side of my body. If I feel something in my neck, I start worrying that a major artery has been severed. If I feel something in my leg, I probably have a blood clot.

To make matters worse, it seems that I have recently developed minor heart palpitations (PAC's). They are supposedly totally benign and a lot of people have them and don't even know it. Except -- I know it. I can feel every single one. Feels like my heart stops for a second, then corrects itself and proceeds normally. You can imagine how nerve-wracking this is for me.

It's getting to the point where it's seriously impacting the quality of my life. I can't go five minutes without worrying about something. My mind races all the time. I have trouble sleeping. I have trouble forming relationships with people. I have trouble focusing in class. I know I need to see a therapist again, but I'm starting to consider that I may need to start thinking about medication options as well.

On top of all this, I have awful obsessions about death (my own, but more often my younger brother's or my mom's) which I neutralize by ""wishing them away"" or doing some ridiculous ritual to make the thought go away. I realize how ludicrous this is but I can't stop doing it. I just can't.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for from you guys. If you actually read through this whole thing and are still reading, I sincerely thank you with every fiber of my being. I guess just telling my story helps a bit. I would like some advice about therapy, or medication, or just any tips or tricks. I'm not depressed, I'm not suicidal, but I just can't deal with this anymore.

TLDR -- I have undiagnosed hypochondriasis, obsessive thoughts, and bad anxiety attacks mostly stemming from the death of my best friend two years ago. I'd like some general advice...anything at all you can give me would be great.

ocffo,3,2012-01-11,"My girlfriend will leave me because i have college debt, what can i do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ocffo/my_girlfriend_will_leave_me_because_i_have/,"So I recently started my first job, and I currently owe over 60k in student loans. My girlfriend came from a slightly more fortunate situation and didn't have to pay for her school and will be debt free when she graduates this may. 

She's looking to get married in a few years, its ""her plan"". She told me last night that she doesn't want to take on my loans and that she can't see us being together because of the fact that it will be prevent her from having the kind of life she always wanted after she graduated college.

I'm earning 32k a year at my first job, and she'll most likely be earning the same amount when she graduates. She told me that if I didn't have any debt, that she'd be planning her future with me.

I'd just like to point out that I love this girl deeply, and wouldn't turn down a life together with her. 

I told her that I was going to try to get the burden of my debt lessened, that I was going to consolidate my loans and actively seek to move up the ladder job-wise, but i honestly feel like my only chance of holding on to her is winning the lottery.

Do I have any options?


edit: Sorry call me an idiot for not mentioning this, but I feel like I left a key point: she let me stay with her free of charge while i was trying to find a job, she helped me afford life in order to intern at my company on a minimum wage salary for three months until i got my promotion. the girl took care of me, she maybe she thinks she is cutting her losses honestly"

oegts,1,2012-01-12,"I'm interested in entering into politics, can Reddit give me some advice and helpful information for making this happen?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oegts/im_interested_in_entering_into_politics_can/,"his account is a throw-away considering content from my current main account could jeopardize future efforts.

With the current events and situation in US politics I have been pondering about attempting to enter into it as a career. I'm 20 years old, so I have plenty of time ahead of me to prepare and plan out what I aim to do and how I aim to do it. Where it stands as of right now is figuring what I should do with the time ahead. I've come up with a few examples of things that could potentially increase the overall influence of my lifetime career such as: getting a PhD or masters (enrolled in art school, have the support to switch and go for another degree), taking time throughout the next few years to dive into politics (intern for local politicians, attend city council, etc.), collecting sources and information that will benefit the campaign (keeping up to date and relevant, an example for today would be SOPA/PIPA), and garnering support, funding, advisers, representatives, etc.

I feel as though it wouldn't work as well if I didn't explain what my goals are and how I feel as a person on situations today. My end goal would be to run for President in 15 years. I don't feel confident enough to say if I'm a Democrat or Republican, but I understand that without associating myself with one or the either I would most likely be unelectable (at least in our current times). With that said, here are a few things that I see needing change in America:

- Corporations are not people.
- The Gov't is NOT allowed to bail corporations out of bankruptcy (there may be exceptions but it's rare). 
- The destruction of unions, pensions, and worker benefits is creating a type of ""paid slave"" in current society (under 20k salary/year, insurance for self but not for family, etc.)
- Police brutality results in immediate and permanent removal, and in some cases let go with absolutely NO BENEFITS (in severe cases).
- A Police officer should never be overweight, and should have access to 24/7 trainer/equipment/etc. (because they shouldn't be overweight or even fat, EVER)
- The Gov't will not touch the internet.
- The Gov't was founded on the belief of a free man, not religion.
- NASA funding should continue.
- Other forms of scientific funding should continue/increase (too broad to delve into right now).
- The Gov't has no right to tell you what you can and cannot put into your body.
- Gov't salaries are too high.
- People shouldn't be allowed to live on the streets (read below)
- The Gov't should fund accommodations for those who can't afford a safe, livable home.
- Sales tax should already be added onto products (on a per item system; carton of cigarettes for $60 (12 packs in a carton), sales tax at 8%, $64.8 for the carton, $5.40 for one pack).

I will be updating this list as quickly as possible, please bear with me.


There is a lot more but it's difficult to throw everything out there at once. If you would like to ask me about a current issue that you'd like to get an answer for I'd be more than obliged to answer it. All I want from you fine folks is information and support, help me make this a reality. Any assistance is greatly appreciated, and if you have any questions feel free to post them."
oeg83,4,2012-01-12,Need help with some MySQL query decisions,davydog187,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/oeg83/need_help_with_some_mysql_query_decisions/,"I'm working on a project for my internship that I've been building from the ground up. Its a web-based scheduler for application licenses thats built on top of flexnet publisher. I'm using the codeigniter framework for the backend which I really have begun to like for its ActiveRecord method to database access. However, I'm having some trouble with some of the more advanced SQL stuff.

I have two tables, features and licenses which look like this:

features:

    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field      | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | scheduleid | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
    | username   | char(50)         | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | feature    | char(50)         | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | date       | date             | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | start_time | float(3,1)       | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | end_time   | float(3,1)       | NO   |     |         |                | 
    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

licenses:

    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | Field   | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | feature | char(50) | NO   | PRI |         |       | 
    | max_lic | int(4)   | NO   |     |         |       | 
    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+

Now that I'm thinking about it, feature should probably be a foreign key. I'll fix that later. For now, I want to insert scheduled features into the features table. Whenever I do that, I want to avoid overscheduling by checking that the # of licenses per time period is less than max_lic. (start_time/end_time is always a half hour block, so I probably could get rid of end_time also). I'm thinking that I'll probably have to make use of MySQL transactions, but I'm not sure of how I should write the query to check for overscheduling. Essentially I would want to do something like this:

Assume:

    myDate = TODAY();
    myFeature = ""gcc"";
    myStart = 9


    (SELECT count(*) FROM features WHERE data= myDate and feature = myFeature and start_time = myStart) 
    &lt; 
    (SELECT max_lic FROM licenses WHERE feature = myFeature).

What would be the correct way of doing this check, then inserting to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency?

Thanks for your help. Also, triggers?"
oeg7s,4,2012-01-12,Should I tell my boss that I am looking elsewhere?,mcwong12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oeg7s/should_i_tell_my_boss_that_i_am_looking_elsewhere/,"So a background of my situation:

I've been working here in total of 2 years. Started out as an intern and then brought full time. The boss and I are pretty cool and when he hired me he said that if I ever wanted to leave, just let him know in advance. So I finally reached that moment where I want to get out and go somewhere else.

Should I let the guy know that I am actively looking? and he should start looking for a new person? Or should I wait and then when I get the offer, just let him know?

My boss has treated me well over the past 2 years and I just want to do right by him and not stiff him.

oed8a,158,2012-01-12,I am so ecstatic I'm about to cry! I can't believe this has happened. ,curlycue,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/oed8a/i_am_so_ecstatic_im_about_to_cry_i_cant_believe/,"I'm a senior in university right now, and this semester I only enrolled for the 1 hour I have left to graduate. (I probably could've graduated last semester, but I'm a video production major and didn't think I had enough experience to warrant graduation and job search, so I took an extra hour while my parents were still paying for school and used it this semester to do an internship I could spend the majority of my time at instead of taking stupid, pointless classes.)

For the last month and a half, I have been KILLING myself trying to find an internship. I've exercised every connection I have (my cousin is a producer in NYC and has connections at ALL the major places, including Colbert, John Stewart, Live! with Kelly and The View and STILL couldn't get me in anywhere.) I made countless phone calls and emails, spruced up my resume and cover letter to perfection and no returns.

I was a total wreck all last week, crying and feeling incredibly depressed for the week before school started. I felt like such a failure. I didn't want to be a disappointment for my parents by not being able to find anything, I didn't want my boyfriend to think I was his loser girlfriend (an idea he quickly exterminated last night during another panic attack) and I was terrified that all of the time and effort I have put into school and previous internships and unpaid practice had gone to waste.

I'd been emailing with a post-production company in my town and hadn't heard back from them in awhile. I emailed, I called, and no one would get back to me. As a last resort, I went back to the place I already had an internship at the past spring and re-interviewed with them. I spent a good thirty minutes bitching to my boyfriend about how I had called this company HE had a connection at and no one would respond to my calls or even send me an e-mail back. I got in a fight with my mom on the phone last night, and ended up a sobbing mess curled into the fetal position on my boyfriend's bed.

After he calmed me down and pried me out of bed for Jeopardy and a cold beer, I opened my laptop and discovered an email from that company. It was the owner, apologizing profusely for not getting back to me sooner and asking me to come in for an interview today. 

I went in, and everyone was immediately super nice and friendly and welcoming. They sat me down and asked me a bunch of questions, and then showed me the kind of stuff I'd be working on. I'm going to be in my own editing suite, they're going to give me real projects to work on and do on my own... I'm not just going to be sitting behind someone and watching them do it. I'm over the moon with joy. I was practically in tears on my way out the door because I'm so excited. I was so terrified things were't going to work out for me, but they are definitely looking up! I just wanted to share! 

edit with tl;dr!

**TL;DR:: After over a month and a half of depression and anxiety over not being able to find an internship and feeling like total shit with no support from my family (and a TON of support from my wonderful SO), I landed my dream internship at an AMAZING company where I'm going to get some great experience.**"

odh8n,1,2012-01-11,Majoring in Comp Sci... Having major doubts,MajorlyConfused,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/odh8n/majoring_in_comp_sci_having_major_doubts/,"This may be a bit long, sorry in advance.


So I'm in Computer Sciences right now. I was always more interested in humanities and social sciences in High School, but I did not see myself finding a job after University with that. I thought business, but it never really appealed to me. Then I found out about computer sciences, and thought, hey, I like computers! This sounds like a great idea!


And it's been ok, but I'm quite frankly getting sick of it. And I'm only three years in. I can't stand the culture, and I feel disinterested in many of my classes. I can program, but it feels so empty and hollow. I honestly can't see this being my life. Plus, I've completely lost my interest in video games in the last year which was where I wanted to work (cliche, I know, but at least there's an ounce of creativity in that field).


So this semester, I'm also taking a few courses that belong in something called ""Humanities Computing"" or ""Digital Humanities"". These concern themselves with science fiction, the history of computers, and the social influence of computers and video games. I *love* these courses, especially the social influence part. I actually want to go to class now.


I stopped to think about what interests me, and looked at a few of my University's grad school options. One of them is sociology. It sounds damn interesting. I've always been interested in different subcultures. I find computer and video game nerds especially interesting. And I've always wanted to be a professor...


But seriously? I'm quite sure a sociology after-degree would take at least another two or three years after my current one, then if I wanted to become a professor that's for sure six years of grad school. That's possibly nine years! I'll be in my thirties. Not to mention the risk of not finding a job, or failing grad school outright. 


I am for sure finishing the Comp Sci degree. I have a 1.5 year internship coming up, and then I have a year of school after that. I've put too much work into this to just stop now, and I have too many people counting on me. 


But I do not want to program for the rest of my life. I feel like I've already sort of screwed up my life and I'm only 20 years old. 


Has anyone been in a situation like this before..? What would you do?"
odf4l,1,2012-01-11,Do I take the internship or not? {MORE},CrackedLips,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/odf4l/do_i_take_the_internship_or_not_more/,"Hi, Reddit. Recently, I've been offered an intership at a prestigious medical school (I'm not going to give the name for legal reasons) and am really excited to go. As a student in highschool, I think the opportunity would be really rewarding as I hope to some day have a job in the medical field. I am scheduled to intern during the summer for approximately 4 weeks. During which, I will, not only work with MDPHD doctors, but experiment with blood samples and extra DNA (kind of a nerd, but I LOVE this kind of stuff).
Normally during the summer, I attend a summer camp for 8 weeks (basically takes up my whole summer). I've made a bunch of great friends there and have a strong connection with the place. If I was to accept the internship, I would be unable to go to camp. This summer would be my last summer ever to be a camper at this camp. All of my friends and I have been looking forward to this summer ever since we started going. There's a lot of myth and excitement about being there this summer; we get tons more privileges than the other campers and everyone remembers THIS summer. 
I don't want to let down my friends, but I think the opportunity at this medical school is too important. My parents, though very supportive, haven't really leaned towards one decision or the other and I'm having a really difficult time deciding what I want more. Do I take the internship, and lose the summer with some of my closest friends? Or do I go to camp, but lose the intership at the medical school? Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. "
od55c,0,2012-01-11,Job Help,throwaway3188,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/od55c/job_help/,"Hey Reddit,

A few weeks ago I decided to look for and take a new internship. I applied for one at a local start up and a few other places around my college town, and get an offer for 14 an hour as before I was making ten, at a cool start up.

The day after I accepted the offer from said start up I got another internship offer for 22/hour from a IT company. 

I told the IT company sorry, and started at the start up. I did not enjoy my first few days, and am beginning to regret my choice.

I am worried however that the IT company will be worse, as there are NO women, I work from home part of the time, and I would be the only person under 30 working there. But the pay is amazing and it seems like a good gig.


I do not know what to do. I am torn. Any advice?

Tl;dr, I got two job offers one from a start up that pays less and one from an IT company that pays more but is boring. Advice?"
og4cz,1,2012-01-13,"CS BS graduating in May, cautious about taking that first step.",zerkz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/og4cz/cs_bs_graduating_in_may_cautious_about_taking/,"Before College, I had a knack for computers since I was 7, and had been troubleshooting them and replacing parts around 11. I built my first computer when I was 16, and made some pocket change doing odd jobs around my community. I earned my CompTIA A+ Certification in 2010. 

Now, I'm a Computer Science senior at a state school in PA. I'm 21, and going to graduate in May (unless for some reason I fail to pass all m classes). My school concentrates primarily in Java, while teaching you some C++/C (this is our basic/intro programming class), and COBOL (yes, they still teach that). Right now, I've been independently working on an Android App (which probably 60% finished, as I just completed the database-end of it).

My skills in more detail:
---------------------
Intermediate Java - decent understanding of Abstraction, Inheritance, etc. Have experience doing HTTP socket work, GUI/Swing.

Android - Getting close to completion with first app. Using Eclipse/SDK

Adobe Fireworks and Flash - I've done some independent stuff with Flash, and I minored in Communications Media so I have some Fireworks experience. Makes for some better ""programmer art"".

COBOL - Took a required class in COBOL. Know roughly/decently how stuff works.

Database - Basic experience with Oracle and a good bit with SQL. Know SQLite somewhat due to Android. Know how to normalize somewhat, ER diagrams, etc.

-------------------

I've only applied for a few jobs recently, but I've had a certain bank shown interest in hiring me (they called me the next day) for a COBOL internship position. It pays decent, as well. I'm worried about getting stuck in a rut though, as I'm not passionate about COBOL at all. I told them I would get back to them.

Since I was young, I've also been into gaming. It became a stress reliever during certain parts of my life. Therefore, I've been interested in game development. I've had a course with it involving Unity 3d, but I thought the class was useless. I have done research in the game industry, and i know alot of people tend to warn others not to get caught in it, due to long hours, deadlines, etc. I still have a huge passion for the field though.

Any advice on what specifically to watch out for? With my experience, what kind of jobs do you think I could take on? I see many jobs that want years of experience for a low level position. I live near the Pittsburgh area, but I'm definitely willing to travel.

Apologies for the long write-up, but I figured I needed to give background. Thanks reddit."

Since lots of you are probably at work but surfing reddit, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm a 4th year computer engineering major at my university and I'm trying to get an internship. Do you have any hints or recommendations? There is a engineering internship fair coming up soon so I'll probably check it out. Should I make a resume? What should I put on it? (there must be a subreddit for this...)

A little about myself, I don't have a whole lot of computer programming experience besides learning C++, Java, PHP, and dabbling with some languages in the classroom. I do have some design experience, but not enough to be a graphic designer :( I'm willing to work hard and learn all that I can

I need help reddit!

ofs3h,19,2012-01-13,Why I Love Polyamory,housepage,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/ofs3h/why_i_love_polyamory/," I moved out to Seattle to intern in 2009 to intern at Amazon for a second summer. After about a month in town, I met a lovely, kind, and open-hearted girl, *Sally*, and soon enough, we hit it off. I had until this point been in one relationship in my life with a lovely lady named *Meg*. About halfway through our first date, she laid it on me. ""I am not single. I actually have a boyfriend at home,"" she said and set about explaining to me about polyamory. Up until this point, I had barely even heard of polyamory much less thought about being in a polyamorous relationship. However, this girl and I really hit it off and I decided to open myself up to the possibility that it could work. 

Soon enough, I met her long time partner, *Frank*. *Frank* turned out to be a software developer like myself so we found common ground almost immediately. However, it took me a while to get to know him. He was fairly quiet and worked long hours over in Redmond. As I spend more time with him, I found that he was a fantastic, caring guy and I could see that he cared deeply for the girl I was falling for. We ended up iming each other frequently with interesting computer programming articles and over time developed a close friendship. I consider him to be one of my absolute best friends in Seattle. Funnily enough when our relationship with *Sally* ended, *Frank* and I have stayed on together living as roommates to this day. He is such an important part of my life and an absolute rock for me.

Even as I grew more and more fond of both of them, it was still really hard sometimes. The times when I woke up alone in bed, the times when I was just sitting there in my apartment on the Internet alone while they were having a nice dinner, the times when I was really stressed from something and they were across town together sending me cute text messages. I could not help but be jealous of the fun that he was having with someone I was beginning to care about a great deal.  

However over time, we formed an understanding and a solid web of communication about how we were feeling and communicating about our uncertainties. I felt like I was intruding at first and stepped lightly. I wasn't quite sure where I fit into the elaborate puzzle that was their lives together. They did so many things together. They went to *Sam's Club* together. They took care of their *dogs* together. They had built a home together and they were so beautiful together. There were many pictures of them about. There was a magnet on the fridge from the time they went to *San Diego*. I was awash in their relationship every time I encountered it and I was staggered by it. They had been together for three years and had many stories to tell of the wonderful times they had together. *Sally* always cooked dinner and *Frank* always came home from work and got his beer and they were nice enough to invite me into their home. 

They were amazing enough to  welcome me into their lives with open arms and I am eternally grateful to them both. They introduced me to this new city and gave me a solid base to work from. I got to meet their friends and acquaintances. *Sally* showed me all the hidden corners of Seattle and *Frank* always made me laugh with a funny coding story from *Amazon* or a corny joke. They both brought much warmth and happiness into my life and made me love Seattle so much that I decided to make a real go of it here. I moved back here after I graduated and things went amazingly well for a long time. 

We laughed, we loved, we enjoyed Seattle and unfortunately ended eventually over differences of opinion. Both, *Sally* and I and *Frank* and *Sally*, had a few things which we were unable to find a compromise about after much trying. In retrospect, one of the major reasons that I stayed in that relationship for so long was my fear of losing *Frank* from my life. *Frank* had become a close friend, a confidant, someone I could talk to and *Sally*, unfortunately, would have made it hard for us to interact on any sort of regular basis. However, we both decided that we had the same differences with *Sally* and parted ways and in the end, I got a best friend, two years of magical adventures with a lovely lady, and a healthy understanding of how much another human being can love someone you care about deeply and the deep bond that can form between two such people. I am forever indebted to *Frank's* openness for all the amazing things that it brought into my life."

I always had an ambition to do comics, animations and voice work, but I was always steered to the wrong places. For instance, I ended up going to college for graphic design on the advice I got from counsellers back in High School. As I progressed, I ended up getting an internship at a comic/animation company, but they went bankrupt and I never had the chance at getting further. and I have yet to work within that field again.

After that, I was struggling for 5 years doing menial and abusive retail work where my managers never let me progress and force me to work long hours (even off the clock in some cases). I ended up walking out on one job due to that my one manager told the head of graphic design department there to not bother with me.

During that time I tried to do voice work as I always wanted to, but all I kept doing was expensive classes with a ""promise"" I'd get work. but not once was I called in and they have removed my name from their site. It feels like no one would tell me where these mythical auditions are being held.

During this whole time of trying to make it in this world; I ended up having my condo forclosed and having to live in a basement with my fiance at a friend's house for a year.

Since then, we have moved into a decent apartment &amp; I managed to find a job doing graphics, but it holds no promises of advancement, no paid vacations or days off, no raises, and gives no benefits.

I also have been seeing a private voice coach who is reputable, but it's tough keeping up payments for the classes while worrying about my bills.
--------------------------------------------

At this point, I feel like College was nothing but a waste of time. I since hid away my BFA out of shame. I get paid the bare minimum to pay for rent and a bill or two; my checks get garnished due to that I don't get paid enough to make student loan payments that they're demanding. I have not been able to get insurance or save for my wedding and it's killing me inside that I am not doing enough or making what I should be to have better quality of life.

Only thing I can ask is, where did I go wrong? Why is it so difficult? Where do I go or look to get what I truly want to do? Was College truly a waste of my time?

Forgive me for sounding so demanding and that this post is out of wack, but I want to succeed, I want to really live out my dreams"

They actively spend money upgrading IT, rather than looking at is as a sunk cost. My main responsibilities include 100% control over the physical aspects of the Datacenter at our company. To put it in perspective we have a top-of-the-line DC, but only ~40 racks (not including UPS-related ones). They have no problem trusting me to transport ~$30,000 between DataCenters in different cities on a weekend trip. A lot of my duties are on the software side of things also (provisioning servers, VMs, troubleshooting, etc). We also have 5 full time competent System Administrators. I would say I'm pretty much already a Jr Sys Admin, without the title.

They often have IT helpdesk positions open which include on-site and remote support. The liklihood of my getting a job as a Sys Admin there after this internship is unlikely, but I might be able to find something else higher up than a helpdesk position. Anyway, the question is this: Should I stick with this company and work my way up through helpdesk positions to get to a Sys Admin position, or take my chance and try to get an actual Jr. Sys Admin position with another company? My concern is that I'll end up at some company who doesn't care about IT with a bunch of incompetent people.

This is my first time I've ever been in such a setting, and to be honest I'm not sure how to navigate these shaky waters... I'm halfway through my term, and I have 4 months left to make a better impression. So far I've been known as the hard-working, quiet gal;  I don't mind this, but I'm worried that people find me anti-social. People in this department are particularly social, and I'm starting to feel a little left out..

To add to this, my boss isn't too keen on my right now. He treated the last intern in the same position I'm in now as practically his niece. According to a coworker who worked closely with this intern, my boss took her under his wing and helped her with everything, but he's making very little effort to make me feel welcome (gives vague advice, barely acknowledges me in the hallway).  I have a feeling he finds me too quiet.

Reddit, I'm running out of time. I have good work ethic but my shyness and lack of knowledge of the office life isn't helping me at all. Do you have any good advice?

TL;DR  New to workplace, unsure of office culture, any advice would be awesome."

While I expect form responses, maybe their interns will take the time to actually read my letters.

Senator [    ],

I am writing to you regarding US Senate Bill S.968 (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011). I am urging you to vote against this bill. When you vote later this month, know that your constituents are watching and please consider the following:

1.	The Protect IP Act will threaten the vibrancy and freedom of the Internet:
There is nothing more important to the cause of spreading Democracy around the world than the protection of Internet freedom. The Internet is the great equalizer; and if we have learned anything from the recent events in the Middle East it is that content-sharing web technologies can be incredibly powerful tools for building communities and sharing ideas. If this bill is passed the United States will join the likes of China, Russia, and Iran— by using censorship, regulation, and arbitrary enforcement of ambiguous laws to limit the creative and social potential of the Internet.

2.	The Protect IP Act will discourage investment in American businesses
Recent studies have shown that this bill will discourage venture capitalist investment in American Internet startups. The risk of government interference will push these opportunities oversees along with countless American jobs—if there is one thing that frightens investors more than risk it is uncertainty. Because PIPA and SOPA are so ambiguous, they could be applied at will to foreign and domestic websites—blocking sites without so much as a trial.

3.	The Protect IP Act will not stop online piracy
The Internet will find a way. The few people dedicated to online piracy will not be stopped by any number of regulations. Even sites that are removed will still be accessible by using IP addresses. This bill will punish legitimate companies and users instead of those responsible for copyright infringement or intellectual property theft. 

In conclusion, I am urging you to vote against US Senate Bill S.968 because it violates the basic principles of due process and freedom of speech, hinders American business, and frankly will not be effective. The Internet is too important to become a victim of corporate greed or misguided litigation. This bill and its implications for the future are too important to be pushed through congress before it can be fully explored. 

Thank you for your time,

[SOPA_NOPA]"

&gt;&gt;File Synchronization

&gt;&gt; VPN Software
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right now I'm using Hamachi from LogMeIn and it's okay.  I wouldn't mind having something that maybe I can setup on a server at my house so it's a completely personal VPN connection.  I'd prefer to be the one managing it so I can allow others to VPN to me whenever needed without them having to make an account.

oh2hg,16,2012-01-14,How the heck do haircuts work?  I'm 26 and should know this by now!,rebent,malegrooming,https://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/oh2hg/how_the_heck_do_haircuts_work_im_26_and_should/,"I've never really cared about my hair - as long as it wasn't obnoxious or smell bad, I was fine with it.  But I'm about to graduate from grad school and have an internship this semester *as a consultant*, and I don't know the first thing about hair cuts.

[Photographic evidence of my hair at different lengths](http://imgur.com/a/CtZE0#0)

How much are they supposed to cost?  I think $20 is a good price, but the only places that cheep around here (southwest michigan) are great clips and cost cutters etc, and they usually butcher my hair.  I thought about going to a *Hair Salon*, but they charge upwards of $50!  That seems like way too much for me, especially if I'm not going to get any better of a hair cut.

And that leads me to point two: What the fuck, my own hair?  I have... wavy, large-curled hair which comes from whichever ethnicity produced it - dutch or jewish being the most likely culprits.  When it's short, it's all cowlicks.  when it's long, it's a full-on white-boy 'fro.  My classmates and colleagues all have these really great, professional, business-person haircuts but I never think that my hair would lay flat enough for them.  Will having a more-expensive haircut solve this problem?

A related problem is that I never know what my hair should look like.  I go in and they say ""how do you want it cut?""  What I want to say is, you're the expert, you figure it out.  but I don't.  I say ""short on the top and the sides, but don't use clippers.""  Is there some way to figure this out?

And finally, how often am I supposed to plop down my hard-earned cash to get a haircut?  Biweekly?  Monthly?  Typically I get about 5-6 haircuts a year, and it seems like I should get more, but I am so afraid of the whole process that I just don't do it.

**TLDR**: How do you find a place to cut your hair, how often should I get it cut, how much should I pay, and what cut should I get?"

ogoko,17,2012-01-14,Why The Time To Build A Wawa At Temple Is Now.,TheHeadiestBrah,Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/ogoko/why_the_time_to_build_a_wawa_at_temple_is_now/,"[If you'd care to first check out this heavily relevant article from The Temple News I wouldn't blame you.](http://temple-news.com/2010/11/08/freshman-initiates-petition-to-bring-wawa-to-campus/) 

As many of you may recall, the construction site that's currently blocking half of the sidewalk on Broad St. between Oxford St. and Cecil B Moore Ave. is eventually going to be the home of a multi-purpose complex that will house over 1,000 students along with a considerable amount of space for retail shops. The complex is intended to serve as a ""gateway"" to our fine school for those arriving from center city.

Looking back a few years, Wawa and Temple seem to have developed and maintained a strong, mutually beneficial relationship. Wawa has consistently offered a number of internships and corporate training opportunities to us Owls (I believe mostly within the Fox School) in addition to partnering with STHM (represent), which has provided interns and student volunteers for Wawa-sponsored events as recently as this past July for the Wawa Welcome America Festival.

One can only assume that on an executive/corporate level, Wawa must think somewhat highly of our institution, as licensed by the ongoing nature of their recruiting efforts. Wawa doesn't interview Temple kids for cashier/deli jobs, their objective in recruiting us, as far as I have seen, has been exclusively for managerial or management-track positions. I believe it stands to reason that since Wawa, by their past actions, has clearly embraced the notion of allowing Temple and our alumni to play a considerable part in the day-to-day operation as well as the future development of their organization, that they should in turn be as greatly enthused by the opportunity to become a part of the ongoing development of Temple's community as well.


In writing this I was reminded of the work of two students within my major who completed a semester-long research project as one of our school's requirements throughout this past fall. In this particular class, students are given almost total autonomy as far as picking what to research, this particular pair chose to design their study to explore perceptions of what the student body finds to be lacking from main campus along with what those students would want to see built to address those deficiencies. The most common opinions found in their study (by a fairly wide margin IIRC) were that students believe that campus doesn't have enough options for places to eat and that there are not enough businesses that are open 24 hours a day on campus. In light of their findings, I must deduce that a majority of the students that provided responses to this survey share the sentiment that the time for a Wawa to be constructed at Temple is upon us.

I think there is a strong case to be made as to why the currently-developing site on Broad St. presents the ideal set of circumstances for the introduction of Wawa to our beloved university. Wawa's stores are generally fairly small (~3,000 sq. ft. according to their website) but attract a great deal of foot traffic day in and day out. It could work out to the benefit of other would-be businesses in the new complex in that a Wawa, by it's very presence, would act to provide a constant stream of visitors (potential customers) to the immediate area while leaving a great deal of the physical space open for other businesses to occupy. I'd think that maximizing profit per square foot is in the best interest of any real estate developer, I see no reason why this instance should be the exception.

In spite of these lengthy musings and in spite of my great personal desire to see this initiative come to fruition, there is much reason for  apprehension in that the good ol' online petition method has already been attempted with regard to this cause and has fallen short of realizing its goal. As such, I'm at a loss as to what might be the best way to go back to collecting and subsequently conveying our community's support for this initiative.

To those of you that share in this vision, I'd appreciate any input as to how you think one might make the best effort to organize/utilize our community to make an honest go at this. This semester is going to be my last on campus as an undergrad and I know I'm going to be too poor to donate to the school's alumni fund until I pay my loans off. Regardless, I still want to try to give back and make an effort to leave Temple as a better place than it was when I found it for the generations to come. To that end, I think a Wawa would do quite nicely.

**TL;DR: I dream of a world with touchscreen hoagies and f'real milkshakes for all Owls**

I'm a college freshman who's doing well in school so far (3.9 GPA in the first semester). I went to a top ranked public high school in the US and because I slacked off, I now go to a fairly small university with about 6000 people total where I have a few good friends there. I love the professors and my newfound interest in learning, but I can't seem to really fit in socially. That's not to say that I'm not a sociable person. I can get along with people very well, but I haven't really made any friendships that mean something to me. Most of my close friends are all from high school and they're all very smart. All of them ended up in places like Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and UC Berkeley/LA/Davis. 

I suppose I may have developed an inferiority complex because I spent 4 great years in HS with them. In those 4 years they helped me realize that my education was important to myself, but at the same time, I couldn't/can't stop comparing myself to them. They're all extremely talented people with goals and here I am sort of drifting through life. Sometimes I can't help but feel like I'm not doing enough with my life. I feel like I'm uninteresting even though I've had really fun times with my friends. I'm usually the person they go to talk to about their problems because I always listen and try to give advice, so in turn, I don't end up venting about my worries often because I feel like they're insignificant in comparison. Sometimes when I talk to them, I hear their stories about how fun their lives are and how they're going to parties and enjoying their classes, I can't help but feel jealous and wish that I could find a place where I'm completely comfortable at my school.

Over the last few years, I've switched my focus between varying engineering disciplines (chemical, mechanical, materials) and am now contemplating Computer Science and Engineering. I've considered transferring to another university where I think I would fit in better, but at the same time, I'm worried that I won't be able to do well there. Where I am now, I'm doing very well and am pretty much at the top of my class. I also get along very nicely with my professors, but I don't feel comfortable amongst the majority of the students. It may be an elitist attitude that I have, but I don't feel like I can be friends with people who have even less of an idea than I do about what they want in their lives. I keep worrying about research and internship opportunities and I feel like I'm not taking enough units to compare to my friends.

Tl;dr: I miss the company of my old friends who are essentially sociable nerds, have an inferiority complex, and am undecided about my future.

What can I do Reddit?"
ogih2,5,2012-01-14,CS Major graduating in May: Have I hit an early jackpot or am I settling?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ogih2/cs_major_graduating_in_may_have_i_hit_an_early/,"I'm a CS major at a major university in New York City who is graduating in May. For the past year I've been interning in the IT department of a financial company. It was my first internship, and I did a ton of grunt work with the HelpDesk during that time, but I stayed on because they payed really well and constantly dangled a job opportunity in front of my face. I also believe that I learned more from the internship than I had during some of my later classes, and I made sure that I kept honing my skills during slower periods.

Fast forward a few months. A co-worker, the company's Backups Administrator, mentions he may soon be looking for an assistant. Primarily, he's looking for someone to stagger hours with and take some of the stress that is associated with being the only person responsible for a major part of infrastructure (and so he could accomplish more with some Disaster Recovery related projects). The job may also involve acting as a lackey for some of the other departments (Database administration, UNIX, networking), and I am excited about the possibility of still absorbing more information from these other professionals, especially since I wouldn't be making an intern's hourly wage anymore. Shortly before he considered me for the job, he mentioned this new hire would probably be starting around $60k.

Fast forward to today, and the job is essentially guaranteed (I'm reading the NetBackup literature and everything). No formal talks about salary, however.

So, /r/cscareerquestions, I'm willing to answer any other questions you may have/ heed any warnings. Does this sound like a good opportunity for a new grad, or am I selling myself short?"
og9sq,0,2012-01-13,Who knows? Maybe Futile? Computer Lottery...,[deleted],misc,https://www.reddit.com/r/misc/comments/og9sq/who_knows_maybe_futile_computer_lottery/,"So let me get this out of the way.... I'm sort of looking for a handout/ multiple handouts. My computer just died(May it rest in piece) and I'm having to type this on a Touchpad (gross!). I just moved to DC to live with my aunt and uncle. The good news is that I get to live here rent free but the bad news is that the job that I do have now is only an internship, and an unpaid one at that. I don't want to ask my Aunt and Uncle as I don't want to overextend their hospitality 

So anyway, back to my computer. It just died. And I use it. A Lot. I have a weird plan and was hoping that you guys could help me. I want you guys to buy the parts for my new computer, but after I have a paying job for a few months or a year, I want to give the computer that you helped me build back to one of the people that helped pay. So think of this as a lottery. For every dollar that you put into the computer, you get a ticket into the lottery drawing. So say the total of the computer comes to $600 dollars and you gave me a $60 computer case, you get 60 tickets into the lottery. That's a 10% percent chance of winning a computer in no later than a year. A $110 GPU, gets a 110 tickets(18.3%) But any thing helps. You can donate money instead of actual components or even some parts that you have lying around.

One thing about it how I used my old computer. I liked to play games, I never had them at the best settings, but I managed. I have a lot of music backed up to iCloud(thank god). I was editing softball recruiting videos on it before I moved here, so it would need to be able to that. Well anyways, I don't know how I can prove that I'll give this up when I get a job, but I want everyone to know that I will.    

TL;DR You help buy computer parts, gain entrance to lottery to win whole computer in no less than a year."

oi5iq,5,2012-01-15,Lots of experience but still young.  What goes on my resume?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oi5iq/lots_of_experience_but_still_young_what_goes_on/,"I recently got my Bachelors in CS, and will probably be job hunting soon.  The thing is, I got my first internship freshmen year of high school, writing ASP for a small local business.  Within a couple of years, it was no longer an internship, but a junior developer position.  Lots of ASP, some ASP.NET, database management, etc.

My second year of college, I began working at a small contracting company.  Despite being in college, my previous experience pretty much made me the senior developer at the company.  I worked on a large variety of projects, directly interacted with clients, spec'd projects, even helped make the sales.  Despite being in college, I'd work 20-30 hours a week, and full time (or more) over my summer and winter break, so I'd say this is very legit experience.

I graduated college a year ago and am still with the same business.  I may be moving quite far away this summer though, and if I do will be looking for a new job.

My concern is this:  Do I represent myself as best I can, with over 5 years of professional experience with a large variety of technologies and projects?  Or does it look suspicious to HR to claim X level of experience having only just graduated college, such that I should write my resume around my education and one year post-college work experience?  I could potentially see myself applying for non-junior/senior level positions, but I'm not sure if my young age will make this a poor choice."
ohyb9,1,2012-01-15,Truly in love with a friend/ex-gf who lives 350 miles away.  Am I crazy to try and make it work?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ohyb9/truly_in_love_with_a_friendexgf_who_lives_350/,"     Obviously the situation is much more complicated that what I can/should fit here, but I'm going to do my best to not blab on forever while still giving an appropriate amount of info.  The first 3 paragraphs are background, and the rest is an outline of my dilemma.

     Note; we are both 23 (I'm male, she's female, obviously).  So anyways, I started dating a girl in April of 2011 (we had both liked each other for a few years, but neither of us had made a move).  Things were going pretty well (she told me she loved me and vice versa a few weeks into our relationship) up until she found out she had gotten accepted for an internship in DC (I/we live(d) in CT near Hartford) that she had applied to months before we started dating (it was to go from June '11 to August '12).  Since we had only been dating for 2 months, we both decided (ok, more her) that a long term thing wouldn't work and we broke up (but returned to being friends).

Like an idiot I started to avoid her messages and such because I was heartbroken for a while, and she eventually stopped sending me FB messages and such.  During her Christmas vacation, I asked her out to lunch and we caught up (she thought I stopped talking to her because I didn't like her anymore, lol), and it went very well.  On New Years Eve I hung out with her and a few friends, and eventually I ended up ""going home"" with her that night (we were both sober).

     I never once mentioned dating again or our relationship beyond friends, but she brought it up tangentially several times throughout that night and into the next day (aka, ""I'm not sure I want to be dating right now,"" ""Even though this feels great now, I don't think we should start dating again, cause I'm still in DC for another 8 months,"" etc).  Sunday morning we went out to breakfast and then for a long walk.  She spent a solid chunk of the last 30-45 minutes we were together crying.  Heck, before we got into the car after breakfast, she came over to my side and hugged me while sobbing for a solid couple of minutes in the parking lot.  Before we separated, she told me she would miss me and made me promise to keep in touch.  I managed to maintain control of myself this entire time (though I obviously just wanted to spill my feelings for her).

     Now I'm not sure what to do.  I love her to death, and I'm not sure I can wait another 8 months to see if we might date again (she's not even sure she will be coming back).  Right now I plan on taking a trip down to D.C. the weekend before Valentine's Day to surprise her and do a whole cheesy ""will you be my valentine/romantic date type thing"" and see what happens.  Ideally I would love to just move down there (yes, I am that in love) b/c I am in a very fluid situation right now (aka, unemployed, living with a friend, with about $1,600 to my name).  But that's probably too unrealistic (I'm a very resourceful person, but that might be pushing it).

     I really would love 2 things from you guys.  1) Some third party perspective regarding my Valentine's Day idea (aka, would you be creeped out if someone did this to you, or would you find it romantic?)  2) What would some of you do (generally speaking) regarding our situation?

     I know this probably sounds crazy, but all my life people have told me to be bold, take life by the horns, etc, and tbh, I'm kind of feeling down for an adventure.  However, I'm also smart enough not to blindly trust impulses.  So lay it on me, and don't sugar coat anything please!  Thanks!

I do like the idea of using PLC's to control equipment and also the sensor technologies associated with them, but the general consensus seems to be that being a controls engineer is more of a ""watered down"" type of engineering.

I have a history of mental illness, specifically depression and anxiety... I was diagnosed as an Aspie in elementary school, but I feel that was a misdiagnosis.

I have gone from being in an approved-private school to a PhD program. I recently accepted a very prestigious internship.

I've still got a lot of stress. While I network and make friends fine, I haven't had much luck with women. I lost over 50lbs, but I still obsess over my weight/looks...

Which leads me to today. I felt kind of crappy all day. I took it as a sign I shouldn't drink so much... I went out drinking Friday and Saturday, and had a lot both nights (8+ drinks). I drank a lot of water, so I didn't have a hangover, but I noticed my mood was off. I made a mental note to watch my consumption in the future. I also had a slight ache in my chest, but it felt like a sprained muscle... it's hard to descibe.

Anyways, I went to the gym and was doing bent over rows, and suddenly, it was like there was a rock in my chest, riight in the middle. If you drew a line between my nipples, right in the center... and this rock was throbbing, and the pain spread to my back. 

I sat down, and started to feel scared. I know someone who had a heart defect and just flat out died playing basketball. And while I sometimes feel anxious, I have only had a panic attack once. (And I'm not sure if that was one or a heart issue as well)

Anyways, I am not sure what happened. On one hand, I was not stressed out... I have a few small things to do this evening, but otherwise it was a leisurely day of reading journal articles and writing some simple code.

The pain is still here, but slight. If I move, it gets worse, but not terribly so. I'm pretty convinced it's stress related, but I thought I'd try asking the internet to be safe.

I am a little stressed now... I had a couple small things to do to day, but tomorrow I am very busy so I need to do these small things (like read a book chapter) tonight, or I won't have time...

ojxw9,2,2012-01-16,Acquiring Skills and Graduate School,whatwhatwhat1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ojxw9/acquiring_skills_and_graduate_school/,"I realize that what employers want and what corporations need in people are skills and experience.

Over the summer I graduated from a top 20 university with a bachelors in Business Administration. I feel like it helped me grow as a person, improved my critical thinking abilities, taught me the basics of financial analysis and other ""business"" things but didn't give me any real solid ""skills"". This is probably what they're shooting for with undergraduate education, so I don't particularly blame my schooling for my inability to land a job.

I worked for the entirety of my schooling at a local retailer and between that and full time school I presumably didn't do enough extracurriculars besides being an officer in an environmental student group.

After graduation I was able to find an unpaid internship back home working for the county as a budget analyst. I work like 25 hours a week doing whatever odd jobs they can think for me to do. They've been really good about not making me do menial things like filing and I've been getting a lot of experience in excel and SAP but still no real ""skills"".

I enjoy the internship about as much as I could expect to enjoy working for free, and would love to get further invested in that area of expertise but the county is laying off more people than it's hiring and I have only had one interview in months of searching.

I feel like as time goes on computers will replace most of the typical office jobs that people are strangling to hold on to now, and my job search is only going to get harder and harder. I've been a computer geek from the earliest times I can remember and have been pondering going for my masters in a field like Computer Information Sciences. Day after day of job searching and it seems like there is always a multitude of openings in the information technology industry. 

My problem is that I've already taken out a considerable amount of student debt (~30,000) to be able to afford the original university. I imagine it'd cost about the same to go for my masters and is that really a feasible amount of debt to have as a new graduate? Will a masters degree teach me skills that are desirable in the job market?

I'd love any and all advice on how I should progress with either graduate school (and how affordable that would be), or other ways of possibly acquiring skills. Or maybe my entire thought process is wrong and you can show me the light."

Overview:
Veritas Scientific Corporation is an applied neuroscience startup company based in Arlington, VA.  It is in the process of developing its P-300 NeuroTruth technology, which will provide brainwave-based deception detection and truth verification for the National Security industry.  This transformative technology will revolutionize the nature of our National Security in all forms of interrogation, threat screening, distinguishing “friend from foe,” and pioneering prevention intervention.   P-300 NeuroTruth derives its efficacy from the P-300 Event Related Potential (ERP), which is to say that 300 milliseconds after a stimulus (a face, name, or location, etc.) is presented to a subject, the brain responds with a decipherable brainwave pattern.  This reaction occurs before the conscious mind can manipulate the information.  


Responsibilities:
 Interns will be tasked with assisting Veritas Scientific in using its MATLAB programming language to: 
A) Write a program that will reliably isolate the P-300 ERP (a marker of recognition) 
B) Directly interface with an EEG
C) Design an appropriate interrogation atmosphere that is conducive to isolating the P-300 ERP.
	

Eligibility: 
* We at Veritas Scientific Corporation are seeking 1-4 interns with MATLAB programing experience.  If interns  have not previously used MATLAB, extensive experience with another programming language is required.  
* The other 4 interns will be tasked with helping the company on the management side: finding Venture/angel investors, writing proposal materials, identifying future government or defense contractor clients etc.
* Neuroscience coursework in addition to programming experience would greatly enhance an applicant’s eligibility.
* At least a Junior or Senior (Graduate Students and Alumni welcome).  Sophomore applicants will be considered if they have taken at least 5 relevant programing and/or neuroscience courses.

Duration: 
Typically one semester. Preferred start date: January 20th 

Benefits: 
Paid transportation to and from work 

Required for Application:
* Transcript 
* Cover letter
* Phone or in person meeting

ojr9g,6,2012-01-16,"GF went through my email, now thinks I'm lying to 
her",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ojr9g/gf_went_through_my_email_now_thinks_im_lying_to/,"We've been together for about 6 months now and I just recently moved in with her.  I'm 27, male, she's 24.  I left for work last night and left my e-mail account logged in, and being very open with each other, this wasn't a big deal to me at the time.  While at work, she texted me ""you should really log out of your e-mail account.""  I laughed and joked around about it and then she started saying things like ""Gross.  I'm really irritated.""  and ""This makes me feel like shit.""  and ""I hope you weren't planning on getting laid tonight.  You can use those pictures.""  Thinking she found my fap folder, I tried explaining that (which she already knows about and is fine with).

Later she said ""I can't believe you're asking other girls to send you pictures, what else are you doing behind my back?""  Now realizing what she saw was a series of 'naughty' pictures a no-longer friend of mine of 5 years sent me a couple months ago (ex-friend because of these emails), who was trying to give me incentive to come visit her 3 hours away on her internship.  She's absolutely batshit insane as it turned out.  She had a crush on me while I was with my ex of 3 years, and later creeped on me through her as she was a mutual friend between me and my ex.  I was somewhat okay with this while I was single, but she has had a boyfriend the whole time, and still does as far as I know.  I didn't realize HOW crazy she is until she sent me those pictures, but I didn't know how to take it.  I stopped talking to her then, and a couple weeks later, she sent more.  I asked her to stop it and haven't talked to her since.  She kept bugging me to come down still and kept asking what's wrong, but I didn't know what to say to her, so I just ignored her.

Anyway, after trying to explain this to my GF, she thinks I'm full of shit and that I'm probably doing other things behind her back.  I told her I'd show her our texts if my phone didn't automatically delete them after a few days, but she wasn't having it.  She later told me to stop texting her and that she needs some time alone.  I responded with ""Alright, just don't make it forever,"" and she replied, ""I don't think that's your decision to make.""

We haven't talked since, and when I came home after work (around 5am... stopped at a mutual friends house for a couple hours to calm down), she was sleeping on the couch and then got up and went to bed.  I tried to talk to her today, but before I could even get a word out, she grabbed her purse and ran out the door.

Now I know I probably should have deleted those e-mails, but I'm not unlike any other neckbeard out there who has 5,000 unread/undeleted e-mails, so I never did.  I could have logged out of my account, but I wasn't worried about it at the time (obviously).  Is there any chance of me getting her to trust me again?  Should I let her come to me when she's done giving me the silent treatment, or should I try to talk to her about it first?  I feel like I really fucked up, but I don't really know if I'm in the wrong here or not nor how to fix it.

TL;DR GF goes through my email acct. finds naughty pictures from 5-year friend that I'm no longer friends with because she sent me those pictures while I'm with my GF.  GF thinks I'm doing shit behind her back now, doesn't believe anything I say and now has me on the silent treatment.  How can I regain her trust, or am I fucked now?

UPDATE: Welp, woke up this morning and she's talking to me again!  After giving her a couple days of space, we're good again.  We haven't really talked about it yet, nor do I think she wants to anymore, so I guess I'm just going to leave it at that until she wants to bring it up again.  I do have plans for tonight involving a cheesy letter and flowers and probably candles, so we'll see what happens."

Same interests, same sense of humor, and she even thought I was good looking.  I'm 22 years old and I've never even been on a date before, I'm always awkward and nervous around women and I tend to over think things which has always stopped me from ever making a move.  I decided this time would be different; I manned up and asked her out and within a week of first talking we were on our first date.  

It was fantastic, she was also a novice at the dating scene and so we were both learning as we went.  By the time Christmas came along I thought I couldn't ever be happier, we talked all day at work, would go out on most weekends, and were both telling all our friends that we had finally met someone.  I was excited and nervous but everything seemed to be going right.

After new years I headed back to university for my final four month term.  We were both a bit anxious about this but were sure we could get through it.  We were both looking up ideas for Skype dating etc. and would be trying to meet up on weekends if possible.

Last week however, she had an interview with a company in another county (leaving out details in case anyone sees this), and was pretty sure she nailed it, and sure enough just a few days ago she got the job offer.  We had a long and sad talk where she told me she would be taking the job and that the best thing would be to end our relationship, as long distance would just be too hard (neither of us have much money to travel, student loans etc.).  I told her I would be willing to try long distance, but that if she didn't want to I would respect her wishes.

So that's it, she’s going to be moving soon and I don't even know if I'll get a chance to see her in person again.  I'm a complete wreck, I've gone from the happiest I've ever been to feeling like complete crap in under three weeks.  It’s not like we were having problems or anything like that, it was going so well and now...it’s just...over.  I can't concentrate, I think about her all the time, I don't feel like doing anything.  She says she feels the same way but I know she's got her new job and moving to distract her.

I don't know how to deal with this.  I've never felt this sad in my life, I was so ready to finally be in a relationship with someone and I poured my heart into it, and now it’s just gone...a victim to circumstance.  We try talking sometimes, but it’s completely different and awkward now.  I don’t even know if we’ll be able to maintain a friendship and that makes me feel even worse.  I'm not mad or angry, I understand her decision and I know it’s hurting her too.  I don't want to try and forget because there was nothing bad about the time we had together, we both thought it was going to last much longer than this.

I’m normally a pretty happy guy, I play video games and go to the gym, I have school and friends I hang out with and I know I’ll feel better in time.  But what do I do right now…until that time comes?  I feel so empty and sick to my stomach; I don’t know if I want to go back in time or forwards…I just don’t want to be here.

**tl;dr** first relationship was going amazing.  Now she's moving to another country and thinks it would be too hard to go long distance.  I accept that its over but I feel like crap, like what we had was cut down just as it was really taking off...don't know how to deal

Any advice would be really appreciated.

I'm looking for some input and opinions. I'll be finishing up my bachelors in either Fall 2012 or Spring 2013. I'll be applying to start a graduate program for Fall 2013. I'm currently most focused on a non-terminal Masters degree to eventually continue onto a PhD program. 

The reason I'm not putting all my focus into a PhD program right away is that for various reasons I sucked at freshman year/first semester of sophomore year, so my GPA is only at around a 3.2/3.3 overall. I currently have minimal research experience (working on it), and am applying for HR internships for Summer 2012 (my understanding is that this is as close to an IO internship as I can find). 

Now to the point. I am a New York State resident attending a state school for undergrad. I have always had a deep, abiding love for Canada, and have always felt that I fit in better to their social system and general culture than I do here in the US. While I'm not desperate to get out of the US, I am very attracted to at least grad school in Canada, if not long-term plans for permanent relocation and duel-citizenship. 

So I'm wondering if I do go to school in Canada, will I be limiting my potential in the US job market? Would potential employers look down on my degree from a Canadian university? I'm most interested in going into the private sector, hoping to open my own consulting firm down the line. 

Also, from what I've read, I/O seems to be a fairly steadily-growing field in the US, but does anyone know if is that inconsistent in Canada?

**TL;DR: US student finishing undergrad, has questions about going to grad school in Canada.**"

ollat,1,2012-01-17,My girlfriend got raped almost 8 year ago. It still haunts her to this day.,staticvoidmain,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ollat/my_girlfriend_got_raped_almost_8_year_ago_it/,"I met a wonderful girl a few months ago which I could describe easily as my soul mate. It was idyllic and perfect. She's beautiful, smart, funny and full of joy.

When I started going out with her I noticed small scars on both of her wrists. I asked her about it and she brushed it off. I must have had a worried look because later she spit it all out. At age 13 she was raped and she tried committing suicide because she felt it was her fault and she felt dirty. I didn't inquire more about it. Fast forward a month later. She studies nursing and begins an intern in a psych ward. She returns to me after her first day down and angry so we decide to drink.

After a few drinks she begins to cry uncontrollably. I ask her what is wrong and she tells me it still haunts her everyday. She said since I came into her life it started to go better (I never noticed her having issues and being haunted) but it happened again after her first day at the ward. 

She cried all night. She wanted to talk to me about it. She explained how it happened. It was her first sexual contact. She was a virgin. She said after she felt dirty and at fault so she tried committing suicide. She then slept with lots of guys to try to make the pain pass and because she felt so dirty.

I am the first to know about this. Not even her parents and 3 year ex know about it. I was speechless. I love her so much but felt powerless. I don't know what to do, Reddit. When she was telling me how it happened I imagined the scene in my head and almost cried of madness.

 What can I do to help her? I'm with her and we have had beautiful moments since then but I still feel the need to help her."
oleyc,6,2012-01-17,24-year old boyfriend is unemployed and doesn't seem to be looking...,detartsurf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/oleyc/24year_old_boyfriend_is_unemployed_and_doesnt/,"Dear r/relationships, I could really use your help on this one. I'm 26, my boyfriend is 24 and we've been together a little over 2 years. We've lived together for about a year. He graduated from college in May 2011 and is still unemployed. I have been working full-time since I graduated five years ago and make a pretty good salary. 

When my bf first graduated from college, he said that he wanted to ""take the summer off"" because he was burnt out from school and wanted time to figure out some relationship things with his parents (he has had some difficult relationships with them). I said, OK, that makes total sense. By the time I graduated I was totally burnt out too. He told me that would be kind of a ""3-month"" thing and he wanted to look for jobs in the fall. 

(Now, for those of you who might say, why would you even let him do this in the first place....I guess I don't have a good answer. I empathized with him feeling burnt out after graduation, and I'm making enough money to be the one who pays for dinner or the movies or things like that. It didn't really used to bother me because I knew that we were in completely different places, financially---I had been in the work world for several years, whereas he was a college student/recent graduate. I really did think that he would want to just have a few months to veg out and then I truly believed he would get down to business in the fall and have a job by, say, October!)

Anyways, it's now eight months after graduation, and five months after ""the fall"" and he is still unemployed. This would not bother me as much if he really seemed to be putting his all into looking for a job, but I don't think he is. I asked him to tell me what percentage of effort he's putting forth to look for a job, where 100% effort is getting up every day and spending the equivalent of a full days' work (8 hours) looking for jobs, polishing up your resume, networking, looking into internships, volunteering, etc, and 0% is literally doing nothing. He was honest with me and told me that it's pretty much around 10%. He knows he is not looking as hard as he could be and acknowledges to me that he needs to put more work into it, but he doesn't actually do anything about it.

At one point he was close to having a job interview at a retail store that he was just dreading working at and he cried about it so much that finally, I said he really shouldn't work there if it would make him feel truly miserable, but that he had to step up his efforts and he promised he would. I don't believe that he has.

I know that every day I am contributing to this problem because I am still paying for everything. He literally has no money and so he is completely financially dependent on me. He's said that I should tell him if it ever starts to really bother me that I'm paying for everything, and he'll get a job, and I have told him that as long as he's truly putting forth his best efforts into getting a job, it doesn't bother me. Again, if he were truly putting a lot of effort into finding a job, or if he were a full-time student, or something, I don't think I would have a big problem with this. But right now I feel like he's my child or something---I am just financing his ability to play video/computer games all day and then go out and do fun stuff with me/friends at night and on the weekends. I know that I am enabling him and I feel badly about that, but I don't know what to say or how to get him to get off his butt and truly look for a job. I know that maybe what he needs to hear is some sort of ultimatum, but please keep in mind that I do truly love this person. He is a wonderful guy in so many ways and I don't want to just yell at him and say that he's worthless and needs to get off his ass and get a job or I'll kick him out. How can I tell him that he needs to get a job in a caring, respectful way? His lack of motivation frustrates me on a daily basis and it is taking a toll on my feelings for him because I only see him as lazy and mooching off of my good intentions. I also get mad at myself for being so soft. It seems like every time I talk to him about looking for a job he has one excuse or another---he was really sick that day, or he did look but there was nothing good, etc, etc. In five months he has had one job interview and it was for a job that I FOUND for him. I routinely send him job postings that I find and even part-time kinds of things on Craigslist. We went out a couple weeks ago and he said, ""I realized I was completely ignoring looking for part-time jobs, I think that could be a viable option for me"" and I got really frustrated at him because I was so angry that he HADN'T been looking for part-time jobs in the first place! I would be thrilled if he had a part time job! He asked me how I felt about that and I tried to be calm and said ""I would be ecstatic if you had a part time job,"" but inside it just made me even more furious.

Every day I am resisting the urge to just blow up at him and tell him that I am sick of his bullshit and him taking advantage of me. Overall, it makes it hard for me to respect him as a responsible adult because he shows no drive and motivation to be able to take care of himself. Maybe that would be good, to just ""get it out of my system"" because I am so tired of being patient. It has gotten to the point now where I am sacrificing things for myself, financially, that I would like to have, because of things that I have paid for for him.

His student loans come due in March and I have made it really clear to him that I draw the line at helping him pay for his student loans. Because it is only a $40/month payment and that is something that anyone working even a minimum wage ($7.25/hour in my state) job could afford.

Reddit, this is getting to the point where it is affecting every detail of our relationship. I feel like he should be more grateful to me for the fact that I pay for EVERYTHING and he feels like I treat him like a second-class citizen sometimes. I'm worried that my resentment toward him not looking for a job is subconsciously affecting the way that I treat him. How do I tell him that I'm really upset with this situation without hurting his feelings?

P.S. Sorry for the rant-like post, I just don't know how to resolve this situation!!!

TL;DR: BF is unemployed and barely looking for a job; I am losing respect for him and sick of being financially responsible, but don't know how to get him to change."

oknez,109,2012-01-17,The Little Girl,SuperSayan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oknez/the_little_girl/,"I've been a police officer for almost 30 years. I've seen it all. Or so I thoght.

A few weeks ago I was cruising around town on my way to my favorite Starbucks like any other normal day. I had just been out on a school teaching some first graders about traffic safety so I felt pretty good. I got back to my car and sat down, pulled the seat back a bit and took a sip of the steamy hot coffee. It was a pretty fine day, the weather was a little dull, but it didn't really bother me. All of a sudden I get a call over the radio. I didn't recognize the voice, but we just got new interns at the station so it was probably just one of them. Some girl claims her mother needs help. The address is only two blocks away so I decide to check it out. I pull over next to an apartment complex and walk up to the front door. As I'm about to ring the doorbell hoping for someone to let me in I hear a faint voice behind me. I turn around and is greeted by a small girl. She appears to be 7 or 8 years old. Very, very pale with huge cirles under her eyes,. He lips were slightly grey as if she was ill. Her hair was flat and looked very dirty. She wasn't wearing anything besides a little white/grey dress. No boots or socks. I offered her my jacket, but she declined. When I told her why I had arrived and asked if she knew anything she motioned me to follow.

We went around the back of the apartment complex and down a small staircase to a basement which appeared to be the place to park your bicycle. She walked over to a door, which led on to the rest of the basement and opened it. Suddenly she picked up her pace and started running. I tried to keep up, but... She looked underweight, but she was jumping around the corners like a deer running from a predator while still telling me, in a silent whisper, to follow her. I couldn't hear the slighest hint of her being short of breath, her voice didn't change at all. At some point I lost her. I stopped to catch my breath and looked up. I was standing before a door. I placed my ear to the door and heard a familar noise. I couldn't figure out what it was, but I forced the door open and found myself in a washing room. The noise was coming from a washing machine and there, on the floor next to it, lied a woman. She lied in a pool of blood. Her clothes was torn into pieces and she had bruisers on her arms and legs. I called for assistance and an ambulance and ran over to check her pulse. She was barely alive. I picked her up and made my way outside. 

At the bicycles I was met by paramedics who took care of the woman. They told me she was gonna be fine, but only because I got to her in time. I figured the girl had seen her mother on the floor and called for help. I just couldn't find the girl anywhere. I wanted to let her know her mom was gonna be fine. After searching the rooms close to the washing machines for a good half hour I gave up and went back to my car. My coffee was freezing cold so I went right back to Starbucks to get a new one. 

I arrived at the station shortly after. The new interns were standing outside smoking so I went over there and told them about the little girl and how the call had saved her mom's life. They all looked at me like I was from another planet. Apparently, neither of them were on calls. I apologized and went inside. My boss rushed down the stairs from the dining room and told me to follow him to his office. As I sat down he started questioning me about the call. He was eager to know what I was doing in a locked up basement next to a woman who had been raped. I told my boss about the call on the radio, the little girl who had opened the door and shown me the way. My boss was confused. The paramedics couldn't get into the basement because the door was locked up good and barred from the inside. They had to wait for someone in the complex to remove the bar and unlock the door.

I deciede to take the afternoon off.. I had no idea about what had happened. I definately heard the call on the radio and the girl had been standing there right infront of me, without a doubt. How she managed to run away from me - I don't know.. and why she ran back and locked the door to keep the paramedics from enterring I don't know either... Puzzled I headed to the hospital to check up on the mother. A kind nurse showed me where the mother was lying. She was asleep so I picked up a newspaper from a newspaper stand and sat down next to her bed.

After about an hour the mother woke up confused about where she was and what had happened. I told her she had been raped, but luckily her daughter had found her near the washing machines and called for help. She looked at me with an odd look. She had never been a mother. She was pregnant 8 years ago, but the child was stillborn. 

Now I was kinda scared. I excused myself and told the woman to call the station should she remember anything about her assailant. I walked out of the room and headed straight towards the nearest elevator. I pressed the button and waited for the doors to open. For some reason I felt an urge to look back on the woman one more time... so I did. 

And there she was."
oklbn,2,2012-01-17,Am I being too harsh to Furries?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oklbn/am_i_being_too_harsh_to_furries/,"I despise furries, not because they are creepy or delusional. I dispise them for what they have done to the puppeteering and costume industry. 

I’ve worked for about 10 years in entertainment, started when I was 17. I’ve had some great opportunities in the FX and costuming industry that culminated when I landed an internship with Jim Henson Corporation. I’ve done costuming and puppetering for countless companies including Disney, Dream works and Warner. I’ve been everything, from kick ass monsters in horror films, to several recognisable characters on children’s shows. 

A number of friends know what I do and I’m ok with them joking about it. But gradually I’ve found my work as a costumed performer crossing paths with the stigma or furries and my sense of humour is dwindling. Whenever people ask what I do for a living, and I tell them, the first thing they always bring up are “hey, do you know what furries are?” 

I always feign ignorance, and they always feel the need to tell me. It infuriates me. I work with kids, and though I’m not prude, I just feel that anybody who is in this line of work should not be motivated by a costumed character fetish. When I go to a gig, whether it be a TV show, or just working on a cruise line, I can always spot the furry that got cast. They have this air to them, this really unnatural focus on the costumes that goes beyond healthy.

The last big gig I did, we got a furry fired. Though, he was getting on the nerve of most of the cast, I’m not sure he did anything outside mentioning he was furry. A group of us literally told the stage manager that we felt his personality was getting in the way of the groups comfort level, which on a cruise ship, is all it takes. I felt kind of bad, but at the same time, I’m so sick and tired of people associating costumed characters with sex obsessed weirdoes.

These days, I’m transitioning into working as an illustrator, and hope to cut back on costumed work. I think this is in part, to the fact that I just can’t stand furries, and in the rare cases I cross paths with them, I just want to punch them. Am I too harsh?

I want to get rid of this debt as fast and efficient as possible).

I've estimated that I would pay around $1,963.91 per month for my loans altogether aka **$23,566.92** per year for my loans (5 years).

olqkh,6,2012-01-17,I no longer fear it...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/olqkh/i_no_longer_fear_it/,"I have recently transitioned from fearing suicide to not fearing it at all. I'll try to give you some background. I don't know what I hope to achieve with this.

I'm 25 now, but I started being depressed in high school at 15-16 due to various factors. Maybe it was part genetic, maybe it was my bad family situation, maybe it was because I was a closeted gay at a single sex school. I grew up in a western country that has rampant homophobia and racism ingrained in society and from my late teens I felt a need to escape it. I had always thought about suicide from time to time, but never thought about it seriously until I was about 22. A friend gave me an intervention and said I needed to go get treatment. Before this I was against psychiatric medicine because of the seemingly changed personalities of my friends on it. I have now been on anti-depressants for 3 years, either having medications that didn't work or gave me bad side effects. I've gone through a bunch of them. I either feel dread or nothing. I don't know what it's like to cry anymore, it's been close to 10 years since I've been able to, even in the worst situations, like a friends funeral.

You could say I'm moderately successful, though in my eyes I am not where I wanted to be. I have a degree and I am working on my second (postgrad) one in a foreign country that doesn't speak english as a first language. I have worked at large corporations overseas doing summer internships multiple times. Despite this, I always fell short of my performance requirements and never managed to get a full time job, partly due to lack of effort on my part, partly due to asshole managers, partly cause it was very hard, and partly because i was stressed and depressed and still had to try put it aside to succeed. I have been trying to get a full time job outside of my home country for 3 years now. I don't do well in interviews, I tend to be badly judged in a short time with extremely technical questions.

More recently, I did badly/got screwed at my summer despite working sacrificing many nights and weekends and didn't get asked to come back full time. However I subsequently did well in university (though I could have done much better with my ability). Despite high pay at summer jobs, every cent goes into my education and I have no support from anyone and I'm not eligible for scholarships in this country. I have had to do crazy things just to get my study visas and I definitely have had less money to support myself as I would like. As a result I can never go out, never see friends, can't eat out, and have had to reduce the amount and quality of food I eat to make money last longer. Despite my frugal spending, I realised recently that I had overspent what little I had from unexpected costs and I won't be able to continue to the end of my degree without work. Getting a part time job is hard here, let alone one in english. I can barely afford my psychiatric appointments and medicine. I might have to go back to my home country without finishing my degree with only a few months to go.

I haven't had a relationship with any of my family for at least 2 years and have had to rely on friends as family since my late teens. I stopped talking to them because the anxiety and depression from even thinking about them was too much. A phone call or email will completely throw me off for the day. I haven't felt love for them for a long time. The idea of a working family seems so foreign to me now and I can't relate to wanting to be with them. I understand the instinct, but I don't feel it.

I have a network of friends around the world, but as you can imagine, not being physically in their locations makes it hard to be close to them. Most find it too much effort to talk over different timezones. I usually have 1-2 friends I am close to at any one time, but it changes year to year. I had a non-serious open relationship for a few months when I was 23, but have never otherwise had a relationship due to falling in love with unobtainable people (which luckily I stopped a few years back). I've never had someone in love with me at least.

A few months ago I started thinking more about my philosophies on life. I have always believed in the personal right to suicide, but it was never an option to me because of the hurt I've seen it do. I had a friend hang himself over a girl about 3-4 years ago and I saw the damage it did to everyone. On this past New Years Eve, I was alone as usual due to lack of local friends and money to go out. I got the most suicidal I had been in a while. I started to think that the only reason I was keeping myself alive was to not hurt those that knew me. This point has really stuck with me over the past few weeks.

I am frantically trying to make my situation work but I should have been fixing this earlier. I have had offers of small short term loans from friends who can't really afford it but the overwhelming guilt of accepting them and the uncertainty of employment/ability to repay them after finishing my degree makes me feel like it's not a realistic option. As soon as I get down to only having enough money to buy a one way ticket 'home', I think I'm going to leave.

I don't think I can handle going back in this state of mind though. I can't tolerate the general populous in my home country and their conservative attitudes. I can't handle starting over again with nothing and having to take a underpaid job with strict working environments. As far as I am concerned, I couldn't be happy that way, having lived through it already. The glimpses I've had of what it would be like to work and live overseas in the places I temporarily lived have felt like life is taunting me. My best effort with balancing sanity and work performance hasn't been enough to get me where I want to be. I feel like I have failed myself, and to me that is what matters most. Even if I got where I wanted to be, I'm not even sure if I'd be happy, and my quest for happiness seems almost selfish.

I'm an atheist, and I am perfectly OK with being cold and lifeless after I die. I hope they use my organs at least. I don't even want to be buried, I want to be burnt. I'm not about to go kill myself I don't think, not immediately at least. I think about who I'd leave things to based on who needed it the most and what kind of note I'd leave behind. Whether I should translate the instructions. I've gone from suicidal feelings from being impulsive and temporary to being meticulously planned and date TBD when I exhaust my current options. I'm currently on my backup-backup-backup life plan, and unsure where to go from here."
olp8n,0,2012-01-17,What will happen if I switch to a running based exercise plan? Will my muscle turn to fat?,fit_for_cali_throw,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/olp8n/what_will_happen_if_i_switch_to_a_running_based/,"Ok, some background: About three years ago, I realized I was fat. So I started eating better, and lifting weights. 

So yeah. I tracked my calories on MyFitnessPal, I lifted weights 3x a week, and twice a week, I ran a 5k.

That worked pretty well. I dropped from a peak of 240 down to about 190. But I've been plateaued at 190 for a while, and slowly creeping back up. I feel that this is due to my lifestyle: I am a grad student. I travel a lot, and I often end up in crappy hotels with no exercise facilities. On winter and spring breaks, I have no access to gyms either. 

I have been considering moving to a running based workout, since I wouldn't be relying on having equipment around. The big catalyst was when I hurt my back yesterday doing a deadlift... I will be out of commission for a couple weeks, and I don't want to risk that happening again...  

I am currently 190, trying to get down to 170 by May 1st (when I start a summer internship in California). If I wait the 2 weeks my doctor recommended to start exercising again, I'll have 14 weeks. I don't wanna lose a week during spring break, and another week or two due to travel. 

Also, I like running more than lifting. 

So, r/fitness, what do you say? Will my muscles turn to fat, or will I just strip away the fat to reveal the godly physique hiding under my rolls?

I'm looking for some solid advice on how to accept an offer from a company for which I've been ""interning"" for the last year and a half.  Although the offer they extended is a raise from my current pay rate, I feel it is far below average salaries for entry level BSMEs in my area (San Jose, Silicon Valley).  

I've been doing research on websites like Salary.com, Indeed.com, EngineeringSalary.com, and PayScale.com.  What I have found is that there are wildly different predictions on what I should make, here is a summary of this data:

All sites were supplied with the same information:

* Mechanical Engineer I
* 1 year experience (actually been interning at this company 2.5 years)
* 100-250 employees
* San Jose, CA
* Degree from Santa Clara University (top 20)



* Salary.com: **72k**
* Indeed.com: **101k** &lt;--- WTF? Sounds unreasonable
* EngineeringSalary: **75k** 
* Payscale: **54k**
* Homefair.com **72k**
* JobSearchIntelligence.com **68k** &lt;--bottom 10th percentile, 90k median

My current offer is for 63k which is 5k more than I make as an hourly intern.  The benefit package is just about the best you can get (profit sharing, stock purchase, even education and veterinarian)

My question is this:  How do I present this information to attempt a massive renegotiation of the offer?  I myself do not trust the accuracy of these websites and wonder if there is a better data set I can present.  Is it unreasonable to ask for at least 70k?  What do other low level experience MEs make (if you feel like divulging that info)

Any advice, experiences, data etc. is greatly appreciated, I really don't want to get screwed on my 1st offer. 

Thanks!

**edit:**  Wow, thanks for all the advice everyone.  To fill you all in, I did compile all the information from my research and presented it to my manager.  He was surprised that I was attempting to renegotiate but entirely willing to hear me out and let me say my part.  Basically the gist of the argument was that our company does not fully compensate salaries based on the cost of living adjustment in the area.  There is a small bonus for employees in San Jose ~6%, far below the COLA of about 50%.  He took my argument upwards and I ended up with an offer for 65k.  
I think the take away here is that **it never hurts to do your research and learn more about what your company will and will not do for you**  Had I just accepted I would've left money on the table and not had the experience of learning how they came up with my offer.  I'm happy with how this turned out and grateful to all you reddit engineers for giving me the courage to just go for it.

Most of these parents are low income and rely on some form of government assistance. I am in my mid 20's and have no children, and my experiences with and knowledge about kids are largely from what I've learned in my various child development classes. I was hoping the redditors in [/r/socialwork](/r/socialwork) might have some good suggestions regarding potential topics, or websites/books that are beneficial (for both me, and the group members!).

We have a basic curriculum that covers topics such as bonding, nutrition, home safety, and resume writing for the parents. Some topics I am exploring are discipline, relaxation/stress management, and couponing! I hope to add something more to these groups, which is considerably hard when it's a non-profit with basically no money to spare for books or supplies. I'm looking for what lies beneath the typical websites that pop up on a google search.

I originally posted this question in [/r/parenting](/r/parenting) and got pretty much no response, so I am hoping that maybe the minds of my fellow social workers might have an idea or two to throw my way.

My goals (and the goals of the agency) are to prevent child abuse and neglect, and promote self-sufficiency and esteem in the teen mothers. I am only in my internship for a couple more months, and I would really like to leave these girls better off than they were when I met them. Thanks for your time.

onyj8,2,2012-01-19,Some advice for someone in the friendzone,sanandresjf,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/onyj8/some_advice_for_someone_in_the_friendzone/,"I don't usually go to the internet but screw it, I'm desperate.

Short Version: I've been friend zoned by my college friend and I'm gonna graduate soon. Don't know what to do.

Long Version: I'm a college senior and there's a girl that I've been friends with for while now that I've met here in school. I started liking her only about a year ago. I found out we have a lot more in common than I thought, we have similar interests and goals. Unfortunately, by the time I started to gain interest, I was in that damn friend zone. Even though we both go to the same school in Virginia, she actually lives in Jersey while I live here in VA. Currently, she is actually roommates with my best friend and his girlfriend right now. The four of us have actually talked about moving to LA once we graduate (we're all aspiring filmmakers). All of us actually spent the past summer in LA working internships and whatnot, getting a feel for the California lifestyle. Even though we all talk about being in LA together, there's still uncertainty, especially on my part, as to when we'll all be able to be out there together (I have a potential job opportunity in New York; 2-year commitment). As mentioned before, we're all gonna graduate soon, and I don't know what's gonna happen after graduation, so right now I'm trying to decide whether I should say something or not to her about how I feel.

I've never had a girlfriend before if that answers anyones ""Am I socially awkward with women"" question. Shit, I've never actively wanted to pursue a woman until now (and to think, I'm 21 in a school with 70% women). I can say that I honestly do not care if she rejects me or not, my biggest concern is that she wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore. I have talked to my two best friends about this, but they're even more clueless than me as to what I should do.

I'm just worried that if I don't get this off my chest before we graduate, I'm going to regret it, but I'm also afraid that if I open up to her, things will get awkward between us which, as a result, would get awkward amongst our group of friends. What do you people at reddit think?

onop5,3,2012-01-19,On letters to Senators,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/onop5/on_letters_to_senators/,"I see people post letters from Senators here a lot, so I figured I should contribute something in case people don't know this.

I was an intern for a very powerful Senator from a small state about ten years ago. Things may have changed, and people who have done this more recently can probably add better insight regarding how the approach to e-mail might've shifted, but this is what I gathered:

If someone is looking at the letters or e-mails sent to the office, it will be an unpaid intern, or maybe a low-level mailroom staffer. 

1) In the case of this Senator from a small state, any letters sent by someone from out of state were discarded. Period. They couldn't vote for the Senator, so he did not give a shit. Only letters from zipcodes and cities within the state ended up being opened.

2) The content of the letters themselves were not examined or pondered. These things were noted:
     a) the issue in question in the letter (gun control, abortion, etc.),   
     b) whether the person was taking a pro or anti stance 
                 *to elaborate: there was a spreadsheet. a pro-choice letter added a '1' to the running tally of pro-choice letters. a pro-life added a '1' to the running tally of pro-life letters
                 *same applied to legislation, etc.

3) All the info available regarding the constituent was logged when this letter was. First and last name, state, zip code, phone number.

4) People who were very strongly pro-gun had a note in their file bolded, bright red, and underlined as 'very strongly anti-gun control'. Now, this senator was also anti-gun control because that was a big point among voters in the state, but this is something to note

5) With regards to e-mail, at least at that time, less attention was paid because e-mails could be from anywhere. In order for the e-mail to merit any attention there had to be some explicit identifier indicating it was from a constituent of the state in order for it to be considered-- otherwise it was disregarded. (This may have changed-- ten years is a long time). Also, notice how many Senators have forms on their websites that ask for zipcodes before your e-mail is sent through? That is why-- it is probably filtering them before they even reach the system. If you are from CA and writing a senator for WY, then it probably doesn't even go through.

6) Last step of the process: there were form letters saved in the computer. The intern or low-level staffer, if this was a resident of the state, printed out the appropriate form letter, went to the auto-pen, signed the senator's name with it, sealed it up and mailed something back.

So, essentially, if you write a senator? You add to a tally. That's where your voice gets through: if those tallies add up, it tells the higher level staffers something.

I don't know if that was helpful, but there you go. Don't ask what state or senator this was. It was a long time ago, but I thought this might be useful info if anyone didn't know about it.
_____

A couple unrelated things: the state was small enough that every single mention of the Senator in the major state newspapers was sent onto him daily and distributed throughout the office-- even letters to the editor. The Senator was very intent on seeing these, so he was obviously keeping a personal tab on them.

On a last point: I remember even back then being amazed at how many freaking red-carpet, movie premiere invites a U.S. Senator received, especially in a state that had nothing to do with Hollywood. I only dealt with that mail pile once, but it was a daunting stack of movie premieres, fancy parties, etc.-- but I digress.

 I lost interest in any career in the political field after that, so I have nothing more to contribute here."

This is sort of the culmination and story behind a lot of the comments and stuff I've made lately. I know it has been done before, and truthfully I kind of hope it will be done again, but I'm gonna share with you all my thoughts on Day9 and my small story of how I ended up where I am now.

How did I get started with Starcraft?  How did I hear about Day9?  Christmas 2010, I really wanted Starcraft 2.  I didn't know shit about it.  I couldn’t have told you the names of the three races.  I was what you would call a complete noobie.  I had heard about how huge it was in Korea, but I had no grasp of anything beyond that.

I played through the campaign, and of course I thought I was the shit at Terran (really Terran it up :P).  I was eager, after besting the campaign on normal difficulty, to start my adventure into ranked.  I'll have you know, I went straight into my ranked 1v1 placement matches, because practice league sounded boring, and I didn't need 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 to prove my worth.

My first game?  I was probably finishing up my barracks when a handful of reapers jumped over the wall into my base and started ripping apart my SCVs before I knew what to do with them.  I was freaking out.  My 30 APM to make workers and build a barracks was already too much for me, and now I had these units, that I had honestly only used in one mission in the campaign, completely murdering me.  I'm pretty sure I cried a bit, I felt so awful.  The other guy kind of realized what was going on, and was really nice though, and apologized for doing such a cheesy build.  

I kept playing, and by my 5th placement match I was actually able to beat the other player by outranging his cannons with siege tanks!  I was placed bronze, but I wasn't giving up! A few games later, I had a pretty rough loss again, and afterwards the other player suggested I check out some videos to get a better grasp on the game.  He recommended HD, Husky, and Day9.  I subscribed to all of them on youtube, and started watching and learning, and while HD and Husky are awesome, Day9 completely blew me away!  Noobie Tuesdays were a godsend, and Funday Mondays, which were still pretty new at that point and really fun/ interesting.

Before getting too personal, I'd like to start with some of my thoughts on what makes Sean such a popular figure in the Starcraft 2 scene.  

Sean's level of fame hasn't changed who he is.  He is a regular person still like all of his viewers.  He gets it.  And his imperfections, while possibly detracting from his ""professionalism,"" help him earn the respect of his viewers.  As was part of his intention from the beginning, the chat/ chat involvement really helps to create and foster a sense of community.  It's kind of like sitting there on a giant sofa with thousands of friends all watching along :3

I think a lot of people don't realize the mental level that Sean must have regarding the game.  Knowing the game is just as much part of his job as it is part of a current Pro's job.  Years being a competitor at Brood War helped him develop and understand the competitive mindset behind a game like that.  I will hear people complaining that he can't possibly know the game at the same level as a pro player, and truthfully, I think in a lot of ways this is bullshit.

This culmination of Sean as a person, unafraid to joke and make mistakes and the former pro/ professional caster part of him, come together in a really nice mix.  Beyond that he is an amazing orator, and a genuinely nice and awesome person.  Beyond all of that though, he doesn't treat his viewers as fans, but instead as friends.  He shares himself with his viewers, the very personal and private side of himself.  He reaches out in some ways to every corner of his viewership, may it be some obscure joke, or calling out people and taking the time to be say ""so-and-so is awesome"" before a daily.  He treats his viewers in a way that I could only treat a handful of people I am personally close to.  This, on top of his amazing talent for entertaining/informative casting commentary, is why he is so popular in my opinion.

Now, for the whole life-saving part… (or at least I feel like he did).  I'm a long time atheist, and it has been a long time since I have really been afraid of death… I've struggled with depression for a long time, and like many others suffering as well, suicide is always one of those very real things on your mind.  About a year or so ago, a good friend of mine's roommate killed himself.  A seemingly happy college kid, with a lot of things going for him, not too different from myself, now gone.  It's something that at the very least has left me thinking quite a lot.

As I stated, I've always been pretty depressed, but I've fought it with relentless positivity.  I really enjoy helping others, including my girlfriend, Felicity :P, who also has a lot of difficulties with depression, and I were our own little support group.  Things were looking great around this time, back in the spring of 2011 when I was playing a lot of Starcraft and had just gotten into Day9.  I was offered a job as an intern at Microsoft.  It was an amazing opportunity career-wise for me and I couldn't really turn it down.  It was going to be a long way away in Seattle, though, and my girlfriend was going through some really difficult stuff around that time.  All of this made what should have been an easy and exciting opportunity really difficult for me.

Sure enough, after about a month or so, and a good bit of discussion between the girlfriend and I, she came to the conclusion that we should break up after a long four and a half really solid years of dating. I was respectful and understanding about it, and we even still talk and see each other on occasion.  At that time, though, the mix of a stressful new job, being on the other side of the country, and the fact that this all happened right in time to be the worst 21st birthday present ever made it really rough on me.

The next day, I just didn't show up at work.  It took weeks for it to sink in fully.  Everyone at Microsoft was super cool, and I promised them I'd put in extra time.  I was… to say the least pretty emotional.  I had three really close and amazing friends that helped me out as they could, but when that stuff happens and you've already had a pretty hard time dealing with depression, you need a distraction.  Day9 was that distraction.  I started watching live every day after work.  The AHGL at this time, and getting to see the Microsoft team play live was also really awesome.

I'd fall asleep listening to his dailies or different interview podcasts he had done.  And when I felt bad, Sean was there.  Since then, when I feel shitty and bitter, I'll just put on one of my favorites.  I'll listen to the Valentine’s daily, or ""what natural expansion?"", because I never get tired of watching poor little Megumi stars try to fly :3  So many different gems and moments.  

But you know what really did it, what got me from all of that to being much more awesome?  It was Sean.  He doesn't seem that different from me.  You can tell just how much he has been through.  He has dealt with many more stressful situations than I have.  Relentlessly positive, but still having a pretty tough time dealing with everything going on, just like me.  Recently, he gave his talk on relentless positivity and gave his analogy for emotions using kittens and ninja stars.  That struck a chord.  Yeah, that’s what’s going on.  I've taken a lot of ninja stars in a row, and it suuuucked.  But after getting hit so many times, you start to get a bit numb.  Either you can start being numb to the kittens, or you can take all of that and try to maybe stand in front of a few ninja stars for someone else (or you know, help them look for kittens).

There is no limit to the different ways Sean has been there for me.  Not a celebrity, not someone I look up to-- a friend that knows just how important it is to be relentlessly positive too, and for being everything he is, I have a great respect for him.  I've been a proud subscriber since around the time he started his subscription service.  I try to stay involved and play a positive role in the community.  I remember arguing with one of my friends about how weird it would be being famous and having all these fangirls swooning over you, so I figured it'd make a pretty funny and interesting question for his AMA. [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16PNOH48Ys&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1311s) [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jzzi0/iama_day9_lol_ill_be_doing_a_live_ama_tomorrow/c2ggl2p) .  And of course that was my favorite answer :3

Also, I totally have my own version of Manfred. :3 A cute little otter named River that my ex gave me that I cuddle up with every night! MAN MODE! &lt;3

So, for all of this and a lot more. For everything you've done for us, my story along with others.  For not letting fame go to your head and taking the time to be a friend to all of your viewers for over 400 episodes now.  Thank you, Day[9].  Thank you, Sean.  

Don't ever stop doing what you do.  You quite possibly saved my life.  It has been a rough journey, and it may get rougher.  But hey, every once in a while you get a kitten. :3 &lt;3

P.S.  Just watched Daily 403 (The COMPLETE FAILURE DAILY) and that's exactly what I’m talking about.  Just sitting back and talking to his fans.  Not powering through a struggling daily.  Being open with everyone :3

TL;DR  I’ve been through a bit of shit and I’ve struggled with depression, but Day9 and how awesome and friendly he is with his fans, is a constant pick-me-up.  He brings the kittens!

omp6c,2,2012-01-18,Question of what skills to list - Computer Science,diamond29,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/omp6c/question_of_what_skills_to_list_computer_science/,"I'm going to be graduating with a BS in computer science in the spring so I'm getting my resume together now to send out for jobs that are hiring in the summer. I've used maybe a dozen or more languages and frameworks since high school.

My question is, what languages and skills should I be listing on my resume? 

Last semester I did a project with OpenCL and C and I recently just made a simple visual C#.net app to learn a bit about the language and brush up on sql. The only languages I think I really feel comfortable taking interview questions on would be c, c++ and java, but I've used a dozen things like php, ruby, mysql, python, html and c# on projects before and haven't touched them since.

I do feel rather unprepared compared to what I've read on the internet to expect and I am trying to brush up on everything through some side projects. I'm mostly just worried that I will flounder if they ask me some intense php questions or something like that. I feel like my greatest asset is being able to pick up any language relevant to a project and be productive with it.

Another point worth noting...my mother passed away right before last summer break after a long bout with cancer and then my father followed suddenly after. This has definitely had an effect on my coursework/ability to prepare myself for employment, particularly when I had to drop my internship at school to go back home. Should I bring this up in an interview or not? I do think my resume would look different without this happening."
omk7t,5,2012-01-18,From the target of today's SOPA protest: job well done (+ tips on contacting Congress in the future),theg00dfight,SOPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/omk7t/from_the_target_of_todays_sopa_protest_job_well/,"Hello folks.  As a hill staffer I want to say today's level of activity was extreme and that it was noticed.  Good job.  Our phones were ringing off the hook from the time we opened until we shut them down at closing time.  

In my office (which was already a ""no"" on SOPA/PIPA) we received the following: 

* ~800 Emails, largely from individuals who had not written previously. 
* ~250 phone calls
* ~50 faxes 
* Dozens of posts on social media sites (twitter, facebook etc.) although these are not really counted to the same extent.  

I would say most Congressional offices send out between 1500 and 4000 pieces of mail a month.  Sometimes more, but offices have to be REALLY good with mail to be much higher than that figure on a regular basis.  
Generating 1,000+ points of contact in a DAY is meaningful and that means that every office will take these concerns seriously, even if they may disagree with your stance.  Seriously impressive stuff.  If young people chose to meaningfully participate on this level regarding other issues, they would have much more influence over the political process than they do today.  

I would like to reiterate some tips for contacting a member of Congress: 

**1. Be polite and respectful.** The people answering the phones are probably almost as young as you are, and likely care about the same things.  Taking out your frustration on a Staff Assistant isn't going to accomplish anything but getting you hung up on.

**2. Be concise.** We don't need you to list off and explain your 18 bullet points about why SOPA (or Keystone XL, or NDAA, or whatever else) is the worst thing to happen to the country in years.  
State what the issue you're calling about is.  State your position.  Keep it short - when you hang up, that phone will be ringing with someone else about the same issue.  Staff Assistants and interns don't set (or even meaningfully influence) policy and your long-winded explanation will be wasted time for you both.

**3. Please, please: Know what the hell you’re talking about.** Don’t call me and ask why the government turned off Wikipedia.  Don’t call me and ask about the bill to turn off the internet.  Don’t call me and just be completely oblivious.  Please read a summary about whatever it is you’re calling about so that you can at least refer to the right thing.  If you want to be taken seriously at least put 30 seconds of effort into it.  

I don’t expect you to know or understand the intricacies of private causes of action and what they could theoretically do to social media sites on the internet.  I just want you to understand that the government didn’t force reddit or Wikipedia to shut down today, but that it was instead a protest to raise awareness.  This isn’t rocket science.  

**4. Leave your Information.** If you leave your information, you demonstrate a) you are a constituent and b) you want to be counted.  Calling up and telling someone you support a bill but refusing to leave your information means that you won't be counted.  Why?  Because we can't verify that you are calling from X state or district instead of Y.  If you are in state or district Y and can't vote for the Congressperson, they aren't concerned about what you think, because they don't represent you.  

This is especially true for emails.  Don’t just fire off an email without any identifying information.  Make sure that we can tell you are from the district.  Include your full name and address.

**5. Ask for a Response if you want one.** You are one of several hundred individuals calling the member of Congress about the same issue.  Are you going to get an individualized response?  No.  Don’t expect one.  Expect that you are going to get the same letter that everyone else contacting us about the topic will.  Make it clear that you want to hear back though.  You may not, but adding that expectation puts pressure on the offices to actually respond.  

**6. Don’t bother asking for a response via facebook or google+.**  I’ll be honest – it’s hard to keep track of all the avenues that people try to communicate with members of Congress.  While not ideal, Congressional staff rarely have a set up to log and track comments and questions sent in via social media.  Why?  Because, as above, we can’t verify that you are even a constituent.  If you aren’t a constituent, we aren’t supposed to respond to you (due to Congressional courtesy.)  If you want a response, please either call, email, fill out a form on the member’s web page, or send a letter in the mail.  It isn’t that much extra work, and there are meaningful processes set up to track and respond to those sorts of inquiries in many cases.  

**7. Acknowledge the good Members.** I see a lot of cynicism here on reddit about members of Congress being bought and paid for.  And some of them?  Yea, they are.  But - are some of them honestly good people who fight each and every day for American citizens?  Absolutely yes.  More than you would think.  If your member of Congress has come out on the right side of this or any other issue you feel strongly about, please spread the word!  Like them on facebook.  Circle them on google plus.  Reshare their posts and make positive comments so that they know people appreciate it when they go out on a limb to do what is right.  Members of congress doing the right thing are often overlooked on social media and I think that is a tragedy.

I realize this is long winded but I thought you guys might appreciate some feedback from the inside.  If you have any questions about the protest as viewed from the inside, or how we handle stuff, feel free to ask away and I'll try and clarify.

A bit of background:

I am 19. I met this fantastic girl at work (also 19), she was there for a month and we really hit it off. When her internship ended I asked her out and we started dating. That is all nice and sweet. The problem is, she was my intern. Also, my father works for the same company, and her father is my father's supervisor. Naturally, we kept it all secret.

She lived 3 hours away, and because of our schedules, we only saw each other on the weekend and as we got closer and close the pain of being apart got more and more difficult. It was a great relationship, some of the best times of my life, and I know It was special to her too as I was her first boyfriend. 

However, all the distance was causing issues. It led to me being clingier. After about 5 months in, It began to lead into silly little fights on the phone day in and day out. 

We broke it off at the turn of the 6 months. After another round of stupid pointless arguing that evening, over skype. She told me she can't do this anymore and she needs her time and space. I felt heartbroken, we always talked about how difficult it would be but in the end ultimately worth it all. And I felt like her saying she can't carry on anymore was her giving up. It really crushed me.

We kept talking, promising to be friends and all that. However, we met up twice since then (it has been about a month) and both times we acted like a couple. We still talked daily and texted all the time. However, the other day we got into an argument (she didn't want me at her birthday, and all the reasons she gave were terrible, I respected and accepted that but I let her know how much it upset me) and then I proceeded to get very upset. Here is where I fucked up and the shit hit the fan:

When I texted her later, she did not respond, but I kept doing it, I freaked out a little bit on her. It culminated with me telling her that I am going to tell her dad. This is something that would hurt her very much, and I did it anyway. I said it out of anger. 

She called me back right away, she said she was in class. and she said she can't believe I would threaten to hurt her like that, and that I broke her heart. I instantly regretted it, I did not realize quiet how much I hurt her. I apologized profusely but she was hurt too deep. She told me not to contact her, and she told she would contact me when she was ready to be friends (if that happens at all). The last thing she texted me was ""You hurt me, I need space"". I agreed.

I feel like a massive asshole now, and a terrible person. 

So What do I do now? I feel so lost and confused. I love this girl, I want her in my life as a friend or as a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to fix this at all??

oozvg,1,2012-01-20,SDET vs SDE internships: which one?,netinept,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oozvg/sdet_vs_sde_internships_which_one/,"As background, there is a Microsoft recruiter coming to my campus, and it seems like they have three internships available, two of which I'd be interested in: Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), and Software Development Engineer (SDE).

I currently am a Computer Science Junior and work at my school as a web programmer, coding in C#, .Net, and HTML5 and I love it.

At first glance I thought that of course I wanted to do the SDE, but when I read the descriptions, it seems like the SDET is more suiting to my personality. It sounds like it's more of a problem-solving and people-oriented position than the dark closeted code jockey that is the SDE. Anyhow, here are the details they have on the Microsoft page:

SDE

Does anyone have any experience or knowledge in either position to provide further insight on which might be more enjoyable?

However, the other day we got into an argument (she didn't want me at her birthday, and all the reasons she gave were terrible, I respected and accepted that but I let her know how much it upset me) and then I proceeded to get very upset. Here is where I fucked up and the shit hit the fan:

When I texted her later, she did not respond, but I kept doing it, I freaked out a little bit on her. It culminated with me telling her that I am going to tell her dad. This is something that would hurt her very much, and I did it anyway. I said it out of anger. 

She called me back right away, she said she was in class. and she said she can't believe I would threaten to hurt her like that, and that I broke her heart. I instantly regretted it, I did not realize quiet how much I hurt her. I apologized profusely but she was hurt too deep. She told me not to contact her, and she told she would contact me when she was ready to be friends (if that happens at all). The last thing she texted me was ""You hurt me, I need space"". I agreed.

I feel like a massive asshole now, and a terrible person. 

So What do I do now? I feel so lost and confused. I love this girl, I want her in my life as a friend or as a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to fix this at all??

**TL;DR: Close relationship fell apart from distance. Tried to be friends. Didn't work out too well. I freaked out, acted like an asshole and hurt her over a text. what do I do now?**

I'm a college student who's workin/loanin through school.  I'm looking to get a car mainly to get to and from my summer internship, and I have no idea where to begin.  I've done some research but it's so overwhelming, so I thought I should ask some knowledgeable folks 

So from my understanding there's three paths: new, used and lease.  My first reaction is to buy used, but I'm very worried of it being unreliable, as I don't have the money for a ton of repairs on top of everything else!  I've been looking at certified used but they cost nearly as much as new :o  So what do you think the best path for me to take is?  What do you think I should expect in terms of a monthly car payment?

English isn't my native language so sorry for any mistakes, dont really care. I'm just gonna write whatever comes to my mind. I dont expect anyone to read through it or give a shit, you all probably have your own problems.

Also, I'm 19. If you're just gonna say ""you're only 19, it gets better"" - dont bother. It doesn't. 

I graduated a year ago and am now qualified to work with computers. I've been unemployed for a year and have never worked aside from two internships. My parents are alive, they're not alcoholics or drug addicts, just regular upper middle class people. So I guess I dont have any real problems and am just a whining bitch, that's what people keep telling me.

I spend all my unemployment benefits on gambling because its the only thing that makes me feel alive, as retarded as that sounds. I still bet everything even if I almost certainly know I will lose. I still do it. It makes me looks forward to something.

I dont have a reason not to work and I've been going to interviews almost weekly. I always go in as happy and as optimistic a person can be but never get hired. Lately I've been losing motivation and I stopped sending out applications. There must be something wrong with me if I can't even get hired at Mickey Dees.

I have no friends and never really even talked to a female. I dont see how that would change even if I did get a job, so why even bother. I failed at life and its too late to try and fix it now, I have too much catching up to do. I guess if I had a job and money, I could buy a hooker to get rid of my virginity. Maybe that would cheer me up? Probably not. It seems too fake but its also the only choice I have.

I do everything alone. I wake up, fire up the computer and spend the rest of my day online. I dont like to do it and most of the time I just end up listening to music and staring at the monitor for hours. I can't watch movies or television shows anymore because they remind me that there are people out in the world with friends and partners and I will never experience what those people take for granted. I've been trying to tell myself that I can manage alone but I just can't do it anymore. I guess its just human nature. I still live with my parents and its the only reason I'm still alive because I can't imagine sitting alone in a quiet house for 24 hours a day. I would literally go without saying a word for months.

You can ignore the rant.

**Rant**
 
~~I hate how America's leaders are either idiots who don't know what they're doing, or saboteurs who know exactly what they're doing.~~ This is probably true in some respect almost everywhere, so disregard.

I hate the American culture, with God being crucial in every significant thing. 

I hate how sex is still taboo, and knowing that any future daughter of mine may be mocked and bullied for being herself.

I hate the fact that gay rights is even a fucking issue. I mean, why the fuck are people still being treated as second class citizens?

I hate knowing that my future kids will have to either struggle with a shitty public school, or be subjected to the bullshit of a private school. 

I hate that the way my parents raised me (which I honestly can't think of any better way) is considered strange, unorthodox and dangerous. 
All of the positive things that we stand for take a backseat to old and outdated thinking. 

I'm just sick of the mindset. The financial problems of anywhere will blow over, I just want to live with people who aren't ignorant about so many things.

I'm currently studying computer engineering in France. I would like to go one year in China to learn the Chinese language. Nevertheless, my current school asks me to do an internship to complete this year. 

I wonder if there are possibilities to do an internship in Chengdu, maybe one of you knows any computer-related company which could accept foreign interns ?

It's a 3 month intership, I'm mostly interested in system administration (mostly Linux, vistualisation and so on, but I had courses on Windows Server as well). I also learned Java and Cocoa programming languages.

oq115,2,2012-01-21,Should I break up?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/oq115/should_i_break_up/,"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

Hey everyone (wall of text warning), so I need some advice on how I should proceed in a perilously rocky relationship.

About a month ago, my girlfriend of 3 years (both are 21) left for an internship in Europe for 2 months. Before she left we had a good relationship and only had minor squabbles every 6 or so months that we always resolved maturely. 

Since she left for Europe, she became incredibly distant. I would be the one who would always initiate conversations and skype chats and I would always be the one saying ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"" which she would never say on her own accord. I started to feel that something was wrong, so I asked her about it and she claimed that ""that's how she is when she travels abroad, I barely talk to anyone home"". 

The final straw came when I sent her a text saying ""I love you"" after this conversation about her being distant with no response. I knew something was wrong and didn't want to wait 2 months to get broken up with. So I did something I shouldn't have and feel terrible about, I snooped into her facebook account. In a conversation with her friend I discovered that she was intending to break up with me, because she didn't miss me and was annoyed when I called to talk.

I confronted her about it, at first she was furious about me invading her privacy but after a long and emotional phone conversation she admitted that she wanted to see how she felt when she got back before deciding to break-up with me, because she claimed she felt like a different person in Europe and that might change when she got back. I couldn't believe she would keep me on the hook for 2 months without even considering my own feelings.

I'm still deeply in love with her and during the phone conversation we said we would try put the mend on our relationship but she still couldn't say that she wanted to stay together when we got back.

Reddit this is killing me, I love her and don't want to break up but I can't wait another whole month in maybe land. I don't have many friends and am currently unemployed due to just finishing university. I'm incredibly scared of being alone and this is clouding my judgement. 

Should I just break it off? or are there alternatives to making it somehow work? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you"

orr4x,11,2012-01-22,"Transferred schools, Big mistake.",rhubarbie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/orr4x/transferred_schools_big_mistake/,"Last year, I transferred from a BFA program to Binghamton University. Basically, what happened was murphy's law and just about every bad thing possible happened to me in a very short time frame which really took a toll on me. The school itself is an awful fit; just about everyone is from NYC and there is a very cliquey/ethically segregated atmosphere. The academic are based more around busywork, cheating and gaming the system than actually learning anything. I've had a hard time finding a boyfriend here since most (decent) guys either want a slutty girl for one night or  have a girlfriend already. I can't seem to connect with people. I have a group of “friends” I regularly go out with but outside of drinking we don't have that many common interests outside of that. If I do meet awesome people, our social circles don't overlap and I rarely get to see them.  I absolutely hate it here but transferring out is simply not an option.

I probably sound like a whiner and all but I feel trapped and I'm just counting down the days until I can leave. I beginning to have regrets about wasting 2+ years of my life here. Hell, I'm even acting like a prisoner. I work out 6 days a week, have taken up water coloring and even started writing a horrible novel.  I talked to a counselor about this and they say I have some adjustment disorder that I should just ride out. I've joined clubs, hold an internship and a part time job and I don't get much out of them except some lines my resume. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm trying to make the best of it, but it feels like I'm regressing all the time. I'm less outgoing, less confident and optimistic than I was before I came here. It's just the day to day struggle is wearing me down and turning me into a bitter, cranky person. I just don't know what to do at this point."
orpla,1,2012-01-22,Week 4: Another 30 days of awesome,stunnings,postcoitalkazoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/postcoitalkazoo/comments/orpla/week_4_another_30_days_of_awesome/,"Last week was my best week yet. I've felt better and better, and no longer are my bad days connected with a bad attitude. Instead, I just feel tired, but still have a happy and positive point of view. The other thing that I've noticed is that I no longer have fear of talking to women who are around me. I still am uncomfortable with a cold approach, but this progress shows me how easy a cold approach could be. 

Looking back at my last PCK post, I see that I had intended to hang out with more people, but in actuality I hung out with my house, and very few people outside of that. Instead, I ended up meeting people in my daily activities. Looking at my journal, I also see that my week has been better than past ones. So I feel like what I did last week, meeting people in my activities, I should continue to do.

Another thing that went really well last week was exercising. I managed to run I think 3 times, and I feel way better. The only catch was that I ran too hard on Thursday, and that has caused me to be unable to do anything active since then; I'm starting to feel the need to exercise. So I need to keep in mind that I have limits on my working out, and I feel much better if I don't push them. The other thing I'd like to change is instead of going climbing and then running, I'd like to alternate climbing and running days. I'd also like to swim and do yoga, but right now I want to focus on actually getting into the habit of running and climbing, then I can complicate it again. 

Something that didn't go well this week were my new affirmations. I don't know why, but I just didn't connect with them. So instead, I kept my affirmations for fear and happiness, and made up one about not being needy. Those have worked really well. This week, I think I'm going to keep these three, and add one about trusting my subconscious. I love the idea of trusting my subconscious, and I realized that when it came time to pick another affirmation, I was afraid of that one... So I picked it. 

One experience I had last week that really caught my attention was that after my first day of my internship with at risk teenagers, I felt like I truly knew what it means to accept someone as they are. When I wasn't trying to be their friend, I just relaxed, and let them say what they wanted to say. I didn't judge them, but I still got to know them, but all the pressure was gone. This is one thing I'd like to bring into my normal life. So this week when I do my internship, I'll see if that sticks around, and maybe follow up on the idea next week when I have a better understanding. 

My list of things to do this week are below.

+ Journal about fear, boundaries, self care, and happiness. 

+ Exercise – Alternate climbing and running.

+ Affirmations

+ Meeting people in my activities

After writing this post, I realize that a lot of what I'm doing is starting to succeed, but I still have a set back here and there. I can feel everything start to come into place, and I think once it all clicks, I will be back to my full happiness potential."

Then I went on exchange to her country for ½ year (which I where I am now, about to go home...).

The thing is, my stay here was not as good as I had hoped. She has grown a lot moodier and admits herself that she changed and she insists I changed too. Problems typically surfaced whenever I didn't have enough time to spend with her alone and with my full attention, either because I was socialising in my new student exchange environment or I was busy doing homework (had lots of tough classes this semester). We broke up briefly twice (for less than 24 hours), but got back together realising how much it hurt to be apart. Still, the relationship doesn't have the same spark any more.

One of the problems is that we come from different cultures. Apart from the language barrier, I can't see myself fully integrated into her country's culture (an Asian country) and she is really bad with socialising with people of white complexion, which most of my friends are.

For example, when we go out she is almost always totally silent around friendly (non-Asian) people, but has no problem communicating with other Asians - even thoroughly Americanised ones. It's not a language thing, she simply feels intimidated when speaking to non-Asians. When speaking to other Asians she has so much to say, expressing her opinion on everything, politics, music, etc. I always found this a bit strange, but it's definitely become worse after she moved back. She told me that she was like this before and changed a bit while on exchange, but now she's back to the same behaviour again.

She is a nice girl, very clever and quite funny, but these days we don't talk that much. When we see each other, it's mostly for physical comfort. There are no great stimulating discussions, not as much genuine fun in the relationship anymore.

We had a conversation a couple of days ago where I said that I didn't want to continue the relationship after I go home. She cried a bit and agreed and said that she had felt the same way. Then later we went home to her place, talked a bit more about it, both cried, and then we went to sleep. The next morning, waking up with her was wonderful and we had some food together before I went home. Later at night she called me and said she felt sad and I told her I felt the same. She talked about ""regretting the decision a bit"" to break up and I must admit I felt the same way at the time, but I didn't tell her.

Now is the day after and I don't feel any strong regret any more. If I rationalise it in my head I can see why breaking up is a good idea (it's hard to be long distance, we would never be able to fit into each other's lives), but I have a feeling that next time I see her, I might feel differently again, feel like it was the wrong decision. Before she called me yesterday I felt very alone and after talking to her this feeling disappeared.

I don't now if the feeling is a temporary thing or if am truly making a big mistake here. One of the things putting doubt in my mind is that we're not breaking up after a big issue, but rather after a long period of rationalisation - knowing that it's about to get long distance again. I keep telling myself it's the right decision, but at the same time, maybe the fact that I keep telling myself that is making me take the wrong decision. Am I?

Any comments are appreciated.

**TL;DR** My relationship is about to go long distance again. It's not as good as it was before and I am contemplating whether it is worth saving."
ordjf,0,2012-01-22,Almost two years and I can't get over what i've done,athrowawayyoudontsay,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ordjf/almost_two_years_and_i_cant_get_over_what_ive_done/,"I'm in my early twenties and almost two years ago I had an abortion. 3 years before this I left home and lived with my boyfriend. A bad relationship, we cheated on each other but parted amicably and I left him everything, inc. his inability to keep bills (sent money a few times and we both moved on) and returned to my parents'. I was reckless with my life (oddly not a partier, smoker, or drinker), non-committal to my priorities in life, hopeless at relationships, more carefree, until I got pregnant.

Things hit rock bottom. Some would call it karma but the guy who I'd cheated with (from before) and I got me pregnant. I had stupid moments of not wearing a condom but always took the pill immediately. As proof of potential psych. imbalance I'd wait anxiously hating the day I got pms for the pain but happy to know I was safe. This time I slipped in my stupidity and was 4 weeks pregnant. 2 weeks later I had a medical abortion and haven't been the same since.

4 months later I severed ties with the guy(too alike, and more reckless). I returned to school, worked hard on my grades, saw school counselors, made some friends, re-established myself with old friends, worked on projects like building a computer, aquarium, bike.  Today I volunteer, intern, bike and hike, slack a little but still work hard when i get to it.  I live but I can't get past it. My mother knows but I can't tell anyone in my family. I told an aunt and she blurted it in her mood swing with my other aunt when she was pregnant. It's staying buried but recent developments have made me an aunt to a cousin's (culture doesn't see second cousins) newborn that i didn't know of until he was born, possibly because the father isn't tied to the family.  

 I think my cousin is brave. She's smart and being older than me by a decade she's at the point of having kids, just maybe not financially ready or entirely mentally. she's got supportive parents, going to stand by what she's done and eventually she'll be fine. Me, I'm a pro-choice and I knew if I had a kid at my age it'd be hard to put things together even if my family is decently off. This kid would be stuck with two reckless parents, the possibility of experiencing the childhood of living alright but not being happy because of unstable relations, and a fail mom: me. I'd be uneducated, not under my own roof, financially unstable, and strained to make giving time, being caring and thoughtful first priority. Any children afterwards could be burdened by my choices now. I go to a transitional college and I see these people struggling with school, work, kids, themselves (still acting like kids): I can't put a kid through that. Further I'd be burdening my family when a child should be treasured, it's more than shame, it's hurting everyone. My choice was immediate, without hesitation, I stand by it (if this happens again I will kill myself) but that doesn't mean I don't regret it, or just see cells.

Did you know that an embryo at 6 weeks is a little smaller than the size of the tip of a pencil eraser? I look at this at times. It's important to say that I'm not religious but I try to be very open-minded when it comes to people's beliefs. My opinion is that so long as the belief is not harming someone else and for the most part, you keep it to yourself, you're golden. However because of this I feel like I've breached that. Before this, I'd say pro choice because there are people in terrible circumstances now I just think of what someone else would have to go through and wonder why no one thinks about that. I see a lot of children that need homes or better parents already. Everyday I look back and think of how I could have made that situation. How that baby could have been something more, my little love. There are good cases that come out, heck, my nephew would have had someone his age to play with, something I always wanted.

In the end, I can't forget, can't live beyond it. Someone's been trying to have a relationship with me but he feels like a kid and I'm scared with sex and he doesn't get it or even that we're not in a relationship. (says he does but still clings and I don't want to lose him as a person that I do care about) I'd rather not be in relationships at all for several years until i want a committed one that could progress to getting hitched.  I think I'd be a walking time bomb with it not being a priority, past issues, and not being a whole person, but it's something I crave (paradoxes). I live to make myself better beyond my slacker ways so I can have kids the way I see they should live be the person I'd want as my parent as a person even if I still slip up. To have caring parents that listen to what they have to say and make time for them without so much strain on working to only see them as problem children. It sounds to me putting it like that that's something worth living to, but it effects me down to the point of even keeping friends. You can't say 'you shouldn't care about what people think' until you've been in this situation. I have religious friends and they know because I was so afraid that I'd be like a stain on them (they're good respectable people). But even regular people, even anonymous online penpals I can't help thinking like I'm the stain. I feel like I'm lying to my father when I know this would really hurt him especially the way he carries on about my cousin think of other people like that. I function, but I feel like shit, don't know how to move on, and feel really really alone.

Sorry for the rant and thanks for reading. Beyond counseling, if you can think of anything I'd love to hear it.

tl;dr: I killed my kid, 6week abortion, pro-life, recovered and doing better with priorities, feel alone, don't know how to move on mentally and is effecting me socially. Oh, and I masturbate to vids and feel guilty. There, only time I'm ever bringing that out. If you're going to say something please make it critical, objective thinking and constructive."
or0hh,2,2012-01-21,Two questions about choice of school and relocating.,usernamecmon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/or0hh/two_questions_about_choice_of_school_and/,"Hey reddit,

I have recently switched majors to computer science from chemistry and will likely be completing a BS degree in about 3 years. I'm currently going to a very small lesser-known university and I was wondering If that mattered with respect to future job prospects. Will employers care that i did not attend a top 20 school? Will i be in good shape as long as i frequently work on decent side projects, internships, etc?

I'm also wondering about relocating. Once i graduate, will it be possible to move to a different state with relatively little difficulty? I'm not a huge fan of the city I'm living in now. 

Thanks

Also - sorry If this has been asked before, I searched briefly but had limited success."

Since I'm 5 years into my degree, I have taken all of my core engineering classes already. This spring, I'm taking classes that concentrate on my capstone, which is Mechanical Design. I would say that I am well rounded in regards to both general and mechanical engineering knowledge. I know the basics of both SolidWorks and Pro/E, but I'm taking an in-depth course in Pro/E this coming semester.

I have developed excellent team-working and interpersonal skills through the many engineering projects I've done. I have a hard work ethic as shown by my GPA and membership in Pi Tau Sigma (Mechanical Engineering Honor Society). 

I'm currently seeking a summer internship in the Bay Area so that I can apply my knowledge to a real world project/situation. I live in both San Jose and San Francisco, so I have no problems commuting around the bay. 

Resume is available upon request.

Hiring managers please feel free to contact me through this thread or the messaging system.

otb73,2,2012-01-23,Summer Job vs Internship,garruk66,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/otb73/summer_job_vs_internship/,"Hi. I am 26 year old 2nd year CS/chemistry major in Canada and I'm having difficulty deciding whether to keep my summer job as a forklift driver in a lumber yard or to find a programming internship.


Lumber Yard pros:
- more money and its stable (worked there seven years, am wanted for busy season) $16 for 44 hours per week plus 16 hours of overtime per week at $24
- I get a lot of exercise which I don't do normally (don't play sports, hardly ever go out, never work out)
- Its easy and there is a lot of freedom; no supervision. I can listen to podcasts during the night shift and on weekends.
- not much socializing (I am the epitome of Socially Awkward Penguin)

Lumber Yard cons:
- not much learning
- not meeting new people (I know I have to get over my SAPness, but I am scared to talk to others)
- I am embarrassed to still work there because I don't want to be seen as a ""lifer"". I started going to university six years ago (told everyone I wanted to become a doctor) but I am only in my second year because I failed two years, took two years off to save money, and lied about going to university for two years while I played WoW). I told everyone at work I am graduating this year.

Programming Internship pros:
-learning experience
-more interesting and fun; I want to become a developer

Programming Internship cons:
- Would it be very difficult to get in for me because I don't have any personal projects yet and I've never went to a job interview before and I am extremely shy and socially awkward?
-lower pay? I have 0 experience, but I took a lot of relevant math and CS courses. GPAs: semester 1 3.5, 2 3.5, 3 2.0, 4 3.0 estimate. I'm worried about starting a personal project because I'm taking six classes this semester (three with waived prerequisites) and I feel like I can't make spare time even though I know how important a project is on a resume.

I'm looking for any advice. Thank you."

I wanna get a degree in criminal justice from here so i can get experience and join law enforcement so i can get into Border Patrol.
But there's been so many varying opinions on what i should do, i dont know which one to go with, so here's a little background for you guys to help me pick which one is best:
I'm from Laredo, Texas, and i'm currently a senior at J.W. nixon high school. i am currently in the top 40% (199 out of 500) in my school, and my last SAT score was a 1420. 

Now here are the opinions i've heard and considered:

1. My parents, who dont want me to move away from my hometown (which i really want to leave though) want me to study my basics for 2 years, then go to TAMIU to get my degree for another 2 years.

2. A border patrol agent who told me that i should join the coast guard for 3 years, then join Border Patrol soon afterwards.

3. My older cousin, who recommended me to UTSA, because they have a good criminal justice program, because they have an internship program.

4. my same-age cousin who i get along well with, who's going to study medicine at UTSA, and i wanna live with him, so the financial expenses wont be so bad for living, since we'll go to the same college.

I dont know which one i should go with, help me out, r/UTSA?"

My freshman year of college, there was a big poker boom and I was doing extremely well at it. I dropped out to pursue a career as a professional poker player. I made a bunch of money, then went back to school and finished my degree in Computer Science.

I had an internship my last semester. When I graduated, I worked as a programmer at a small state department for a few months. I was then offered a job as a consultant at one of the big three in Chicago.

I worked there for about four months. The 60-80 hour weeks plus travel, along with the monotonous non-programming work burnt me out quickly. The company telling me to lie to clients didn't help either. After this, I went back to playing poker for a living if that is what a big corporate job was going to be.

It's been about a year now and I miss coding. It's extremely difficult for me to even land an interview with my huge resume gap. Honestly, I'm even willing to work for free for a while to get my foot back in the door. I have plenty of savings that can sustain me.

I wanted to ask you guys. I am learning about WCF and still trying to get my head around it the main concepts. What I ultimately need to do is use a form I created that will display some *endpoints* in a listbox, then allow the user to upload a selected file by clicking a button.

I was wondering if you guys know any good articles on this topic or have any tips. I watched the 4+ hours of training on Pluralsight.com, ""Introduction to WCF"" already.

If I have time, I'd love to really add that *wow* factor and add some drag&amp;drop functionality in outlook, where users can drag messages from the inbox into the form to upload with the WCF. But I'll have to do the first part before I can mess around with that.

	“So, since you’re starting your third round of chemotherapy, I was - Elizavita? Liz? Hello? Ya’ with me?” Dr. Chargaff looked up, his thick eyebrows with their poly-directional hairs having to move farther up his well tenured forehead to meet my gaze, which had also, a moment ago, been an observer of my spouse’s descent into yet another catatonic state of being.
	“She, uh, done this before?”
	“Yeah, they’ve been happening fairly regularly since the diagnosis. Usually they happen when she’s on the deck. Lately, I’ve just been ploppin’ down next to her, makein’ sure she’s OK, and, keeping an eye out for the grey whales. That time o’ year, ya know. She doesn’t stay in her mini-coma too long. They haven’t worried her, so I haven’t been worried either. But, this is the first episode outside of our home, which I’m aware of.”
	“So…how’s her pain management going…? That Dilaudid  I gave her--pretty powerful stuff.” Dr. Chargaff didn’t usually beat around the bush. Usually he would come right out and ask me anything. Most other oncologists that Liz and I had met with displayed an open condescension for my status as a leading bio-medical researcher, a cancer biologist, no less. First impression of Dr. Chargaff was his smile, namely that he had one, and, even though he hadn’t been in an operating room, or in any room messier than the cafeteria in decades, he still wore scrubs, with the obligatory stethoscope around his neck. All the previous Docs wore the requisite tailored Italian shirt with the equally impressive neck tie. Funny, how oncologists seemed so serious compared to other doctors. If any patients needed a little cheer weren’t they the terminally ill ones?
	“She hasn’t touched the stuff since the first bout of chemo. Gave her bad dreams, she said. I’ve had one or two, though: eat one of those with a whiskey neat, phew, I’m good for the weekend.” 
	“Dr. Avigail, I’m sure I don’t need to play advocate for your liver…” Said Dr. Chargaff with a diminutive, grim grin.
	“Yes, indeed you don’t.” My mind, via its abstract, yet highly pertinent association mechanism, took me back to all the research associates and interns who took so many smoke breaks throughout the day. What was it about studying the machinery of death that made one want to have a smoke so bad? 
	I stepped out from behind my wife to a crouching position beside Dr. Chargaff. I placed my hand on Liz’s shoulder and looked into her green eyes. Her new wig was really quite nice; hadn’t really noticed before, but she hadn’t had that hairstyle since we were engaged. It may be called the “bob” when the hair is neck length and curls in under the chin. Liz was still quite stunningly beautiful. 
	“LIZ, HONEY? ARE YOU IN THERE? YOO-HOO? IT’S ME, EZRA. COME OUT, COME OUT, WHEREVER YOU--“
	“Yeah, I’m here…”Liz’s pupils shrank down and refocused on my face. With a smile she said, ”You are a dork!”
	“Liz, you had me worried there.”
	“Well, Doc, my minds been a little preoccupied lately-sometimes just starts to go quiet for a moment or two. I’ve been running with it, sometimes I get sucked deeper than others. Ezra’s been able to get me out, right, honey?”
	“So far, so good.” 
	Dr. Chargaff walked back to his desk, slowly sat down in his overstuffed leather chair on wheels and intentionally inhaled through his remarkable nose. Looking at me, and then Liz, it seemed he was about to begin to speak, but instead he pushed down on his gold riveted armrests, and, one by one placed both New Balanced feet on his mahogany desk. Liz and I flashed a look at each other; must be bad (worse) news this time. We kinda already knew, though. Dr.Chargaff had one last bout of auto-eye massage, and finally spoke up. 
	“Liz, as I was saying before, I wanna keep you overnight, tonight, for observation when we start this new, and, well, more potent round of chemotherapy.” As I observed the doctor labor with the bad news, I felt a tinge of understanding of why those other doctors hadn’t respected me in my profession. Yes, we were both working to help people, to keep them alive, but never once did I have to communicate to a Petri dish, or even a lab rat, what was being presented to us right now. “This is the last weapon in our arsenal, Liz. If this doesn’t work…” 

	As I walked into my laboratory, I shook my traveler’s mug that previously had been full of coffee, confirming the need for another brew. I headed to the back of the lab, passing the shiny automatic coffee maker, and fired the Bunsen burner. I preferred my coffee made in a Chemex ; my lab assistants had considered it another useless quirk, until they tasted the coffee. Then, they considered it a useful quirk. With my whistling water kettle securely fastened by a clamp above the blue flame, I headed to my office. 
	“Dr. Avigail, our grant proposal was accepted!”
	“What?” This latest proposal was very important, and, no way was I going to let a false alarm dash my hopes against the rocks of denial--or worse--a status of “still pending.” I had written this plea for additional funding so the lab could purchase a neutrino scanning microscope. Previously, and for nearly a century, the highest resolution image was stonewalled at the size of an electron which was procured via an electron scanning or transmission electron microscope(EM) . I felt that the future success of my lab lay in the acceptance of my grant proposal. I had heard nothing for nearly six months from the deliberations committee. Normally, a grant would be accepted or denied within three months, but this was a proposal that was worth many, many times more than anything I had been a part of before. “Bethany, not a good time for joking around.“  I was starting to get a little excited. 
	“There was a manila envelope on the floor this morning when I got here. I’m sorry-but…but-I opened it right away…I couldn’t resist!” She already had donned a pair of safety glasses, and they were getting a little foggy. 
	“Well, where is it, my little researcher?” Beth was many things, but definitely not a practical joker, and she rarely said boo to me before lunch. Beth pulled the envelope out from behind her back, and, as she did so, my water, with the Bunsen burner’s inducement, let me know the enthalpic phase change had occurred and I could finally re-up. I poured the first round of hot water into the open, superior end of the hourglass that was filled with brown gold, watched to make sure the air was able to escape upwards through the pour channel so that the coffee could flow downwards and, with a heavy and expectant sigh, pulled out the documents. To acquire a neutrino microscope would mean the powers that be consider my lab worthy of an $8.5 million check. I scanned the letter, zooming past the first couple of needless paragraphs. We were getting the microscope. I dropped the letter on the floor and embraced Bethany; a true scientist, Bethany was not accustomed to communicating or recognizing human emotion, but, she did hug back.

	 Watching the high-definition monitor that was hooked up to the neutrino microscope, for the first time I saw cellular and molecular activities, in vivo , of a mouse that was in terminal stage cancer. I had set the resolution to a setting only tenfold greater than the standard EM would provide; meaning that one epithelial cell  in the mouse was several thousand times larger than the field. The cancer was literally marching from organ to organ. Stunned, hunched over while sitting on my wheeled lab stool, I watched a cancerous cell destroy, one by one, receptors on the membrane of healthy cells. I thought back to my teenage fascination with the Borg , an alien life form from a popular TV show that demanded assimilation; my right brain protested via issuance of a nerd alert. I couldn’t help but chuckle. I had always owned my dorkdom. The malignant cell was seeking out and destroying receptors on the cellular membrane of the healthy cells that helped control apoptosis.  It was like I was the first person to view an epic battle in real time, compared to everyone before me who had only been able to try and piece together the manner in which the battle was fought, using only smoldering tanks and shrapnel coated craters. On the monitor, the cancerous tumor grew in size and legion. Looking at the mouse, which was in nylon restraints under the neutrino detector lens, and then back to the monitor, I couldn’t help but imagine my wife under the same lens, only temporarily removed from the destiny of the mouse.

REDACTED TITLE

Police Foundation

1201 Connecticut Avenue, NW

Washington, DC 20036


Dear REDACTED, 

I am excited to be applying for an internship at The Police Foundation. I am currently a junior at the REDACTED University, working towards my B.A. in Criminal Justice and B.S. in Physics. Due to my unique skillset I believe I would be a valuable asset to the Police Foundation as an intern.


Through my studies in criminal justice, I have gained a background in various aspects of the field and would love the opportunity to broaden my knowledge and gain real-world experience in the workforce. I have an especially in-depth knowledge of the subject of mass imprisonment through my research and work on the topic with Professor REDACTED. Through this work I have learned how to successfully conduct meaningful research, a skill, which I believe will be invaluable for this position. Although the focus of Professor REDACTED’s research is the effect of mass imprisonment on prisoners, I have also learned a great deal about the people working in the field and would love to learn more about the police and related personnel by working at the Police Foundation.   

I also believe that my international background has given me a unique perspective on the US Justice System, and would personally be interested to learn how the systems compare on a more detailed level. 

I am highly organized, with meticulous attention to detail, which is particularly advantageous when conducting researchm. When I am interested in a subject, I immerse myself in researching the topic and its context. Even when I am not actively engaged directly in work, I subconsciously commit my focus to the job.

I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration. 


Sincerely, 

REDACTED

About that, I'm not sure. I've just been contemplating this for a while now and I don't think people in real life would take me seriously.

First things first, let me tell you about myself. I'm a sophomore attending a state college in the Midwest, trying to attain a B.S. in Computer Science. I received a 3.375 GPA my first semester of college - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. I consequently told myself that, each semester, I would do a little better than before.

Time passed, and in Spring '11 I received a 3.714. In Fall '11, I received my first 4.0. My current cumulative is a 3.674. I started joining different clubs as well, and I'm currently involved in 4 organizations. I have been participating in a leadership program, I'm the secretary of my fraternity, I'm the PR chairman for a large student-led philanthropy event, and a member of the Association of Computing Machinery as well as being a full-time student. I felt pretty successful for a while until some recent events.

A little more than a week ago, I scored an interview with Microsoft about 10 miles away through some connections with some alumni. I went to my interview, and it wasn't at all what I expected. The gist of it was that they told me all about what kind of work they did, but they told me I should look into getting a summer internship there. I was frustrated and worried - *Why did they call me in for an interview if they told me to apply for a summer internship? Did I fuck up? If they're telling me about their program, doesn't that still interested in hiring me?* To be honest, it's really burning me up. I kind of did break down at one point; I'm not really that good at interviews. I was tripping all over my words, and I admitted it to my first interviewer. Yes, I know, huge mistake - **I don't want to hear any of that.** But it's a problem I have, and I **will** work on it, trust me. I felt like I had to apologize for my lack of eloquence. 

But that's not all. I live in a fraternity house with quite a few members members, and a large slew of them recently got internships at Bobcat. I'm fairly sure that I have a better resume than most of the people who were hired, knowing them personally. They had the same connections as I did, but they succeeded. This is what really had me hanging by the throat. Was I not good enough? What could I do to be better?

And the thing that irritates me the most is that about half of these people are complaining about their jobs. Why they complain is beyond me. I'm not sure if it's for attention, if they're bragging, or if they really do hate their job, but for 16 dollars an hour, a hard-working student like me would excitedly embrace that opportunity.

But that's just the beginning of the problem. I really would like to get a summer internship so I don't have to work at the high-paced, stressful seasonal concession stand job in the summer. Thing is, I don't know where to start. I went to the career center at my university, and they showed me different ways I can apply for internships. Unfortunately, the university didn't have any job placement options. The whole ""searching for an internship"" part is just so foreign to me.

Some people have told me that I should be searching for internships with a mental attitude that says ""I can't fail. I will get this job, and there's nothing that can stop me."" But my brain doesn't work like that. My brain is hard-wired to think realistically. I realize that there are chances of success and failure, and there's nothing I can to to shed that from my current line of thinking.

So, I'm lost, Reddit. Any advice you can give me, any at all, I would appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.

I try hard, I really do, but I fail in the process - and that's what I'm worried about. "

otwm7,0,2012-01-23,Drug Testing Rage (No Comic),[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/otwm7/drug_testing_rage_no_comic/,"So last summer I had an awesome internship at a company that I'd like to work for when I graduate. I got paid well and enjoyed the work. I did a great job over the summer and was invited to intern there again this summer. 

In October my manager emailed me asking if I was still interested and saying that she would start the rehiring process. I quit smoking that day. Finally 3 months later I get the official job offer. Last year I had to take a drug test a few days after the official offer. I was so stoked that I would be able to smoke again in a few days that I went out and bought a new bong and a fat ass sack of bud. I spent like $350 on that stuff.

Today I accepted the offer and was told by HR that I will have to take a drug test a *few weeks before my start date*. I start in about 3.5 months so that could be anytime after about 2 months from now. Last year the piss test happened in March, but that is also when I received the job offer.

I get extremely paranoid and stressed out when it comes to drug testing and always play it as safe as possible so I am going to continue abstaining until the piss test. I may indulge once this weekend just to try out my new bong though.

On one hand I am stoked that I get to work there again this summer and I got a 10% pay raise. On the other hand I am irate about drug testing. I am not so much mad at the company as it has become a norm in society and I believe it might be required for them to get insurance and what not. I am pissed off that Marijuana is **STILL** fucking illegal in the USA. I smoked weed every fucking day after work last summer and they fucking loved me...

Not really looking for any advice, just venting."

I'm a computer science student who is closer to a degree in philosophy (which I'm much more interested in studying). Lately I've been sort of anxious about the amount of time and money I feel like I'm wasting in school for CS with no satisfaction. I love working in programming and solving problems, but the program at my University has me entirely jaded about the going to school for it. I'm a software dev. intern for a small company right now which employs two college drop-outs in the IT department of about 10 people. (One in systems and one in software). One of those 10 is also a college grad with a humanities degree, although he is going to grad school for comp sci currently.

I'm not sure how much of an anomaly my company is in this regard, since it's the only one I've worked for, so I'm wondering if anyone has stories/info about their own workplace.

I'm leaning toward finishing my Philosophy degree, feeling more fulfilled with school, and seeing where it takes me. Perhaps this company will keep me on if they feel I've been doing a good job, or perhaps they will let me go if I'm less of a ""potential hire"" for the future? However, they're also looking to expand so maybe they'd be excited to see me graduate sooner? Out of the two interns they employ, they often give me the more challenging, project-oriented problems.

Anyway, I'm not looking for advice regarding my current employment situation, as obviously (whatever I decide) I'd have to talk things through with them to know for sure what things would be like there. But I'd like to know what you guys think about hiring/working with someone with a degree in non-CS, and my chances of pursuing a career in CS if I decide to finish up my humanities degree instead."

I recently graduated with a degree in Environmental Science, which included a GIS certificate.  I managed to land an internship with a state agency doing GIS work, but unfortunately it hasn't presented many learning opportunities to this point (most of my tasks involve digitizing data; really simple stuff that anyone could be shown how to do in a few minutes).  I've realized I need to take it upon myself to learn some new skills if I want to turn this into a career, but I have no idea where to begin.

One of my biggest questions is (and this may be a dumb one) - what can I actually DO with GIS?  My college coursework was pretty much limited to making maps, and all my work experience has basically just been digitizing data for the use of others.  To make this question simpler, say I want to work with GIS but I also want to stay in the environmental field.  What kind of job could I get, and what kind of projects might I work on?

My other problem, somewhat tied with the first, comes from my observation that every GIS job seems to have different requirements beyond simple knowledge of GIS.  Going back to my previous question, in such a position as what I'm looking for, what kind of skills might be necessary for me to be a valuable member of a company?  To make answering this a bit easier, here's a general list of what I know and don't know:

* Basic knowledge of ArcGIS, including: digitizing files, editing data, very limited experience working with spatial, network, and 3d analyst, preparation of maps, some familiarity with some of the data management tools, and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head.

* I don't know Python.  How important is it to learn this?

* I have no database management skills.  I've started poking around with Access just to develop some kind of experience, but nothing beyond that.

* I don't know any programming languages, although I'm not at all afraid to learn some (as a kid I taught myself basic HTML for fun; I'm sure if it were necessary I could learn VBA or C).



I've poked around ESRI's site and looked at some of their training resources, but I wasn't sure which would be useful to me (plus I'm certainly not going to pay for any unless I'm sure I'll get something valuable from it).  I feel if I had a better understanding of what I should know, it would make learning those skills a lot easier for me. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"
owob5,4,2012-01-25,Some facts about the boycott of Hollywood,Inuma,boycotthollywood,https://www.reddit.com/r/boycotthollywood/comments/owob5/some_facts_about_the_boycott_of_hollywood/,"Hello folks.  This is Inuma of the Reddit Research team.  I'm talking today about the effectiveness of a boycott and how you might be able to make this far more effective.

Let's be very clear here. I enjoy hearing people try to find ways to take down the multiheaded hydra of Hollywood, but we need ways that are effective to the cause. So I'll explain why a general boycott is not effective and try to help people find ways that might bring the movement to better ways to make a statement.

1)  **Boycotting and asking for personal information is a no-no.** We don't know who will maintain the boycott and there have already been areas where I don't believe this movement won't be effective.  For example, Batman will *always* make money.  Anyone boycotting Batman is missing out on a shared experience.  So saying ""I'm going to boycott for X days"" is useless when people can either opt out or pirate and come to the same effect.  If you don't go to the movie theater, what else can you do?  Pirate?  Not an option here.  We're looking to prove a point and this comes from allowing people to enjoy their Saturday nights.  Remember, Hollywood is a lot bigger and harder to hit than GoDaddy.  Yes, they're dying slowly from making bad movies. But we don't need to check up on people to boycott.  Just send them in a new direction for their movie fix.  Better yet, let's get the movie theaters involved if possible.  Find independent theaters that might be able to get away from the major studios and support them.  Possible area of improvement is finding a way to fund new theaters that compete with Imax and Cinemax.  Remember, indies are your friends.

2) **Hollywood has a lot of licensors, making the boycott ineffective.**  Think about this.  Disney owns ESPN and gets money from sports all the time.  All of the major studios make money from Netflix and the RIAA makes money from Spotify and their own business dealings.  Do you think not spending $10 on a movie ticket will directly hurt their income?  Suggestion: Start cable cutting.  The transition to pure internet might hurt a little, but you have far more variety of content online and this hurt the money from Hollywood the most.

3) **Economics will hurt Hollywood far more than a boycott.**  Why has no one ever put up VODO.com as a viable alternative to piracy?  How about Jamendo music?  Where is the education campaign of telling people ""let's opt for the viable alternatives?""  These may work far better.  Starve Hollywood so it dies that much quicker instead of trying to find a quick solution.  We're in this for the long haul.  Let's find the alternatives that show Hollywood how it's done.

4) **Expose the problems of Hollywood.**  Hollywood Accounting hurts artists.  Piracy doesn't make a lot of money.  The regulatory capture of ICE and the MPAA equates to class welfare.  Copyright laws are supposed to benefit the public.  The public doesn't have enough freedom fighters in the White House.  The CEOs are paid so much money despite piracy, that their workers starve.  Copyright = regulatory capture.  Hollywood has a problem paying interns.  For every $1 spent lobbying, the business gains $220 in tax savings.  The IRS needs to audit all of Hollywood.  There's plenty of ideas.  Hamper and harry our politicians to continuously advance and pressure Hollywood and keep them off balance.  That's the aim of the game.  They have the law, we have the power.

5)  **Target the weakest links**.  I know, it seems hard to go after Hollywood and more people want to fight that.  But it's the politicians that have to listen to us, not Hollywood.  We shouldn't stop at SOPA or PIPA.  We should be pressuring those same politicians to listen to a Reddit made proposal or the proposals of others.  Politicians will always be the weakest link.  Here, they HAVE to listen because the proposals for better dealings in copyright law are ours to demand.

For now, those are the main issues.  If there needs to be more, I can add here as need be.  "

Am I lazy and not getting how much one can pick up if you really live Ruby for a month?

I currently live around Seattle with my parents, but would also be more than willing to relocate to Portland, Oregon should an opportunity arise there.

Little did I know there would be a guest speaker there telling me about the greatest summer internship a human being going to college could possibly acquire. I could make thousands of dollars in a single summer AND get invaluable experience that would help me succeed in my future endeavors. [Seems like the perfect opportunity, right?](http://troll.me/images/futurama-fry/seems-legit.jpg) That's what I thought too.

Anyways, they hand out these little sheets of paper to the whole lecture hall, and me, being the driven individual I am, quickly filled it out and passed it to the left ([not the right](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtLONl4cNc)). It asked for some simple things like my name, my major, my year, my phone number, if I had a car, where I would be living in the summer. I figured I might have to do some driving and what not, I was okay with this.

A few nights later I'm surfing with my bro on Counter Strike, and I get this phone call from a guy who asked if I was still interested in the internship and would like to ask me a few basic questions. Being the college freshmen I am, I eagerly answered all of his questions. He asked me things like what am I going to do in the future, what field would it be in, why I would be a good candidate for this internship, etc. He then told me that I was qualified to attend one of the ""info sessions"" which would be held the next day. Three things stuck out about this phone call now that I think about it; first, I barely gave him any information about myself for him to say that I was ""qualified"" to attend an info session, second, why is he calling me at 9 PM the night before to question me and inform me of a meeting the next day, and lastly, why am I meeting up for this ""info session"" at the Bruin Bear not at the Career Center or some other legit place like that. Oh and then at the end of the phone call he asks me to promise him that I will show up. I swear he asked me this at least 4 times. Either way, I didn't give this any thought at the time.

The time for the info session rolls around and I put on my spiffy pant-shirt combo and head over to the bear. I find him because he told me he was going to be standing there with a white binder (this screams [legit](http://themavesite.com/TMS-Pictures/Epic/SeemsLegitToMe.jpg) at me). We end up walking to Ackerman Union (a quieter place to talk) with 2 other students who did the same thing as me to have the ""info session"". Now that I look back on this, its sketchy as fuck, but none of the clues registered or clicked in my eager little head. We sit down and again start talking about our future goals, life plans, and things of that nature. I go with the flow and like anyone who's giving their first interview in college, I'm [bullshitting left and right](http://i736.photobucket.com/albums/xx6/Frozenith/Everywhere%20MEME/EverywhereMEME-Bullshit.jpg). I'm wasn't lying about anything I did of course, but I start pulling words out my ass that I've only ever ~~used~~ seen once before in my life. But that's besides the point. 

Out of the three of us, I end up getting picked to go to this ""first interview"". I was absolutely ecstatic. I walked out of there like a [fucking BOSS](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly4gtaMq2l1qfmplv.gif). I get back and somehow only tell a few special people about it.

TL;DR version:

For years Sashi has had excruciating in her abdomen, but doctors have only recently figured out what's wrong. She has large (LARGE) cysts growing around her ovaries which is affecting multiple internal organs. She is dying and needs a surgery which will cost thousands of dollars. Her friends have set up a Tumblr account where you can learn more and perhaps even donate a couple dollars. http://donateforsashi.tumblr.com

From the website: 

“Ever since she was a kid, she’s been suffering from chronic pain on her abdomen, getting worse over the years, getting fucked over by doctors who dis-diagnosed her or flat out told her she was “lying” about her pain just to get pain killers.
After years of awful symptoms, trying to figure out whats wrong, ER visits when she couldn’t bear with the pain anymore, having to rush everytime to the hospital, she has finally been diagnosed with a severe case of Endometriosis, which requires a big surgery that also requires to remove her ovaries that are practically all covered in several tumors the size of big oranges, even she feels the stiffness on her tummy.
Endometriosis consists in cysts (in her case of 8cm) growing around her ovaries and affecting intestines and several organs.
Up-to date, she’s 24, had to quit her job (and therefore having no insurance) because she can barely move anymore. She has developed several other side problems from this disease, she can’t eat because there’s literally no room in her intern organs to proceed any food anymore.
As much as it hurts to type down and as tears well up in my eyes,
She’s dying.
She’s been slowly dying in front of my eyes for the past years of fighting.
After trying several times to get medi-cal, today she got denial again because according to the government she doesn’t count as a “disabled” person.
saving her life is up to a surgery that would cost thousands of dollars, I am uncertain exactly how much, I’m researching that right now, been researching all night, trying to find out some solutions; but if she finally could afford this surgery she’d be able to…start to live again.
Though, is sweet of the person above me that talked about donations, Sashi herself is reluctant of donations because the surgery is really, really expensive and its true, it would require a LOT of work/donations to get to any near goal. 
I don’t want her to die and keep going through this, I would do anything that is in my hands to help her. To prove her wrong, to show her we care. I am writing this against her will because she would not want to sound “needy” or calling for attention for anyone. she’s always willing to help others with their problems, but she’s too fucking nice to ask for help for herself, she feels uncomfortable with this stuff. But, still. I need to write this. And its why she needs to keep on living, because she doesn’t deserve this at all, she’s the last person I know that would deserve this.
Can you take a minute to reblog, spread the word, and help us with any information you may have on some insurance or coverage she could get (medi-cal isn’t an option anymore, she’s been denied many times) maybe some of you know someone, or know about this stuff, hell, maybe there are some doctors out here. Maybe some answers are out there. Is worth a try, anything you can help her with.”

The stated reason:
""Our business holds very firm on our GPA standard. At this time, you are ineligible to join [comapny] for a summer internship opportunity this summer. I wish you the best of luck in your remaining academic semesters.""

I made it very clear what my GPA was at the time of the interview and made a note to remind him that it was not to the company's standard. He informed me that my references at the company spoke very highly of me and that it shouldn't be a problem. 

I've turned down other jobs and interviews for this offer and now it's gone. Is there anything I can/should do?"

I'm skilled with HTML, CSS, PHP, etc. and I can write a mean bit of Javascript code (including jQuery).  I also come from a background of knowing C/C++, Python, etc. so I have a rock-solid foundation with OO and programming in general that makes me a solid candidate and has helped immensely with picking up PHP and Classic ASP.

I know that most people here say there's not much difference between Macs and PCs, but I just want some clarification. 

I got to my senior portfolio class a little early today, and I was talking to my professor about how after graduation in May I will most likely be buying a new laptop. She automatically assumed I would be buying a Mac, and when I told her I was leaning towards PC (I've always just been more of a PC person) she went on a rant about how it will put me at a major disadvantage when applying for design jobs, and how some students didn't get offered internship positions because they weren't familiar with the Mac OS. Now, at school we use Macs, so I do know my way around them, I'm just a lot more partial to PCs. Any insight?

(I also posted this in AskReddit but didn't get any responses so I figured I'd try here)

Thanks in advance :)

Edit: Wow, I did not expect to get this much feedback! You guys have definitely given me a lot to think about. I'm not planning on buying a laptop until after graduation, so I have a few months to think about it. For now I'll just try to spend some more time using the school's Macs for day-to-day things. That way I'll be able to get a better feel for what it would be like if that was the main OS I was using. Thanks again guys, you're the best!"

He is an Iraq war veteran (3 tours) which has resulted in some serious PTSD, anti-sociality, and a drinking problem, he also has Asperger's syndrome. I don't consider him an alcoholic because 1) I'm not an impartial expert and 2) he drinks no more than twice a week. But when he does drink, he gets fall over sloppy drunk. He has 3 boys ranging from 9 months to 5 years old. He and his family are living with my gracious parents but his wife left 2 weeks ago with the youngest child because of a few days of intense fighting that stemmed from him getting laid off. He hasn't really been able to hold down a job for the past year since he was basically fired from the military (he was given an honorable discharge before his contract was up, and the military refused to pay some of his discharge benefits, my understanding is he fucked up but not enough for a dishonorable discharge). His wife is manipulative, bullies him, and what I like to call a psychopath. My brother has been very stressed doing some things to prepare for actually getting a job but I've noticed first hand (I'm home on break from uni) and hasn't really been motivated. He took his 2.5 year old to a friends house tonight, he left around 8:30 because usually the toddler is asleep and was hoping a car ride would put him out. Me and my parents assumed he would come home once the kid was asleep but went to this certain friend's house. For some reason I haven't been able to sleep all night when my brother's car pulls in the driveway at 2:30, I immediately notice his friend is driving. My brother stammers out of the car more drunk than I've seen him since the weekend before he left for his 1st tour. I let his friend bring the sleeping kid inside and put to bed, and my brother passed out on his bed. I immediately took his friend outside and yelled at him for being an enabler and that I said to him that ""if you were a true friend you would have sent him home sober, not brought him home drunk, how the fuck is he going to get (His oldest son) to school tomorrow morning if you have his fucking car? You realize he's heading for a custody battle soon, right? It takes one piece of fucking evidence to ruin a whole argument (I'm in law school so I know a thing or two) and if the court thinks my brother is alcoholic I will never see my nephews again"" So to make this even longer I wrote my brother this letter since I'm heading back to school tomorrow morning, let me know what you think. My parents are meeting with a lawyer tomorrow to discuss the most appropriate legal route to take because the children aren't in any harm right now.

-(Brother)
I realized years ago that snitching on you didn't stop you from making bad decisions, I'm not going to start now. The one word that comes to mind from what I saw last night is disappointment. I'm disappointed that you are so incapable of dealing with your issues that you get stupid drunk. I'll never comprehend what you've been through or what you are going through, I wish you were strong enough to NOT resort to alcohol. Mom, Dad, (our sister) &amp; I have always been here for you, but you refuse to be okay with it (I have no idea how to express what I'm trying to convey here, but w/e wrote it in ink). You need to stop convincing yourself that things will work out on their own. Fucking take control, grab it like a life saving rope as you fall off a cliff, cause that's what is happening. Mom &amp; Dad have thrown you a great rescue rope but you have to work for it. Grab the self-control to be a real man and not drink your problems. You need to make the hard choices everyday, I know you're capable. You need to prepare everyday like you are fighting for custody of your three boys, that day is inevitable. It takes mountains of substantial evidence, not Mom &amp; Dad's vouching, to convince a court you are THE better parent. It takes once incident to undermine any evidence you have. You might think I have no idea what I'm talking about or how you feel or I can't understand what you're going through and you're right, but saying so is distracting yourself from what you need to do. I can't try to help you by snitching, but I REFUSE to ""protect"" you if it puts my nephews any closer to not seeing me again. I suggest you find better friends who won't enable piss poor decisions. A real friend sends you home sober. I want nothing more than to see you provide a great life for your boys, but you can't do it with that cunt(pardon the language) wife of yours, and you can't get rid of her AND keep the boys if you fuck up. Getting laid off wasn't your fault, but what happens NEXT IS. I have nothing but love for you (Brother), it's why I decided not to work this break (I was going to work for the company that took me on as an intern this past summer) to help you with the boys, I hope it's the last favor you never asked for. I wish I was man enough to say all this to your face, but your behavior lately has made it clear that you can't be pushed. It's a frustrating paradox that Mom, Dad &amp; I can't push you because it's our instinct to do so when you are in this time of need. When you divorce that parasite &amp; need me to testify in your favor, I want to look in any lawyer's face, especially my own, and unequivocally tell them you never made a bad choice after January 25th, 2012, and that your sons need to be with you and will be fine if it is only you. Do me a favor and act like you didn't read this around me until I know the time is right, I hope I get to do so sooner than later.

Also, put this letter somewhere your wife won't find, like a high shelf, or in a book. (She's super short, and super dumb)

Love-(Me)"

First draft, would greatly appreciate the proof reading!",MoMoFoSho,Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/oxadv/my_application_to_my_schools_honors_program_first/,"**Promt:***	Explain why you feel you would be a good asset for the UNF Honors Program*

Thank you in advance!

**First Draft**

Experiences are what make us who we are. The experiences we have teach us our values and customs. I believe that the experiences I had have prepared me for the affairs that will come my way. One program I would like to be a part of is University of North Florida’s Honors Program. I believe that I will benefit from the program through the exclusive classes available to Honors Students and the duties that will be presented to me. I believe that I will make a quality addition to UNF’s Honors Program for the following reasons. 

One of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had so far was when I volunteered as Technical Director for my high school’s drama program. The Technical Director has duties such as keeping schedules, managing people, and fulfilling the director and producer’s visions for the production. As Technical Director, I oversaw everything during production that was behind the scenes. I motivated and assigned people to projects. Being able to manage these people effectively to fit our tight schedule took leadership. I also gained practice in teamwork by helping crews accomplish tasks such as building a platform, painting a set piece, or ironing costumes. 

As Technical Director, a lot of issues fell on my shoulders. I needed to be quick on my feet and have a sharp mind to fix problems. These instances where I managed crises tested my critical thinking and problem solving skills. Once during production, we had used the last of our budget for building the set, but we needed at least $150 worth of lumber. I found a local lumber dealer and made an arrangement that he would trade us some lumber for ad space in our play’s program. There was also an issue where our costume mistress was threatening to quit the production and take all of the male costumes she made home with her. I presented at the parent booster meeting our need for donations, and even though our costume mistress didn’t leave, we received enough donations to add another costume change between scenes. 

A successful person starts any job, assignment, project, or resolution with determination, devotion, and a sense of enthusiasm. This can be reflected in my academic experiences at UNF. After I toured the campus with my father in August of 2010, I heard that there was a deadline about 2 weeks later to have my application reviewed and find out if I was accepted the following October. I gathered what I needed and ordered my transcripts by the application deadline. On October 2nd, I received my admission decision, I had been invited to start the upcoming summer, but if I brought my overall high school GPA up, I could change my start date to the fall instead. I finished my first semester of my Senior Year with six As and one B. This improvement allowed me to change my start date to the fall, and I continued to do extremely well in my classes during my second semester also. 
This determination still hasn’t faltered now that I am actually taking college level classes. I completed my first semester with a 3.7 GPA. My enthusiasm hasn’t faded either. It’s the beginning of my second semester and I walk into every class eager to learn what my professor has to offer next. I look forward to the classes that I will take next fall, and the spring after that. Thanks to this zeal, I am able to complete homework easily for near perfect grades.  

I recently declared my major in Health Administration. Before declaring, I thought I wanted a degree in business, but I knew that I wanted to work in healthcare, but didn’t know how to without taking up nursing. My mother was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer September 2009. I wouldn’t be able to count the number of times I witnessed her experiences with the health care system. I realized that there was someone behind the hospital and insurance companies that helped my mom gain her health back, and I decided that that’s the job I want. My dream job would to become a Hospital Administrator. I want to be able to manage doctors and procedures most effectively to provide a comfortable experience for patients on their road to recovery. To reach my goals, I look forward to completing internships that will let me apply skills to a job I want to make a career. I also have applied to live in the Brooks College of Health Living Learning Community for next school year. Through the living learning community, I hope to meet professionals in my field who will give me insight and advice for my advancement. I will also be in pursuit of a Leadership Certificate from the Institute of Values from UNF. I have not taken Introduction to Leadership yet, but plan to this coming fall to begin my documentation of all my leadership experiences.  

University of North Florida’s Honors Program will help me polish and develop the skills I have and I expect to learn additional talents also. I am an earnest applicant who wants to grow and develop within my university. The experiences and goals I’ve written about show why I would make a good asset to the program. Lydia Maria Child, a woman’s rights activist of the 1800’s, once said, “Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.” I believe in myself, and I know that I will prosper at University of North Florida, and will prosper in University of North Florida’s Honors Program.

As a short side quest in completing the prerequisites for entry into the grad program, I'll be receiving a [computer programming certificate](http://engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/PS/CPC.html) from the school.  I am thinking it will be a good time to get out of my field and into something related to CS once I get the cert.

I'll still be in school though, and the top companies seem to be looking specifically for new grads for their FT positions.  If I want to get into CS before I graduate, am I going to have to get an internship?  I have a family.  This would involve quitting my job for a temp position."

I'm fucking up my life.  I made a very good friend on New Years and we've been immediate great buds ever since, playing music, small trips, hanging out with my friends, challenging him to tetris at a local dive, helpin' each other out. I care about him very much but...you know. My drinking is miserable for everyone but me and whoever else is drinking. Last night I accused him of just wanting to hang out with me to hang out with my friends, *that he was bored and had nothing better to do*, saying ""no one actually likes me and i know it, it's okay, it's normal"" etc. He finally got angry and left. Silently angry, chucked his water cup in the yard. Didn't want to see him angry, it took some function out of my throat and chest like a punch, just wanted him to want to leave me.

Last week after I drank til I probably should have thrown up (and I was very regretful and apologetic for ruining the night and a movie,) I think we shook or pinky promised on being ""no drinking buddies"" for 4 days at least and I only lasted one. night.  Yeah.  But I feel like I totally have excuses is the worst. Then last night...his texts say ""Give up the alcohol, that's the only times I've ever not liked you"" ...tells me it makes me bratty, confusing, manipulative, expecting, unpleasant (ow ow) ""and I'd never think of you that way any other time"" ... ""i can't understand a drunk, nor do I want to... ugly, ugly... I will never have that in my life again...if you want to be with me give it up, there's no way around it""

So I'll stop, that's probably more than enough to make it clear that my heart is in the gutter right now. I feel so desperate to prove to him, anything to him...**I feel like I've blown it and I should just leave him the fuck alone.**  I wanted him away from me last night because I didn't even want him to come over and see me like that in the first place, but he did, and stayed around hanging out.  I don't see why he ever did in the first place, what my life is and the huge problems I deal with are fucking obvious.

I want to go over to his house but damn maybe I shouldn't do that.  His last text let me know he was turning his phone off for awhile and goodbye.  **I feel like throwing up from the anxiety that the sudden realization of what's happened creates.  I'm so sorry, but I have no one left to say I'm sorry to.** And even now you guys, I just wanna walk down the road and get some wine or beer because this sucks, but I won't, I'm trapping myself in my room. I'm very useless.

There's a photobooth snapshot on my computer from last night of me messing around with him, trying to get his picture with me.  It's just me in blurry laughter trying and failing miserably to pull him back over in front of the computer.  First and probably last photo and he's not even in it.

What should I do? What can I say? What the fuck can I do??? Should I leave it all alone and walk away? I could do that if it's the good thing. I didn't even drink all summer and then bam, I moved back to my college town from an internship and in with my alcoholic (now ex-) boyfriend. Now what the fuck is even...I don't...I...would really like any advice.


**tl;dr** new friend doesn't drink like other friends, I really like and respect this new friend, I've fucked up and acted like a tragic cunt.


EDIT: I'm 24 and graduated and frustrated with where I'm going, that I'm a waitress, life things.  He's 21 and wiser and calmer than me, and all-around sweet and genuine and good-natured. And I really just wanted to have positive encouraging effects on him, not make him miserable."

Behold, [my student loan debt.](http://i.imgur.com/NK6EN.jpg) 

I do not have to repay the full amount of my loans. I can either [A](http://studentaid.ed.gov/students/attachments/siteresources/LoanForgivenessv5_051511.pdf), work in a public service sector for a period of 10 years during which I will be repaying my loans but after which the remainder of my student loans will be cancelled. Or, option [B](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/who-qualifies-for-obamas-10-student-loan-payment-cap/247470/), pay 10% of my income for the next 20 years, after which the remainder of my loans will be cancelled. Actually there’s an option [C](http://nhsc.hrsa.gov/loanrepayment/index.html), which will repay ‘x’ amount of my loans per ‘y’ years of service in an underserved area. 


Assuming option B: Over the next 20 years my income will probably begin around 50k and make its way up to 70k. Let’s average and say 60k. $60,000*10%= $6000 per year. Multiply that 6k over the following 20 years and I’ll end up repaying approximately $120,000 (whether I owe $170k or $200k). So, why not max out my loans over the next year? 


I still have an internship year remaining, during which I am considered a full time student. I can take out loans during this time—unsubsidized, subsidized, and PLUS loans. It appears that there would be no repercussions (other than potentially affecting my credit) to taking out the maximum amount of loans during this time. I do not need this money, as I will be receiving a stipend of approximately 22k. However, I could take out loans and begin a retirement fund, purchase a much needed car, to simply retain the funds for an emergency, etc.

ozelm,2,2012-01-27,Credit card spending amount &amp; credit score?,chulk90,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ozelm/credit_card_spending_amount_credit_score/,"Hi everyone,

I'm an undergraduate student who has net income *(income from summer internship and scholarships - taxes, housing and school)* of ~$9,400 per year. I recently opened a new [Bank of America secured credit card](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/marketingdetail.action?context_id=marketing_detail&amp;offer_id=ECOMM0908AYB00406800151520EN000|2072218|6E) to start building up my credit score. 

Here's a question that I've been wondering for quite a while: is there any relationship between my credit score and my credit card bill? In other words, will I be able to accumulate more credit score if I spend more on my credit card? 

Like many other financial institutions, Bank of America gives a tiny bit of interest for using their debit card. It's small but seems to be a better one than WorldPoints that I can accumulate through the credit card. So I'm considering using my debit card if there's no relationship between my credit score and my credit card bill. If it matters, I'll potentially be using my credit card for all my purchases.

Thank You!"

TwoX, today I got out of counseling, and I can't stop smiling. In December of 2010, I was raped. It wasn't a violent rape, and I thought I was fine. In the summer of 2011, I was in a car accident. And almost like the truck hit me, so did the trauma of the rape. 

I would wake up screaming in the middle of the night, I had terrible nightmares, and would be so scared sometimes that I would be sweating and shaking/crying until 3 a.m., when I would finally collapse.

I couldn't get anything done. I felt like a prisoner in my own mind, and no matter what I did I just couldn't ""shake"" it. I am a psychology student, and I know everything to say to myself, but somehow I felt a failure for it not working. I got a [dog](http://i.imgur.com/jbcF4.jpg) (Jax/Jaxie) during the summer, and he and JK Rowling (see below) saved my life. No matter how hard I was crying, my baby would come over and lick my hand and lay by me, and he wouldn't leave my side for anything. He growled at the opposite sex when they came near me, and he wouldn't let me out of his sight (he knocked down the bathroom door once because he couldn't see me). It breaks my heart into a million little pieces every single day that I can't have him with me at school. As soon as I got back to school, I got into counseling. It got worse before it got better.

I couldn't listen to music with a male singer, I couldn't make eye contact with the opposite sex, forget about touching or hugging them. I was extremely irritable, anxious, and depressed. Sometimes I thought that it might have been more merciful had he killed me. Because if he had killed me, then it could be put to rest - I was gone. But it wasn't like that. It was always there, lingering, making me hate myself and everything I did.

I couldn't watch movies, because something in them would remind me of my rapist, or possibly the professor that took advantage of me when I confided in him about what had happened. In fact, the only thing I could do and feel comfortable with was Harry Potter. I only got to read Harry Potter while I was on bed-rest from my accident (it fucked up my back), and it changed my life. Watched it, read it, tattooed it. 

Well, this was my life last semester. My counselor and I did [EMDR](http://www.emdr-therapy.com/) therapy, and I can't tell you how it helped. I don't know where I'd be without it.

This year, it's like someone flipped a switch. I've applied to four summer internships, with 2 more applications on their way, as well as a scholarship application. I'm the president of the Quiz Bowl team here on campus and we're on television, we've been invited to a dinner party with the university president and his wife, and we're going to nationals in Chicago later this semester. I'm putting into motion my own psychological study, I'm adding to my tattoos, I'm confident in myself and who I am again, and I'm happy single. These few weeks of the new year have been better than the entirety of last year.

But today, TwoX, I am out of counseling. I'm doing what I need to do to take care of myself. I'm so excited to be out of counseling TwoX, that I can't possibly put it into words. At the same time, though, I know that I've fought tooth and nail for this. Blood, sweat, and many tears went into feeling normal again. I fought every single second for myself, convinced that this man who violated intimacy to the highest degree would not ruin me, and it's been the hardest thing I've ever done (and I've raised $527K in a week before). 

And I'm very, very proud of that.

If I can do this, I can do anything. That will be my new battle cry.

Edit: And I just ordered a whole bunch of cake decorating supplies from Amazon. I'm going to master a new skill, and something I've always wanted to do!

Edit2: **WOW.** Front-paged! You ladies are amazing, truly. It seems I keep just saying ""thank you"" over and over, but I mean it each and every one. You guys made my day a million times better. I can't thank you enough."

oyxjp,7,2012-01-27,Bad teeth since I was 12.,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/oyxjp/bad_teeth_since_i_was_12/,"Here's my story:  I was raised by a divorced mother who was neglectful, partly because she was too busy working and partly because she was kind of crazy.  When I was young, I was very thin because she never bought much to eat, so often I would end up eating a good amount of pure sugar and/or jello powder because there wasn't anything else to eat.  I was also not taught the importance of brushing my teeth daily, so by the time I was around 11 or 12, I had developed over 20 cavities all over my permanent teeth.  Back then I didn't realize how bad the situation was until my mom freaked out when I showed her what they looked like.  She took me to a dentist a few times, but soon stopped before I had gotten all of the cavities filled.  While she was/is poor, I'm pretty sure she had enough to cover the remaining visits, but she didn't do it.  So, from age 12, I've had around 8 cavities that still have not been treated.  I've never actually counted how many there are because it just makes me feel horrible to think about it or look at my teeth.  The worst cavity is on one of my big teeth at the top front of my mouth (one of the big incisors) that's basically a big black hole front and center in my mouth, which has made me extremely self-conscious to the point of frequent periods of extreme isolation, basically ruining most chances of living a normal life while in high school and then in college.  I can't talk normally; I'm always aware of the movements of my mouth, making sure not too much is shown.  I also cannot smile.  I've had to withdraw from my college twice due to the psychological/mental health effects.

I severed ties with my mother once I entered college, taking out as many loans as I can, doing paid internships, and working doing school, but that's been only enough to just get by.  So I've dealt with these slowly worsening dental issues for 10 years (I'm 22 now), very often depressed about how much I've missed out on and stressed over because of my teeth.  It makes me feel like I lost a good chunk of my youth because of my teeth and how much I've had to work.  Even if I could afford to go to a dentist today, I'd feel too embarrassed to actually go have any work done.  And even when I do get this stuff fixed, it will probably feel like too little, too late...  I guess at this point I'm not even sure why I'm posting this."

Hey everyone, My name is Chris (24) (if you couldn't tell by the username) and I'm in a bit of a dilemma..

 My now-fiance (22) and I are getting married in June, we've been dating for about 2.5 years, we both love video games, guns, internetz, and anything that involves being a nerd.

Right now we're living with her parents because we moved down here on a whim that I would score a job at the local school district as an IT Technician.. well.. I didn't get the job, and I had left my previous job since it was about 70 miles away.

My fiance left her job also since we moved and is getting screwed by her unpaid internship.. she's filling a woman's spot at the city jailhouse as an UNPAID internship that THANKFULLY she gets college credits for. Sadly, her getting paid for that isn't looking good, as they're cutting the budget which isn't fair because she's doing EXACTLY what that woman did (and better).

After a few months of job hunting (and getting a job as a pc repairman/salesman at a popular office supply store), I decided that I wanted to join the Air Force, they'd give me the training I need, would help me start my family, and I over all just wanted to be a part of something BIG and serve my country. I've been training for about 2.5 months and have already lost 25 pounds, I've only got about 30-40 more to go before they'll actually enlist me.

To get to the point - I'd love to be able to take her to a place where we can both be happy, we've had a rough 6 months and it really won't get better until I get in the Air Force. I really want to take her to DisneyWorld and Universal Studios, and stay in a nice hotel. That's really all we ask.

Right now, my mom is helping to pay for some of the honeymoon, but I REALLY don't like her doing that. She works for FedEx driving 18-wheelers in a city environment and she works DAMN hard for her money. SHE deserves that money. My mom is the type of woman who would give me the shirt off her back if it meant I could sleep warm.

All I'm asking is a few dollars to help pay for this honeymoon. It would mean the WORLD to us!

I've been trying to think of ways to thank people for donations.. and I think I've got a Reddit-Solution.

For every donation 20 dollars or more, we will take a picture (not nudes :) ) of your choosing. Whether it's us kissing on a ride, me giving Mickey Mouse a high five, or shanking a mascot and blaming it on the janitor. We'll try our BEST to get every single picture  in. It should be fun!

I'm not sure what I need to do to prove to everyone that I'm not some scammer or douche trying to take people's money. I guess we can take pictures of us holding up a handwritten sign or something. She's sleeping and I'm about to go to bed (have to be at work..on a saturday.. at 8 ) so we can take them eventually. I'll give a link to some pictures of us in text form.

I'll use my PayPal address since it's Business Verified (I used to run my own Game Console Repair business) if anybody wants to throw a few dollars our way. But really any sort of donation will be **SO MUCH** appreciated!

Here's some pictures of us for now until we're both back together so we can take some verified pictures.

I've been training for about 2.5 months and have already lost 25 pounds, I've only got about 30-40 more to go before they'll actually enlist me.

To get to the point - I'd love to be able to take her to a place where we can both be happy, we've had a rough 6 months and it really won't get better until I get in the Air Force. I really want to take her to DisneyWorld and Universal Studios, and stay in a nice hotel. That's really all we ask.

Right now, my mom is helping to pay for some of the honeymoon, but I REALLY don't like her doing that. She works for FedEx driving 18-wheelers in a city environment and she works DAMN hard for her money. SHE deserves that money. My mom is the type of woman who would give me the shirt off her back if it meant I could sleep warm.

All I'm asking is a few dollars to help pay for this honeymoon. It would mean the WORLD to us!

I've been trying to think of ways to thank people for donations.. and I think I've got a Reddit-Solution.

For every donation 20 dollars or more, we will take a picture (not nudes :) ) of your choosing. Whether it's us kissing on a ride, me giving Mickey Mouse a high five, or shanking a mascot and blaming it on the janitor. We'll try our BEST to get every single picture  in. It should be fun!

I'm not sure what I need to do to prove to everyone that I'm not some scammer or douche trying to take people's money. I guess we can take pictures of us holding up a handwritten sign or something. She's sleeping and I'm about to go to bed (have to be at work..on a saturday.. at 8 ) so we can take them eventually. I'll give a link to some pictures of us in text form.

I'll use my PayPal address since it's Business Verified (I used to run my own Game Console Repair business) if anybody wants to throw a few dollars our way. But really any sort of donation will be **SO MUCH** appreciated!

Here's some pictures of us for now until we're both back together so we can take some verified pictures.

I'm wondering if anyone out there knows what to look for as far as less competitive internships go, since my GPA is not fantastic.  However, I do have excellent letters of recommendation from my school.

Almost done with college and no idea what I actually want to do.,negative_epsilon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p202n/question_on_the_it_industry_almost_done_with/,"I know that not knowing what you want to do with the rest of your life isn't something to be worried about-- I've gotten that speech before. But I have absolutely no idea what I actually want to do. I have interests that range from music composition to database administration, from philosophy to combinatorics, from journalism to political science. My major is in mathematics because for the longest time I was dead set on going to grad school and becoming a professor, but in the last year or so that dream has died and a whole wide range of fields are in front of me; here I am with no idea what to choose.

I love analytics and problem solving (Otherwise I wouldn't be a math major, I suppose). I got my A+ Cert at 16 because I was in love with the idea of working with computers for the rest of my life, and my job right now is officially a student assistant for my university, but I'm building and managing databases in Access (Thus, I'm really good with VBA and have a little experience with MySQL) for the college. 

I'm minoring in statistics, and right now I'm kind of on an actuarial path. But I've heard horror stories of not being able to get into that field... and what if I really miss coding? Helping my friends with computer problems is still a pretty big joy in my life. I'm totally scrambled. My GPA is shit low, too (2.9), and that doesn't help me get internships. One thing I've thought about is becoming a Microsoft certified database admin, but are there jobs for database admins right now? Is that really a certification that people respect, or is it something that college students do when they have no real world experience?

Sorry I rambled. Any help is appreciated.

**tl;dr- Math major with no direction, is the MCDBA worth it if I really enjoy that?**"
p1wac,1,2012-01-29,Put off career goals? Or try to make them happen now?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p1wac/put_off_career_goals_or_try_to_make_them_happen/,"**Here’s my problem**: I’m a recent graduate who is unemployed and can’t secure a paying job in my field (one in a million, right?) So far I’ve done internships and freelancing on my own. My technical skills combined with my experience easily qualify me for the entry/junior level jobs I see posted in my field BUT the problem is none of these jobs are in my locality, they’re in New York and I live an hour outside of it.
 
Recruiters seem reluctant to hire an out-of-state candidate, as I’ve been applying like crazy and got only two interviews for all my efforts. One I didn’t get the job for because they went with another candidate and for the other I’m still on the fence.

Of course I have my parents, student loans, and a credit card to pay back too. I was able to put all but one of my loans in deferment till late summer/early fall and got the credit card company to hold off on my payments for a couple months at no additional cost or interest. Mom and dad are letting me stay at home for as long as I need to, but they have their own stuff to take care of and I feel guilty for tacking my bills onto their expenses.

**Here are my two ideas to resolve the problem**:

*Start using a friend/relative’s address on my resume, try to get interviews, tell HR ‘I’m relocating soon’ if they ask, and commute to work every day if I land a job.
(I think:  the most expensive to begin with, but should level out by mid-spring. By then I can probably sort out my finances for fall when all my loans go back into repayment. Plus, I’ll have the industry experience right off the bat.)

Or

*Take a retail or coffee job in my local area, save up money, move to New York, then start my career plans.
(I think:  the least expensive begin with, but will put off my experience for 7 mos. – 1.5 years, by which time my loans will all go back into repayment, will have to use the cash I save to pay them back plus current debts and relocation costs, etc. etc.)


Thoughts on which of these would be the better option? Or would you suggest I do something else entirely?

Thanks!

It's always been kind of understood between us that 'the move' would be made by me...I'm from, basically, the middle of nowhere, and she's from a pretty big area out West that I've grown to really like...it's a little busier than I'm comfortable with, but I've always felt I could get used to it in time.

Our relationship is 'good'. We've never had any major fights, except for her having occasional emotional breakdowns because of the distance. The trust is strong. We've been faithful and spent a lot of time with each other, thousands and thousands of hours talking on the phone, playing games, watching movies and tv, etc. I've always been a little more 'giving' with my time and attention in the relationship, aka I'm constantly editing papers for her, talking her to sleep, my sleeping schedule has been a wreck because I'm the one who has adjusted to West Coast time while living on the East Coast, etc. I'm also facing the fact right now that I've gone MIA and lost contact with a lot of friends because I've spent quite a bit of my time focused on keeping the relationship healthy. I don't want this to sound completely negative against my LDR, because I've allowed a lot of it to happen because I've seen myself slip into being quite a pushover at times.

Compatibility-wise, we get along well and have a good time when we're together. I've noticed in more recent visits that her emotions swing much more rapidly when I'm around, and I often find myself wishing I could leave halfway through a two-week visit but by the end of the visit we're happy and getting along. We both want kids, etc. But I'm starting to realize that my time has been monopolized, and I'm wondering if I'm going to have any time to develop myself and my own interests if I do make the move. I'm really passionate about sports, history, politics, etc, but it seems like whenever I bring these up with her, she falls asleep or changes the subject.

Biggest problem is...I've had trouble facing 'the move'. I've been looking for employment in her area for a long time now, and haven't really succeeded in anything besides an internship which allowed me to spend about 3 months near her. I have quite a bit of anxiety about moving across the country with tight funds and having to find my own place, because she's locked in to an apartment now for another 5 months or so. I'm close with my family at home as well, also, and I've always felt somewhat of a tug when even considering the big move. I'm becoming increasingly tight with money, especially with loans over my head, and she's completely the opposite and tends to be a free spender.

Ugh. I know this is rambling on and on, and I'm sorry for that but that's where my head is right now. Does anyone have any ideas or advice for me? We've just gone through a bit of a blow-up, and the ultimatum is pretty much on the table - if I don't move within in the next 3-4 weeks, the relationship is likely over. But is moving even something I should consider? I feel like I've cheated myself a little in the last 3+ years by losing what made me 'me' - my interests, my personal ambition, friends, etc - in favor of what's best for the relationship - and a lot of that is my fault. But is it worth ending a solid 3+ year relationship for the chance to start all over while I still have my youth?

Unfortunately, I do not have anyone to talk to about how I should think about structuring the second half of my undergrad to best position myself coming out the other side. That's why I came here.

I've got a very solid GPA in and out of major and I'm involved in a relatively small research group (no experience required) right now. Coming in to college I had zero experience in CS so my body of knowledge is probably a bit smaller than your stereotypical CS kid.

Due to circumstances out of my control, this summer is not suitable for internships. It is too short for a full program and I am not going to take a quarter off, so I didn't apply when that time came around. 

My plan right now is to finish up the project I'm currently working on and search for some more serious research positions to buff my resume through the end of this year, the coming short summer, and my junior year. When the time comes to apply for next year's summer internships, I feel like I should have enough practical experience to make myself a worthwhile candidate. 

So that's my plan right now. I'd like to get some input from those who have been in my position though, because I feel like I'm way behind the game due to not being able to take an internship this summer and having a smaller pool of knowledge coming into college. Any insight would be much appreciated, thanks in advance!"

What should I expect?,UnhappyHobo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/p1ecg/going_in_for_an_interview_on_tuesday_what_should/,"So, this interview was really, seriously unexpected. I received a notice about a job through a mailing list at my school earlier this month, so I sent in my resume because it looked like a great opportunity, but I didn't really expect a response. Earlier this week they emailed me and asked for an interview. I'm not really panicking--I've been through interviews before and I know that being nervous doesn't help me any. But I haven't been through enough that I know what to expect from the interviewer. Each time has been a wholly different experience. But my biggest problem is and has always been asking questions. I can usually answer them just fine, but I'm really terrible at asking my own questions. I'm not sure why, I just seem to have to process the things they're saying a bit longer than the interview time-span. I also don't fully understand post-interview etiquette. My last interview didn't go very well, and the interviewer told me she'd call me whether they wanted me or not, so that I wouldn't be left wondering. She never called (it's been almost 2 months) and I never called or did anything because I thought I was supposed to be waiting to be contacted.

Anyway, here's a **tl;dr** list of questions for you:

* **What questions should I ask?**
* What questions might I expect?
* What should I do after the interview?

I've dealt with various issues in my past, mostly as a teenager - severe depression, OCD, generalized anxiety, etc. I had a lot of help, took time off school, went part time, etc. I'm just now graduating college at age 23 and had been healthy for quite a while. I had grand plans to find an internship, take some classes, and apply to grad school in a field I'm very passionate about. Maybe find a job in between to save up some money. I'm very lucky in that my parents are willing to support me while I find my footing. I was really excited about this new stage of my life.


The problem is, a few months ago my OCD came back full force. There are days when the barrage of anxiety is 24/7. It's mostly mental (no real physical compulsions) so I become very disturbed, distractible, and sleep becomes more difficult. I know I would feel better if I had a set schedule and some responsibilities. But the OCD struck at the worst time - If I were employed I would have something to force me out of my head during the day. But I'm unemployed, and the prospect of finding a job and doing poorly is very daunting. I was so excited about my future, but now I greatly fear finding my dream job (in research/academics) and being unable to do well because of this crappy disorder. I'm trying to harden the fuck up and go for it anyway, I just desperately want to do well.


**TL;DR**: How do you guys deal with finding employment and staying employed while dealing with your anxiety? Does your job help your anxiety at all? How do you deal with employers? Basically... how the fuck do adults handle Real Life and a mental illness?"

Been mostly a lurker until now and my native language is not English, so I am sorry for my lack of coherence and possible mistakes :).
Okay, so me (23 M) and her (23 F) have been involved in a kind of tumultuous relationship over the past two and a half years. She is the first person I really every cared about in a deep way. We met at driver's school ed class and after that we continued to IM each other on the internets. She was kind of emotionally unstable at that point so I was trying to help her get over her problems, but it seems that I've set up a trap for myself. Four months go by and we start seeing that we feel for each other. It is worth mentioning that she had a boyfriend at that point(I was single), but still, she did not restrain in becoming very close to me and flirting in subtle ways. After a year of strange behavior I finally decided to go for one year to Germany for an internship, as an effort to get over her. After one month of staying in Germany I find out that she started to like my roommate of all people.. (via internet). I did not expect this from any of them both, and it was extremely painful when I would hear them skyping, and, almost always, I would go outside and walk it off. After a few weeks she 'broke-up' with my roommate. 
That Christmas I flew back home and met her, and had an awesome time together. I really thought things were going in the right direction. So I return to Germany only to find, two weeks later, that she got back together with my roommate. I was like 'what the fuck' and decided to completely remove her from my life. I worked out and was in great shape, buried myself in work and it felt awesome!. But it did not last, and when I returned home in August we got together again, for 2 months, and it was great while it lasted. But after she went to college the shit hit the fan again and worse this time.

She is a really unstable person, I dare to say. One day she would ignore my efforts to communicate with her, the next day (when I left her alone) she would complain that I ignore her, and act as the fucking victim, so on, so forth.. I haven't spoken with her at all for about two months, removed number from phone, unfriended her on Facebook, disabled my Facebook account for that matter.. and tried to direct my conscious thoughts towards my work as a student. I have come to the conclusion that a few moments of pleasure are not worth months and months of suffering and I have to find someone who is able to have a healthy
relationship, even though you’re in a world of pain sometimes.

All you heart-aching redditors out there, stay strong, time will heal your wounds.

TL;DR Girlfriend of 2.5 years kept making me feel like shit in a clockwork manner. I decided that she would suck me right back into that shitty state every time I tried to remain friends with her. so I removed her from my life, thus saying 'fuck no' to being 'just friends'. Was I wrong in doing so?

I'm a Junior in High School, and I've got to decide what I want to do this summer. I've got pretty much the entire summer, and I'm willing to work anywhere in OC, though places near Huntington Beach would be preferred.

I'd be happy with a paid job as well as an unpaid internship. I can try to draft up a resume (and a portfolio?) if that would help. This would be my first experience working.

Suggestions on how to improve my spiel, get a job of this nature, or just general life skills welcome. You're also free to tell me to buzz off, though this wouldn't be quite as welcome ;)

My GF and I are both 23. We met last year in April, and immediately hit it off. I'm not kidding, we were sleeping together on our second day. She had given me her key in the first week and we've shared a bed since. We just clicked. We still do. We argue from time to time like all couples, but we make up really well and really listen to each other. We want the same things in life. The sex is incredible. We approach problems from different directions and meet in the middle. It's a great relationship.

When we met, I still had 3 semesters left until I graduated. She had graduated and accepted a job where she knew she could be sent overseas. She warned me early on about it, and when 2 months in she found out and asked me to follow I couldn't pass it up. I skipped the fall semester, found a great internship in the same city, and spent an awesome six months with her. No regrets, greatest six months of my life.

Now I'm back home, and she's still there for another year and a half. I'm knocking out another semester of school and going back to live with her over the summer. She's got some training in the states in March, so I'll be seeing her very soon. She'll be spending vacation time here in April too.

**The Problem**
I talked to her about me just doing a full year in the states after that, and seeing her when she gets back. She told me she couldn't do that. A year alone and apart was not something she wanted.

I figure what I could do is attend school in the fall of 2012, skip Spring 2013, and graduate December 2013. We'd be 25 and she'd be done with her overseas post.

I've spent the last 5 years in and out of school, paying it for myself and living on my own since 18. I'm starting to feel a real pressure to push through and get my degree the closer I get. My parents are a part of my life again since about a year ago, and they're putting pressure on me too. But whats the big difference between graduating in a year vs two with the economy the way it is? Also, I can do another awesome internship overseas. My last one was the best resume fodder I've ever gotten.

I've made it clear to her if I do this plan, I'd be doubling down on ""US""  I told her she would have to know that I'd basically still be dependent on her while I'm overseas. That I'd really need a real commitment even though we both feel too young to marry.  She likes that plan way better than a year apart. 

I guess I'm asking for advice reddit. Am I doing this right? My father says not to do it that way and to prioritize my education. My gut says I've gotta be with her. (My gut also says my father regrets not ever being able to help, and wants to see me ""finish my education"" above all else) I'm worried I'm just playing this blind.

Trying to do it ""my way."" Usually it's been easy, because aside from a girlfriend I had for two years I've been a bit of a loner when making life decisions. I just plod and move forward. Now I'm playing a weird game.

TLDR - . Feeling pressure from my parents to finish school, but pressure from my girlfriend to be with her overseas. Came up with a plan to satisfy that, but still worried I'm compromising my life for everyone else."

Or charge ahead?,Cro1son12,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/p2a8v/put_my_plans_off_for_a_bit_or_charge_ahead/,"**Here’s my problem**: I’m a recent graduate who is unemployed and can’t secure a paying job in my field (one in a million, right?) So far I’ve done internships and freelancing on my own. My technical skills combined with my experience easily qualify me for the entry/junior level jobs I see posted in my field BUT the problem is none of these jobs are in my locality, they’re in New York and I live an hour outside of it.

Recruiters seem reluctant to hire an out-of-state candidate, as I’ve been applying like crazy and got only two interviews for all my efforts. One I didn’t get the job for because they went with another candidate and for the other I’m still on the fence.

Of course I have my parents, student loans, and a credit card to pay back too. I was able to put all but one of my loans in deferment till late summer/early fall and got the credit card company to hold off on my payments for a couple months at no additional cost or interest. Mom and dad are letting me stay at home for as long as I need to, but they have their own stuff to take care of and I feel guilty for tacking my bills onto their expenses.


**Here are two ideas I have to resolve the problem**:

* Start using a friend/relative’s address on my resume, try to get interviews, tell HR ‘I’m relocating soon’ if they ask, and commute to work every day if I land a job. (I think: the most expensive to begin with, but should level out by mid-spring. By then I can probably sort out my finances for fall when all my loans go back into repayment. Plus, I’ll have the industry experience right off the bat.)

Or

* Take a retail or coffee job in my local area, save up money, move to New York, then start my career plans. (I think: the least expensive begin with, but will put off my experience for 7 mos. – 1.5 years, by which time my loans will all go back into repayment, will have to use the cash I save to pay them back plus current debts and relocation costs, etc. etc.)


Thoughts on which of these would be the better option? Or would you suggest I do something else entirely?

Thanks!"
p29w5,5,2012-01-29,I think I've reached my breaking point - a healthful rant,werdunloaded,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/p29w5/i_think_ive_reached_my_breaking_point_a_healthful/,"Hey, everyone. If anyone has read any of my previous posts, I've been struggling with my current college. In short, it's my antithesis in pretty much every regard. 

Last weekend, I asked a friend's friend out and she rejected me. Fair enough. Yesterday I found out, via the mutual friend, that I've been de-friended in real life (but not on facebook...). They weren't going to tell me, but my friend's friends (I was part of their social circle) agreed that I can't hang out with them anymore. They were just going to awkwardly ignore me. I must have breached their trust or something, but as of yesterday, I've been disowned. My mutual friend told me it in the form of a side joke, but it kind of backfired. 

So here I was doing really well and I was in a good circle of friends who I thought had some maturity. In the end I get kicked out and blacklisted. I'm done. Done. Done. Done. I'm done with this immaturity, this need to belong to feel valuable, and this illusion that being in a constant challenge brings constant growth. Sure, I've learned a few nice skills here, but now I'm just falling apart. I've been attending this college for 5 months and it's already gotten to the point I'm getting physically ill from the tremendous stress (it's the collective stress of being here, not just recent events). I've always told people, ""The moment your (intangible) emotions start destroying your (tangible) body, you need to get the fuck out."" Well, I need to take my advice, or dramatically change the way I do things here. 

As of tomorrow, I'll be seeing a therapist for the first time in my life (I'm 21, almost 22). I can no longer do this alone, and I'm not comfortable opening up to my friends because I'm afraid of losing them, too. I've never lived an easy live; it's been a blessing, really, but this is fucking ridiculous. I really can't take it anymore. I'm not suicidal, just fed up.

**TL;DR: People at college suck, causes life to suck. Broken.**

On a brighter note, I've used my energy productively instead of wallowing in it all day, and I've decided I would enjoy Human Resources as my future long-term career. I've started looking for internships around my college and found one. I hope they get back to me soon.

Thanks for listening everyone. I know there are quite a few of these rants floating around this subreddit, but it really helps those of us who don't have this kind of outlet in real life. "

Today I got a email offering a 2 week internship opportunity at a different company. Since neither of these opportunities are certain at this point I would like to play the field and try to do both, but I don't want to have to leave a 2 week internship early if I end up getting hired. What would be the best way to handle this situation without taking advantage of anyone. 

This internship would start on Feb 16th, my next interview with company 1 is on Feb 7th.

Would it be ok to express interest in the internship but just say I may have to take a day off for an interview? I also have Jury duty during the 2 weeks the internship would take place.

As I gently lifted the flap of skin back, I admired the fragility and solidity of the skull. How could something so dull possibly reveal the beautiful secrets of the organ it housed? I stood aside as the secondary surgeon drilled through the skull. “Which hemisphere did you say I was supposed to remove?” I joked. One of the interns laughed too hard. Ass kisser. 
            “The hemispherectomy went well enough,” I told the parents. “If all goes well, little Tyler should be able to walk and talk a little in about a week.” The look of joy on the parents’ faces should have warmed my heart. Any other surgeon would have succumbed and allowed themselves a grin. I know how I’m supposed to act, and so I feigned a smile, then turned and returned to my office.
            I reviewed the logs and tape from the surgery, before packing it up and handing it to an intern to give to the dean. 
            As I drove home, I wondered if Noah had received the body. I thought back to when I first met Noah. The psycho had been at a bar, where I had only gone to have one drink before going home. He had started ranting about how he was going to burn the entire world down one day. The bartender then made the biggest mistake a bartender can make, and cut the poor bastard off. Noah then had started to bawl his eyes out, and started apologizing to thin air. Something about “why’d I help ‘em?”
            The bartender said he was going to call a taxi, but Noah had mumbled something about not having any cash. Before the bartender said anything else, I volunteered to take him home. That sentence seemed to aggravate Noah even more. “Fuck homes!” he had yelled. I asked him whether he had a place to stay. “Yeah, but that shithole’ll never be a fucking home” he growled. “Does this shithole have an address?” I remember saying.
            Over the course of the following week, Noah and I became closer. “So Doc,” he would say, “I got this fucking twinge in my neck, ya think ya could check it out?” I would gently remind his that I was a neurosurgeon.
            I discovered Noah’s “little secret” two weeks after the night in the bar. Noah had come to the hospital with a broken arm, and it was my day for clinic rounds. I remember sitting awkwardly in the room with Noah for a minute before Noah chuckled and said, “That file probably has it all in there right?” Seeing the confused look on my face, he said, “Why don’t I just tell ya, I’d rather ya hear it from me.”
            He then proceeded to tell me everything. About how he posed as a lawyer to seem normal, but how he was actually a murderer and an arsonist And about how he spent all his money on booze and accelerant. “Well actually, Bellua’s the murderer, I just burn shit,” he clarified. I had no idea who this “Bellua” was, but I didn’t care anymore. This was just too messed up. 
            Yes, technically I’m a murderer, but not to this psycho’s extent. I’ve only ever killed for other people’s benefit. There was the time I prescribed a double dosage of Luvox to a patient who I knew had been skimming money from the school district, and that other time when I had tampered with the drill before surgery to kill a corrupt judge on the table; but these had all been for the good of society. 
            I didn’t tell Noah any of this, I simply pretended he was joking, although I knew he wasn’t, and proceeded to call a nurse in to set his arm.
            Later, I called Noah and told him how I was a murderer too. I realized Noah had provided a golden opportunity to kill and not risk being caught at work. I proposed that I kill, and Noah dispose of the body’s. Noah agreed, and said that whenever I kill something, I should bring it to his house, and leave it somewhere no one else would see it, he would find it.
            This had been my first kill I was going to share with Noah. I had sliced a corrupt policeman across the throat, and let him bleed out on Noah lawn. Then, I covered the body with a hot tub cover, and left.

 I want to begin by saying i'm applying for an engineering internship with a NASA program. Recently, I became alarmed when I looked at my grades from a bad year during my College Sophomore year. I'm talking about a year where I failed one semester of classes which brought my GPA from a 3.2 to a 2.5. In reflection, I remember a time where i wasn't motivated to do work. I felt shitty when a CERTAIN event took place, and that affected my performance in school. After that incident, I took two years off from school to travel the world so i could forget. 



I signed up with a non-profit organization and helped with projects in different cities in Mexico, USA, and the Philippines. I lead many projects, and became involved with their communities. I loved every minute of it. I helped with engineering related tasks by building wood bridges, and fixing cars, and creating other mechanisms that helped the community, and building homes. At that moment, I reignited the engineer within me. So, I ended up finding all the books related to my major and studied outside of the classroom. I met wonderful teachers who didn't have credentials but were so fucking smart to understand the theories. I learned from them and developed my understanding in those areas. For two years, I traveled and studied. At the end of my travel, I realized that i needed to return to finish my duty as a student. So, I returned home to work as a tutor until i regained enough funds to pay for college again.



Now, i'm back in school. I'm fighting an uphill battle with my GPA. If anyone tells you employers don't look at your grades, they are right until you try finding internships in technical related fields. Anyway, I regret that one year with a passion. Most of the internships that i'm applying to require a 3.0GPA; I have the smarts, but i don't know how to get around this GPA business. What can I do or write that can give me an equal opportunity for a job/internship position? Employers what do you look for and what suggestions can you make for a person in my situation? "

We met doing a college internship about a year ago, and we were inseparable from day one.

The thing is, she's pretty crazy and I should have ended it the first time I realized this.

She would have crazy mood swings over NOTHING, at one point physically assaulting me. (I don't mean like a slap, I mean full on punches)

But I let it slide, because she always got over it shortly.

We ended up moving in together about 6 months in (Because the internship was national, and we lived in different states, but wanted to stay together. I lived in Florida, where the internship was, but she lived in New York)

Thing was, she was supposed to have a job. Turns out, she didn't. I spent 2 months trying to pay for a $700 a month apartment on minimum wage working at Disney World and then Universal Studios. Didn't work. I had to move back in with my Dad, and she had to move back in with her parents in New York.

Fast forward a bit and I had come into a pretty good chunk of money. I spoke to her about it and toyed with the idea of me going to school in New York, since I wanted to study theatre, if I went to Ithaca College, she'd only be 40 minutes away.

She agreed, and so I went and was getting ready to enroll into IC. About 2 weeks into me moving to NY, about to sign a lease on an apartment, she told me I should go home and broke up with me. She told me she didn't need me anymore, since she was in school and doing well.

I. was. destroyed. She contacted all my family members and told them vicious lies about how I was stalking her and I had to do damage control about it while driving back to Florida, having been freshly dumped.


Two weeks later she calls me all teary, apologizing and wanting to get back together. You see where this is going.

I agreed to 'get back together' with her to see if I still felt any of what I did before, but I've realized that she just killed every emotion I had for her. I don't see her as anything more than a friend now, and not a very good one at that.


You don't have to say it. I know I'm an idiot, I know I'm a doormat, though even I didn't realize the extent until I just sat down here and wrote it.

I originally was writing this for advice on how to break up with her and not feel absolutely awful about it, but even just writing out the facts plain and simple helped enormously."

In the mood for some cheering up.,kelustu,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/p3vgo/basically_my_life_story_long_in_the_mood_for_some/,"Hrmm, where to start. I've lived in San Diego my entire life, go to a prestigious school in Boston (that isn't Harvard or MIT) and am currently working at a prestigious internship here in Boston as well.

That's about where the good part ends. So let's jump into some history real quick. My mother runs the only profitable (currently) of many market research arms of the largest advertising juggernaut in the world. My dad is a successful architect. I have one sister. My mom is generally flying and not home very often, but is wonderful. She calls every night when she's away, staying up to ungodly hours of the night to wait for me and my sister to get home from school to say hi. My dad never said a word to me beyond ""take out the trash"" on Mondays. We actually had a very poor relationship for a long period of time. 

So then let's just jump into the rest of it, no? This is going to end up being close to a life story; I'm going to begin with elementary school. In the interest of keeping this as short as possible, suffice it to say that after about 3 weeks of 8 hours of testing multiple times a week, it was determined that I was legally blind out of one of my eyes, and that they were unsure why. They've slowly figured out more and more over time, but still know nothing. I must have been about 8 at the time and was tested for brain cancer. I'm still given a yearly M.R.I. to test for brain tumors yearly and I'm desensitized to it.

I was born with an extra tooth between my baby tooth and my adult tooth (forgive me for not knowing the technical names) which had to be surgically removed in 5th grade. I then had a gap in my mouth, as it was one of my front teeth) for a year and a half, until they decided to surgically pull the tooth down. After realized that there was not enough room, they had to essentially pull my gums up and slap on some braces, which lasted 5 years, which were odd and awkward.

That's about the same time I started at a new school as well. I've always been an adult at heart, so add my social awkwardness to my medical conditions and you have a recipe for a pretty ostracized kid. In 7th grade, at one of my two best (and probably only) friends' bar mitzvah's, I had received a call from the other's dad that one of their three sons, the middle child, had committed suicide at college. This was my first experience with death and it cripples me to this day.

He was an incredible person. He was one of the best fencer's in the country, a well known tennis player in our state, was one of the top rated Starcraft: The Brood War players around, was great with technology and one of the sweetest people I ever knew. I can't even imagine what it was like for his family, but I know that I was pretty shocked. It was, and remains, one of two times in my life I've ever cried above the age of 8 (I'm generally emotionless). 

In the summer between 7th and 8th grades, after complaining about some shoulder pain for awhile and driving me home from my tennis lesson, my dads starts screaming in pain. The next few weeks are filled with expletives and the occasional ""JUST SHOOT ME I CAN'T TAKE IT."" That lasted for about 3 months. It was determined that he'd had a pinched nerve in his spine at about neck level. He spent another 2 months on vicadin everyday and never said a word. It was truly frightening, may I remind you that he was a very quiet person beforehand towards me, not my sister. So roughly 5 months after the pain started, he had surgery. He's now better, but will never be able to do the things he loves again, such as playing tennis and golf on the weekends.

Fast forward through what can best by described, for brevity's sake, as a horrendous few years through middle school, to 9th grade. I start at a high school that consists mostly of the same kids as my high school. 3 weeks into the school year I realize that a song has become popular around campus, by all students and some teachers; the lyrics of which go something along the line of ""Nobody cares about [kelustu], if he died, no one would care."" Repeat for 5 or 6 lines and you about got it.

Two months later, my grandfather is moved to a senior citizens home and my family goes to visit him. I'm a naive child and fake sick to get out of it. They visit again two months later when he becomes seriously ill and I'm genuinely sick this time and plead with my parents to go see him. They say no. Three days later he dies. I neglected to see him once in the previous year. The only other time in my life above the age of 8 that I've cried. I'll never forgive myself.

A few weeks beforehand, my parents had bought a golden retriever. He was legitimately the greatest pet alive. He was outrageously sweet, adorable and essentially a walking carpet. I love him more than anything else alive outside of my direct family, but even then it's close.

10th grade: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She immediately went into surgery and began chemotherapy. She spent 4 months in bed, occasionally throwing up, but never leaving her bed upstairs. The woman that would stay up to 5 in the morning in Hong Kong to call me and my sister whenever she was there. She could not even utter a ""goodbye"" on our way to school in the morning. Her chemo sessions were every two weeks and the only I saw of her outside of her room was my dad taking her to chemo, with her in tears over the pain she knew she would be in for two weeks. She pulled through and is now healthy and back to running her company successfully. 

Weeks after my mom is done with chemotherapy, around December of 10th grade, my dad's Arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) begins to flare up. He spends 3 weeks in the hospital and undergoes surgery to electrically shock and kill some of his heart cells. It doesn't work the first time so they do it again. His life-expectancy is reduced by about 5 years because of these procedures, but his Arrhythmia is cured, which could have been much more severe.

Now then, go forward 5 months. My birthday is near the end of May, a week before finals. The day before my last final (English) it starts hailing, movie foreshadow style. My dog has always been afraid of any kind of weather, so we assumed nothing of it, but had been refusing to eat for a day. He's done this before, so again, we thought nothing of it. That night, we realize that he's very slow moving and looks physically weak. We can also notice that the way he looks at us was worrying. I spent the night on the floor of my entry way with his head in my lap just petting him. When I woke up, my mom had taken him to the vet, and I went to take my final. The vet, who we'd called the night before, said it would be no problem to wait a few hours, it was probably just some stomach bug or something he'd eaten.

I come back from my final to my mom in tears. ""where's Jack?"" ""How *over tears* was your English final?"" ""Good, where's Jack?"" ""I'm so proud of you *crying*"" ""Great, where's Jack"" ""I'm so sorry.""

The vet said he'd had heart cancer and it had burst the night before and he was gone in the morning, there was nothing they could have done even if we got him in on time. They assured that he died painlessly and peacefully. I was beyond shocked and sad and I didn't even cry, but it is by far the saddest moment of my life. I would give almost anything in this world to have him back. We have another dog now who's also great, but I can't help but feel guilty because I just can't bring myself to love him as much.

Now back to my eye disorder. There have been steady updates over time, but still nothing really conclusive or substantial. I'm in at least one medical journal for the shear oddity, and for those science-knowledgeable of you out there I will explain it as best I can. I was born with some scarring in my retinal tissue; I have abnormal vascular fluid; the veins in my eye are ""corkscrewed"" and there is a cloud of ""dust"" that's actually visible without any form of magnification if you simply get close (I can see it standing close enough to a mirror) in my pupil. It's obviously tiny without magnification. We find out in about 11th grade that my eye is actually hemorrhaging slowly over time, by popping blood vessels as a result of the twisted veins. The doctors now believe that I will have a stroke and it's only a matter of when. 

I mentioned that I'm generally emotionless, but I hide it very well. I can be sociable and no one will notice. In fact, no one has. Underlying that lack of emotion, though, there's a sort of overlaying sense of depression. I've been depressed for about 6 years, think about death or suicide usually once a day (never about acting on it, however, just how I would do it). 

So where to end up this horribly edited/ramble post here? Well, I guess where we started. My birthday is in May, as stated somewhere in the ramblings above, but I would prefer not to say how old, specifically (20s). I've been single my entire life and have basically given up/accepted it at this point. I'm having an incredibly shitty day and if one of you amazing people could somehow make it through this ungodly post and MMFB in any small way, I would be forever grateful. 

There's no real TLDR that I can post, as it would be almost as long as the original post, other than maybe the title. At the very least, thank you for letting me vent, and for reading whatever you end up reading. Have a great night/day."

I'm about to start an internship that involves a lot of heavy graphics programming in python. The laptop I currently have does not have a graphics card, and I don't know if this will have any effect on the speed or functionality of the programs on my computer. Should I get a graphics card, or will I be OK without it?"
