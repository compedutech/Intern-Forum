Hello,

I have recently accepted an offer from a company that I have interned over the summer. The problem is that I have not been doing too well in my classes this semester, and it seems like I won’t be able to graduate as a CS major. I have been pursuing a double major in CS and in another degree in social science, so I will have graduate with major in social science and minor in computer science. 

When I was filling out the intern transition application form, I only wrote down CS as my major because I thought I could pull this through and also because the HR representative told me to write down the major that is relevant. 

I graduate in May, and I would like to inform the company of my current situation, but I am just afraid of the consequences. Could they end the contract over this? I will be working in the Bay Area (CA). "

Should I return next Fall instead?,kaledo0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uxp2b/returning_from_an_internship_that_was_extended/,"My summer internship at Google was extended for an extra 3 months into the Fall semester. I figured I would be able to apply to full-time jobs at the top companies once I return in Spring, since I have always seen them recruit for FT positions in the Spring as well (e.g. FB, Google, Microsoft, etc.). But now I'm starting to worry I will be at a disadvantage if I return in Spring, and that perhaps I should consider taking a leave during the Spring and just returning the next Fall. Is it better to return the following Fall in this case, or should I return in Spring as planned?"
3uxpk6,6,2015-11-30,[UPDATE] I [21/F] feel hopelessly lonely.,MilknBones,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uxpk6/update_i_21f_feel_hopelessly_lonely/,"My initial post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tehqz/i_21f_feel_hopelessly_lonely/] didn't get a lot of attention but I received a lot of warming messages. So thank you.

/u/lanadeltorro asked for an update, and also I have some things to get off my chest so here it is.

Do I still feel lonely? Yes. But I now have a bigger duty to take care of other than myself.
My mother was very recently diagnosed with cancer.

Actually, I don't know where to start. It's all very complicated. She was visiting family in our home country (Korea) and she just got a check up because she's been having stomach problems. Seems like our family has a history of stomach cancer, 3 of her 4 uncles had stomach cancer too.

She got tested and initially the results came back with H. Pylori, which is some kind of ulcer causing bacteria? I don't know, the results were all in Korean and I'm not as fluent as I'd like to be (I left Korea when I was 2). She was supposed to come back today, in time for my sister's high school graduation tomorrow but she had more tests and it turns out the bacteria caused cancer. Now she just has to check how far it has spread so she's staying in Korea for more tests, but during our phone call she estimates she has about a year to live.

It all feels very surreal right now. She hasn't told me this to face yet, so it still doesn't feel real. The only thing that feels real is the statistics I found online and it doesn't look good.

Furthermore, my father and mother have been having problems for a while. There is some sort of financial battle going on between them (has been for a while), and inevitably will come to me when my mother passes. Back story, my father left us back for our Korea when he couldn't find a job here (his decision). He was supposed to come back after 3 years but it's been something like 16 or so years now, details removed, he just kinda started a new life.

I'll probably be my mother's primary caregiver when she gets back home. My younger sister who will turn 18 in a month will be starting university in a new city. I'm luckily studying in my city. It'll just be me and my mum next year.

My younger sister (the one that's graduating high school) knows that something serious is happening (serious enough for our mother to miss her graduation) but we haven't told her about the cancer yet but she'll inevitably pick it up because she's smart like that. We didn't want to tell her yet because she's doing her exams at the moment. She's going to visit Korea in a couple of weeks to be with my mum. I have an internship so I'm staying here.

My initial post was about how lonely I felt. I'm not sure how this will affect me in the long run. Right now, I don't even feel anything anymore. I cried all last night and couldn't sleep. At work I was totally zoned out, started crying in the foyer, a couple of people saw and asked if I was okay and I said yes. Otherwise I tried to act happy as always. I told my supervisor at work and he was understanding. I also told a coworker/friend and he's being supportive too in a coworker/friend type of way.

I told my boyfriend over phone call. He doesn't know how to react either. In my prior post I said he's the only person whose company I enjoy. But he's pretty distant and I don't want to appear too upset in front of him, I'm scared I'll push him away. I'm too scared to ask for his support because I have a big feeling he'll be bothered by it. He's been nice today, texting me and answering my phone calls even while he's at work. But he said he won't visit me today when I asked if he could come around. Then again, I did see him basically everyday for the past week and he's probably worn out of my company.

I honestly don't know how to talk to him without the worry of pushing him away. Before you tell me to break up with him, he does do some incredibly nice things for me too. He helps financially, and practically. Just not so much emotionally. (He's just not very good at this, he said it himself).

I'm not sure if this in an update, more of a ramble on about what's happening in my life right now because I feel like I just want to tell someone about it and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk about it with. Sorry for the long post.

   
**tl;dr**: I'm still lonely, but I now have a bigger duty. My mother has cancer. I'm going to be her primary caregiver. I need emotional support, but my boyfriend is not good with emotional stuff."

I recently changed my major to Business Administration. I am beginning to search for internships that will take place next summer. I am having a difficult time finding much. I have tried searching generally for ""internships"" and I have even tried searching for ""business internships."" What are some keywords that I should be using in my searches, and what more can I search to find better results. A lot of the job postings that I am finding are not even for internships. 

I am not certain what I want to do specifically, but I know that I want to work with people on a daily basis. Whether this is a consulting role, sales role, or something along those lines, I am sure I would thrive because I have excellent interpersonal skills.

What are some good websites to search for internships on? I have tried the job posting sites like Monster, Indeed, etc. and even Chegg Internships but I am not having much luck. Only a couple of things that really peak my interest!

Thank you for the help!

It's always been around christmas/ my birthday for whatever reason but every time I try to explain why I want to break up she doesn't listen then we end up back together.

This relationship doesn't make me feel happy. I guess the spark just isn't there for me but I have a hard time explaining that and if I try she just blames herself and then I feel bad and can never go through with the break up. She's always telling me how happy I make her and how great I am which just makes it harder. 

She also gets extremely jealous to the point where I am afraid to mention any other girls to her like friends coworkers etc.. She even gets mad when I talk to her sister for too long. It stresses me out. This entire relationship stresses me out along with, school, work, and an internship I feel like i'm always on the verge of falling apart. I know the answer to my ""problems"" is to end it and make myself happy but I just can't seem to do it.

My major is CS with concentrations in Software Engineering and Database. As I get closer to graduation (Dec '17), this feeling that I'm not going to stand a chance against graduates from other schools just keeps manifesting. I love my school's CS program personally, I've been able to develop amazing relationships with all of my CS professors and I am pretty well known due to my officer positions in various CS related clubs however, I feel like our curriculum doesn't cover a lot of technologies that apparently all these companies are looking for. For example the only thing I feel completely confident with at this moment in Java and C#(and I mean basic C# like creating a WinForm App, not .NET stuff). On my own time I've been reading up on Anjular.js and Node.js but I really don't see myself having knowledge in things like Spring, Scala, Akka, Guice, Hibernate ORM, Hadoop and all these other technologies by the time I graduate. A lot of the graduates at my school end up working for so-so companies nearby or defense contractors, but I want to work at other companies, not necessarily the ""Big 4"", but companies like Etsy, Whitepages, Flatiron, Groupon and SquareSpace. I'm scared because I really want to move to NYC after graduation and work possibly as a front-end developer however, I imagine NYC is a very competitive place for jobs in that space and I just feel like if it were to ever come between me and another candidate, I would get tossed aside. This is not to say that I'm not smart, I am. I love my classes, I make decent grades and I even have internship experience, I just feel like I'll be a basic CS student when I graduate and won't have anything great that will make me stand out (unless you count being a female of color, which I really don't). 

I'm honestly freaking out a little bit here guys so any feedback, advice and tips would be very much appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm an education major, which is the position I applied for. Im currently an instructional assistant in a school and I'm about to start my student teaching in an s.e.i class, which will help me since the position I'm being considered for is to teach English. Besides the current teaching I've  been doing, I have had almost 300 internship hours in various classroom settings from k-7th grade as well as in special education classrooms. I've also had experience volunteering out of the classroom as well. I compete in pageants and have won a few different titles in various systems, with my platform always being ""education for all"". I've done work with charity organizations, homeless shelters, and other work. I also have taught dance classes for the past 10 years. I'm confident with myself and with my resume, but I'm starting to doubt whether I'll be chosen for anything or not. The biggest concern I have is that when I submitted my application I didn't have my teaching license and I'm afraid that that will keep them from picking me. However, I'll get my license before I graduate in April. 

What are the chances of me being picked?  And what do they look for? Also, if I do get interviewed, what type of questions will be asked? And where is the interview conducted?

I am a Computer Science/Mathematics student at the University of Kentucky and just landed an internship in Atlanta GA for the spring semester. Instead of searching for an apartment first I am going to do AirBnB and stay for two weeks until I get my school financial aid. This will run me about $800 instead of $2200 for a deposit and first months rent on an apartment. I also have to pay ~$150 for a rental car to get to the new city. I have money to make it in Lexington but my budget does not cover an entire new place in a city (with higher cost of living).

I will receive financial aid through the university in the amount of $13,000, which will be dispersed to me in a few smaller payments throughout the month of January. The internship pays $4150 a month as well, so I will have no problem paying the money back. The entire situation is just bad timing, as I will have plenty of money about a month after I need it. I am able to provide any proof that is requested. As stated in the title I need $1000 and can pay back $1250, I am willing to negotiate on that as well (as I don't have another option).

And no, this actually isn't about anything romantic actually, which might make it even worse :(


I have/had a really good friend, Daisy, who've I've known since middle school. We grew up together, and ended up going to university together. We've been each other confidantes about many things: life, family, relationships, etc. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but no, we have never had a relationship with one another besides friendship.

===== Background =====

In our last year of school, I was present at two points in Daisy's life that haunt both me and her to this day:

The first point was when she and I were hanging out, and she was debating accepting an offer from a company she had interned at over the summer. We had talked during that summer and it was clear the internship stressed her out immensely, and as she hovered over the job offer, she talked about how she was very unsure about whether or not she should take the job offer since it would contractually bind her to the position for 2 years. She ended up also calling her mother, although I do not recall what advice her mother had given her. What I do remember is telling her not to take the position if she didn't want it. I told her that if such a company (and it was a fairly prestigious one) would take her, then she could go somewhere else that might make her happier. She ended up rejecting the offer, and continued to apply to other jobs.


Fast forward a few months, I check in with Daisy and ask her to hang out, since she seemed stressed out about work and study at the time. We start talking about how we're both doing, and it becomes clear she is feeling buried by the amount of schoolwork,  extracurricular obligations, and job hunting. I try to cheer her up by trying to help her find activities that she enjoys doing and convincing her to invest some time in those things. At that point, she completely breaks down into tears, and as I try to console her and  restore her composure enough to ask her what was wrong, she tells me she has realized at that very moment that she doesn't do anything anymore that makes her happy. She continues sobbing, and I do my best to help her stay together. When I had to leave that night, I informed her other best friends about the situation, and to keep me in the loop. We agree later on that I should keep my distance for a while.

We both graduate still thinking of each other as good friends. After I ended up finding a job and moving to another city, I eventually lost touch with her as I got sidetracked with learning how to be an adult.

===== Present =====

Recently, I've been trying to reach out to Daisy. After 2 separate attempts over a month to get in touch with her, I got radio silence. I sent one final message on Facebook messenger saying that I think of her as a good friend, and I respect any wishes she might have not to speak to me, and stopped trying to talk to her.

Tonight, I got one message from Daisy saying saying that she thinks of me as a good friend, and apologizes for the lack of contact; she has been avoiding social media for mental health reasons, and continued unemployment hasn't helped  her either. But she ended the message saying she would still like to catch up.

I respond with a message wishing her well, and trying to set up a time to talk. Thanks to the uncomfortable tracking abilities of Facebook messenger, I know that she has seen the message, and didn't respond back.

===== The Dilemma =====

I am wracked with guilt that my past interactions with Daisy have taken an intelligent woman that was full of life and completely dragged her down through the dumps. I have never forgotten those two moments, where I know for certain I am responsible for the way she is now. I had always thought she would recover and bounce back with time, and it's clear that isn't the case. I would do anything, even ruin my own friendship with her, to restore her happiness and stability.

If we ever get in touch again, I want to apologize to her and explain to her that I have never forgotten the moments where I have messed up her life, and that I accept any hatred or grudges or anything she holds against me. However, I am extremely worried that doing so might relapse her road to recovery, thus adding to the count of times I've been a disaster in her life.

I'm looking for any thoughts or opinions as to how to approach this. Do I tell her? Or do I wait until I think she is in a better place? Or do I not tell her at all?

tl;dr **I, and I alone, was present at key conversations in my friend's life that ultimately have left her jobless and made her go through a mental breakdown. We're connecting again, and I need to know how to make amends, please help.**

-Past jobs (totally unrelated to CS, one government job at a park and a fast food job)

-Languages I am knowledgeable in (Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript...)

**Now my question is:**

Is it appropriate, at my level, to include projects done in class on my resume?

Some projects this semester have been:

**Word Cloud**:
Loads in a .txt file, adds the words (except the common ones) to a linked list and counts each word, setting the size of that word according to how many times it appears in the .txt file. 

**Sudoku Solver**:
This was for our recursion section. We created a 6x6 Sudoku Solver.

Anyways, I was pulled into this new role sideways with a team that has been together for about a year. My background and education did not prepare me at all for distributed systems work (I entered devops purely from tinkering but have a background in webapps and very low level electrical/computer engineering) I am constantly depressed and anxious every day because I literally do not know half the jargon being thrown around and have no idea how to contribute to open source/work on an open source code base. On top of that all of the tribal knowledge makes it impossible for me to handle configuration tasks because I don't know what all the company plumbing is. On my old team we had a newer guy but veteran engineer who was just as lost as I was and we figured things out together. This team is going at 100mph and hasn't really taken a new grad ever. Anyways, I feel like I'm floundering and making no progress. There is no net for me or small one off projects I can work on because I literally do not get the code base I'm supposed to work with. On top of that we have 2-team sprints where everyone tries to show off their progress, bullshit or not, in glorified status update meetings. I feel like half of my time is spent wtfing over company specific plumbing, confused to shit with distributed systems stuff, and worrying about the stupid shit I will say during meetings. Everyone on this team is probably an average of 10 years older than me so it is also very lonely. 

I apologize for the rant, but I need some advice. Should I switch teams? Suck it up and try to learn? Quit and find a job with a culture more suited to me? Thanks"

How are you doing?

I got an internship during the summer and one of the tasks that I had was to plot some data in Scatter / Bubble Chart, however, I still struggling with it. 

Just to give a short background about the data: The data were collected in a small-scale fisheries community in American Samoa through a survey. This surveys had two question that I need to turn into only one plot. Those questions are similar, but the first one ask about ""total CATCH"" and the second one ask about ""amount o TIME"". I need to relate both answers in only one plot, for example: 

- Answer 1: 24) Much more / 25) More
- Answer 2: 24) Much more / 25) Less
- Answer 3: 24) Less / 25) More
- Answer 4: 24) Much more / 25) Less

According to these answers, I should have:
- One ball in the intersection between ""Much more catch and More time""
- One ball in the intersection between ""Less catch and More time""
- One ball in the intersection between ""Much more catch and Less time""
- Two balls in the intersection between ""Much more catch and Less time""

The image bellow is an extract of the survey question and the exact plot that I want. See that the catch is in the Y axis and the time in the X axis. 

I forgot to mention that each (5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, Started fishing) will be one plot, so I will have one plot for 5 years ago, one plot for 10 years ago, and so on.

Here you can see the ideal plot and also the questions:

Hopefully, you will understand my question! It is extremely difficult to explain it! haha

Thank you so much for your help! You will help me tremendously!

3uz70n,8,2015-12-01,Great Privilege. Not Appreciating it.,4seriousaccount,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3uz70n/great_privilege_not_appreciating_it/,"I'm in school. My parents aren't and haven't paid for anything. I can't get around taking out loans even with financial aid. So I'm going into debt, which is giving me more anxiety, and I'm continuing to work while putting myself through school. Also, I'm 28 and still getting my B.S. 


I'm surrounded by so many people younger than me. I've watched the upper-middle class and upper class friends graduate, go on to grad school, medical school. While I'm still putting myself through my B.S. in hopes of getting into Grad or Med school. 


All the while, I'm still paying for my college, working, while trying to maintain a 3.0+ GPA. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know, I've met, and I'm surrounded by a LOT of rich kids while trying to go into med school. Their parents pay for everything, they don't and haven't worked. They're allowed to go take unpaid internships, volunteer at hospitals and put themselves into positions where getting into med school becomes increasingly more easy because they don't have to worry about things like rent, car payments, food, or family obligations.


I've listened to one of my friends complain that she could no longer buy a new car because money her grandparents were going to give her now had to be used for medical expenses for her grandpa. Now she holds it against her grandparents.


They still complain. They whine about not getting in the first try. They whine about their 3.9 GPA. Professors are unfair. They deserve better. Their ""old"" 2004 subaru. I'm sick of the entitlement. No, you're not God's gift to the world. You don't deserve anything. You're not very special. The world owes you nothing. 


You want something? Work hard for it. Persevere, use your cunning to get where you want. Exercise your reasoning skills and further your knowledge base. This is the way the world SHOULD work, right? 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel somewhat cheated. I wasn't given the opportunity to go to college directly out of highschool. My parents had 8 kids and were still in the middle class. That wasn't taken into account. I never got financial aid because my parents still made enough to put me through college (hah!). I got out of HS with a 3.4 GPA. I never got any advice or guidance for getting into college, I couldn't enroll in after-school activities during HS because I was working full time to help support my now single mother and the other 4 kids still living at the house. At 28, colleges don't look kindly to those that don't go to college immediately after highschool, at least as far as finances go. 


When I look at my ""circumstances"" in comparison to my friends now, I can see a stark contrast. College now rewards those who have money. The privileged have an even greater advantage now than I think they did earlier in our country's history. The rich are getting richer and power is becoming increasingly tighter in its circle.


Sometimes, I look at my ""circumstances"" and I'm tempted to bitch about it like I have above. But in the long run, I prefer it. I've seen first hand what happens to people when they're given what they ""want"" without having to work for it. They're unhappy. They're depressed. They have psychiatric disorders. What the hell am I actually bitching about anyway? I live in the United States. It's EXTREMELY hard to fail. You fail in other countries and you DIE. I have no room to bitch. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm still VERY privileged and have nothing to complain about. Bring on the hardship.


In ways, I feel bad for those who complain, the depressed, those with anxiety disorders. In other ways, I see a level of justice in the outcomes of the world. Those who are given, without work, everything they've ""wanted,"" they turn out depressed. They're unsatisfied. 


Those who have nothing, appreciate the world so much more. When given the chance to change the world, they penetrate and change the world around them for the better. Teachers, doctors, friends, professors, researchers, and so on. You've met them. You remember them. You probably still talk to them. These people are given such an extraordinary gift to change the world. 


The stipulation is this: It's hard. It's lonely. It breaks your heart. I don't see any other way around this.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm older than those around me. I don't belong to the richer circles that surround me. Even if I do end up making a lot of money, I don't think I'll ever be able to relate to them. I don't want to. Those who endure hardship and persevere are amazing people. They appreciate the world so much more and they are true friends. I'm grateful for my ""circumstances."" 


I will persevere. I will work harder. Through hardship, I will better myself. 


I'm done listening to the bitching though. Myself included."
3uz7np,1,2015-12-01,20F4A - The Dark Journey to Stardom - From Secretary to Super Star,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3uz7np/20f4a_the_dark_journey_to_stardom_from_secretary/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


----------


I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K Messenger, skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

The position can be anywhere in the US. I'm more than willing to relocate. I'm going to graduate school in data sciences for the fall of 2016 so I am looking for something till then.

I've applied to more jobs than I count with little to no responses back and I assume it is mostly due to my GPA. Admittedly they are very competitive jobs at top tier actuarial and data analytics firms. I am currently applying to tutoring jobs in Mathematics. I have perfect scores in the math sections of the GRE, SAT and SAT subject tests so I thought I would be hired for sure but no luck so far. My areas of academic background are math, econ and stats but I have 0, and I repeat, 0 work or intern experience. What kind of jobs can I apply to that are sure to get me hired and pay me atleast 3000$ per month to live on? I am worried since it is already December and I haven't even had an interview. Please help.

3uzmeg,2,2015-12-01,I don't know what is happening to me,oom9,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3uzmeg/i_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_me/,"Hello everyone. I just made an account in reddit but i love to browse /r/Askreddit. I am usually scared of talking about myself but since I have nobody to talk about this. So here i am, oom9, I'm French (sorry for my english).
Until my 16th birthday i was a pretty happy guy, i always felt different but i didn't care since i had good friends. I had a good enought armor which protected me from sadness until i encounter some suicidal tendencies : i was in love with my best friend, she didn't. I was the kind of guy who was posting his misery on facebook but nobody cared and from this point i realized that the world was far from what i expected, that i was so naive. I also realized that my parents despite being  generally nice were depressing me : my mother is like a chinese father, i had to get good grades, become a doctor etc. Once i finished highschooll, i had to choose my path. My mother wants my hapiness but can't help to define her hapinness as my hapiness. I remember, i went with my parents to a doctor. My parents told it was just a classic health check. I passed many tests (earing, sight, etc). I began to be suspicious when the doctor asked me to touch my balls (for cancer you know). When i asked her why, we both realized i had no idea what i was doing here. In fact, it was a big health check for entering in military doctors school. We were both like WTF??? The doctor then spoke to my mother telling her it's not her choice but mine and then she asked what i wanted to do. I didn't have a clue but i felt i had to say something so i said computering because i loved videogames.
Well this story shows how my mother is (she also sent my sister to an asylum because she was bipolar). I still love her in a certain way because she can't help it and just want my hapiness but she is terribly hurtful and my father just do nothing (he is still very nice).
I met my best friend during my computering studies. We were really really close, so close that i was scared that people would joke on us being gay. My best friend had very high morals standards, he was so depressed because of the world where we live. Yet, he was super jealous and he always got mad when i hung out with other people (specially a girl). In his head, 99% of the population were selfish people, sheeps etc.

I was very unhappy with my studies and computering wasn't for me. I was pretty sad because i had to work in this sector until i'm 60 and really didn't feel it (when i was young i wanted to be an archeologist but couldnt because of my mother). i began to be fed up with my lealous Best Friend. Then my sister told me about genius people, i read a book about how i was sad because i was different from others be cause i was maybe a genius. I found a lot of my thoughts in this book and decided to take an IQ test (my best friend too). Well, the book was right, i was a genius (but i don't feel superior). I was really angry because i realized i was a smart guy and i spoiled it by doing computering instead of something that pleased.

This year, i decided that i was going nowhere with my best friend. I met a nice girl, unfortunately she was the girlfriend of one of my friends. She hit on me while we were all in a bar and we kissed in front of her boyfriend. I have to tell you i wasn't proud of it nor the girl but we were both drunk and the boyfriend forgave me. When i told this story to my best friend, he lost his shit and spend 1 hour making me more awful.
Months later, the girl breaks up with the boyfriend and we make out. I was feeling in love with this girl but i didn't want to be a douchebag so i went to see her ex. He told me this ""Be careful oom9, she can fell in love real fast but she can also break away real fast too"". Well i tought he was just being jealous so i didn't pay attention.
I told my best friend that i had a girlfriend but i wanted to still remain friends with him (he cried, was angry at me) and now we see eachother once/twice a week. Sometimes i regret leaving him but then i remember how jealous he is and i think it's for the better.

Real relationships are weird. At te beginning everything was cool with my GF. I did some mistakes : i was always late when i had to go her home. She is really insecure and seeks help by talking. The problem is that we live far from eachother and she needed to call me to discuss about her life. I don't like socials medias, phones so i fount it pretty uncool but heh it tried to phone her etc.
3 days ago i really fucked up, i went to her home late she was really angry (aka she was fixing the void when i was with her). When i asked her what was the problem, she began to cry. Well, she thinks I am not enought commited (i have to phone more and be more organized). Well, ok i promised to change but then she said ""im sorry but if you re not here, i will seek attention somewhere else. I m talking to a guy via Facebook and i begin to fantasize"". Wasted. She was crying because she knew i was doidng efforts and she was shameful for fantasizing about others guys even if she loves me.
I really love her. I understand her feelings and i can't help thinking it's my fault (i'am late, i don't like to talk with SMS/facebook) and i have to change.
But i can't help thinking about my live :
-my studies suck. I don't want to work hard for money. I don't care about money. I'm feeling like i have learn nothing and won't find the internship i seek.
-my parents suck. My mother is an helicopter parent and my father doesn't care.
-Things are differents with my bestfriend. It will never be like before.
- I'm feeling like an hostage in my relationship (improve yourself or i ll find another personn). I know i have to improve myself but can't stop thinking about the guys she is texting. I could know if it's serious or not but i don't want to investigate her PC.

So i'm thinking about suicides everyday. I don't want to do it but i think about it all the time ""I don't want to die now, maybe later in my life"". I'm trapped by myself and my thoughts. It's awful i don't know what to do.

I am an intern in a big company and I met this guy through a common friend. I really had no intention of dating him and I saw him as an older brother and a mentor, but everyone in the office were teasing me with him despite the age difference. We'd hang out a lot with friends. When there were moments when we're alone, he'd hold my hand, cuddle with me, sleep on my lap, etc. In short, he was giving me weird signals. 

Fast forward to my birthday, two nights before, he messaged me saying that he couldn't make it to my party (although, I only had the intention of inviting him and told a common friend about it but I never invited him yet) and he'd want to make it up to me by watching a movie with me (Inside Out). I agreed since I had no other plans. Things got a little tense after the movie when we went to his flat and we made out and hooked up. He added: ""he just wants to make out with me"". So okay, I thought, I wasn't really into him so I played it cool and went home.

Few months after, we saw each other a lot through several meetups with friends. We'd play tabletop games and we'd go to bars with friends obviously. He opened up to me about his ex-girlfriend of seven years and her dating again made him feel so broken. Being a good friend, I told him that I was going out on a three day vacation and he might want to join the tour so he could take his mind off stuff. He agreed. 

Nights prior to the vacation trip, he took me to his place and after some time hanging out with him, he'd start kissing me and when things got so intense, we hooked up. It happened twice. I still played it cool, but I never asked why. But deep down, I've started hating myself because I know he's playing me around. 

I wanted to confront him about the kiss, but the vacation trip happened. I couldn't bring up the topic since it might ruin the vacation, obviously. But while we were on the trip, he started to distance himself around me and he rarely talked to me throughout. It made me sad not being able to enjoy the trip and he was acting weird. A common friend said that he might be dealing with his ex-girlfriend (probably they're patching things up). When we came back, I apologized (I don't know why) for my strange behavior and I told him I was really stressed seeing him like that. He apologized too, after that we never talked.

Recently, things have become more awkward and I feel that both of us are trying to avoid and become distant to one another. In a recent hangout with a common friend, we're totally separated from one another and we wouldn't look at each other in the eye. Although, I did try reaching out to him and me wanting to remain his friend, but he was acting all jittery and anxious around me. 

I can't tell anyone who probably would know what could be the problem since I'm working in that company and things might get weird in the office.
   
**tl;dr**: I was an intern, met this guy who is seven years older than me. We hooked up and I hate myself. Currently trying to fix the friendship but he's not helping me out. Trying to figure out what I did wrong. How to deal with this and move on? "

I'm currently a junior at a medium sized university in VA. My major is CS with concentrations in Software Engineering and Database. As I get closer to graduation (Dec '17), this feeling that I'm not going to stand a chance against graduates from other schools just keeps manifesting. I love my school's CS program personally, I've been able to develop amazing relationships with all of my CS professors and I am pretty well known due to my officer positions in various CS related clubs however, I feel like our curriculum doesn't cover a lot of technologies that apparently all these companies are looking for. For example the only thing I feel completely confident with at this moment in Java and C#(and I mean basic C# like creating a WinForm App, not .NET stuff). On my own time I've been reading up on Anjular.js and Node.js but I really don't see myself having knowledge in things like Spring, Scala, Akka, Guice, Hibernate ORM, Hadoop and all these other technologies by the time I graduate. A lot of the graduates at my school end up working for so-so companies nearby or defense contractors, but I want to work at other companies, not necessarily the ""Big 4"", but companies like Etsy, Whitepages, Flatiron Health, Groupon and SquareSpace. I'm scared because I really want to move to NYC after graduation and work possibly as a front-end developer however, I imagine NYC is a very competitive place for jobs in that space and I just feel like if it were to ever come between me and another candidate, I would get tossed aside. This is not to say that I'm not smart, I am. I love my classes, I make decent grades and I even have internship experience, I just feel like I'll be a basic CS student when I graduate and won't have anything great that will make me stand out (unless you count being a female of color, which I really don't).

I'm honestly freaking out a little bit here guys so any feedback, advice and tips would be very much appreciated. Thank you!"

   I'm looking for my first internship!  I grew up in Worthington and now am a junior in college (out of state/country).  During the summer months, I return to Columbus to live with my parents (although, depending on where I get to intern, that may change).  I'm doing a double major in economics and geography, but I don't really know what I want to do with my degree when I graduate.  Because of this, I'm open to a wide range of summer internship experiences.

   I would love to hear the opportunities you know about in the Columbus area.  If any of you have interned at any companies in town, hearing about your experience would be a big help.  So far, I have applied to a couple of investment management groups, and I plan on applying to Sherrod Brown's office soon.  


general technical skills:
-some GIS (this would be a cool thing to learn more of through an an internship)
-Microsoft Excel
-some Java coding

note: I am open to internships that require these skills (especially GIS), but I am certainly not insisting that the internship I pursue involves them

If i could get financial aid then it will be great but my parents are okay with fees are around 40k annually.  
I am looking for colleges with good CS programs and a good computer science ranking. Possibly good job /internship oppurtunities also. I loved doing Extra Curricular activities like going to other schools for computer competitions during high school but I am not sure how these things work during college. I am really passionate about Computers, Technology and programming, I am looking for a place where I can change my ""hobbies"" to a real job or way to actually earn.  Applying to top 10 or top 20 is way out of legue with this ACT score. 
I am already applying to Purdue, Rutgers, UIUC, University of Houston and UTDallas so similar schools would be prefered.

Need some advice about how to best prepare for an SDE1 role in AWS at Amazon. I feel like I may have skated through the process and landed this gig. I have never worked as a developer at a large tech company (no prior technical internship experience). I have little sense of what types of skills to have for a base-level programmer (git, basic unit tests, etc.). 

I attend a top-10 school and have only been studying CS for the latter half of my school career after switching into it from another discipline (which is why I do not have prior dev experience). 

Some things I am considering to prepare:

* Set up a few dev projects using AWS services (hosting on an instance, using a data store, etc.)
* Reading books like Clean Code

Beyond that I'm not sure what else to do. I'm worried that I'll be sniffed out as incompetent in the first few weeks/months and potentially end up on a PIP.

Any advice you all may have would be much appreciated."

 The only jobs I currently see are for an aviation joint, but the job description seems to require some electrical engineering knowledge and I can barely build an arduino circuit let alone a robust one. 
It seems like most companies are looking for senior developers or asking for 5 plus years. I've read that if they say 1 or 2 years then you can usually get away as a beginner but you don't want to be very far under what they ask for.
I'm not sure what to do to get started. I've asked places for internships as well and provided my github and bitbucket and nobody responds. Yet I have a friend in the industry saying I should be able to land a job with the knowledge I know. 
It kind of seems like I need to relocate, but I can't afford to do so at the moment as I don't have an income. I'd be willing to work remotely or relocate if a company offered but i dont think a company would want to pay for me to relocate as a junior dev.

It's even hard for me to articulate this well, to confirm that I've got too many things going on in my mind and I'm stuck like never in my life. 

Quick summary: 33yo, lived in Australia for 7 years, recently moved back home (Europe) to assist my family with my mum's impromptu heart surgery. She's now well and beautiful. My parents love me. Financially we're ok, they do own two apartments and one commercial premise. I'm a lucky MF. I'm very social, lots of friends, although I just moved from a 5m people city to a 3,500 small town and I'm feeling like shit as I won't ever be able to live here again. My parents don't ask me to stay here, they just want me to be happy (although that means financially happy, to my mum)

My biggest issue is work. I don't know what I wanna do. I've never known. I know that sport is my passion, but given that a) I didn't wanna spend my weekends with elderly b) it had years and years of internships ahead c) i wanted to travel I didn't pursue my initial career in journalism. I went for business and I've been quite successful at it (always worked for someone).


A year ago, I quit my job - high salary, great lifestyle, fastest growing company in the country. I hated the job and the people I was working for. I wasn't learning anymore. I was, honestly, close to the point where they were gonna fire me. I lost my challenge to be successful, so I gave up and admitted failure instead of just earning $$. I tried to figure it out, I gave up, I was just fed with it.

I went traveling and haven't worked since. I wake up in the morning, have breakfast and go back to my bedroom where I read Reddit or read a) travel blogs b) think about companies I could start.
This is killing me as I **don't know what I wanna do in my life**

I know what I don't want: I don't wanna be locked in an office 5 days a week for the rest of my life, even if that means I could earn good $$. I don't wanna work in something I hate (just reading SEO SEM makes me vomit). My previous job was quite unique as I did manage 70 people who did a bunch of stuff, you can't really narrow it down - I basically ran the dirty part of the business, telling people what to do. Didn't enjoy being always under stress and not learning anything.

What's my passion? It's sports. What would I do? 
a) I'm thinking about working and traveling. Like many crazy travelers, just go and figure it out. And wait for ""The sign"". 
b) Get a temporary job and settle in a new city. Learn something in the meantime. Meet people. Talk to them. Discuss ideas.
One day I wanna be a photographer, one day a music producer, one day a Personal Trainer, a video maker. What would priority be for me? Be location independent. I love my family, but I can't live in this sh*Thole where people my age are already ""dead"". I wanna travel and live abroad, although being 24hrs flight away from my parents was tough. I'd go back if I could come back three times a year...so maybe starting a business is in the cards.


I'm an asshole, let me tell you. I'm reading Reddit stories and I realize how lucky I am. There's some serious sh*t and I'm here complaining with something I can actually deal with. I can change things if I want to. Some redditors have lost families, jobs, they can't control their future. I can. What the hell is stopping me then? 

I'm so fkn confused, sometimes I think I'm depressed and all these thoughts in my head make me thing I'm shit. My mum even went back to work after 2 heart surgeries and I feel like shit, who the fk am I fooling? Happy to answer any question. Sorry for venting.

We've had nearly all of our adult life experiences together, I've never had a better friend and it's icing on the cake that we are romantically involved as well.  We have lived together for one year at this point, and there have been no fights and our relationship seems to only improve with time.  She really is my better half.

We have both told each other that there isn't a single other person that could make us as happy as we make eachother, and I can't see this ending at any point.  We are essentially soul mates, and I would go on and on but it's hard to describe these things in text and I'll save your time.

Basically, I'm 100% sure I love her and she's 100% sure she loves me, I've gotten talked to by her father about marrying her before so I know her family would not be opposed.  No one can say that their marriage will not end in divorce, but I at least know it wouldn't tragically end within two years like a lot of marriages.

This has started to weigh down on my mind since we began looking at properties together in Atlanta, she got an internship there, and if everything goes well I will be teaching there (or something, Atlanta has one of the largest growing job markets in the world.)

Just part of me feels like I'm 21 (I will 22 if/when I marry her) and this may be too young to make such a decision.  But I can't think of a friend, family member, or anyone that I'm anywhere near as close to, and I can't see us separating.  I've been told there are many financial incentives to getting married, and employers see it as a big plus on your resume if you are married because it may be a sign of responsibility / willingness to stay in the area?

I do not plan on having kids until I have an established career.

I find myself in a shitty spot in life and wanted to reach out for help from fellow RPers because I expect a certain amount of truth from the community. 

Personally, I fancy myself an intellectually curious person. I know a lot about history, politics, economics, and current events. I take care of myself and have been lifting regularly for the last 5 years. I’m single and I’m what some of you would call purple pill. I still date but it’s very unlikely I will ever get married or have children. 

A little background. I grew up in Pittsburgh and joined the Marine Corps shortly after graduation. I did 4 years as an aviation ordnance man and completed my contract with an honorable discharge. I also did a tour in Iraq. After college, I attended Penn State University on the GI Bill and received 2 B.A.s. One in Political Science and one in Economics. I ended up graduating with a 3.25 GPA and completed a summer internship with the Pennsylvania Governor’s office. 
So then came graduation. I went on about 10 interviews for various positions and no offers. The positions varied. Some claims adjusting positions for insurance companies. Some various positions in the banking industry. I got rejected from all of them. I ended up getting a job as an office temp making $12.00 an hour with no benefits. This whole experience has been a huge bitch slap to the face. I’ve never felt like I was entitled to anything but I was expecting at least something after putting this work in. 

Anyways, my point of this post isn’t to whine, but to ask for advice going forward. I don’t see too much room for advancement where I’m at now. I am currently enrolled for classes in Cyber Security at the local community college. This is the best move forward I could think of at this time. However, my past decisions have got me to where I am now. So I just wanted to reach out to the community and entertain some better moves forward. 

Please answer only if you have ideas on moving forward as opposed to ridiculing past decisions. Thanks in advance.

3v1v3k,2,2015-12-01,I [19M] am struggling immensely with feelings for an ex-girlfriend [18F],SunandFun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3v1v3k/i_19m_am_struggling_immensely_with_feelings_for/,"Hi everyone, just looking to hopefully get a little advice here in order to figure out what to do because I could really use it right now. I'll try to keep this brief.

This all started roughly five years ago when I met my first girlfriend on the first day of high school. We began dating eight months after we met and carried on all the way through high school. Yes, we endured all the drama and nonsense of a high school relationship. Being just children, our relationship was initially hardly a topic worth any serious thought or consideration. However, we stayed together the whole way through. We changed so much over those four years. By graduation, we were entirely different people from who we were when we first met each other, but we still loved each other in what felt like an unconditional way. Say what you will about the emotional immaturity of teenagers and the lack of serious connections at my age, but it felt like it was meant to be. We would have done anything for each other and to stay together, or so I thought.

Over the summer between graduation and university, I broke up with her. Long story short, I convinced myself it needed to end. We were headed in different directions as far as school choice went and neither one of us wanted to throw away our aspirations, academic pursuits, and ideal school choice. I decided that if we truly loved each other, we would let each other go in order to pursue new lives without baggage and worries. Though it absolutely broke my heart, I had total peace that I was doing the right, logical thing. She wanted to try long-distance, but I refused and said it defeated the purpose of letting go of high school baggage. 

The breakup completely crushed her; she had to get counseling and therapy and had a pretty serious bout with clinical depression, but six months later she rebounded and finally moved on. On the other hand, though I was heartbroken at first, I got over it very quickly. I felt like I was throwing away a once in a lifetime love but I took great solace in the fact that it made logical sense and seemed to promise a baggage-free college experience, and within a month or so I was extremely happy we had parted ways.

In the following months, I essentially forgot about her and fell out of contact. I had many encounters and short relationships with other girls. I would say that I was totally moved and she was distant memory. I never thought of her or worried about her. Furthermore, when I found out that we ended up at schools 2000 miles apart I felt even more vindicated in my decision to split up. Over a year later and two months into my higher education, I felt like everything had worked out perfectly for me.

This has all recently changed. 

Roughly a month and a half ago, she reached out to me over social media. We started talking about college life, internships, classes, etc. It was nice to talk to her and see her doing well, but I was partially annoyed she had tried to reconnect with me - I wanted the past to stay the past. After that, we spoke very casually and sporadically; just when we both had time and nothing better to do. Well, one night about three weeks after we started talking again, she told me she missed being with me. I have no idea what it was about those words that did it, but something changed inside of me. I swear, every emotion from four years of loving this girl boiled over in a split second and I fell back in love with her in that instant. All my feelings crashed down on me like a tonne of bricks. I was overwhelmed and confused but my heart felt like it was on fire for her.

I realize the irrationality and impulsive nature of such feelings and that I likely made a huge mistake reconnecting with her. I am not posting here for advice on how to win her back (though that's all I can think to do right now). Rather, I need to find out how to move on again because I am in a dark place. Every morning, I now wake up and feel like I threw away the most important thing I've ever had. She is the first and last thing I think about every single day. Pictures of her on social media with other people incite a jealousy in me so strong that I can barely stand it. I am depressed and I want to sleep every day away until I can see her again. I can't even hardly focus on my studies or social life because I am having a hard time imagining my future without her. In complete honesty, this is 180* turn from where I was two months ago; I barely even cared about her two months ago.

The sad thing is she isn't a heart breaker or manipulator - I didn't fall into a trap of hers or something. See, she didn't reach out to me to get back together, she just wanted to reestablish a platonic friendship; I am the one who has gone crazy. In fact, she's told me many times since that she doesn't need me anymore and has moved on. She has a new life now that doesn't have room for me. But here I am, torn to pieces. For the sake of brevity, I'll spare further explanation of my emotions. Just know that I am really, really in love with this girl again.

Can anyone offer me advice? What should I do? Does this sound like it could be mental illness? I have a counseling appointment set up already and a tentative date with a psychiatrist afterward. I feel like I am totally out of control and any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.
   
TL;DR: Broke up with a girl I loved because I believed it was the best/right thing to do, moved on and forgot about her over the course of a year, but a recent re-connection has me head over heels in love again. How do I move on and get over her?"

1. I am a 24 year old male. The fact that I am mostly expected to make the first move is a big hindrance. I don't know WHERE I can do such a thing, especially if I don't go clubbing or go to bars. I live in a part of the UK where strangers aren't so social or open to each other. Of course, this is the way the world is and I can't just whine so I am working on that.

2. I come from a traditional family from a part of the world where sexual relationships before marriage aren't the norm. And I live with my parents. This is not a complaint. I intend to keep my romantic life separate from my family life for the time being. I want to respect my parents, and also take things very slowly, as my only previous relationship of 4 years was terrible. Is this off-putting?

3. Finally, my attitude towards sex is complex, because of my upbringing. Long story short, I enjoy it but I had it only a couple of times before. And usually afterwards I feel quite guilty and bad. I don't know if people who were raised in a predominantly ""Western"" way have the same thing. I did hear about everyone experiencing a ""down"" after having sex. Would my attitude, and lack of experience be an issue?

The ladies on here are especially welcome to tell me what they think.

Although I live with my parents at my age, I am not a ""loser"". I have a part time job in a kitchen. And am starting an internship soon related to my masters degree (international law). So I have a rough plan. I am also intending to publish independent work on semi-professional blogs related to the field; nothing too serious. So I will be busy as is, but I am feeling lonely and ready for a companion.

Anyway, if you have read up to here then thank you.

Most of the time I stopped projects because I started working more for my father in construction, which made it difficult to come home and put my head in code, when I wanted to come home and sleep and binge eat cause my body hurt from work lol.

I know a decent amount(probably just enough) about HTTP requests and how they work and working with JSON data and creating web services to provide data to multi platform applications. I can usually hack my way through most problems I have encountered. I've even tried my hand at game programming quickly realizing I am better off staying with web applications and services and building api's. I have done things like wire up and code an arduino circuit that sent the ambient room temperature via a bluetooth connection to a android app I put together to simply display the temperature, or write a script that downloaded xml files that provided country names states cities populations zipcodes etc and parse the info out into SQL scripts to create a database seed for development purposes to build a craigslist like website a friend of mine was trying to build.

Project turned out to be a little much for me seeing as I lack knowledge and experience of designing scalable applications from the ground up. I also at the time was working a lot with my dad in construction so the project kinda became forgotten about.

I am at a point in life where I feel I really need to start my career, being 25 years old I feel like it's going to get harder the older I get to start an entry level job, but I am having trouble getting any response from a company.

So selling myself to a company makes me feel like I'm lying because I have no idea if I am going to be able to be a valuable employee, or if I'm in over my head. I am not good at bullshitting people let alone conversing with people in general. I am a very introverted person and really don't talk to anyone. I only know one developer and he lives on the other side of the US. I am willing to relocate or work remotely and even work a paid internship (or heck maybe even free for now if I don't have to relocate) if it means getting experience and gaining knowledge to become a more marketable developer. I am currently feeling incredibly overwhelmed trying to find a job, and feeling like maybe I am just not cut out for the industry. I'm sure once I'm in with the right people I could absorb like crazy and excel at it. Anyways any guidance would be awesome. Maybe there are some books out there that can help me become versed in software development therefore more comfortable, as all I have ever read have been language or framework books basically. Just looking for the golden nuggets of information that will make it all make sense to me and help push me past this point in my life into a lifelong career that's capable of financially supporting myself. Thanks."

As someone who is experienced with and who enjoys working with GNU Bash on OSX, I relish the opportunity of using that knowledge to earn a gainful income (not to mention, stability!).

Based on cursory research, it seems that knowledge of Solaris and possession of the relevant Oracle certifications is in fairly high demand.

Basically, I'd like to know if there are employers out there that cover Solaris training and certifications for entry-level employees. I haven't had any luck finding such information, though I've put out other feelers. Also, I've applied to Oracle's own internship program.

Any input is greatly appreciated.

I received an offer earlier last Friday about switching to full-time after graduation, but I feel like I did nothing to deserve the position.

[What is your take on the distinction between the behavior difference related to pack hunting of the introduced wolves versus the native wolves in Yellowstone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjnnz5?context=5)|The Yellowstone region's native wolves were eradicated by a government program in the early 1900s without much scientific documentation of their behavior.  But the reintroduced wolves originated from similar habitats in southern Canada.  Given that wolves are capable of traversing immense distances (wolves from the Northern Rockies have made it to California and Arizona) it seems unlikely that the native Yellowstone population was insulated from other wolf populations.  For that reason, it also seems unlikely there were major behavioral differences between the original native wolves and wolves in the area of Canada from which the reintroduced wolves originated.
[What advice would you give to a student considering entering law? Thanks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjo3a0?context=5)|At the outset, I would suggest that you think hard about what you want to do with your legal career and make sure you really want to be a lawyer, because law school is a lot of hard work and it is expensive!  If you decide you really do want to pursue a career in the law and in particular you want to work in the public interest rather than for a private firm, then I would encourage you to explore public-interest opportunities during your summer internship periods.  That will help you transition into a public-interest job even if you initially have to work in a private law firm to pay off student loans.  Good luck!
[Do you favor the proliferation of wolves because you like seeing rural western people unable to self sustain through harvesting elk and moose as we used to?  Do you hunt elk?  Have you seen firsthand, as I have, the decimation of elk herds at the hands of wolves and people like yourself?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjmqjn?context=5)|Yes I have hunted elk, and I and many others enjoy experiencing elk and other species in a diverse environment that includes native predators such as wolves.  As to impacts on elk hunting, the fact is that the Wyoming Game and Fish Department reported that Wyoming elk hunters killed a near-record number of elk in 2013 -- 25,968 elk with a hunter success rate of about 45 percent. As to sustaining rural communities, the good news is that wolf-related tourism has boosted many local economies in the Northern Rockies region.  A recent study documented that wolf restoration has produced a $35.5 million annual economic benefit to the Greater Yellowstone area. 
[Source? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjo7ke?context=5)|The source for the $35.5 million economic benefit is from a study led by University of Montana economist John Duffield.  It is discussed here:   ([Link to www.ypf.org](http://www.ypf.org/print-news-archives/25.pdf))
[But isn't it true that the elk hunting opportunities in the wolf units such as those around the park have in fact taken a nose dive?  Do you feel that elk management could have more aptly been handled by human hunters?  Do you feel that the wolf program is an affront to the western agrarian lifestyle?  Do you feel that perhaps our fore-fathers knew what they were doing when they removed the wolf from our ecosystems?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjpvlt?context=5)|Actually, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department reported in 2012 that only 2 out of 35 elk herds in the state are below the state's own population objective.  The other questions you ask really raise questions about individual values rather than biological facts.  If you are asking about my own values, I would answer that it is short-sighted to remove native species from an ecosystem and that the return of wolves has improved the ecological integrity of the Northern Rockies and sparked the imagination of hundreds of thousands of people who have visited the region in the hope of seeing a wolf in the wild.  
[Are gray wolves living near to and in human populated areas? If gray wolves being shot on site is becoming an issue to their population, isn't the problem that these wolves are living too close to people, not that people are shooting to many wolves?  Also, what is the desired outcome of this legal battle? I know FWS does great work regulating populations of fish and prey animals with tags and daily limits. The only reason they would allow shoot on sight for wolves would be because there are too many in the area, on what grounds do you disagree with them? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlw20?context=5)|In the Northern Rockies region, most wolves do not live near major human population centers.  Although conflicts with humans do occur, they generally involve wolf depredations on livestock.  Although these incidents get a lot of publicity, they are a drop in the bucket of livestock losses sustained by the ranching industry.  For instance, Wyoming cattle and calf losses from all causes totaled 41,000 animals in 2010.  Wolves were responsible for 0.7% of all cattle losses and 1.7% of all calf losses in Wyoming during that year.  As to the desired outcome of the legal battle, it is to ensure that state laws are adequate to ensure a secure wolf population for the long-term before federal protections are removed.
[You are referring to wolves as endangered species in your second sentence.  Isn't the term ""endangered species"" a phrase with a specific legal definition?  Are you arguing that the wolves are still legally an endangered species?  At what population level will the wolves no longer be considered endangered in Wyoming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjjj0i?context=5)|The official government recovery standard calls for 10 breeding pairs and 100 wolves in Wyoming outside of Yellowstone National Park, with genetic connectivity to other wolf populations and adequate state regulations to make sure that neither the population nor connectivity requirements is compromised in the future.  Wolves were returned to the endangered list in Wyoming because a federal court found that Wyoming does not provide adequate state regulations to protect the species.  In addition, Wyoming wolves remain largely isolated from any other wolf populations. 
[Can you explain why it is important to distinguish between inside the park and outside the park?  Isn't the goal to have a sustainable population regardless of whether they are in or out of the park?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjk08v?context=5)|Because Yellowstone National Park is not under the State of Wyoming's authority, the federal wildlife agency established a recovery standard that imposes specific population requirements for the area that the State does control -- i.e., the area outside the Park.  This is because Yellowstone National Park is not big enough to support a sustainable population by itself.  The idea was that the combination of the Park wolf population plus the required population outside the Park would together ensure a sustainable population for the future.
[Why are people shooting the wolves in the first place? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlzm0?context=5)|While some wolves are shot due to conflicts with livestock, others are shot for recreational hunting under state law.  But Wyoming's laws go even farther to allow wolves to be killed without any limit, year-round, throughout 85 percent of the State's territory.  This amounts to a wolf eradication policy for the great bulk of Wyoming, including areas that are important migration corridors to link wolves in Wyoming up with populations in Montana and Idaho.
[Thanks! Can you give an estimate (with a source preferably\) of the percentage of wolves that are shot for recreation-only purposes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjnh3q?context=5)|According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Program 2014 Report (which is the most recent one available), 481 wolves were killed by hunters in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming in 2014.  That represented 68% of all human-caused wolf mortality in 2014.
[Our of curiosity, what is the counter-argument for keeping no-limits hunting around? What is the total wolf population and what would be a sustainable rate of death per year for the population to remain stable?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjor9m?context=5)|The unlimited hunting in Wyoming is intended to prevent a wolf population from occupying that area.  In the Northern Rockies, the total wolf population is estimated at 1,657.  The sustainable mortality rate for a wolf population is a subject of significant debate in the scientific literature.
[Why do you guys care about wolf conservation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjiee5?context=5)|Wolf conservation is important because wolves have beneficial impacts on the environment that cascade through entire ecosystems.  Wolves prey on grazing animals such as elk, which affects the numbers and behaviors of those animals, which in turn impacts all kinds of things including vegetation and even songbird habitat.  Wolves also are important within our culture because they are living symbols of wilderness and wildness for many people.
[Why in the world would someone want to shoot a wolf? They are such majestic creatures.  Have you ever seen the film ""Never Cry Wolf,"" or read the book?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlp5f?context=5)|Thanks for the comment.  Never Cry Wolf provides a compelling account of an inspiring experience with wild wolves.  Another great literary testament to the importance of wolves for a healthy ecosystem is Aldo Leopold's essay ""Thinking Like a Mountain.""  Still, the fact remains that wolves generate passions unlike any other wildlife species in my experience.  Some people love them but others hate them and want to eradicate them.
[Weren't Oregon wolves removed from state endangered species list? What does that mean for the local population? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxji3bs?context=5)|Oregon removed wolves from its state endangered species list on Nov. 9, 2015.  As a result, more lethal measures could be allowed to manage wolves in Oregon in the future. An upcoming wolf plan review could also lead to changes in protections.  Oregon's action has no effect on wolves west of highways 97, 20 and 395, which are still protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. 
[Increased substantially? What exactly would that number be compared to their pre-extirpation population and range? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjposn?context=5)|Wolves once ranged across the entire area now occupied by the United States and their numbers were many orders of magnitude beyond what they are today.  At the same time, immense populations of bison, elk, deer and other prey species also roamed the landscape.  Wolves lived in balance with their prey species over the millennia before modern wildlife management entered the scene.
[In concert with protecting an endangered species, such as the gray wolf, what food chain species are under consideration for protection, to bolster the wolf population? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlt84?context=5)|Prey species for wolves are doing quite well without protection.  Right now there are more elk in Wyoming than the state wants, and Montana just proposed extending elk hunting seasons to reduce elk numbers.  The issue for wolves is not bolstering prey species but preventing excessive killing of wolves by humans.

3v2kjl,6,2015-12-01,This was the only possible outcome,AiCPearlJam,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3v2kjl/this_was_the_only_possible_outcome/,"A year and a half after O&amp;A were pulled apart on behalf of Ant's (reasonable) racist tirade, the real dirt is being shoveled over the best radio of all time's freshly packed grave. 

Being a long time listener, first time caller with every moment of the show, really, this was how it should have ended.

Opie bringing in Jimmy and pushing show prep onto Sam this last decade has led to completely justifiable pestering by his ""old fans"". Opie's laziness and social autism is the *only* reason that his show with Jimmy will and always will be the hot garbage plate Brother Wease scarfs down and proudly shits out with a stroke inducing smile. Period. 

Jimmy was always best friends with Ant, Sam, Erock, Travis, the interns. Who was Jimmy never close with? Opie, you fucking idiots. But who cares about Opie, Jimmy had Tits' shitty Charter boat skills on the pay no mind list. Why would you pay even an infants mind to Tit-tanic when you're hanging with your buddies from the club making each other laugh? So, in short notice, Ant is fired and Jim has to sign a buffer deal with Titstink and try to bring some glimmer of comedy. I think it was after the second time his old pals from the show were on. Vos was doing his usual. Riffin' like a babbling lispy lesbian and taking high heat from Jimmy for being and idiot. Then, wait, what's that? Tit-tanic steering his ship into the glacier of comedic potential in the room. It was that moment when our young boy realized signing the deal was wrong. He regretted it instantly. Rightfully thinking that the radio talent he had curated over the past dozen years would be able to shine, he was quick to realize Tits was the John Denver of sea. 

Jimmy starts going on Ant's show, yucking it up and having fun. This makes Tits seethe with jealously, which he doesn't hide well due to blatant narcissism. As the O&amp;J show gingerly moves forward, two bitch boys named Stangle add their weight to the Opie's Noah Ark, while young Sammy boy's moving on signifies the death of Jimmy's fan-beloved characters. Jimmy begins to feel more and more anxious as old friends stop coming around and younger talent that is *all in* with Opie's humorless antics. Jimmy sees what he should have seen all along. That Tits is sucking the comedic nipples of young Pete Davidson dry, just as he had once twerked the nipples of a young James Norton some odd years aboo. 

Now, after today's tirade, Jimmy is consequently engrained further into being the middle man while being between Tits and a jobless hard place. 

So who's the winner here? After a shaky beginning, Anthony seems to be growing a young stable of talent while growing his business model. And, fuck yeah, does that eat at Opie. Or is Opie the winner for sneaking through the back door and faking caring/talent to the tune of millions? Or maybe it's James Norton, who finds him a short while away from being able to focus on stand up, his characters, or Ant's show?

3v2noa,1,2015-12-01,Advice on Reneging and Deciding Between Companies,babygotbackend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3v2noa/advice_on_reneging_and_deciding_between_companies/,"**Questions:**

1. What are the repercussions of reneging on a company? I know it’s really bad etiquette, and I’ve heard that you can be blacklisted
2. What is your opinion of IBM vs. Cisco? Feedback from people who have worked at these companies would be very appreciated 

**Background:** 

I started applying for summer internships in September and got a few offers but eventually accepted a summer internship at IBM in October. A couple weeks ago I got an email from Cisco regarding their intent to offer me a summer internship, and I am expecting the official offer letter in the next few days. I am tempted to take the Cisco offer when it is made and reneg on IBM because Cisco seems to be closer to the cutting edge and less set in their ways than IBM. Obviously, this is mostly speculation based on testimonies that I have read on this subreddit and Glassdoor, because I have not worked at either of these companies. Also, Cisco would be willing to relocate me to one of their locations far from my university, which is an opportunity I have always aspired for.

**Details:** 

* Both positions are for software development interns
* IBM gave me 5 business days to respond after I received my offer
* It was roughly 3 weeks between my acceptance and this new offer
* I have not signed anything; I only sent an email telling them I accepted
* I did not think I would get Cisco when I accepted IBM. Cisco only told me they were still reviewing all the applications at the time of my acceptance
* Salaries are roughly the same
* I could potentially work at IBM during the school year, which would help build my experience
* I interacted closely with an IBM employee throughout the application/hiring process, and he could potentially be my supervisor/mentor. I mention this only because I have heard that mentorship is often more valuable than any work done during an internship

3v3288,5,2015-12-01,a sort-of abbreviated account (advice/rant/support),Curly-Que,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3v3288/a_sortof_abbreviated_account_advicerantsupport/,"I've been a lurker for awhile now, but my situation has gotten bad enough that I feel the need to reach out for advice (see last section, **help**) and any ideas you all might have on how to cope/deal with my family until I can move out. I'm 19/F in my second year at university, financially dependent on my radically religious NMom &amp; NDad, and am quickly reaching my breaking point. I'm planning to move out by the summer, if I can save up enough money from my part-time job, and I have a plan/place to go. 

**background**
NMom and NDad are part of a radical Christian sect that raises children in the same fashion you'd see in documentaries like ""Jesus Camp"" -- no individual identity or purpose in life aside from proselytizing, parental authority equated to God's authority, extreme racism/bigotry/homophobia/misogyny/etc., equating mental illness with satanic possession, you get the drift. I adhered to this mindset throughout my life because I knew nothing else, but was deeply depressed and terrified to disagree or question anything (""defying my parents authority and rebelling against the Lord and choosing a life of sin""). NMom and NDad always bought me nice (expensive) things to try and prove their love for me, but screamed and called me worthless/stupid/""a waste of my entire life"" if I ever failed to meet their constantly-changing and impossibly high standards. This was all well and good until college, where I realized I was gay, liberal, and started a loving relationship with an SO who they hate for unknown reasons (as in, they literally won't provide a legitimate reason to disapprove of the relationship, just rage against me/SO's physical appearances/career choices/life-goals in attempts to tear us both down and apart). I've tried riding it out for a year and a half, but NParents are now confronting me regularly, destroying my mental health/wellbeing, and threatening to cut me off and disown me from the family if I don't ""get right with God."" Here's a quick list of some sh*t that's gone down in the last year alone, to demonstrate the severity of the situation

* When I told them about an eating disorder that they encouraged, NMom laughed in my face and told me I was making it up and just trying to get attention. They sent me back to school two weeks later with a scale. 
* They knew I was suicidal (at one point in the past, not recently - thankfully that is no longer my crucible to bear) and screamed in my face for hours each day for two months, telling me how worthless I was, what a waste of time/money/effort my existence is, and how they hated being around be because I wasn't putting enough effort into being a happy/perfect child.
* ""No one will ever love you like this. You have to be ten pounds thinner (I'm at a healthy BMI) and ten times happier and have ten times better grades (I have a 4.0 in HS and 3.5 in College). Then maybe someone will pity you enough to love you.""
* ""Everyone would be better off if you were dead than if you were gay"" or ""You deserve to die if you don't adhere to this family's, and thus God's, rules/standards/etc.""
* When I spoke about having zero self-esteem, was again laughed at and told I was a waste of NMom's entire life (spent raising me).
* Whenever I go home for a break, whether it be a few days or a few weeks, NParents are nice/sweet/loving for a few hours and then start screaming. It's wildly unpredictable and there's no way to stop it.
* They refused to give me a phone or bank account unless they had complete and total control over it (monitoring my money, which I earned, and going through my text messages regularly). They also try to control my computer usage and internet search history. 
* They constantly question my work ethic and academic drive, even though I'm in an honors program, double-majoring, and have participated in several internships. Getting Bs one semester is considered failure, and will result in loss of all ""privileges"" like privacy (a door to my room), internet use, phone, contact with friends, etc.
* Guilt me into speaking with them about any issues/concerns I have, but then turn against me and use those ""weaknesses"" to tear me down and describe how unworthy I am of their financial support or family blessing or whatnot. 
* Calling/texting me daily, becoming enraged if I do not answer, and demanding to know all the details of my daily routine/interactions/etc. If I leave out any details whatsoever or mess up minutia (a friend's name, a specific time an event occurred) then in their minds I must be lying and hiding something.
* Telling me that I was my NMom's entire career, and if I fail to adhere to her standards, then I'm a failure and she's a failure. NMom is very Type A and cannot tolerate failure on anyone's part.
* Emotionally manipulating me with tears and pleas to ""not tear this family apart."" Tearing the family apart consists of not telling my parents every single detail of my day, trying to deal with mental illness, getting a B on an exam, or not having an eating disorder. 
* I was raised to believe that I, as a child, was a financial investment by my NParents. The condition of my very existence was that I become the child they wanted me to be. If I don't become that child, I don't deserve their love or support (financial or emotional). Everything was conditional, so all of my life was overshadowed by a fear of losing that support because I wasn't religious enough or straight enough or conservative enough or...
* Constantly saying ""I love you"" and insisting that they do everything because they love me (which I believe they do, but their manifestation of that love isn't healthy or good or right). They've tangled themselves so intimately into my self-worth and identity that I feel like a failure without their approval, which is constantly because I live in fear of them finding out my political/sexual orientation and disowning me because of my 'irresponsible and childish and stupid ungodly behavior.'

What I'm getting at is that their abuse isn't physical, it's just psychological and emotional. It doesn't leave any marks, but it's caused me to develop deep depression, anxiety, shame (of sexual assault, of mental illness, of needing help, of not being perfect according to their standards, of not being 'worthy' of their love), and a heavy dose of self-loathing. Dissociation (loss of physical sensation, feeling like I'm separated from my body) is common for days at a time when I go home, and it's continued now that I'm back at school. I can't ask anyone for help because NParents have instilled in me that that means weakness, that no one will love me or stay with me  (except them), that everyone around me is manipulative and evil (except them), that if I ever 'burden' someone with my concerns (or ask them for help) then they'll leave and blackmail me -- I feel stranded and alone, and I'm the only one to blame because I can't. ask. for. help. 

My plan, as I briefly said earlier (so sorry for the length!), is to save money this year and move out by the summer. I'm moving in with SO/friends, applying to FAFSA as an independent, and hopefully completing all the paperwork over the summer so as not to interrupt my college schedule. It seems like a good plan (would love to hear your thoughts on any elaborations I might need), but I get physically sick thinking about how much leaving will hurt NPArents. I love them very much, even though they're destroying me. It doesn't make any sense.

**help?**
Do you have any tips on how to cope with depression caused by NParents? Do you have any thoughts on how to improve/elaborate on my move-out plan? Any words of wisdom/support on how to just fucking survive the next few months (esp. winter break) with them? How can I emotionally detach so I can escape and move on? Is moving out even the right decision, or am I just being a pansy and just try to ride it out longer? Is there a way to tell NParents I love them but their abuse is killing me (is it even worth it to have that conversation)? Really, any advice or thoughts or support would be wildly appreciative - thank you all in advance and I apologize again for the long post."
3v33tk,1,2015-12-01,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v33tk/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

3v3a14,1,2015-12-01,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v3a14/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!"

We've been very okay with living together, had a few minor fights or whatnot, but always seemed to resolve things well.

He's been nothing but nice to me, supporting me through tough times, have a lot of interests in common, and he's always been eager to hug, kiss, hold my hand and cuddle me. 

However, I swore that ever since I let him borrow my Xbox 360 from home, it just went downhill. Sex used to happen one-twice a week, sometimes more. Ever since then, I cannot even remember the last time we had sex. Even the time before that.

I sympathized with his gaming tendencies, because he's under a high-pressure semester. His strict father didn't allow him to bring the console because it would distract him, but he ended up having to drop a lot of activities and clubs to help boost his grades. He is expected to get a 3.2 GPA in order to be accepted into the internship program with the government. So, serious shit. Hell, I'm a gamer myself and a Game Design major, I understand games are an awesome outlet to stress and can help build bonds between friends.

I also sympathized that a lot of his friends live far away or graduated as well, and the only time he can talk to them is on Xbox Live. I wake up with him, go to breakfast, meet with him in between classes and chill with him during the nights. So, I see him a lot and this is his time to be independent and alone. Understood.

I've tried leaving him alone during the nights, not bringing up the topic and letting him chose on his own to have sex. On those nights, he stays up until 3-4 am playing video games with his friends, and when I go to bed earlier and turn off the lights, he joins me, wants to cuddle and goes to sleep minutes afterwords.

I tried bringing it up to him. He seemed discouraged and knew it was a problem. He would say that he's pretty busy or ends up being too tired to do so. He would try to initiate after I brought it up, because he felt bad that it was a problem and then, nothing for a long time. At one point, he expressed that sometimes it was too much work on his end. I felt really hurt, but then I tried accepting it by doing more work by positions, more male-oriented positions where women would have to work harder. It worked for awhile but even then, his interest to initiate it died. 

I tried wearing cute sexy clothes, sending him dirty messages, teasing him while he's playing or teasing him during the day. He'd say like ""Oh my"" or ""You're being really dirty."" And that would be that.

I've tried planning days for us to have sex and either he would forget completely or comment that it's ""weird to plan sex out"". In which I either say ""It's better than we do, otherwise it never happens"" or say ""Okay, I will leave that to you and you decide when it's okay to do so."" In which, read the paragraph above.

I tried outright surprising him with a blowjob as he gamed and just being a total angel to him throughout the whole day. He got very flustered and told me he liked it a lot and I was being really nice to him. It went well, but when we decided to shower afterwords, nothing. We cuddled and kissed in the shower and had dorky conversations, but nothing. I know it sounds a little selfish, but every time I gave him a blowjob, he was very eager about making sure I was able to get off as well. Whether this was me masturbating, or him fingering me or something. But the past few times I gave him blowjobs, he'd either go right to sleep, forget about it or just want cuddles.

What is so frustrating is that he and I used to be very sexual. We roleplayed a lot, did kinky shit, and hell, we'd send each other porn all the time. We still send each other porn all the time. Hell, he roleplays sexual conversations online with his friends. It's something he's always done, but I did it too. It wasn't something that bothered me, but it's getting to the point where he is more interested in video games and his sexual roleplays online than acting them out in bed.

What was the most disheartening was I brought up that I was leaving college and graduating in three weeks. The next time we would see each other would be probably a long time, and we were very interested in living together in his home state in the future. However, my birth control only lasted all of this week, all of next week and finals week was my period week. He said ""Well, I don't know how it'll go. I gotta focus on Finals week and I don't think we're going to have the time."" And it was really sad to hear.

It sucks because this boy is so sweet, has done a fuckton for me, has treated me like a queen otherwise, and a sympathize with him on so many levels but goddamn, I'm resorting to fucking fanfiction to get all my frustrations out. I have no idea what to do. I've run out of ideas and I feel sick to my stomach.

3v407y,46,2015-12-02,Data from 3 months of data scientist interviews,origin415,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3v407y/data_from_3_months_of_data_scientist_interviews/,"Hi all,

The past three months I've been interviewing for data scientist positions and I thought I would share my results since posts like this have been popular in the past.

##Background:
I am finishing up a mathematics PhD. Around the time I was finishing my thesis (in algebraic geometry, completely pure math), about a year ago, I decided to focus entirely on a career in industry, and have been taking advantage of my student status taking graduate CS and stats courses at my university in preparation, as well as taking an ML internship this past summer.

Thus, I'm fairly similar to what seems like a large contingent in this sub: technical background trying to break into data science. Fortunately I had some programming experience already to make this an easier transition.

My resume reads something like:  
Education:  
PhD Mathematics, Decent University  
Additional coursework in Statistics and Computer Science  
BS Mathematics, minor Physics, Less Decent University  

Experience:  
Mathematics TA/Instructor, 5 years

Researcher, Government Lab, 3 months (last summer)  
Applying stats/ML to large data sets using Python, R, C++, SQL

Programmer, Government Lab, 8 months (during undergrad)  
Writing GUIs for controlling a large scientific measurement device, in C

Programmer, Government Lab, 6 months (during undergrad)  
Using unsupervised learning to analyze medical data, in C

Languages/tools: Python, R, C++, C, SQL, D3.js, Tableau, CUDA, Matlab

## Process
This past September I began applying, telling companies I could graduate in December as long as I heard back before November 30th and could my defense set up and such. I intended to continue at my university for another quarter if I didn't find anything.

In general the process is thus: first, a phone call with the recruiter talking generally about the position, my background, and gauging my interest.

Next, 1-3 technical screens, half focusing on programming and the other half on data science.

The programming half is on something like collabedit, and generally has a few questions for you to code up in python. These range from ""merge two sorted lists"" and ""compute the fibonacci numbers"" to ""write a routine to preprocess text files, code to train a naive bayes classifier, and predict using that code (not call a library, write the whole thing)"". I recommend checking out a site like HackerRank (for the problems, not the contests), which have a range of problem difficulties. Practice talking through your thought process too.

The data science half has some basic stats questions and generally talking through how you would solve a ML problem from start to finish. For instance, one time I had to talk through how I would set up Zillow's Zestimate from what data I would use, what model, how I would train it over a large set, verify results, keep it updated, diagnose problems, etc.

Then there's the on-site, which is similar to the screens above but more focused on the actual company and role, more difficult, and much longer.

## The Numbers

I ended up applying to 39 companies, all in the Seattle area (part of my motivation for industry was that I could stay in Seattle). Of those, I got interest from 11, but only 7 were willing to get through the process before my deadline. Of those, I withdrew my application after the first screen for 1, was rejected after a screen for a second, withdrew before the scheduled on-site for another, and thus had 4 on-site interviews.

For one, they initially accepted while saying they would provide a 6 week training program since my background wasn't strong enough. Eventually they reneged and said to hold off for a few months. I had concerns for the work/life balance there, so this didn't worry me that much.

For another, I was rejected after the on-site. Oh well.

The last two I got offers from, and decided to take one.

[Here is a google doc for full details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpU2P9V8CPujRRdUX9WDjKxGRmn_dib76d2gIMuBHdA/edit#gid=0&amp;vpid=A1). I've anonymized the companies and uniformized the job titles somewhat (there are many equivalent titles to data scientist (quantitative analyst, machine learning scientist, statistical analyst, research engineer...)), but the dates and offers are real. SDE = any software role, DS = data scientist or equivalent, RS = research scientist (large overlap with DS but sometimes focused on a particular topic like NLP or computer vision).

Let me know if you have any questions!"

Ive been offered a gis analyst job in St Louis, Missouri.  I live in New York. I just graduated college this past may with a BS in Geography.  The company the job is with is a pretty well known and very large corporation.  

Does anybody have any experience with relocating for a job?  Ive been putting myself through hell for the past few days trying to make this decision.  I have a girlfriend here (I know thats not a good reason to decline an offer but its not at all the only reason im considering saying no and trying to find something else.)

The only reason I even applied was because I thought it would be cool to see if i even heard back from them.  I wasnt a straight A student.  Not even close.  Im not a GIS genius at all, in fact im pretty mediocre but I have internship experience with Python programming in GIS and I use and know Linux and Unix systems.  They asked me questions about that so I guess thats what attracted them to me. 

Anyway, would I be passing up too much of a good opportunity if I say no?  I just feel like I would be miserable living in the Midwest all alone, probably living in some crappy apartment in st louis by myself.  No family or friends or girlfriend except on the phone.  The thought of it almost brings me to tears.  I dont want to move, but feel like I would be passing up a good opportunity.  I honestly never expected to even get an interview.  And they offered me a job with just a phone interview.  Experiencing a different part of the country would be good.  But I just feel like im leaving so much behind, for not so great pay, but probably decent experience, and the beginnings of a career.  

Sorry, just needed to vent.  

Anybody else have experience with relocating or at least just have any feedback?  I have to make a decision by Thursday, and I suck at making big decisions like this.  Ive just been absolutely miserable the past few days and something tells me if im this upset just trying to make the decision, I should probably just stay home and only apply to local positions. "
3v4dqd,5,2015-12-02,How does a security clearance job (as an intern) affect future (non-clearance) career options?,smashdragon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3v4dqd/how_does_a_security_clearance_job_as_an_intern/,"As the title states, I'm a CS junior in college, I have two job offers for internships on the table, and I'm trying to weigh pros and cons of each. One offer is from one of the major US DoD contractors (You'd recognize the name), this job would require a secret (not top secret) clearance. The pros of this job would be that it would pay $5/hour more, be closer to my house and to school, and be easier work which would allow me to focus more on school. The cons are that I'm not interested in pursuing a career in government or DoD contracting post graduation and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot by taking an internship that's not challenging and not in my projected career path. 

The other job offer is for a firmware position at a local data storage company, which is much closer aligned to what I see myself doing in 5 years, although it would not pay as much, and would be more challenging. Challenging would be good and bad: good in that I would learn a lot more, and the experience would likely be more valuable; bad in that I am also taking a full class load of challenging courses and I want to make sure my grades don't suffer. Both companies plan to hire me on in January and would have me work through the school year and into summer and possibly beyond.

So my questions are these:

* Does obtaining your clearance shoehorn you into future clearance work? 

* I had heard that private companies are sometimes hesitant to hire workers with security clearances, as they could be potential liabilities for the company. Is that true?

* If I were to obtain my clearance, does that come with future obligations and responsibilities if I choose not to use it in the future? I know traveling to certain countries discouraged for clearance holders, is this true even after the clearance is not being used or inactive? I.E. are you put on a ""list""?

* How long does a secret clearance take? I imagine I wouldn't be able to start working until the clearance investigation passed. I have no criminal history or anything so I'm not worried about getting cleared, but I am worried about the time it would take between offer letter to starting work.

I appreciate any advice, and thanks in advance."

When I transfer I will only have engineering specific courses left, and I will be in my third year. 

- How's the engineering courses from your experience?  From what I read, no one likes taking math classes there, was wondering what your thoughts were on the engineering specific ones.

- Are there internships available to aero - space students through the university and/or professors? What would be the likely hood of me getting one with roughly a 3.4-3.5 gpa?

- What's the people generally like around campus? What is roughly the guy-to-girl ratio in the engineering department?  What is the breakdown on the diverse ethnicity makeup in the engineering department? While I don't mind any race/ethnicity, my first university was 90% south Americans on scholarships. So I didn't have anything in common with anyone in my major. 

- Any gaming organizations?  Would be cool to play with others who are similarly skilled and share the same hobbies/passion.

- what calculators can you use in the engineering classes? 

- Tips on parking? I'm going to be commuting from Little Elm, so any tips/hints to insure a parking spot would be great."

In July, I had my second interview after graduating and got hired. The firm deals in Industrial Automation Solutions and I was taken on as an intern (software development) for the starting three months. Kind of like a probation.

[I live in India, so units of legal tender will be in Rupees (₹).]

I was paid a measly ₹5,000 for each of the three months of working as an intern, what they said was a standard intern stipend. I did not really complain because it was the first real job that I had. My offer letter clearly states that:

&gt; ... On the successful completion of your internship, the company shall promote you as a **""Junior Software Developer""** which will be subject to the achievement of mutually agreed performance targets. You will be due for revision in salary after the successful completion of internship, subject to your performance.

The company rules also state that:

* Employees are expected to complete an eight-hour work day.
* Timings are from 9 am to 6 pm.
* Since I have some sleep problems, I end up waking late and reaching work by 10 am.
* Since the last 40-50 days, I have been staying back after work hours, ranging from 7 pm to 8:30 pm.

I joined on the 20th of July, today is the 2nd of December. I haven't heard from them about my permanent employment at all. The CEO is a very intimidating person, and was out of the country for the whole month of November. Now that he's back, I thought there will be some headway in my employment procedure. But whenever he calls me for 'discussions,' he asks me what the status of my work is and then just launches off into twenty to thirty minutes of life advice, and saying how they're still evaluating my performance, even though the three months of my internship (in which they should ideally evaluate me) are over. This has happened thrice now.

I understand I'm not the very best at what I do, and it is my fault also. I do like the job, since **it is** what I graduated in, but I'm not happy with it. I have zero energy left post-work and no drive to do anything creative or social after work hours. All I get is a Sunday, since we have a six-day work week, and I feel like doing nothing except for lazing around.

I am very interested in a writing job, and think that it is my calling. I have applied to certain places where there are good opportunities for a writer, and I would like to leave this place soon. I talked to a friend and she advised me that considering how the work environment is and how rigid the people are, they wouldn't let me leave, I should give them the reason of higher studies abroad and leave at the end of December, citing reasons that there will be too much on my plate from January. I thought it through and seemed plausible.

I then talked to another co-worker who had left the job shortly after I joined, to get a better understanding of the temperament and thought-processes of the CEO. He advised me to stay calm and not fold to whatever tactics he'll apply on me, or whatever curveballs he'll throw if he suspects I'm, in fact, joining another company. He also pointed out the fact that since there isn't any talk of my employment there yet, I'm not obliged to anything, and can leave without much hassle. But they will create problems in payment of salary because that's how they've been to any ex-employee who has decided to resign.

My questions are:

* Should I go ahead with the further studies abroad as an excuse for leaving?
* What should I do if they ask me for proof, since there isn't any?
* How do I convince them to clear my salary upfront and not keep me in the dark?"

I'm a Computer Science major in my last year. After Spring I only have 3 classes left to take, but I'm graduating in Fall for a few reasons. This gives me a chance to get an internship under my belt (and a break from academics, which I desperately need).

I go to school in Florida, but I'm from Los Angeles and would like to land an internship there (Woodland Hills area would be the best).

I'm an USAF veteran - I did an *extremely* technical and demanding job, so I developed a very vast technical skillset from that. I was rather successful in the military and I did also develop great leadership and communication skills there.

On to my question:

I've applied to a number of internships with various companies (mostly in LA). I go on their websites, fill things out to the best of my ability. Church up my resume, and submit. I've applied to a lot of internships with defense contractors, but I haven't been limited to that.

I came across two Facebook internships (to do with Internet.org) which involved literally my exact job in the military, as well as electronics and coding skills. This seems silly to say, but they may as well have listed in their requirements that they specifically need somebody who is 5' 10"" with my exact name and SSN.

I applied to 6 Lockheed-Martin internships which each requested a Computer Science major with exactly the kind of experience I got from the Air Force: on some specific technologies, protocols, and products. In fact I don't know how you would gain this sort of specific experience if you didn't do my exact job.

But I don't hear back from anyone. I submit my application, and it just gets lost in the abyss. How do I touch bases with somebody and get my foot in the door. I feel like I have enough qualifications to be a productive intern and eventually employee, but nobody seems interested. What do I do?

I've tried talking to some reps who come to my campus, and unfortunately that hasn't been fruitful. I've been away from LA for a long time too, so I don't have much of a professional network over there.

I ended up specifically looking for a specific color scheme, remote, Samsung battery, 8 inches, and Bluetooth speakers. 

I wouldn't think of returning it but here's what I would tell myself if I were to do it over again. After rereading it, it's not scientific at all but ask any questions! 

Bluetooth
These are loud! I ended up disconnecting them. For some reason the place where I got this from decided to have a recorded voice announce to the WHOLE WORLD that the bluetooth device is now connecting. Then when it does, ""the Bluetooth device has been-ah connected successfully"". Everyone laughs because even though there's not a made in China sticker the woman has a strong comedic Chinese accent. No matter if my phone is set on the lowest volume setting this woman still announces to the whole world about my Bluetooth status every time I turn it on. 

8 inches
Honestly I haven't had a chance to compare it. I love the style that the typical 8 inches has (transformer style). 

Remote
I bring my board to the office and one of my interns always decides to hop on this. With the remote I can simply lock and unlock it (not sure if it saves on my battery). It's more of a gimmick since the button on the board over rules the remote. I do like that I can set the board on beginner mode easily. Other than that I don't see a use for it. 

Edit: I learned how to put it in a different mode. You turn it on and push the button again. It'll beep. Apparently fly everytime you turn it on it defaults to beginner mode. Honestly for using it around the office I'm okay with beginner mode. The advance mode is a little too quick for my comfort. 

Samsung battery
I asked the company to add a Samsung battery. They charged another $16 for it. I have to say that even though I haven't opened it up yet the battery life is still disappointing. I expected the board to last all day but then again we ride it on and off throughout the day. With all the fakes I don't think it justifies the extra price I paid.

Been lurking here for a while now and I noticed how common being a skilled programmer is before starting college.

I am in my second year of college and have only taken a few CS courses so far, mostly OOP in Java, receiving all As or Bs. I've also started to introduce myself to new code outside of class as well as Github, but at this point still have only just tapped the surface of CS. 

Now for the question, knowing my experience so far and that I have about 2 and a half years left in college, am I too far behind to pursue a CS degree? It seems many going into school have already learned a language or two while in HS I concentrated mostly on my four year engineering program that I decided to not pursue as a career. Other than being an avid gamer and taking one community college class on OOP I went into college relatively new to CS. 

Another question, should I be self teaching as much as possible outside of class or focusing on my course material? 

One of the main reasons I ask is because many internships which I'm hoping to acquire soon look for those who know several languages already and I am no where near that yet. Any advice is very appreciated! "

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well.

So after a couple of failed interviews in the past couple of months. I decided to save up for a macbook. Reason being that I'm a computer science student trying to get and internship as a front-end developer. On these phone interviews I was asked the same question:

""Do you have any experience using a Macbook or any apple devices?"" 

To which my answer was ""Other than an iPod I've never had contact with apple devices"". I will agree that this was a dumb and honest answer.

Anyways that was a little back story as to how I came to acquire this macbook.

Here is the model that I got:

Apple MacBook Pro MF840LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop with Retina Display (256 GB)

I figured I need some decent RAM power to handle Netbeans (not that you need alot to run that program). To be honest I think I could've gone with the top tier Macbook Air and be done with it but I needed that Retina Display. 

Anyways I'm getting off point. Are there any pointers you current macbook users have for someone that has never had contact with macbooks?? I mean I'm using it right now as my daily driver but just want to know if there are any shortcuts or walkthroughs.

I am very depressed and have turned from extrovert to introvert. I used to discuss topics very fluently but now as people have hard time understanding my sentences and then make fun of me, I now try to keep things to me only. 

How can I overcome this?   Any tips will be greatly appreciated.

P.S. Some people say to hangout with Indian-Americans (people of Indian origin but born in US).    To my great surprise they are the ones who make fun of my accent the most.  



Edit:  Here is my background and the reason to post in this forum
I work for a Big 5 tech company as an intern. Interviewed with an Top Trading firm where I was made fun of.
Currently go to a Top 10 CS university again where I am made fun of"

3v7pnp,1,2015-12-02,Choosing between a CS and linguistics BA or a Microbiology BS,Mike_Darsh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3v7pnp/choosing_between_a_cs_and_linguistics_ba_or_a/,"Hi guys,

Right now I'm a third year student at UCLA studying Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular genetics BS with a minor in Bioinformatics. Going through the bioinformatics pathway has really helped me find a passion in computer science and programming. Right now I'm proficient in C++, fairly competent in R, and am going to learn python this upcoming month.

However, when I attended our career fair, a lot of recruiters seemed a bit off-put by my degree -- they thought it was a little bit strange that a life science major wished to do programming or software engineering work.

I've recently found out that my school offers a BA in Linguistics and Computer Science, which goes a lot more in depth than the bioinformatics minor, and covers different topics. I'd still stick with the bioinformatics minor since there are a lot of important probabilistic modeling computer applications to be learned.

Do you recommend that I switch my major to strengthen my marketability? I'd love to go into the field of data science, any type of programming, or any video game or some sort of development. 

If I were to switch my major, I would need to be at the university for an extra quarter or two though. So I'm not sure if it's worth it entirely to just attempt to get a Master's in computer science after getting the Microbio degree anyway.

As my current major, I don't have as much time as I'd like to be able to do side projects, and I feel that those are a great way to get my shoe in the door.

I guess bottom of the line is, can I be just as competitive as others who have studied computer science as a life science major if I prove my worth with internships and side projects? Or should I try and switch altogether to a degree with Computer Science in the name?

Thanks for your help"

I find myself very interested in the tech sector which has drawn me into a [computer science related field](https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics/careers). However, I have also found myself drawn to IB among other finance related careers as I don't see myself doing something like low-level software engineering for the remainder of my life.

 My resume is underwhelming to say the least as are is my ACT score (29) and college GPA (3.5), and I've only recently taken an interest in our schools finance clubs. I feel this has left me uncompetitive for many of the internships that could be a leeway into an IB related career.   

So is it in my best interest to combine my current major with finance despite being 'behind' compared to many? Or should I work my ass off in undergrad to get an MBA at a feeder school after spending 2-5 years in the workforce? "
3v7um9,2,2015-12-02,"Better late than never, sometimes you need a nudge (Reporting in!)",mind_the_gaps,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3v7um9/better_late_than_never_sometimes_you_need_a_nudge/,"First of all, I'd like to say hello to everyone in this community and to acknowledge how mentally driven one must become to reach the goals some of you have already accomplished.

**I'**m 26yo, and as a natural stage of a boys sexual discovery i always masturbated from an early age, but back then it was always normal (in a non compulsive way). 

**A**nyways, things evolved and once i got the portability and everywhere access to the internet, i can recall that i've been addicted to PMO for around 8 years now. And **hopefully** i am now realizing how much it might be ruining my time, my energy.... and in the big picture, my life.

**A**s everyone else, i've always had my own quirks and unique personality traits/features, and despite my excessive gaming habbits, (and PMO whenever i got bored of gaming), i've always managed to get the attention/relationships with the opposite sex without much effort from my end. 

**R**ecently (4 months ago), the 2 years long relationship with my girlfriend ended (mostly I’m to blame), as these 2 “hobbies” might have contributed to it. We lived these 2 years together, in the same house as we were just finishing the college degree, and most of the nights, I would go to bed really late, just so I could pull all-nighters gaming with my palls, and ultimately “Peel the banana” while watching porn before going back to bed. This behaviour, led to some shitty results, as it would drain my energies making me sleep more, therefore skipping some classes and be less productive every day I pulled that routine… and when it came to sexy time with the lady I loved even tho It was always awesome, in the back of my mind i knew all the PMO was holding me back from making it even greater, numbing my sensitivity and the spiritual bond.


**W**ell, fast forwarding a year and half after the start of the relationship, she started getting tired of my lack of interest on stuff, and the love started to wane, when the time came for the college degree to end I struggled to try to keep the flame alive, but ultimately she had already made up her mind she didn’t want to get stuck with me if I did not seem to get my shit together about having a good life. Eventually, after college I scored a pretty awesome internship job on the same town she was doing hers, things went smooth for some time, and I actually thought that this new place would be the perfect opportunity to rekindle the fire, but this time as I was the only one really committed to fix everything back, we parted ways.

**A**t this point i still had one more month on my internship, but I was all by myself with the loss of my SO, so I committed to the fullest of my capacities to the job I had, and in the end it paid off with the highest grade of the entire class and a recommendation letter and job offers(which I declined because at this point I already had other better plans). But this event increased my PMO addiction, after workhours I would loose +/- 2hours to PMO, as I now needed something to fill the gap it was left behind….

**A**fter the internship I was forced to temporarily move back to my parents’ house for 2 months as I had some unfinished business before moving with my plans to do, enough to say, I had plenty of free time and a lot of privacy, so you guess…. 

….**B**ut not a few days ago, I managed to talk with my ex, I made a joke about wanting one of the things I borrowed her back, she then gave me right this long text with: (tl;dr) where she cherished the time she had with me and that she still, cared and liked me and always will. But in the end she said that she randomly already met someone else, who she likes and has to respect…

*That’s when it struck me!**
&gt; She already moved on, and I’m here feeling sad for myself, plotting to get her back….

But that’s when my mind screamed **NO, you’re better than this, you deserve better**, if you want to get the best version of yourself you have to get rid of all the shit that’s futile and make your time count!



**So my immediate actions already have been:**

* deactivating my facebook and every social crap, except for reddit. 
* cutting dramatically on gaming time (2h daily, was around 10h before).
* going out more with friends.
* setting goals on getting the best physical form I’ve ever been.
* Completely halting on Porn and Masturbation, started yesterday to take the 30 days challenge for now, and then extend accordingly.


**I need tips on:**

* Preventing me from watching any Porn;
* Getting through the urges.

------------------------
Well, sorry for the long post, but I needed to set my stuff out there and straight as I don’t really have the courage to tell this to any of my friends. I feel an idiot, for dragging me down with these addictions. I hope you guys can welcome me in here, as of right now I need some clarity in my mind after all these years of bad weather.


TL;DR: I’m addicted to PMO for 8 years, my SO left and already moved on and I need to stop feel sorry for myself. I’m going to try to find my better self this time, no PM 30 days challenge to start. Tips and words of wisdom very welcome.

3v7x5h,1,2015-12-02,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v7x5h/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

&gt;$me: What's up with the copier?  
$secretary: It's not copying. (she's writing an out-of-order sign)  
$me: No problem.  
$secretary: I unplugged it.  

Ok... I turn on the copier and the secretary and intern leave me to do my work. 

Copier says to unjam paper from finishing tray. 2 minutes, done.

I guess it was too hard of a task to unjam the copier, so secretary took drastic actions and shut it off and unplugged it. Logic? Nah.  
   It's one of those copiers that has explicit instructions and pictures on the screen to unjam. Teachers would have been without a copier, which in return, would make them freak out and call us. 

TL;DR: Don't unplug the copier without contacting tech support."

Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

The first paid job I got was through my college's career fair (also where I got my internship) but that's in April, the other job was through a headhunter and the ones I'm working with now haven't been too helpful. 

So where is a good spot to get entry level jobs? My last job paid 65k and I'm wondering if expecting similar pay is holding me back. In any case, I get interviews but they complain about me not having enough experience and it seems that every job posting I see wants more than 2 years experience or wants 6 different languages and I've used maybe 4 of them. I've mostly been going through indeed.

Also after interviewing with Amazon I got to visit Seattle and I liked it. Any advice for applying to there (I live near Los Angeles and I could only fly out there for the interview because it was on Amazon's dime)."
3v8k3t,1,2015-12-02,Some questions about applying for internships,xiviajikx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3v8k3t/some_questions_about_applying_for_internships/,"I've been a long time lurker in the sub, and I'm about to start applying for some internships. I'm only a freshman at a decently ranked state school, and when the semester ends in a few weeks, I plan to spend most of my break doing applications for different companies and such. Before applying I have a few general questions:

* I'm only a freshman, but I have a decent amount of experience through personal projects and taking CS classes in high school. How important is actual experience? How much should I be expected to know going into an internship/interview?

* Branching off of the previous question, how important is a github profile/portfolio of projects? I have some personal projects, but I don't really wish to publish them because they are not the best demonstration of good programming principles, and I don't necessarily want to open source my work (I understand this isn't generally desirable, and my code isn't anything revolutionary, but I still don't feel comfortable about open-sourcing these particular projects).

* What is the best way to distinguish myself from others? I learn concepts very quickly and am regarded highly among my friends as I am the one they turn to for help with learning new concepts and assignments. Is something like this even relevant?

* How important is knowledge of versioning and usage of it within my personal projects? My extent of versioning right now is working out of the workspace within my dropbox. It syncs up, and it works for me, but I still understand that this isn't the correct method of version control. I plan on learning this, and I am going to set up a git server for myself for future projects (if this is what I should be doing). However, is it bad that I do not have a maintained and visible history of the projects I've worked on?

* Finally, how important is a strong knowledge of Linux? I understand that linux is a staple within the industry, but I've only recently started to use it after attending meetings of my university's cyber security club. I would definitely consider myself a much better user of Windows or OS X, but I'd be much more of a liability than asset when it comes to Linux.

Thanks for reading this, and for any possible feedback you all might have. I just want to best prepare myself for the future, and I do plan on improving upon the skills I lack in order to better integrate into a workforce."

3v8xr2,1,2015-12-03,M4F: Married Man still seeking just the right delectably dirty penpal,ALilBitOHonesty,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v8xr2/m4f_married_man_still_seeking_just_the_right/,"As noted in previous posts, I am married, my wife is unaware that I am doing this. It is wrong and I should not be. But that's a bit of the thrill of it, isn't it?

I am seeking long-term penpals who agree with me that, often, everything that's supposed to be bad makes us feel so good. Conversations, be they chats or RPs, should be shot through with dirty talk. It drives me wild and I get none of it at home.

If RP is your thing, I'm game for any number of scenarios, esp if they include shifting power dynamics and some kind of taboo flair. Whether that means a boss and his intern, a parent and his kid's babysitter, teacher and student, incest, two co-workers having an affair behind their partners' backs, priest and member of the congregation, I'm onboard. So, taboos can be age difference, roles that usually forbid sex, being related, cheating or something else. Name it and I'll let you know.

If RP isn't your bag, I also just love talking about sex. Whether that is current or past exploits, fantasies, or something else, I think sex is fascinating and (obviously) exciting and would love to chat with someone who is equally enthusiastic.

Age range, I'm open to, basically, anyone from 18 to, let's say, 48 (15 years younger through 15 years older). More important than the age is the level of filth in the mind. That's what hooks me.

Please don't hesitate to drop a note no matter when you come across this. I'll make every effort to at least reply, even if it seems we are not a good fit.

Thanks in advance. I'm excited to ""meet"" you.

Owen: The Depressing Story Teller

Gwen: Hulk Gwen

LeShawna: LeEminem

Geoff: Glue lover

Izzy: Crazy Chick (My Ex-Girlfriend)

DJ: Ingrate

Justin: Prince Pretty or the HeartBreak Kid or The King of Cuteville

Noah: The sarcastic One

Ezekiel: The Zekey One or Zekeyness

Chef: BADASS

Chris: LIAR

Anyway back to the review we begin with a recap and then the intro I always have a problem with these intros you know what the relationships are from 1 second in I know some people like it like that but kind of SPOILER ALERT. Ahhh back in the days were the sharks were new and the challenges were intense ha good times I'm looking at you All Stars. I hate the areas so are shark like scared of....circles? Or something like that and only 1 person doesn't make it in the clear area WHAT IS THE PURPOSE.

All the interns are already dead wow only took 2 episodes. Chef can walk on water you know what that means CHEF IS JESUS he is not God cause my total drama god comes later in the series can you guess who it is? 

(In sport commentator voice) Bridgette is on the podium first, oh a good dismount, she has a good position and a flawless splash what do the judges have to say 10, 10 and 9.8 and what's this her swim suite flew off the third judge changes his vote it's a perfect 30! By good what an event folks. 

Tyler should of died from the fall onto a water thingy true but HE'S A GENETIC FREAK AND HIS GOT A 141 AND TWO THIRDS CHANCE OF SURVIVAL AS FOR THE OTHER TEAM THEY GOT A 8 AND ONE THIRD CHANCE OF WINNING AT BEST! Geoff jumps and I know his hat is glued on but still the Glue Sniffer's hat has superpowers HATMAN HATMAN HATMAN!!!

Eva jumps boring but, what this a rebel is here folks and NO REACTION he is such at rebel he doesn't even scream when he's falling 1000 feet and you know Duncan is such a rebel they say under his mohawk is another fist that flips you off. 

DJ won't jump but an ingrate I mean he should face his fears they're giving him a chance but nope ingrate. This next part is one of my favourite scenes in Total Drama Chris goes to comfort him and DJ is saying how he got his fear Chris then goes on to say and I quote ""That's ok Big Guy unfortunately that's also makes you a chick"" I just love how ticked Chris sounds and how he lashes into the ingrate I don't know why I just love this scene (A review on me says why he loves a moment then say doesn't know why he loves it LOGIC)

WHERE WAS THE ESCALATOR BEFORE!!! Courtney has L-L-L-LAWYERS did you know Courtney is actually a CIT in Training. DAMN YOU IZZY if you just stayed on your team Katie would of died. I HATE YOU KATIE AND SADIE!!! 

Heather and LeShawna are having an argument I kind of think LeShawna is secretly Eminem. (Rap God Parody: Sassy Girl) I'm beginning to feel like I'm a sassy girl, sassy girl all the people from the front what a taste of me, so who thinks their insults are good enough to hurt me, hurt me, they say I rap like a teleporter so call me LeShawna, Shawna but for me to rap like a teleporter must be in the genes got a teleporter in my back pocket. Oops that got off track anyway Prince Pretty Justin looks at himself in a mirror (next episode I swear I'm making a song for Justin) LeEminem throws Heather off the cliff.

The most super good looking piece of gorgeous is saved by the sharks (Give those Sharks a coke). Beth is insulted by Heather I beat she will shake if off (I hate my little cousin makes me listen to Taylor Swift). Ice Skating Fan Trent then jumps and then oh I wonder if Owen will jump not like they showed it IN THE LAST EPISODE.

Owen jumped and we get more filler. And what's pop is it Canadian soda or something. Eva can carry boxes but pushes them anyway what a bad team mate. Ha Katie and Sadie sat on poison ivy that's what they get for messing with the rules of the game. 

Tongue burns aren't a joking matter you know at least 45 people die of tongue burns each year how sad. Heather and LeEminem make up and Lose Yourself move over LeShawna is going to top the charts with Lose My Earrings (Trademark).

Of course the Gophers go to elimination cause Bass have TEAMWORK do it together, teamwork friends forever. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFqhjFrX-z4 (I loved that show when I was younger skip to 0:20 and I don't know how I remember this song or show).

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why Zekey my boy don't be sexist you know in this day and age it's a death wish I remember I was a bit sexist once and I still have the scars from when that lady attacked me. Ah this is another reason I hate Katie and Sadie suddenly they're bitter and also THEY GOT MY BOY ZEKE OUT I just realised if Katie and Sadie never voted for Zeke that means Zeke could of won and that also means he might of not gone insane thanks a lot Katie and Sadie.

The Rebel Duncan gives Zeke advice about the real world you know Duncan is such a rebel he gave the Godfather a negative review. Anyway we all knew Zeke was going and it just brings a tear to my eye to see the first stop on the road to insanity for my boy Zekey and his Zekeyness. 

This episode wasn't as good as episode one it was slow and could get a little boring so for my final score

7/10

Good Things: Character Development 

Good Challenge

Owen being Owen

Negatives: Slow

Too Predictable

Zeke's Eliminated

Next Episode will involve: Poochy References, LeEminem's Lose my Earrings, Justin song, Katie and Sadie hate and another depressing Owen story thanks everyone

3v9ab4,9,2015-12-03,I need to get this off my chest. My story and reasons to quit,bromodfly,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/3v9ab4/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_my_story_and/,"Hi r/StopGaming,

I feel like I have to write this, so bear with me. I hope that this can possibly help someone.

My gaming started when I was a child. My parents were great, and they helped me keep a balance with it (even when I didn't want to). Around the time I turned 14/15 I quit playing video games - because I started doing drugs. Just smoking a little weed at first, and this escalated into rehab, hospital overdoses, arrests... pretty much everything bad that could have happened.

I'm writing this because I feel video games are just as addictive for me as the cocaine I was addicted to for 3 years.

Now I'm going to take a step back. I quit doing as many drugs (though I partake more often than I would like, especially cigarettes), but my life is great now. I've made all A's in university as a science major for 2.5 years. I'm on a full scholarship plus stipend, and I've been lucky enough to get internships and other opportunities. I started my own business while still in school which is surprisingly much more successful than I would have thought. My parents and I are on great terms. I have many friends, and I am very outgoing. Perhaps the best thing about me is my girlfriend, who is far better to me than I deserve. She is absolutely wonderful.

I started playing DotA 2 on September 21st, and I've logged around 150 hours in those 72 days, with the majority being the past 2 weeks (played 70 hours). This may not seem like a lot to some of you guys (and I'm not trying to say it is), but the thing that frightens me is that I recognize my addiction in this game. I've been here before with drugs. The only thing I care about is one more game (hit). It doesn't matter what else is happening around me. I dream about it. When I can't play anymore and decide to cut myself off for the night, I end up watching streams or pro matches on youtube for another 2 hours. I've made the worst grades I've ever made this semester. I may be able to come back with finals coming up, but I may not.

This addiction is terrifying to me. With cocaine, my nose hurts and I can't do anymore. I'll willingly fall asleep and save it for tomorrow. Not with DotA. DotA doesn't physically hurt me. DotA doesn't make my nose bleed. DotA doesn't cost money. DotA isn't a ""serious"" addiction. DotA isn't illegal. DotA won't ruin my life. DotA won't ruin my life.

**DotA will ruin my life, if I keep going.**

Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating. My life is great, and in truth, the things that I have sacrificed to DotA are little right now, but I am terrified of gaming. Even if I keep playing DotA, I'll still probably make money, keep my girlfriend happy, and fulfill my purpose in life. But even then, I know I won't be the best person I can be, at the sacrifice of being a better player. I fear I will wake up in ten, twenty, thirty years with a mediocre life. I wouldn't be happy with 7 kills and 7 deaths, why would be happy with the equivalent real life score?

Drugs and DotA both trap you. That feeling of ""I lost... I need to play another to redeem myself"" and ""I won!... Play another to continue the streak"" is the exact same thing as ""This cocaine is good, I'll do more"" or ""This cocaine is not good, I need to buy and do more to feel it"". No matter what, you're a slave. You are not making your own decisions anymore. Your brain has been hijacked and you are incapable of making rational decisions anymore; this is addiction. It is the same addiction. 

I want people to know from this that it is a serious problem, and that this devil is doing pushups every second, waiting for you to fail, waiting for you to reinstall. Do not give in.

PM me if you want to talk or vent to me anonymously. Talking about your addiction really helps get over it, if for no other reason than being able to organize your feelings on the topic in a logical way. 

Thanks for reading. 

**tl;dr DotA may not be as bad as crack but they're pretty much the same thing**"

I have no idea of how this thing works, so I've been looking for the past week and I've come up with what I think could work.

I have 5 lists so far, Clients, Orders, Order, Products and Suppliers. Some of the columns in this lists are linked and trigger some workflows and whatnot. So far I've managed to overcome the limitations of not having full control over the site and working with SharePoint 2007 in general.

However I am now stuck and don't know how to proceed with what I'm trying to achieve. 

In my list ""Order"" I keep all of the items that are required for a order, the quantities required, etc... My plan is to create views or filter them somehow. (I've found [this](""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/cc300163(v=office.12).aspx"") but the result is not as good as creating a custom view).

* Launch NewForm in a list (Orders).
* When the item is created I want to create a new custom view in another list (Order), showing only the items that contain a certain field in a certain column, which is a lookup containing the names of the items in the first list Orders.
* Editing one of the columns (""single line of text"") in the item created in the first step with the hyperlink to the view.
I have no idea how to proceed, what or where I should look into in order to solve this. Can you please point me into the right direction?"

In the meanwhile, I discovered that I really enjoyed programming. When I was accepted and went to orientation, I figured ""Hey, I'm in engineering, I suppose I'll just do Comp E."" I'm currently a freshman at the University of Maryland, so both programs are relatively highly ranked. I've been debating switching to CS for months now, but it's been really difficult. I know I enjoy programming, but I also like making Arduino projects, which may align better with a Comp E degree. 

I think that I COULD handle a Comp E degree, but is there any good reason to? I think that I want to pursue Software Engineering, but in the future, I may want to branch out into hardware. Do I need to get a degree in order to do that? Maybe if I have good internships then it would have enough experience that it wouldn't really matter. Maybe I could do a Masters or PhD?

They're lovely people, but they believe in family with a capital F. I know they don't have too many years ahead of them, and I desperately want to spend time with them - I just don't want my mother to be there. She's been calling a bunch to try and ""facilitate"" my seeing them. (When are you going? Are you even going to go? Do you know that Hannukah's coming up soon? You should go for the candle lighting ceremony. I'm calling for them; they have trouble using the phone.)

I told her I can make plans with them on my own, thank you very much, and she doesn't have to stick her nose in it. It's leaving a rather sour taste in my mouth.

I'm super uncomfortable being around or talking to her... She acts like there's no reason for things to be strained between us after she tried to guilt me into breaking the law for her, then threatened to kick me out - and when I started packing quickly got on her knees (literally) and started begging for me to stay and help her. This followed by renditions of ""you're a bitch, you're throwing me to the wolves!"" and the like.

She later apologized and told me it's probably better for me to live somewhere else (after two weeks of homelessness I found a place with my boyfriend and two of his friends for cheap rent) and told me she'd still give me allowance every month until I'm back on my feet.

I'm 23, I have a B.F.A., and I suffer from pretty debilitating clinical depression. The years of gaslighting and being called lazy probably haven't helped. I'm in a government program now following a few months of internships, and I'm currently waiting on my job developer to help me find a paid placement. I did more work than anybody else during the training portion of the program and have done a lot to generate leads with potential employers and networking contacts... But I'm really exhausted now and super down about the whole thing, between prepping for interviews and applying for disability support.

I'm in therapy and on medication and I'm really hoping this particularly low point passes. I've been crying a lot and feeling rather helpless.

Now, the allowance doesn't actually come from my mother. My mother's spent the last few years making almost nothing with a company called ACN - more like a cult than a business opportunity if anything. The money really comes from my stepfather's spousal support during their year-long divorce proceedings that have zero end in sight.

I've had one phone conversation with him in the past year. For all his faults, he's repentant and supportive. But of course, he can't give me anything directly without risking my mother taking him back to court, so it's rather a moot point. And I'm still pretty hurt that the first time I've heard from him since last December was only a fortnight ago.

So obviously, her saying ""I'll still support you!"" is more like, ""I'll still pass on what your stepfather's been putting aside for you rather than taking it for myself - like I've done with your sister for the past year!"" Which is honestly shit I'm really not supposed to know.

I just want to see and spend time with my grandparents without the constant guilt trips and outright lies... I'm just so tired. What do I do? Must I suck it up or is there another option I'm not seeing here?"
3vaox1,4,2015-12-03,Choosing between a startup and a tradition company,dovakin422,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vaox1/choosing_between_a_startup_and_a_tradition_company/,"I am currently a senior pursuing my BS in Comp Sci in the NYC area. I currently have offers from two traditional companies (one utility, and one asset manager) and was recently offered an intern to hire position at a very small startup (&lt;20 employees, only 4 developers). I am really torn on what offer I should take. The compensation across the three are all in the same ballpark, with the startup actually offering a little bit more (it's located in an expensive part of Manhattan). I know that going to a startup that small is generally a risk, and jobs at large traditional companies are generally considered relatively secure, but I feel that being young (25) and single is the time to take risks like this. Anyone else ever been in a similar situation? What did you wind up doing/what are your suggestions?"
3vaw16,1,2015-12-03,Is this job fair?,j_ker,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/3vaw16/is_this_job_fair/,"My friend finally got a job after searching for months, as a software developer. This person graduated with bachelors and masters from two different and expensive universities. He already worked for 1 year at another company as an intern. However this time, he again could only manage to be an intern at the job, with 2500 AED monthly, full time, in Dubai. Does this seem fair to anyone? The money he spent for his studies alone is considerable. All he said was that it was a reputable company. I feel that they are underpaying someone with such qualifications and experience. 

EDIT: Thanks for the reply, guys. I really appreciate it. I will try my best to talk some sense into the guy. "
3vawtb,11,2015-12-03,I keep wondering why everyone is so pent up about the Bureau of Land Management.,Tristopolis,PointlessStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/3vawtb/i_keep_wondering_why_everyone_is_so_pent_up_about/,"Every time the conversation on the internet moves towards US politics and recent happenings, I keep seeing people get so angry about the Bureau.

""I used to intern for those guys,"" I always think to myself. ""They haven't done anything crazy in like, 20 or 30 years at least"". I keep understanding what's going on and what everyone's talking about and then reforgetting the second I get off the computer, only to be met by more confusion the next time I come across it.

The BLM might get shit for its history of mining and oil and all that, but there are good people working there. You guys should support them.

""I was raped and druged by a monster that I was dating he was from Iraq came to Canada as a refugee.. Not only he told me they are going to cause world war 3 but that people are stupid in Canada and America... U give them a car walkie talkie and they drive cabs\ taxis at anytime they can hit anything and we would pay the gas to get there ... He also told me that back where he came from Iraq he seen his mother raped his friends leg from being blown up that's all was left.. He seen dead babies body's ppl of all ages dead by Americans and that this war killed 2millions of them and that revenge is all they want to take from us here to give karma and revenge.. To them we are an infidels ... I was druged by my food so that I would be raped by his friends ... They all walk free now and I was am not the first girl they do this to there are others rose Pope and more ... I'm a born and raised Canadian and I tried to put them away not only my government let me down in a victim impact statement was bullshit ... I live in housing for my protection when I've seen him on my street ... So because his country is in war there is no deportation but what they have done to me will for ever be there some days are better some all I do is cry.. I've joined groups for women with women ... And one on one psychiatry.. They beat and burned my body I have marks and scars u can see and ones u can not see.. I met a American we married and had a baby I'm waiting to move to America.. This country has let me down.. Only the guy got 3 years the rest got away ... But when they do this again don't call me like I told the courts its ur problem not mine. These ppl mind has been broken they seen so much death war rape their house being blown up family friends the same or worse .. They are broken hurt consumed with pain suffering that intern it comes out in anger or aggression and revenge they need psychological professional help.. The guy that did this came to Canada when he was 3 now he is in his 30 like me ... But u know what u will do what u want and put ppl that are innocent at risk... Shame on those that do.. Cuz he was right Canadians are stupid and very trusting so let them all in even isis who cares this war was caused by bush and ppl that profited after oil... Now I see it's all krama in the end u get what u asked for and then put it on the news like its new ? Well u see it's not and most of them want u , us to pay for what we have let happen to them cuz we don't care we killed 2,million of ppl from their land. Women and children and more that were not part of a war like me but now I have two choices get back or forgive and I choose forgive .. I forgive them but I think this is wrong... They need help and alot of it the mind is broken so is the heart... U can't being this onto population when they are looked and charged by the majority...They should be watched and told to get help someone to talk to most of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder with more this is a problem .. They need to understand forgiveness love compassion serenity law abiding citizens... They are on a state of war many of them all there lives u can't being that to population and expect them to act appropriately it's ludicrous... Face the facts or more law suits will happen as I did Sue the the system for this... Is what it is ... God bless and take care..."""

I started doing really well once I figured it out but my overall GPA is still under a 3.0 at a 2.86. My major GPA is a 3.2. I love to code and I have numerous android apps, embedded system projects, cloud applications and internship experience so my resume looks nice and I get a lot of calls but I don't include GPA. I have had multiple interviews that were going great until they immediately shut down after they realized my GPA was sub 3.0. Is it a fact that employers do actually care about GPA rather than what I had heard from many in the field? How do I keep the focus on my passion for coding / past projects and not my academic performance."
3vbil6,0,2015-12-03,Need help deciding between internships. Any help is appreciated and valued. Thanks!,tophorra,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vbil6/need_help_deciding_between_internships_any_help/,"So I've gotten internship offers from AppDynamics (Page on appdynamics.com) and Flatiron Health (The New Standard for Oncology Technology) over the summer.

But before I say any more, a bit about myself. I'm a student on a F1 visa.  Both these startups have said they can sponsor H1B's for me if I get a return offer. That is the most important aspect for my internship.

Now, AppDyanmics is in SF and Flatiron health is in NYC. And SF has been hailed as the central for anyone who wants to launch a tech career.
Also, I think AppDyanmics is a more funded and stronger Startup than Flatiron. These two points make me want to intern at AppDyanmics.

However I find the work Flatiron does more engaging. It's also compensating me a lot better than AppDyanmics, but that could just be because of the difference in costs between NYC and SF.

If anyone can shed some light on what kind of startups these both are I'd be indebted. My deadline to accept the offer draws near and I'm very confused on the matter. Thanks.

Just to put it out there:

AppDyanmics is offering $5700 per month with a $500 housing stipend.

Flatiron Health is offering $7300 per month with a $1000 housing stipend.

Thanks for your time!"
3vbjcr,1,2015-12-03,"Post-Grad internships: Do they exist? If not, why not?",PM_ME_YOUR_ALGORYTHM,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vbjcr/postgrad_internships_do_they_exist_if_not_why_not/,"It's clear that while there is a high demand for skilled software engineers, the new grads are finding it difficult to find jobs (me being one of them). 

I feel like Post-grad internships would solve a lot of problems for the new grads, and give companies a lower risk chance to try out prospective candidates that they're not sure about. You sign on for 4 months at a lower pay and have no guarantee of a full-time position, but at least you get get the experience.

I personally have an internship at a local decently successful tech startup  (they're not going to be a unicorn anytime soon though), but I seem to be losing out to candidates that have a second or third internship under their belts (many of which are big tech firms -- though not necessarily big 4). Both because it looks good on their resume, and second because when they get asked questions in their interviews, they have the experience to back up their answers.

I guess this was a half rant, half question as to why post-grad internships aren't a thing.

Edit: removed stuff about myself because it upset some people"

-How much clothes should I bring with me? Do they do laundry there or do I pack enough to last me the two weeks? As well as how many different shoes and pants? And are suits needed or just dress shirts?

-DU is at like a farm/barn, will I be there the whole time or would we travel to nearby cities and stuff too? Is the place exciting or boring?

-I will have a roommate, is it someone from the city I will be interning at (Dallas) or can it be anyone from around the country?

-How bad does it look if I hook up with other interns? I heard a lot of people hook up during training but does it look down upon from the seniors or does no one actually care what you do?

-Anything else I should know about training? I haven't received the schedule yet so not sure exactly what I'll be doing but is it typically like taking classes 8-6 and then free time after and weekends are off days?

3vc1y2,5,2015-12-03,When to tell potential employer about only being able to work until Sep. 2016,Panda_Muffins,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3vc1y2/when_to_tell_potential_employer_about_only_being/,"For reference, I am a 22 yr. old with a B.S. in a STEM field, a very high GPA, internationally competitive awards, strong experiences, and the like. I'm starting a PhD program in the fall of 2016, but I need to make money between Jan. 2016 and when classes start. I have a paid research position lined up (a continuation of work I had been doing for over a year), but the professor has to make sure he has the finances to support me, so I am looking for jobs in case he can't pay me.

I am applying for a bunch of paid internships, but it's an awkward time of year and most positions are normal full-time jobs in my areas of interest/expertise. I am submitting applications to pretty much anything I feel qualified for and have already received a number of responses to schedule interviews. I feel like I am a very desirable applicant for some of these positions and wanted to at least be considered and put my name out there.  

The question is, when do I tell the interviewer I am specifically looking to work between Jan. 2016 and Sep. 2016, as I'm doing my PhD in the fall? Do I bring it up when scheduling the interview? At the beginning of the interview? At the very end when I've sold myself? 

What do you consider best? "

I'm a computer engineering sophomore at Middle East Technical University (in Ankara, Turkey). Up to this point I've done pretty much nothing except for studying the college courses. So I've got a cumulative GPA of 3.96/4.00 for the first year, and also my score in the colege admission exam here was marvellous but I've got no other talents or I haven't done any projects yet. Also I am not sure about what I want to do as a computer engineer in the future.
Especially in Europe, are there any prestigious names to whom I can apply for summer internship with these qualities I've got. From research labs to sizeable companies. I want to spend my summer learning and doing something useful while having a good reference for my future.

Any help will be greatly appreciated, and thank you for helping.

3vcncr,18,2015-12-03,"[Request] [F4F] ""Why didn't you stop, Mommy? Why did you hurt me?"" [incest] [mother/daughter] [rape] [starts out consensual] [strap-on] [ignoring pleas to stop] [overwhelming guilt] [begging forgiveness] [bleeding] [depressing as fuck]",johnboy3434,gonewildaudio,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio/comments/3vcncr/request_f4f_why_didnt_you_stop_mommy_why_did_you/,"My mind went to another dark place, and this skeletal scenario was the result. It sort of tapers off by the time the sex begins, because the muse randomly decided to fuck off. I put F4F in the title because the character being spoken to is female (the performer would be playing the mother), but since I am decidedly not female, I make no claim of accurately depicting lesbian lovemaking. Or heterosexual lovemaking, for that matter. Or lovemaking that involves dogs and/or Yoda from *Star Wars*.

Life as a single mother isn't exactly easy, doubly so when you're a lesbian, but you've managed to make do. Your successful law practice is testament to your fortitude, perseverance, and professionalism. But above all that, your greatest treasure is your 18-year-old daughter. You've always felt that she saved your life. Before she was born, your life was... different. You try not to think about it too much, lest you begin to miss it. You did things you weren't proud of. The alcohol. The drugs. The partying. The sex. Lots and lots of sex. Yeah, your heart has always lusted after your own gender, but when you're washing down a second hit of molly with a bottle of Jack and you're already eating out that cute little redhead in the middle of the dance floor, the lines can get a little blurred. One night, they got blurred enough that, nine months later, you got a blonde, blue-eyed, seven-pound wake-up call.

The urge to go back, to take a drink, to pick up a girl who looked like the kind of trouble you didn't need but desperately wanted, it was almost undeniable. Then you just looked at her, the light of your life, the center of your world, and you found the strength to let those opportunities pass by.

And today, she's 18. That's not possible. In a couple months, she's leaving you. That's terrifying. But like all parents, you bear it with a straight face. After the requisite birthday dinner (honestly, the girl loves Olive Garden more than can possibly be healthy), it's back to your penthouse apartment for presents. A laptop for studying (yeah, right), a sweater with the university logo on it, a comprehensive history of the football team that she'll be obligated to root for. You know, the essentials.

Then comes one of those moments. You'd seen it often enough: she wants to tell you something, but she's afraid. This time, you have a pretty good idea. Throughout high school, you've always asked if there was anyone she was sweet on, but the answer was always a rather flat ""no"". But, it was the kind of ""no"" that spoke volumes. The kind of ""no"" that you remember having to give your parents whenever they asked you. You break the ice yourself, ""You're gay, aren't you, sweetie?"" You give her a reassuring smile. The girl nods, but the tension doesn't dissipate. You try to alleviate it with some small talk concerning her sexuality. What attracts her, etc. She says she prefers older women. You become concerned. Did one of her teachers ever try to—she cuts you off. Nothing like that happened. It's just something she noticed about her desires as she grew up. You ask her, not as her mother, but as her friend, if she ever had a secret girlfriend. She meekly responds, ""no"".

Finally, she can't stand beating around the bush any longer: ""Will you be my first?"" A cannonball flying through the window couldn't have knocked you off your feet any harder than that question did. She immediately launches into a confession of love and admiration. You're the perfect woman. You're everything she wants to be. You're everything she wants to have. She never fooled around with anyone, even when one of the cheerleaders hinted that she was up for it. She was saving herself. Saving herself for the woman who deserved to be her first. For you.

She knows that you've never had a girlfriend since she was born. You were too focussed on her needs to satisfy your own. Now you can do both, she says. Her confession is starting to evolve. This isn't just about popping her cherry. This is about the future. Long-term. It's not like she looks just like you. She got all of her looks from her father (whoever he was), so you could actually go out, she says. Like, as a couple. In the Olive Garden, she fantasized that other people were looking at the two of you, figuring that some little tart had found herself a sugar mama. Whenever you visit at college, she could introduce you as her girlfriend. Maybe, after a few years, she could even introduce you as her wife. As long as you're out of town, no one has to know that you're not actually married, and behind closed doors, it could be truth in all but name.

Your brain is fried. Your long-dormant libido is starting to see an unacceptable amount of sense in her proposition. This has to stop now. Then you see the eagerness in her eyes, the sincerity of her plea. The love, the unbridled love. Don't do it. You lean forward. Don't do it. Your hand caresses her cheek. For the love of God, don't do it. You do it. Your lips meet, and you pounce like the cougar you apparently are. Your daughter is pinned to the couch in seconds. Your hands are everywhere. Clothing is gone. Your daughter is overwhelmed. Beyond words. This wasn't what she expected.

You lower your face to her virgin pussy, and it's like riding a bicycle. Soon your daughter is bucking against your face, speaking words that might have been English in her mind but come out as pleading gibberish. She's too fuckdrunk to stand, so you pick her up. You carry her across the threshold, to your bed, throwing her confused frame down onto it. You start rummaging through drawers, trying to find... it. Your favorite instrument of pleasure. Mr. Shock-and-Awe, you call it, for the reaction girls always had when they saw it. If your daughter wants to lose her virginity, she's going to get what she wants, in spades. Time to bring Mr. Shock-and-Awe out of retirement.

As you strap it around your waist, memories come flooding back. The club. The drugs. The alcohol. The cute redhead that, nine months later, you named your daughter after. In your drug-addled mind at the time, she was the one that got away. Your daughter looks less confident than she did when this started. In fact, she doesn't look confident at all. She looks scared. That look on your face is something she's never seen before. The lust, burning so intensely. And that thing between your legs. You can't be serious. As you pin her arms to the bed and smother her mouth with yours, she knows you're serious.

She screams into your mouth as you ram home. Eighteen years of repression come rushing back to you. Everything you've wanted, you take it. You're not fucking your daughter. You're fucking the cute redhead on that date you canceled because you woke up with your first bout of morning sickness. You're fucking that grad student who invited you out for drinks on graduation day. You're fucking the fellow intern who invited you into a storage closet for a little stress-relieving session. You're fucking your secretary, because you're the boss now and she does whatever the fuck you tell her to do. You're fucking that working girl with impeccable gaydar who strolled up to your window while you were at a red light. You're fucking all of them, fighting to keep them in place, catching them again when they slip past your grip and slapping them with all your might to let them know you aren't finished yet. Your orgasm is a supernova behind your eyes. You waited almost two decades to feel this again, and now you have it. You have it for the rest of your life, with a woman who will always love you.

As the light fades, her face comes back into view, and your heart freezes in your chest. Your daughter's lip is busted and swollen. She's crying her eyes out, her voice an incoherent litany of ""Please stop"", ""No more"", and ""It hurts"". You back off, a scream coming from your daughter as Mr. Shock-and-Awe pulls free. You look down, and you want to kill yourself. That isn't just a smattering of virginal blood. It's a pool. The sheets are saturated in the center. And the pool is still growing. She's still bleeding. Moving as quick as she dares, she crawls away from you, the blood forming a trail, to the far side of the mattress, where she curls into a ball.

You're paralyzed. You need to call an ambulance, but how are you going to explain this? You try to get closer to her, but she yelps and flails her arms to keep you away. ""No more"", she says. You immediately divest yourself of the bloody strapon, but it doesn't help. ""Why didn't you stop? I yelled to stop, that were hurting me. Why did you hurt me?"" these questions are all you can make out through the sobs. You try to inspect the damage, but as soon as you reach between her legs she fights to keep you away.

You try your best to soothe her, but it won't work. She doesn't trust you. Your baby, the little one that always depended on you, doesn't trust you. You hurt her. You betrayed that trust. You raped her. The word is like a further punch to the gut. You're the most disgusting trash on Earth. She trusted you to show her the pleasures of making love, and now for all you know you've hindered her ability to ever do it again.

No time for that now. You need to help her. One last time. Then you need to decide where you're going: prison, or out your apartment window. Does it matter? You're going to Hell, anyway."

I am a recent university grad majored in Computer Science looking for a job in the tech industry. It's been a few months, and I haven't found a job yet. 


**About her**:

She is an intelligent/smart European student, who recently finished her undergrad and continuing her studies in a Master's program. 


**How we met**:

We teamed up at a tech company's hackathon event. We successfully built the application. Although, we did not win the competition, we were really happy we built it. 


**What happened then**:

After the hackathon, she actively started messaging me. I liked her too, so I asked her out. We had a great first date. At the end of the date she kept asking about my job, and I felt really uncomfortable answering her questions about it. She went back to Europe and started her internship with a reputed tech company. 


**The problem now**:

When she was going I decided that I will find employment and then contact her. So I messaged her saying if I get a job I will let her know. Fast forward a few weeks, she messaged me again telling how excited she is starting the internship and asked me about my job again. She seemed supportive in the chat. I really want to chat with her and know how she is managing stuff out there. I really care for her, and think of her every single day, but I am stopping myself from contacting her. I feel embarrassed about contacting her when I am unemployed. 


What should I do? Is it ok to talk to her now in this situation ? or should I hold myself out until I get a job? 


Am I being a nice guy, who is hiding his flaws and displaying avoidant behavior? Does it fit the equation? [This is for those who have read 'No more Mr. Nice guy' book]

   
**tl;dr**: 

I recently graduated and am looking for a job. She is interning at an awesome company. I feel embarassed to talk to her because of my unemployment. Should I talk to her or not?

There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

I have a phone interview for Google New Grad SE coming up soon. I'm cramming every single day and trying my best to prepare myself.

Been at the same company as an intern throughout college, and full time 3 years post graduation. I'm interviewing with one of the big dogs next week and feeling confident i'll be a good fit. The role would require me to move to a rural area on the otherside of the country, where I won't know anybody. I grew up in a rural area, so that's only a minor concern.

Since I've never switched major  jobs before, i'm hoping somebody can help me weigh pro's/con's before/**IF** I end up with an offer.



Cons of current job:


    *My team's dynamics suck, boss is a 'yes' man who avoids all conflict. 
    *very uneven workload among the team, as in 20% of the team does 90% of the work while management refuses to address the issue. 
    *Very silo'd role - not much chance of moving out of my current team in the future, but i could still get one to two more promotions before 'peaking' in my role. 
    *I'm salaried with a 48 hour work week minimum requirement (no overtime pay). Typically work 48-52 hours a week, plus on-call duties every 5 weeks. No bonuses.

Pro's of current job:


    *flexible schedule. 
    *Yearly raises are typically significant. 
    *Good environment to learn. 
    *Family/friends in current city. 
    *Can travel once a year to a conference, such as F5 Agility or Cisco Live. Am currently in a more Senior position.


Pros of potential new job:


    *One of the biggest tech companies on my resume.
    * Environment to expand my existing knowledge significantly.
    * Pay would increase. Serious step forward for my career. New part of the country to explore (in US).  



Cons of potential new job:


    *no friends/family in new place. 
    *All the unknowns with taking a new job and moving across the country

Been at the same company as an intern throughout college, and full time 3 years post graduation. I'm interviewing with one of the big dogs next week and feeling confident i'll be a good fit. The role would require me to move to a rural area on the otherside of the country, where I won't know anybody. I grew up in a rural area, so that's only a minor concern.
Since I've never switched major jobs before, i'm hoping somebody can help me weigh pro's/con's before/IF I end up with an offer.
Cons of current job:
*My team's dynamics suck, boss is a 'yes' man who avoids all conflict. 
*very uneven workload among the team, as in 20% of the team does 90% of the work while management refuses to address the issue. 
*Very silo'd role - not much chance of moving out of my current team in the future, but i could still get one to two more promotions before 'peaking' in my role. 
*I'm salaried with a 48 hour work week minimum requirement (no overtime pay). Typically work 48-52 hours a week, plus on-call duties every 5 weeks. No bonuses.
Pro's of current job:
*flexible schedule. 
*Yearly raises are typically significant. 
*Good environment to learn. 
*Family/friends in current city. 
*Can travel once a year to a conference, such as F5 Agility or Cisco Live. Am currently in a more Senior position.
Pros of potential new job:
*One of the biggest tech companies on my resume.
* Environment to expand my existing knowledge significantly.
* Pay would increase. Serious step forward for my career. New part of the country to explore (in US).  
Cons of potential new job:
*no friends/family in new place. 
*All the unknowns with taking a new job and moving across the country
So, with all that said, is there anybody in/were in a similar position? What was your experience in moving across the country? What you would do?"

Right now my start date has not been determined, but I was just wondering what the options are. I looked at what other redditors have posted and it seems that it's either August, September or October. However, I've heard from someone that a June start date is also possible. I am choosing MSA classes for my 150, so I want to know how much leeway I can have next semester to get the exam done as well. Could anyone share their experience? Thank you in advance!!!"

I feel like I'm being dragged down and drowning myself, but don't know what to do for him or me anymore.",the_crows_care_not,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ve5fm/i_30f_have_been_with_my_bf_29m_for_nearly_a/,"I've (30F) been with my bf Sam(29M) (name changed) for nearly a decade. We met in a time where we were still exploring who we were, and as time has gone on, we've matured and grown together. In the beginning we would go to concerts, music festivals, camping outings, long drives just to go, etc. These weren't things that he would be jumping for joy to do, because #1, he's not that kind of guy, and #2 he's dealt with depression since his teens. Over the years the outings have pretty much stopped, and it's like pulling teeth to get him to do anything, even watch a movie at home, go out to lunch, go grocery shopping, etc, with me. If we do go do anything, I **always** foot all the bills.


As of December last year he graduated college after 9 years (part and then full time), with a degree in education, but scored too low to get the certification. Given two choices he chose to not retake the 6 month internship, and at the time the plan was to be a substitute for a while. That never happened. He said school had made him miserable, and that he absolutely regretted getting his teaching degree. Instead he decided to stay home. Then he decided to try to do some ebay and amazon selling to bring in more money, as I was footing all the bills and going into debt to keep us afloat. 

In April during a fight (about bills and money) he threatened to hurt himself. At the time it was decided he would not go into intake at the crisis center, but within a week he chose to go that route, feeling it was best for him. Since then he's been diagnosed as bipolar, on top of his depression and adhd. He got set up with  a dr. and counselor, and takes loads of meds to deal with his various issues. 

The online sales helped to pay some bills, but I was still handling the majority. We would get into constant fights about this. Then his father passed after a long illnesss in August. Since then Sam has been steadily getting worse. Changes in meds either don't work, or the dr changes them before they have a chance to. Sam's mom (also our landlord) stepped in to try to help us. Sam is due an inheritance sometime soon from his father's side of the family. She paid me back all the bills I'd paid for Sam, and then when he gets the inheritance, he will pay her back out of it. So the financial issues for the moment are handled.

But I feel like I am over my head here. I myself work full time, and am a part time student. I don't know what to do for him anymore. He stays at home all day everyday doing a little of the online sales some days. Other days he just plays video games or sleeps. Usually when I come home he will announce that he did a load of laundry, or switched the dishes out of the dishwasher, as if waiting for a round of applause. I feel like an asshole. I know on one level that so much of what he deals with is the depression and meds. On another level I feel like saying ""I just came home from 8 hours of work, and will put in another 3 or 4 doing homework, but yeah! Great job doing the dishes!! /s"". I know that these achievements are probably huge for him somedays, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one doing anything. I feel like I am dragging him through life to keep on, one day at a time. I am exhausted. Our sex life is at a minimum, as I generally have a lower libido and him higher, as well as him gaining a sizeable amount of weight lately. I don't feel sexually attracted to him this way. With the always down attitude, no motivation, general unhealthiness, and me taking on the brunt of ""real world"" duties to keep us going, I feel like I have a dependent rather than an equal partner, and like I'm just a cash cow.

I've thought about breaking it off, but I'm scared of what he would do to himself, and I'm scared of being alone. Great reasons to stay together, right? I love him, but I don't know if I can mentally, emotionally, or physically deal with this anymore. I feel like I'm being dragged underwater, trying to gulp breaths of air. The deeper I get pulled under, the more I feel this intense pressure on my chest like the breath I'm holding onto is burning my lungs. I myself deal with huge amounts of daily stress and anxiety, but I've always been the one to get shit done. Lately I'm finding that I need help, and I don't feel like I will ever get it.

I don't know what I expect from anyone reading this, but I just had to get all this off my chest. 

tl;dr. longterm bf has depression, bipolar, adhd. I feel like I'm drowning in the various burdens I must shoulder. Help."
3ve68z,4,2015-12-04,I have created my first app to get an internship.

I've decided  to create my own app and understand basic best practise of Android. So here is my project :
https://github.com/jfabri63/ClothsWeather
So at first I force the user to choose a city in the autocomplete view using Google Autocomplete API. I get the GPS coordinate with another API.
Then the user choose how much time he wants to go out and with openweather API I get the weather with GPS coordinate. In the second fragment I suggest the user how he should dress according to the temp.

I'm planning to add more extensions to learn more aspect of android programming. So if you have suggestion about what I can add in a special way that could help me to discover new parts of Android programming it would be cool.
By the way I'm using volley libraire to send request and EventBus to pass data between fragment. I don't know if these libraries are ""good practise"" but I found pretty good review on the internet.

So if you have suggestion about my code ( I know it's a bit ugly) and extensions that I could add. I'm happy to hear it.

I've been stuck in a depressive mental rut lately and it's just been bothering me. Do you guys ever feel ugly about your skin color/ethnicity? I have been, since most of the girls around me are white, beautiful, and I've just been feeling hopeless. It sucks just walking out the door that a good number (not all, I can't say that, but realistically it's a sizeable portion) of them won't think of me that way due to something that I can't change about myself. I figured out awhile ago that I couldn't conform to society's standard of a good looking white guy, no matter how hard I tried. I see it within my race, how lighter skin color is valued and desired way more than darker skin color. I'm not that dark, but I'm noticeably brown, and I just don't know how else I can own it more being one of the few brown people in a big campus of pretty white folks. Aside from my physical stature (5'9 ~200lbs) It seems like I've just been losing steam and effort with girls. I'm getting back into lifting and dieting (myfitnesspal and cutting down on eating out), so I can't just blame it all on my skin color. I know how much exercise can lift your confidence and yourself, and I truly do value that. I realize the power it has and have been utilizing it more. Yet, I've just been feeling hopeless and my self-confidence is internally collapsing, even though I don't want it to. I've never been too successful with girls (20 years old, never had a gf) but I've been trying around. Getting involved, going out, meeting new people, people seem to love me as a friend! My phone isn't constantly blowing up with invites, but I get to go out and see people and I do have a life. People find me funny! People like me! But, it's like no girl likes me the way I want them to, and after awhile, I think that I'm becoming a bit numb to it. I know I'm not supposed to give up, and I don't want to, but I just wish that I was white sometimes. It gets tough being alone and seeing others with their girl/s. I don't even think I'm just after sex, but I just want some intimacy. Some companionship. I've never had a sober kiss before, or a girl find me attractive in a long time. It's like I'm trying to dig myself out of loneliness, but I'm not making progress. I can't blame it all on my skin color, and a lot of it does have to do with my attitude, diagnosed anxiety and depression as well. Depression and anxiety have gotten so bad to the point where i did something really shameful and regretful about a year and a half back. I lost my virginity to a prostitute. It wasn't good, I did it out of desperation and I felt disgusted with myself. What's worse is that I did it again when I had a small nervous breakdown episode about the same issue. I have nobody but myself to blame for that, and I accepted it and moved on from it. Since then, I've been having good streaks of confidence and happiness since finding myself more in college, which does make me really happy, but I just don't want to become a 21 year old without much or any experience/good history. I've become more successful as a person, student, and future workforce member by finding my passion in a good major and locking down some internships, but don't think/feel that I've personally succeeded. I've made my family and myself proud, but there's still a lot to answer for. I feel mature enough to truly have sex and engage in a relationship because I have a better understanding of myself and others than I did back then, but it's been a tough and lonely journey on the inside. I just want some good memories, that's all. I know I have to make them, but this time it takes 2 to make this type of memory and it isn't looking like it'll happen anytime soon. I just don't want to spend another year without at least some contact, a good pick-me-up or confidence boost from a girl. I don't like how hairy I am, or my skin tone. I know this was a rant with a huge personal tangent, but I've just been feeling bad lately about what I've become. I've been tossing and turning in my sleep, retreating to porn, and I'm afraid of how it'll last long term."
3vecnw,2,2015-12-04,"It's been an entire month, but it hasn't gotten easier.",throwaway91234478098,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3vecnw/its_been_an_entire_month_but_it_hasnt_gotten/,"I followed all of the general advice. I hit the gym, I focused on myself, I drag my body out the door once a week to go hang out with people and distract myself, so why is it that I can't stop thinking about you?

I should have known a month prior when I went well out of my way to see you for a weekend. We met up briefly on Saturday, which was nice, and had planned to spend all of Sunday together. I was waiting for you for 30 minutes when you finally told me that your ride wanted to visit a friend and you wouldn't be able to make it. Never in my life had I felt so betrayed. The biggest red flag was that you didn't even attempt to contact me or apologize You just tried to defer the blame and pretend it never happened. I was livid and was absolutely determined to end things there, but a few cute snapchats, a few days of non-stop texting and two days spent together the next week and I had practically forgotten all about it. 

It was long distance, you said that was the reason it didn't work out. You said it had nothing to do with the guy you had recently became best friends with and spent more time with than you did with me. The guy who you know is in love with you. The guy who sang and played your favorite song to you on his guitar one night. The night you lied to me about what happened because you were too *nice* and didn't want me to feel bad about it because ""it meant nothing"".

In the weeks leading up to the breakup. You started becoming more and more distant, and I started blaming myself. Drowning in my insecurities, I worked to try to be the best possible person I could be for you. I thought that every problem in our relationship stemmed from my inadequacy, and that I had to become better to keep it together. I could see everything crumbling, and I asked time and time again what you wanted. If you wanted it to end, I was prepared for that. But whenever I prodded, you were so *nice* and said ""You're fine"" and that I had nothing to worry about, as if you didn't see the walls crashing down around us.

After agonizing weeks of this, I finally called you out on it. I told you that I knew you weren't happy. You agreed and so it ended. It was for the best. You said you still wanted to us to stay close friends, but you were just being *nice* to spare my feelings. That was true for about 3 days. In the last month, we have spoken a grand total of 2 times because you've been ""busy"". You were so nice to me, but you didn't realize that I didn't want niceness. I just wanted honesty. Being nice didn't make the harsh reality any easier, it just delayed the inevitable and made you feel better about yourself. 

Here I am, a month later. I'm ostensibly over it, but every time my phone lights up, a small part of my heart flutters on the off chance that it's from you. I often catch myself thinking about you, and I realized that I'm favoring internships that would be close to where you live, but by this point I'm probably just a footnote on your relationship history.

Being with you was the happiest I've been in years and I'm terrified to go back to the way things were before. Despite the protests of every rational piece of my mind, I pathetically cling to the hope that everything will work out if distance isn't an issue. 
 
I know your off hanging out with and probably hooking up with that same guy who you told me you'd never date. 

I know that the chances of a future relationship with you are virtually non-existent.

I know that what we had was not a good relationship, but I'm still holding on because it's all I have."
3vedn7,2,2015-12-04,Torn between my dreams and my duties,half_as_wise,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3vedn7/torn_between_my_dreams_and_my_duties/,"I am 23, I am a guy, I live in India. When I was done with high school I wanted to pursue higher education abroad. But my parents said no primarily because they were unsure of me being able to cut it so far away from home. In the end I relented and agreed to studying here. Then afterwards I wanted to choose humanities but my parents insisted I go for Medicine. So I got into one of India's best private medical college on my own merit and I tried to finish my studies.

But as the years went by my grades suffered and my attendance plummeted. I had little interest in pursuing the degree and, yes, I acted very irresponsibly. I got into the wrong crowd, started getting dependent on alcohol and gained a lot of weight. I smoked like a chimney and was almost into drugs and stuff but fortunately didn't. I messed up. And I know what I did was wrong. And I am deeply sorry for it. So I got rid of my habits.

However now I am too far behind to start making up with my batch mates in attendance and academics. I had to attend classes with students who joined later than me and I was labeled a casual student. I sunk deeper into depression and almost killed myself over all this. I couldn't talk to my parents because I couldn't bear seeing them disappointed by me.

But after that episode I gathered my wits together and I head back home. I confessed everything to my parents. Needless to say they were disappointed. And they have every right to be because I acted irresponsibly.

So now they want me to continue the course and finish the job. It would take at the minimum one year to do it. This is not counting a year of internship I will have to do anyways. So in short I will have to spend two more years in a place I didn't want to go and absolutely dread going back to.

I dread because, well, it broke me. I broke me down to the core of who I was. I used to be a happy cheerful person. But this place pushed me to the edge of killing myself and destroying the lives of everyone close to me. Even now I feel jittery at the mere thought of going back there.

The environment there I had immersed myself in was so toxic that the mere thought of getting out of there gave me a glimmer of hope and helped grab onto something to put my life back on track. Since I decided to leave the place I have lost several kilos, I have quit smoking, and have gone teetotal. Idk if it makes sense but the idea of quitting that place and moving on with my life gave me the strength I needed to deal with my self-destructive tendencies. No, I want to live; I don't want to die.

And I am almost certain that if I go back to that medical college and If I have to deal with that place again I will just break down again. I don't want to be an empty husk.

I want to live here for the time being, start a small business and in the middle of 2016 start going to college again with the money from my business. Its basically a dairy farm business. Its simple and easy and not complicated at all. We already have cows and people who look after cows. I just want to manage that and expand it for the time being while I recover and recuperate and heal my psyche. This will allow me a degree of financial independence and will allow me to move on with my life. My step-father always loves pointing out how much money I waste and I think this might help me not have to deal with him anymore, financially that is.

I don't even need my parents money for it. They have some money, a very meagre amount of their entire fortune stashed away in a savings account for me. I only wish to use part of it for expanding the dairy business. Either ways the amount I am asking for is a lot less than that will be spent in fees and expenses in keeping me in the college and finish the course.

I don't even want to practice medicine. I don't like it, its not my thing. I would rather research and discover new drugs and I would definitely love to teach students, something which I originally wanted to do. I love teaching and have the skill and aptitude for it.

But they are dead set on having me return to the college and finish my course. And get that 'Dr.' in front of my name For them it will be just a year or two that I spend there. For me it will just be so much worse. I will be constantly reminded of all my mistakes and it will be difficult for me to cope and move on and get on with fixing my life. It will just feel like too much to handle honestly.

I don't really get why my parents want to put me through such emotional trauma only because people in the wider society and the extended family will think less of me for dropping out of a course. A course I did not want in the first place. People may snigger now at our family but if end up successful they surely will thing twice before doing so openly. And honestly, people will at the very east rudely stare whether you are a saint or a sinner. That's just how it is. And now my step-father wont talk to me, wont even come visit me. My mother keeps feeling dejected and lost. Today she told me that I was a disappointment.

Really? A disappointment? I did not want to get into the course and you asked me and I did. I admit I made a mistake by getting messed up but I got rid of my addictions myself. There must be millions of parents who wouldn't wish that their children got themselves rid of their addictions. And yet they tell me that I am the same as a guy we know who ended up a wife-beater, cheat and a drunkard.

I am just hopelessly torn between giving into to my parents wishes once again and standing up for myself. Is it too much to ask to be allowed to make one decision in life in which I make from my own free will? Am I so incapable of rational thought and decision making?

If anyone of you can help me please do. I don't know if I want advice or just someone to talk to. I am just drained after weeks of going through this with my parents, and of weeks of being told by everyone under the sun what a disappointment I am. And I know my parents are tired and hurt too. I just don't wish to hurt them, but it seems the only way not to hurt them is by hurting myself enough to break me. Please help.

3vepo0,1,2015-12-04,Im sick of feeling hurt by my own actions,water_bottle_goggles,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/3vepo0/im_sick_of_feeling_hurt_by_my_own_actions/,"9 months ago, I had a breakdown in a relationship with one of my closest friends. I cannot blame anyone else but myself. I tried everything to make amends with what ive done and yet I couldnt do anything about it. I established the friendship out of wanting to be an inspiration in the person's life. However when I failed her, I felt like a failure to not only this person but to everyone else. Which made me feel as though I am not worthy of anything or anyone anymore. I live my live strongly by the morals that I learned, and yet I failed at the very thing that I live by. 

Right after it happened, a lot of my friends saw me drained of energy. The usual happy go lucky person suddenly turned tired, unattentive, and seemingly reserved. My flatmate got the full brunt of it, I would leave the flat at 8:00am in the morning and go home everyday at 10-11:30pm every night, not talking to him or doing any chores. I left very early and came home REALLY late because I was afraid of my own thoughts, I didnt want to be alone because my mind would speak of lack of forgiveness towards myself. Alot of people supported me... genuinely supported me, as I had done it to them in the past when they needed comforting; I had a lot of close friends. A few months went by and I didnt feel any better. My 'brother' (my closest friend) asked me how he could help. I can still remmember what I told him: ""Forgiving a person whose wronged you is easy, you can always hope what they've done could be out of their control."". I continued: ""What I did was fully in my control, how can I find forgiveness in myself? I built my friendships like how we built our friendship... we inspired each other so that we can better ourselves. But after failing, what am I worth?"".  

I studied engineering at a relatively 'good' university so my studies are a priority. However its always been my relationships with people that I hold in far higher regard. Perhaps the reason for this is because everytime I would go home to visit my family, I would tell my mother how ive helped 'troubled' people through teaching the value of having hope and forgiveness, which I did through friendship ive built in the year. However when I failed a friend, my relationships with people begun to suffer because I no longer saw myself as a 'fitting' friend. I tried to study harder but I found myself without energy to even distract myself after a while.

Funny thing is. When I tell my friends about what I did, they dont even blink and when I tell them why I feel what I feel, theyre baffled by what and why I put myself through over such a little thing. 

Long story short, I got a voluntary role at university. Where I was to 'mentor' 25-30 freshers for their first year (Im a sophomore). I got to know everyone very well because it was my nature :-) and put ALOT of effort in my job, far more than that was required of me.  In the process of knowing the people, one person I saw was troubled, very introverted but also very open about herself. (Uh oh, I know). The more I got to know her, the more I learned that she lived in a shell of misjudgements and misconceptions. (Uh oh). So I did what any of you will do, try to unravel the complexities of a person hence I invested a lot of time in her. You guys probably see where this is going... I fell for the girl so I waited till the 2 month programme was over and I confessed my feelings in private after our last club meeting which I treated the freshers to see a play. 

It was a misjudgement in my part. I knew that it was probably the worst time, (she just got out of a relationship). I was heartbroken ofcourse but what hit me the most is that I lost a friend, a good friend through my own misjudgement.. and purely my own. In addition to that, I was her mentor so I felt as though I totally undermined my position. All of which resulted in me having to repeat my second year (my grades were top 15% of the cohort, now its top 50% or even lower), lost internship opportunities, lost friendships (I became reckless with people's trust) and lost a year of my life. 

The worst thing is when im at university, Im surrounded by people but when I get home... its far from anything or anywhere populated. So im alone with my thoughts of what I did during the year. I only wrote this because I have 'attacks' where im reminded of my regrets. If it happens when im alone, my thoughts overwhelm me until I cry. Weird thing is that, I always think that apologizing to her is the only way for me to find forgiveness in myself. Ive had plenty of good opportunities to apologize in the past 9 months but everytime I mean to apologize, it baffles me that she still speaks to me like im her mentor and friend... like nothing happened. Where every thought of unforgiveness when im alone is all happening in my head. 

Hurt by my own actions because I chose to hurt :-P Can someone help me?    "

Poncho has been chilling with his loose shed still on his body for over 24 hours. The thing is, it doesn't appear to be stuck. He easily got the head part off so that his head and neck, including his eyes, are completely free. His past sheds have always been pretty healthy except for the occasional bound toe which I've fixed with a damp q-tip.

The skin is very loose and when prodded with a damp q-tip pushed away easily. He has constant access to a moist hide which he's utilized for his previous sheds, and I've also misted him directly to help moisten the skin. He's still just walking around the tank in his skin like nothings wrong. No signs of distress or lethargy.

I'm not home all the time, but I have not witnessed him attempting to remove the shed at all. Has anyone experienced this issue? I can call my vet if I have to but I've spent $500 on his medical problems over the span of 2 months and I'm a college student trying to save money for grad school...so avoiding another trip would be really nice.

I can't get pictures right now because I had to leave for my internship but I can get some this afternoon if necessary.

Update; my dork finished shedding on his own by the time I got back home for the day."
3vf6x3,1,2015-12-04,Current sophomore scheduled to graduate early; would like advice/discussions abut my options.,hwtfls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vf6x3/current_sophomore_scheduled_to_graduate_early/,"Hey all, I'm a current sophomore scheduled to graduate next year (May 2017) with a BS in Computer Science, even if I take the bare minimum credits per semester. However, I'd really strongly like to walk for graduation with my friends who are primarily C/O 2018(personal choice).

Regarding my personal motivations and goals... they're not too specific, which is why I'd like an outsider's POV in weighing the cost/benefit of my options. 

My options as far as I can tell:

1) **Get a minor/dual major.** This is my least favorite options. I'm not particularly sure what other field I'd be interested in enough to get another undergrad degree in. If I go this route, I was thinking either econ (because it's a subject I really liked in high school that I even took more classes on it at a local community college in my spare time, no credit at my uni for it, though) or stats (since I think working with data is mad cool, but I'm not sure how useful this would be because it seems like most data analyst/quant positions require graduate degrees).

2) **Use the last year or two for an MS** My school offers a 3+2 integrated BS/MS degree, which I'll be able to do in 4 years (spoke with my academic adviser on this). However, it will be another MS in CS, but with more specialised tracks like computational biology, computer security, etc that aren't offered at undergrad. I think this is a very viable option for me, but I'm not really sure what the benefits of a graduate degree are if I do not choose to pursue data analyst positions. I feel like I would not feel significantly less satisfied doing SWE work. I'd be happy either way, so I'm not really sure if it's ""worth it"" to attend school for another year that I can be doing something else.

3) **Study abroad for a semester.** Sounds fun, but this would probably only delay graduating by a semester. It's also not something I'm terribly interested in, since I only speak English and my native tongue, and I've attended school in my native country before.

4) **Take semester internships?** Not sure if this is possible, but I was thinking of going to school one semester, then doing an internship for another semester for the next two years. Or like take an internship, and study abroad (thereby postponing graduating by 1 year haha). My school definitely will allow me to take leaves of absences, though. Do companies hire a lot for fall/spring internships? There doesn't seem to be much of a timeline of when to apply for them either. Would people look down on me for only having attended 1 semester of school for my last two years of college?

5) **Just graduate early** Not too sold on this one; my internship for the upcoming summer will not lead to a FT offer since it is designed for younger students, but I took it because I really like the project/company culture. So a bit worried about if I can find a job like this. Also, I don't really feel ready to enter the ""real world"" of working since I'm already young for my year.

Can't really think of any other options, but if you have ideas/input, I'd love to hear them."

I already have one degree from a different school in history. I decided to go into computer science due to a long and semi-painful 4 years at my previous school due to personal reasons. Let's just say that I was at a very low point mentally and I was in an abusive relationship and when I finally woke myself up enough to get out and move back home, I didn't really feel like myself. I had been away from home for 4 years and I think I was in a depressed haze that whole time. I felt like I had to recreate myself in order to move past what had happened, so I went back to school for computer science because it's a very big field right now and I could make a lot of money doing it.

Well, now I feel back to my old self again and I am wondering if I have made a mistake. I am good at computer science, and I really enjoyed the earlier classes, but now it is getting a lot more in-depth and difficult and I am not sure that it's what I want to do. I have been trying to find an internship and a lot of the companies I have interviewed with have been very corporate-y and I don't like corporate environments. I also am not sure I like the idea of having to think about technology 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. I seem to have lost a lot of the enjoyment I got out of it early on, and now it's just a chore to do my assignments every night.

My love of history has come back to me, and I am thinking I might have made a mistake not pursuing it when I first graduated from my previous school. Now I am trying to think of a way to have a career that utilizes both of my skills/interests: archives or library work. The only thing is, that would require ANOTHER degree (master's of library science) and the pay is a lot less than I could possibly make if I follow the usual computer science career (some type of tech job). I think I would enjoy the work more than the strictly tech corporate job, though the idea of having to get ANOTHER degree and go into MORE debt is not appealing. And while the salary isn't a huge deal to me, I would have more debt that would be eating into a smaller paycheck if I go the archives route. I would also probably have to move to a different city in order to find work because archive/library jobs are much harder to find than CS jobs. CS jobs are pretty much everywhere, but I would be limited to places with a decent library/historical concentration if I go with library/archives. Also something I have noticed is that library/archive related internships are generally unpaid, whereas CS internships pay quite decently (like $10+, even $20+ an hour). So, I am not sure what to do. I can always volunteer at museums/historical sites and have a CS job, but jobs take up 40 hours (or more) out of every week, so I worry about not being happy because I am stuck with a job that doesn't excite me. Another thing I worry about is that my lack of experience in either type of career is not allowing me to make an informed decision in this situation. For all I know there may be a CS job I would LOVE to do, or libraries/archives might not as enjoyable as I think they would be.

So, as a person who is averse to risk-taking and has anxiety problems, this dilemma has been eating away at my sanity for the past few months. I am not sure what to do. I feel like I can't just brush it aside as I am almost done with my CS degree and will need to start a real career soon to be able to afford to pay off my loans. I think if I do go with libraries/archives I will probably have to take some CS job and work a few years before I can afford a master's anyways. Any advice?"
3vfuhe,29,2015-12-04,I was one of the Skanks that jumped in Anthony's pool over this past summer. AMA.,cj_816,TACSdiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/TACSdiscussion/comments/3vfuhe/i_was_one_of_the_skanks_that_jumped_in_anthonys/,"EDITED: I'm a cunt and double posted this.

TL/DR- I drank beers in Ant's pool one night with 3/5 of the current TACS network, and met the famous Beavis.

Finally joined reddit last week, and decided to share my story of how I got access to The Compound on a random Weds night back in June. 

As you all know, LoS would occasionally do shows from Ant’s basement prior to the move to the Manhattan studio. Since they have an audience, their Twitter account would send out messages saying “if you want to be in the audience, email us”. It just so happened that one day on my way to work I saw their account ask the same question, but referring specifically to The Compound. I thought what the heck and sent an email to give it a shot, not knowing how many people they would take. I got a response back a few hours later saying to be at Creek and the Cave in Queens by 730pm that night, and that they would be leaving at 8pm sharp to head out to Long Island and Ant’s house. I drove to Queens after work and showed up at C&amp;C to check the place out. Very chill vibe, with pinball machines, a bar, and a small stand-up room downstairs. I met the LoS producer (Bobby) outside on the street, told him I emailed earlier, and asked who else would be coming with us. At that point it was just me and him. 4 other people eventually showed up, including a girl with green hair, and we piled into a van and headed off to LI. 

A few minutes away from Ant’s house, we stopped at a strip mall where Bobby was buying a birthday cake from Carvel for Jew Thug Intern Mike. The rest of us went into a Dunkin Donuts to grab something to eat, when all of a sudden the one and only Big A walks in to D&amp;D. He knew Bobby and recognized the girl, so he came over and said hi to us. I never met the guy before, but said BIG A!! which put a huge smile on his face. He said he’d be joining us at Ant’s house shortly in between his trademark stutters. We left and drove a little while longer and finally got to The Compound. 

We parked in front of the house and walked up the driveway past Ant’s Escalade. Now, I was expecting some kind of pat-down/ background check from KtC once we got there (he wasn’t present), but Bobby just led us through a gate to the backyard and down some stairs to the basement. We waited in a hallway for a minute before they brought us in. It was obviously one of the nicest houses I’ve ever stepped foot in. The basement is huge and contains a full bar, karaoke area, and signed movie posters adorn the walls. The table and cameras/ mics were set up for the LoS podcast later on. The Skanks weren’t there yet, but Rat and Garrett were setting shit up. Anthony was upstairs taking a nap according to Dani, as was the famous Beavis. We all milled about in the basement for 30 minutes or so waiting for showtime. Rat showed me Ant’s basement studio which was incredibly cramped with all the gifts and equipment he kept in there. Dave Smith and Luis J. Gomez showed up 5 minutes before the show was scheduled to start, as did Pat Dixon who was their guest for the show. At that time we found out that Anthony would be filling in for Big Jay. We took our seats and the show started. Anthony came down and joined a few minutes in, and Pat came on later. Needless to say sitting right behind the table was an absolute blast. 

Once the show ended I expected Anthony to hurry us out the door and for Bobby to drive us back to Queens. Dave, Luis, Pat, and Ant stayed at the table just bullshitting while Bobby and Rat/ Garrett cleared out the cameras and mics. Bobby then opened a bottle of wine and poured some Guinness for us from Ant’s bar. The other guests kind of stayed in the back, but I made my way over to the table and started talking with Ant, Pat, Dave, and Luis. The conversation was mostly around the growth of the network, and the phrase Anthony kept saying was “I finally can see where this is going. And I’m really excited”. Dave and Luis were both extremely pumped too. I can honestly say that all 4 of them were incredibly nice and down to earth guys. I was doing my best not to fanboy out, but they were open and friendly enough that I got into the conversation too, even getting a Jesse Ventura impression out of Ant, which is an experience to witness firsthand. 

After a few minutes Dani and the green haired girl came downstairs and asked if we were going in the pool. At this point, I’m thinking NOW we’re going to be leaving. But Bobby asked us all if we were cool staying. Me and two other guys said UMM YES without missing a beat, while the last guy that drove with us from Queens muttered something about Uber and left out the back door. We poured some more beers and went out in the back. Anthony brought out towels for everybody and swim trunks for Dave and Luis from the cabana. I asked Ant where Beavis was, and he said he was sleeping but would probably wake up and come to the door and meow to try to get someone to let him out. Sure enough, Beavis came over as we were speaking. I asked Ant if I could meet the little guy and he obliged, opening the door and handing me the Beav. He even took my phone and snapped a few pictures before heading into the pool. 

http://imgur.com/w6Sewnr

Me, Pat, and the other two guys from the Skanks audience just stripped down to our boxers and jumped in. Big A asked Anthony if he needed anything, to which Ant replied, “bring about 3,000 more beers upstairs for everybody”. Ant’s pool is unreal. It’s a huge salt water pool heated to something like 90 degrees, and the jacuzzi is more like 105. The famous velociraptor is right behind the jacuzzi. We all grabbed beers, and I spent time hanging in the jacuzzi with Pat, Dave, Luis, and the other two guys from the audience. I actually ended up speaking with Pat for about 30 minutes and got his whole backstory, including the time he was almost murdered by an ex in a parking lot. He’s a really chill dude and I’m glad he’s signed on to the network. 

We moved into the pool and drank more beers. There were 2 other older guys there, in their 40s, who weren’t part of our group that left from Queens but were already at the Compound when we got there who just hung out on the patio. I think these were the guys (one of them specifically) that Anthony mentioned “didn’t know anybody or have any connection there, just showed up” and freaked him out a little bit the next day when he thought about it. I went over to Ant and asked him about his neighbors. He pointed out the ones who always call the cops on him (think he said it was some Asian guy), and then the other one where the kid’s father looks out sadly at the parties Ant throws in the backyard. The conversation then turned to cops, guns, and race relations. We got out of the pool and had ice cream cake for Jew Thug Intern Mike’s birthday, and hung out a little more. By that time it was 3am and Pat needed a ride back to Queens, so we got changed and headed out. I said bye to Ant on the way out, shook his hand and thanked him for letting a big fan he didn’t even know into his house. He just kinda laughed and said anytime, and we talked for a minute about the show and the upcoming studio, to which I pleaded MORE JIMMY. 

On the way back to Queens I thought of something that Big A said when we were outside- “Anthony is beyond generous”. It’s true, we all love this guy and the entertainment he puts out, but being able to hang out at his house for a night made me realize that he’s a very genuine guy who doesn’t put on an act just for the show. His personality and mannerisms are all the same once the camera turns off. I think it’s safe to say that I have been to Ant’s house more times than his former co-host of 20 years. Viva Cumia!

3vfw4r,2,2015-12-04,"I [25 M] have feelings for her[23 F], does she have them for me? Should I ask her out?",nomnomrelationship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vfw4r/i_25_m_have_feelings_for_her23_f_does_she_have/,"The purpose of my post is twofold: 1) to express my feelings as I do not have anyone I can/want to be sharing with 2) would like some advice/direction on how to move things forward.

To give some background I would say I have identified with an introverted and foreveralone lifestyle from about highschool on. Currently have childhood friends just rarely see each other but maybe few times a year. Oh and never had a girlfriend add that to the list it will be important for this story.

Anyway fast forward to now: after having lived with my parents for two years (while being paid minimum wage to intern), I am now on my own in a new apartment with a new job. My field given the degree/career path is the public sector and all coworkers are all married and/or have kids (not really my demographic). So fast forward a little more I am at a conference and during a dinner reception with a client end up sitting next to a girl who also happens to do the same thing I do &lt;10 miles away. 

We actually discussed business at the dinner for a bit and so after about a week I followed up offering assistance on a grant we had discussed. I also thought ""shit I have no friends I have to take this opportunity to ask her out to do something"" so I added a PS saying we should grab drinks sometime. We made plans to get drinks after work at a local bar/restaurant (my angle hey we are two young people in an a field where everyone is older why not make something of it). I live outside of a major city and my neighborhood was having a kickoff barcrawl to initiate its annual beer week. I offer hey this is a minor change of plans but would you like to do this instead as the restaurant will always be there. She said yes and so we really kicked it off (no pun intended) and ended up drinking and talking for a good 4 hours. After we part ways she sends me a text thanking me for the night and suggesting something non-traditional. 

My parents always leave me with food when I see them and I had a couple frozen pork loins and decided to use one as an opportunity to cook for her. I ask her if she has a grill (knowing she lives in a house), is not a vegetarian, and if she would like to see me again. She said yes to all three so I propose to grill/smoke her a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin (for some reason I am not allowed to grill indoors in my apartment). For use of her grill I would share with her my pork/bacon creation and she would cook a couple side dishes. As a side note I was kind of drunk from drinking beer the whole afternoon but somehow the pork was fall off the bone tender (even though there was no bone). Events after a little fuzzy but not much happened and I left shortly after.

At this point I have enjoyed our times together and want to do something again but am afraid I have been very forward in some of our previous plans and thought could I have possibly pressured her into saying yes. So with that in mind I decided if she really enjoyed our time lets see if she initiates anything. We text on off (maybe a conversation every other week) for almost a month and now Thanksgiving is coming up. Not sure if it was right but I invited her using the logic I know her family is 5 or so hours away and am not sure if she is visiting but if I were in her situation and did not have Thanksgiving plans I would like to be invited to do something. She politely declined saying her family is coming to her this year. She then follows it up saying we should grab dinner or drinks after the holiday. We make plans for this coming Wednesday at the place we originally were going to go to before things got changed to the barcrawl. 

Other events that happen: 1) we get talking about food and I suggest we should make something together again - she says she would love to 2) this past Sunday I ask if she wants to do anything. She says she is up so I we end up going to a local metropark where we walk/talk for an hour then to a local cider house and share a couple flights of cider.

So I will echo my original question: I have feelings for her, does she have them for me? Obviously only she can answer this question but please let me know your thoughts based on what was presented above. Am I at the decision: I don't want to string her along and have some other guy swoop in yet I also don't know if I can risk asking her out and her declining jeopardizing (my only) friendship. And if she did say yes? I have no idea what to expect, more of the same? How will I keep her interested? How often should I be texting her? Just little things like this that make me have to stop and think what is the next step in this situation. And yes I have had flings with girls in college and even at my previous place of employment but never having a true relationship has really eaten me. Not so much is it that I'm looking for the sex part as it is the just being together with someone I long for.

Thanks to all who read, even if not many do writing this has helped me express my feelings in a way. 

TL;DR Met a girl through work, have gone drinking with and cooked for her. Should I move things forward or keep things the same? "

A Google recruiter even came to our campus and I was told that my resume would be handed directly to a recruiter and that was around the beginning of October I believe. So now it is early December and the semester is almost over and I haven't heard anything. I kept making excuses to convince myself it was normal, but now I'm a little worried.

I'm also kind of new to commenting on Reddit, I will be thankful if you could forgive and point out any mistakes I make (for future references). Hopefully you will see more of me in this subreddit ;)

Today I had a discussion with my mom about differences in opinion, using the opportunities you have and the like. She eventually commented on how I thought differently/can't comprehend her way of thinking because I was ""Westernized"". I was then explaining the difference between doing something 'because you don't have a choice' and 'making a choice when you can'. During the whole conversation I got really sad/mad, because I only started to discuss it with her to help her.. Considering I was getting emotional I decided to stop the discussion and left to go to my room. I was very sad and wanted to cry, maybe I'm PMS-ing I don't know(I usually don't cry easily). I felt like perhaps I should move out(I used to live on my own), even though I only will be home for 2 months(hopefully) until my internship in a different city, because I shouldn't be in this kind of 'environment'.. I was considering my options very seriously. 

Yesterday I had talked to my mom about a documentary I saw on Netflix, ""Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead"". Basically about a guy who drinks only juice for a long period of time, and it's pretty motivating. So when I was in my room.. feeling sad she knocks and hands me this freshly-squeezed orange juice with big pieces of fruit and vegetables. (Apparently our aunt had borrowed our blender so she decided to just to cut in pieces, still they were pretty large.. I kinda chuckled when I saw it) The gesture made me realize, although we have a lot of discussions that I'm still lucky that she still does very nice stuff for me, and always has. Even though we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, I'm very lucky to have a mom who still puts up with all the discussions and my 'haram'. And brings delicious peace offerings. 

-phew- I feel so much better after typing that out! I normally have a pretty ok-relationship with my mom, I do love her very much, and with these kind of incidents it makes me realize she loves me too. It makes the coping with all the shit less bad for me, I guess.. Albeit I will never compromise on my beliefs/opinions.

Thank you for allowing me to rant /r/exmuslim! I could go in more detail about the discussion if you want, anyways, Ciao~"

Today we are having a cook off with the five remaining teams and only two will be saved. **The cameras zoom in on the contestants.** I'll be the one judging each and every one of your dishes. *the crowd claps* By the way everyone, we're in front of a live audience! Or well, these are all my interns and a few of their friends. Let's see what each and every one of you made. 

***

We'll start with **The Leftover Royals**. Let's see what Devin and Samey made for us. *argues with myself* It's my turn to judge! Not now, Mal! Yes! Errr...let's judge!

Devin: 

Appetizer: cheese and crackers

Entree: steak with mashed pototoes and gravy 

Dessert: My famous Blueberry pie with a scoop or five scoops of ice cream

**Taste Testing**

The appetizer was too bland for me and it felt out of place compared to the other two meals. **2.5/5**

The entree was a lot better. It would have been nice if you added more detail. **3.5/5**

I am not a fan of blueberry pie but it was still good. I also enjoyed the ice cream but five scoops were a lot. **4/5**

Overall score for **The Leftover Royals** - **10/15** Put more effort into it next time.

***

Next up is **Brains and Brawns**

Miles: 

Appetizer: 

I'm totally risking my friendship with the Goddess of Karma, but I'm going to use cheese and eggs inside this dish. I'm sorry, Laurie. (OMG THAT RHYMED)

I'll be making a quiche lorraine (WITHOUT THE NASTY FUCKING BACON). Drizzled on top will be a hollondaise sauce and caramelized onions. It will be served with a beet salad on the side.

Entree:

I'll be making portobello mushrooms three ways, one of them stuffed with brown rice, pepper and walnuts then baked, and portobello mushroom fries, seasoned with turmeric so they look like potato fries, and drizzled with spicy sriracha sauce. I'll also make a cream of broccoli-mushroom, using vegan cream substitute and vegetable broth :)

Dessert: 

I'M SO SORRY LAURIE BUT I'M MAKING A CROQUEMBOUCHE. sobs

I just want to stay in this game

Anyways, whimpering I'll make stupid chocolate ganache cream puffs with a spiced choux pastry. I will feather up a honey-lemon glaze with cloves, then fucking stack them all up sobbing

r u happy nao

**Taste Testing**

*pats your back* There there, Miles. We all have to do things we don't want to. 

Appetizer was delicious! I enjoyed the cheese, vegetables, and especially the caramelized onions. I will give you 5/5. 

Entree...I love portobello mushrooms! Preparing them in 3 different ways was also creative. 5/5 again!

*stares at the dessert* These look delicious! Ending your three course meal with delicious ganache cream puffs was smart. They are nice and fluffy. *takes them all* Mine! *begins to eat them* Um...5/5!

I am a very pleased man right now. Overall score for **Brains and Brawns** is **15/15**

***

The next team will be **The Untouchables**

Zoey: 

Appetizer - loaded baked potatoes with cheese, bacon and buffalo chicken

Dinner- chicken parmesan calzone with a side of cheesy bacon fries

Dessert- monkey bread stuffed with chocolate chips

**Taste Testing**

The buffalo chicken was delicious and the baked potatoes nicely complimented the chicken. I will give the appetizer **5/5**

I love cheesy bacon fries! They are very delicious and the chicken parmesan calzone was also well made. I would have given this a 5/5 but since you gave me buffalo chicken before for the appetizer, it's a lot of chicken for me. **4.5/5**

I have never heard of monkey bread before. *stares at the bread and pokes it* It's not going to attack me, is it? There's chocolate chips in here? *eats some of the bread and then takes the whole plate* Mine! I love chocolate if you have not already noticed and even though monkey bread sounds strange, I will give you a **5/5**. Nice job, Zoey!

Overall score for **The Untouchables** a **14.5/15.**

***

*cautiously approaches the next team's cooking station* Amy and Rodney, known as team **Beauty and the Beast** Remind me again, who's the beast and who's the beauty? *you hear the crowd laugh in the background*

Let me see what you two evildoers made...*stares at the alien hiding behind some props* 

Amy:

Appetizer: I made me some delicious onion rings with a nice tomato dipping sauce. I also have ranch dip as another dipping sauce. I will sprinkle some salt on them from the tears I gathered from Heather, Ella, Lightning, and Scott. I evaporated their salty bitch tears and I got me some salt! YEAH! SCIENCE BITCH.

Dinner: A bitch burger is what I call it. I'd like to think I got this meat from severing the heads of those who have been 'eliminated' and grinded their heads inside a grinder and viola. 100% prime human meat. I also have some cheese. um, lettuce, tomato, Shawn told me the krabby patty formula so I use that too. bon appetit

Dessert: Chocolate covered strawberries with some whip cream. I got the chocolate from using molecular gastronomy. I converted the ashes I got from burning the bodies of the eliminated contestants and then I mixed their ashes with some milk and I got me chocolate. The strawberries are their eyeballs that I dipped in a cherry batter. yummy. eat it bitch. 

**Taste Testing**


*holding up a knife to protect myself and the crowd laughs* Don't laugh! This team is crazy! *calls over an intern* Please taste these foods, they may be poisoned. *the crowd boos* 

Appetizer: The onion rings are spot on and the ranch dressing was deliciously made. It was lightly seasoned with salt and it's at a perfect balance. **4/5**

Dinner: The hamburger was nothing special other than well made. [The beef was so raw that I could hear it moo](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/30/3002e3ee0e5c4844a5fead15310c0c44b40c8a4e2d9aab252bee8e739d5bfb56.jpg) **4/5** 

Dessert: I hate strawberries. [She was going for chocolate covered strawberries but this is all I see](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/3a/3ab9c8bdfd039da0d7f3d050896c96e335329d4ebd7f444b0d8f4f785d489954.jpg) **3.5/5**

*intern begins to choke** Medics! *the medics take away the intern* See! I knew you were trying to poison me! *the crowd boos again*

Overall score for **Beauty and the Beast** is **11.5/15**

***

Last but not least, **Just Josh**

*walks over to Josh's food station and sees nothing* ... *the crowd laughs*

**No submission** 0/15 points! 

Well, I would say Josh had the best meal tonight.

***

There you have it everyone! Let's see how each and every team placed. Now let's get the points from the last round and add them up to the points from this round. The top two teams will be safe tonight.

    **The Leftover Royals** 14.5  + 10 = 24.5 points

    **Brains and Brawns** 9  + 15 = 24 points

    **The Untouchables** 19 + 14.5 = 33.5 points

    **Beauty and the Beast** 15 + 11.5 = 26.5 points

    **Just Josh** 17 + 0 = 17 points


***

The top two teams of the night that are safe are **The Untouchables** and **Beauty and the Beast** Congrats you two! You survived this weeks double elimination. As for the other three teams, only two will survive this weeks final challenge! The team with the least amount of points will be gone.

***

The final challenge will be up soon! It will be luck and skill based. "
3vhpit,1,2015-12-04,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3vhpit/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I still get really cool internships at the big companies in the valley/SF, and less time studying means I get more time to be involved in student design teams (doing actual engineering work).

So for those of you that have been out of school for some time, can you share any horror or success stories based on your marks?

3vhtp9,61,2015-12-04,"Feeling quite a bit of ""Imposter Syndrome"" since started towards my CS Masters. Any advice or tips to get my head straight?",PSEOL,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/3vhtp9/feeling_quite_a_bit_of_imposter_syndrome_since/,"So I graduated in 2014 with a BS in Criminal Justice with a 3.92 GPA and wanted to continue my education since finding any law enforcement type jobs in my area (NYC area) is limited. For the past year I have taken two Java courses, one intro one and one data structures one, a operating systems course, computer architecture course, database course, and now a networking course. I have done well at have a 3.95 GPA with those classes and have been accepted into the Masters of CS program at the same school which is a fairly good tech school. Although I can do well on tests and do a fair job of googling things I don't understand or code I'm not sure how to format, I feel as though I have no way of applying what I've learned meaningfully or showing an employer or internship that I'm capable. I'm also very nervous about starting graduate school in CS because I feel like yeah I have passed the courses handily but I feel like it's only been a little over a year since I started so it feels almost rushed and I'm very nervous going forward. Anyone else experience this or have any advice of what I could possibly do, book to read, YouTube series to watch, anything? I just want to make sure I'm ready for the obviously much harder graduate courses and can show employees or internships I'm a good fit for them. Any advice is helpful thanks :) 

Edit: Also, my biggest area of fear is my programming skills. I currently only know Java and some Python, but have programmed binary search trees for a class which was challenging but I eventually got to work. I know programming is essential to the degree but how can I advance those skills to be better. I'm very interested in networking as I found that class to be the most fun and rewarding if that makes any difference towards my lack of programming confidence."
3vhulp,0,2015-12-04,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3vhulp/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

3vhwn5,4,2015-12-04,Recommendations for dealing with fatigue?,arrowgirlie,lupus,https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/comments/3vhwn5/recommendations_for_dealing_with_fatigue/,"I'll try to keep this relatively short... I've been experiencing cycles of severe fatigue since July, as well as swollen lymph nodes and joint pain. I'm currently in the process of bouncing between my PCP and rheumatologist for testing; they're leaning toward SLE or mixed connective tissue disease. This week we added 14 more blood tests to the previous 12 I had in September, hoping that something will come up. I'm okay with the testing, because I know it's the only way I'll get an answer. On the other hand, this fatigue is killing me. 

I'm a full-time graduate student with an internship and a part-time job. My rheum recommended Vitamin B, but I haven't really seen any difference. I've pared down my schedule, and try to schedule a couple days off per week for rest, but any other management tips would be so very welcome. "
3vhyf1,0,2015-12-04,"I'm [23/m] and I'm talking to this girl [20/f], but she has an extremely hard time accepting presents are me buying her anything - reddit, I need some clarity here!",butterflyonthebluff,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3vhyf1/im_23m_and_im_talking_to_this_girl_20f_but_she/,"Hey Reddit, so I moved across the US to start working full-time, and I ended up meeting this amazing girl. We started dating, and we have 1000% chemistry. We work in the same industry, we like the same things, we love the same food - even down to the exact weird toppings on pizza. Our lifestyles seem to really be compatible too - neither of us are crazy about the glamor or nightlife; we prefer to just relaxed days, and do not mind getting take out and watching TV all day. During this time, I would buy her dinner, and because I work full-time (and she was working part time, as an internship just ended), I understood the differences in our financial situations, so I would gladly help out with paying for certain things. However, just a few weeks ago, due to various reasons, she decided to move back home with her parents - from the East Coast (where we met and where I live) to the midwest. 

We would always talk about flights to visit each other. However, recently, when I brought up the topic of flying to visit each other, and actually made it a serious consideration and plan, she told me how she didn't have enough money and needed to save some money so she could pay for her own college tuition. I told her that I would gladly pay for her flight (or my own), or that I could even use my built up rewards miles and use those, so no money would even be used. She said she didn't want to do that and she would feel bad if I did that for her. Now, I thought this was just girl-code-word for ""that would be awesome, but I'm going to refuse the offer to sound nice."" But this really wasn't the case.

Just a few days ago, I decided to order her a case of her favorite drink which she says she can never find in the US (I'm having it shipped internationally) to her home. I haven't told her exactly what I'm having shipped to her house, but when I asked to confirm her exact address, she told me not to buy her anything. Again, I thought this was her just being polite, and actually, she wouldn't mind me buying her anything. But, again, I was wrong. 

I felt really excited for her to receive it, so I mentioned in a conversation again that she should be receiving something in the mail about a week from now. That's when things got kind of bizarre for me. She told me she actually wasn't happy - and actually kind of upset that I went ahead and had something shipped to her anyway. She told me that it makes her feel like she's in-debt to me, and that she owes me something. I reassured her that this was absolutely not the case, and that I saw something she would like, and because I like her, I wanted to get it for her. She said that she is ""too independent"" and doesn't like feeling ""weak"" or like a ""victim"" that needs help. 

I was quite shocked. It definitely was not the reaction I thought would be happening from this. I'm realizing now (after the conversation about buying airplane tickets and now this random gift I'm getting her) that she seems to have an extremely hard time accepting gifts or anything from people. I kept trying to reassure her that I am absolutely not expecting her to repay me (I'm really not!!!) and I apologized if I made her feel that way. 

She said that it was fine, that she appreciated it, and that she's looking forward to the package.... but still said that these things still don't make her feel good.

Am I doing something wrong? What might be the issue here? 

TL;DR - anytime I [23/m] offer to help this girl [20/f], she becomes upset and feels ""indebted,"" ""weak,"" and like a ""victim"" to me

Edit: title should be ""..OR me buying her anything..."" obviously i'm desperate for help, i can't even type properly"

Well, ""senior"". I'm was doing two majors, but long story short, I transferred to a school closer to home after my freshman year due to money, and I just got worse and worse. I got into the prestigious business school at my university, and I'm double majoring, but for what. My grades suck, I have no friends since the people I met my sophomore year here already graduated, I'm doing shit in my classes, I just had a final where apparently we could bring in a cheat sheet and calculator, something I found out 5 minutes before the exam. So I got fucked there. All of my friends/classmates from high school and in my year are all graduating this year with full time offers from investment banks, huge tech firms, etc. and I'm just sitting here struggling to go through a data structures class MY SECOND TIME. That prestigious business school? Oh yeah, im still in it somehow, and have been getting shit grades. Everyone says its the B-school for a reason, everyone gets Bs. Well not this guy. Cs color my transcript. And this semester, guess whos probably gonna get an F? I have a shit resume, my GPA is below a 3, so no internship for me. I can't program for shit, so thats out the window. ""Don't worry, you'll have plenty of jobs, majoring in business and computer science is really good"". No it fucking isnt, not when you hate all of your business classes and dont connect with your comp sci classmates since you're trying to stay away from video games, even though you keep coming back to them. I fucking hate school. I just get fucked over and over again. I almost jumped in front of a bus today. I was diagnosed with ADHD, but now i think im just a lazy fuck who cant do anything right. Please tell me why I shouldnt just fucking end it, or run away and starve/lose my mind in some remote place, because I cant take this anymore. This past semester I went to class, ate in my room alone, studied alone, played video games alone. I'm getting a rhinoplasty in a week since I was always called a bird for having a big nose, but I'm debating whether I should even go through with it. I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, blah blah blah, all this shit, I've gone to therapy, seen psychiatrists who just want to prescribe me shit, and nothing helps. I'm almost 22, and I've never had sex, never kissed a girl, let alone dated a girl, since I'm a huge pussy, I'm stagnating in life while everyone else just keeps going. I look back at what I've done and I realize I haven't done shit with my life. I'm scared of being like my dad, scared of not doing anything with my life, and yet I don't do shit. I'm a sad pathetic excuse of a human. 

TL;DR 22 year old who's fucked, I hate my life, I hate myself, I want to just start over or die. I need a time machine.

3vi986,38,2015-12-04,"I thought he saved my life, but now I think he simply spared it...",creatureinthewoods,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vi986/i_thought_he_saved_my_life_but_now_i_think_he/,"Most people have been led to believe that all homeschooled children are painfully sheltered, receive an insufficient education, and never develop adequate social skills. Due to this presumption, I often had a hard time convincing people that I spent my entire life being homeschooled and that kindergarten was the only public classroom I had ever even stepped foot in.

&amp;nbsp;


I was not only provided with an excellent education, but was also given the opportunity to develop social skills, interacting with a more broad range of age and personality types than I would have in a classroom, and a freedom to explore and learn so much more about life than I ever could have with my nose in a standard textbook for the majority of my day.

&amp;nbsp;


On the days my mom worked as an administrator at our church, I did my studies in her office and then spent the afternoon helping the interns with their assignments or the old man in the mailroom fold bulletins for the upcoming services. The rest of the school week, I'd rush to complete my work so I could spend the day going on adventures through the woods behind our house or in the park a few blocks away.

&amp;nbsp;


I always had a backpack full of books about the places I could only dream of visiting, cities and countries with cultures to experience and sights to see that were so different from my small little town. I knew so much about the world but had never stepped foot past my state’s border, so when our church organized for select members of the youth group to take a trip to Germany, I accepted the offer immediately.

&amp;nbsp;


We flew out the day after Christmas, spent a six hour layover enjoying the incredible architecture of Amsterdam, and then spent the next ten days in and around Berlin and Hamburg, ministering at a few small churches and visiting all the famous landmarks. The sights and sounds, the food, the people, the entire experience was everything I could have dreamed of and more as a girl desperate to see the world. Of course, the exposure brought both wonderful experiences and odd events…

&amp;nbsp;


I distinctly felt an unnatural presence beside me while taking a private tour of Auschwitz, even when I walked alone, and only lost the feeling when we exited the gates. When a few of us tried to take a shortcut through a dark alley on our way to dinner one night, a drunk man approached us to ask if we were prostitutes, and became aggressive and almost violent when we informed him that we were not (this would’ve been a bigger deal had a group of gentlemen who had seen this encounter from the street not come to escort us the rest of our walk).

&amp;nbsp;


More ominously, a little girl practically drowning in her long, dirty-blonde hair and tattered, oversized sweater who sat silently on the bench across from me, slid me a small slip of paper right before she exited the train, which simply contained the words “bedenke, dass du sterben musst”. These experiences and others like them occurred periodically throughout the trip, but none haunted me more than what happened at the youth camp we visited during the last three days of our trip.

&amp;nbsp;


The camp was once a military base of some sort, the old buildings never upgraded, just converted into dorms and meeting places for summer/winter camps and events. The small property was surrounded by a barbed wire covered fence and endless rows of unkempt trees, and was somewhere outside of Parchim. (I only know that was a nearby town because that was the closest train station; we were taken by cars the rest of the way. I’ve tried on many occasions to pinpoint the location on a map to no avail.)

&amp;nbsp;


The boys and girls stayed in separate buildings respectively, with four youth per room, and four adult mentors to chaperon each floor. Our group was provided with our own wing to stay in since we were considered to be guests and had a bit more leeway when it came to curfews and property access. There were two services held each day in the chapel, separated by three community meals in the mess hall. There were other small group workshops and activities held in between those, but they weren’t mandatory.

&amp;nbsp;


We had arrived at the camp late Thursday evening with just enough time to tour the main facilities, meet the staff, and settle into our rooms. The next morning, a handful of us decided to meet an hour before breakfast call and go for a run- stretching our legs on an open path seemed so refreshing after having spent almost 6 hours on a train and in small back seats just to get there. From the mess hall to the property’s main gate was a road that we estimated to be a bit over a mile in one direction.

&amp;nbsp;


We slowly jogged down the road, lit only by the street lamps as the sun hadn’t even thought of rising yet, and admired the white, sparkling layer that covered the roofs and cars from that night’s snowfall. When we reached the gate we found it wide open, and the road continued through the thick tree line into the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;


We foolishly decided to keep going just a little ways further, saying we’d turn around before the gates got out of site and before anyone noticed we were gone. We were at least two or three miles past the gate when we finally stopped jogging and turned around to make our way back.

&amp;nbsp;

We were taking our time walking back when we saw light approaching from behind us, growing rather quickly. As the sound of a revving engine increased in the otherwise quiet atmosphere, we dove into the tree line in hopes of avoiding being seen (or worse, hit) by the oncoming vehicle. We weren’t sure we were supposed to be outside the fence unchaperoned, and didn’t want to risk being caught by a counselor on their way to the camp or have to try to explain to a stranger why four US teenagers were wandering around in the middle of nowhere Germany.

&amp;nbsp;


With my back to a tree, I peeked around and watched as the car sped past. As I faced my friends again to share a laugh and sigh of relief, I quickly realized one of us was missing. My searching eyes darted between the trees, finally finding her walking with determination into the thickening woods. I caught up with her and grabbed her arm to stop her, but she pulled away, putting a finger to her lips to shush my efforts to stop her.

&amp;nbsp;


She was walking toward a small house that I hadn’t noticed before; frankly I’m not sure how she even noticed. The windows and wood of the abandoned abode had darkened from years of dirt and dust. The roof had caved in on one side, and icey leaves covered every flat surface of the structure. The dark tones of the exterior combined with the blanket of natural camouflage made it almost impossible to see in the dense morning fog.

&amp;nbsp;


We followed her cautiously to the front steps and watched nervously as she tiptoed across the front porch to peak in a window. My heart beat was steadily increasing as I watched her make her way to the door, and then instantly sunk when a light came on inside the house in the same second her hand made contact with the door knob.

&amp;nbsp;


“Run!” escaped my friend’s lips in a sort of whispered-shout, followed by the crunch of damp leaves beneath our feet as we took off. We ran in a scattered line through the trees, not even sure we were heading towards the camp, just desperately trying to put space between our backs and the house. I’m not sure how long we had run before I was tripped by a fallen branch, causing me to hit my head on a  root and black out, but when I awoke I was alone and I could see faint rays of the rising sun breaking through the fog and trees.

&amp;nbsp;


I slowly got back on my feet, checking for injuries or potential damage. Unsure of whether they left me to get help or just left me for dead, I stumbled in a circle, trying to decide which direction to go. These woods were so new and intimidating compared to the ones back home, the ones so familiar I knew them like the back of my hand. I was so focused on my fear and confusion that I barely noticed the looming figure watching me from a distance.

&amp;nbsp;


I froze in my tracks and my breath caught in my lungs as my eyes took in the sight before me. He was hard to see through the fog as the light was at his back, but I could tell he was broad and towered over me in height, was dark in color, and seemed more animal than human. The only thing that made me believe he was even human-like at all was his eyes- even in the dim light I could see them, could feel them as they bore into my own.

&amp;nbsp;


Everything was still and silent in that moment. The fog seemed no longer carried or moved by the cold breeze, but instead held itself steady, and the faint scratch of bare branches rustling together had faded away. Terrified of moving, but even more afraid of staying there, I slowly moved my right foot to take a step back. In my shakiness I lost balance, and the sound of a snapping twig emanated from beneath my foot as it met the ground from my shifting weight. I could feel the heat of his breath against my cold skin as he sighed in frustration, and I began to wonder if my depth perception was somehow impacted from my fall.

&amp;nbsp;


“Please…” was all I could manage to whisper, a sad attempt at a request to spare my life. The more I considered his stature, the easier I realized it would be for him to snap me in half no differently than the twig that lay broken beneath my foot. But instead of charging at me and ripping me limb from limb, instead of eating me whole or dragging me to his home somewhere near the gates of hell, he simply lifted his lumbering arm out from his side and extended a long, crooked, pointed-nailed finger, as if to tell me which direction he wanted me to go.

&amp;nbsp;


Not one to argue with an ominously mysterious figure nearly twice my size, I cautiously turned and walked in the direction of his gesture. I continued at a slow pace, never taking my eyes off of him even when he was almost entirely out of sight, until I almost tripped again. I glanced at my feet for just a brief second to ensure I had them both on safe and solid ground, but when I went to return my sights to him again, he was gone.

&amp;nbsp;


I broke into a sprint as fast as my body would carry me. I didn’t stop when breathing became sharp and I felt like there was blood in my lungs. I didn’t stop when I broke through the treeline and my shoes met the wet pavement of the quiet road. I didn’t stop when I saw the open gates or even when I made it through them. I kept running- through the camp, across the yard, up the stairs, and down the hall to my dorm room, nearly breaking the door trying to get through. I searched the small room, pulling up piled blankets and opening closet doors, hoping to find signs of my morning companions.

&amp;nbsp;


I stumbled into the dimly lit bathroom and finally slowed my speed as my eyes fell on the scribbled note taped to the mirror, addressed to me, explaining that they went down to breakfast and to meet them there. As I went to pull it down from it’s post, I realized that the filthy, bruised, tattered girl who looked like she’d climbed out of an old well looking back at me from behind the note was my reflection, and I wasn’t sure whether I was supposed to laugh or cry.

&amp;nbsp;


Too stunned to do either, I stripped from my damp, dirt covered running clothes, took a shower in the warmest water those old pipes could provide, and put on the first outfit I could pull from my suitcase. I made my way down to the mess hall in a daze and finally found the others, seemingly unharmed, and quite frankly happier than I had ever seen them.

&amp;nbsp;


Understanding that they had no problems finding their way back to camp and had no intentions of sending help for me in my unconscious state, I quickly became offended and demanded an explanation, but the only responses I received were looks of complete confusion and concern. I spent the rest of the trip trying to convince them to give up on the joke and to tell me what happened, but they genuinely had no idea what I had experienced, or where I had even been all morning. Their only knowledge was that I was gone when they woke up that morning and they didn’t see me until met them at breakfast.

&amp;nbsp;


That was the first and last time I saw him, and when our plane landed in the states, I vowed to myself to never speak of that day again, and to never go into the woods, any woods, in fear of a similar encounter. As the years went by, the occasional nightmares of the dark figure in the winter fog became nothing but faint memories, and I had started to believe it really was all in my head. I would’ve kept my promise and would’ve never told this story, would’ve never even consciously reminded myself of it, if it weren’t for today.

&amp;nbsp;


It’s been at least seven years since that trip. In those seven years I took over the house for my parents when they retired and moved to a townhouse in the city, did countless renovations (the most important being an extra tall privacy fence with a locking gate, separating our back yard from the woods), and started our own small family here with my husband.

&amp;nbsp;


I put my son to bed tonight, just like any other night, only he fell asleep much quicker tonight, most likely from exhaustion caused by all the excitement of ‘helping’ his dad hang up the Christmas lights. I kissed him goodnight and tiptoed to his window, cherishing the second-floor view of the fresh fallen snow. As I breathed a peaceful sigh and began to close the curtains, my breath caught in my lungs in a way I hoped it never would again.

&amp;nbsp;


Just there beyond the fence, the trees shielding him from the sight of anyone but me, stood the creature I’d convinced myself had never really existed. I really would have missed him, his darkness blending in with the woods around him, had his unmistakable eyes not been there to pierce mine. I believe he saved my life that day, I’ve just never understood why, but today I think he’s here for something different. That long, crooked, pointed-nailed finger that was once my guide to safety is now pointing straight at me…

Computer Organization &amp; Architecture (3u, lab), Programming Languages (3u, lab), Automata (3u), Physics (mechanics) (4u, lab), 3 Unit elective

I was offered an internship at 10 hours a week for 12 weeks during Spring, and I have enrolled in 18 units with the following:

Operating Systems (3+1u, lab), Software Eng (2+1u, lab), Probability (3u), Physics (E&amp;M) (4u, lab), Senior Project Prep (1u), Databases (2+1u)

Of these, OS was said to be challenging, Soft Eng easy, and Prob &amp; Stats gave no homework (I would still do it to pass exams, obviously). I'm concerned about E&amp;M, though, since with my past physics class, it was completely foreign to me and the beginning of the semester had a steep learning curve. However, I believe I passed all of my classes this semester with A/B's.

Anyways, can anyone comment on this course load?

Ps. I'm a transfer student, so all I have left to do is rigorous CS/major courses.

I intend to keep this job basically forever, but I'm on an academic schedule. I have 2.5 weeks off for Christmas, a week for spring break, and 9 weeks off for summer.

I'd love to continue working on the CS career during the summers. I was thinking something like this might be a reasonable progression:

1. Self study this year and maybe next.
2. Internships for the following two-three years (probably unpaid).
3. A programming boot-camp with a high job placement rate.
4. Finally, figure out some kind of CS summer jobs, like short-term contract work.

Seeing it written out, I'm not even sure it's possible. Would I even be able to find summer internships and summer CS jobs? I need some honest criticism of my plan and recommendations.

3vijq6,3,2015-12-05,LDR arguments? Living together?,TimeMovesOn,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/3vijq6/ldr_arguments_living_together/,"My boyfriend (24/m) and I (27/f) have been together just over a year. We live 3.5hrs away and try to see each other every other weekend. We went to the same school until he graduated before our second month together. Then I went to Alaska for the summer (which really put a strain on our relationship and he stopped telling me that he loved me).

I am doing an internship this school year and have been hoping to find a job near where he lives but when I tried to talk to him about possibly moving in together (we would be a 1.7years then) he said ""I'm not ready.""

I have been trying and trying to get him to talk to me about it but all he keeps doing is ignoring me. He'll read my texts but not respond. I feel like I am owed an explanation!

When he gets mad he ignores me and just says ""Good night dear!"" And logs off when he doesn't want to deal with it anymore.

I tried to tell him that I felt like we should discuss this and that it was a big issue that you cannot just well, not explain.

He wouldn't answer me at all. I just do t understand, even in person when I try to have relationship talks with him he never participates in them.
I'll ask him if something is wrong with me/us and he'll say ""no"" or ""I don't know."" So I will ask ""are you sure there isn't anything you are upset about?""
He typically says ""I don't know"" again then says something mediocre that happened that day. (Example, like this weekend I was upset that he wouldn't respond when I was stranded outside his home for 3hrs, he was supposed to be back in town by 2pm. I. Called and texted and had no answer, I felt like he could have at least pulled over and let me know he was running late).

Back to the living together topic, when he was drunk the other day he mentioned that he ""already did that once,"" so I told him ""please do not compare me to your ex,"" and be said that he ""wasn't.""

Him and his ex lived together and that relationship really messed him up bad. He was in therapy for awhile.

tl;dr. My boyfriend won't tell me why he doesn't want us living together, and he won't have relationship talks."

You and your friends can then reference each other.

I graduated from college with a computer science degree but I am still unemployed so I am thinking for creating a ""failed start up"" so that I can write down work experience on my resume.

I don't live in USA so there isn't really much software development internships or entry level software development jobs where I live.

Most entry level software development jobs I have seen require at least 1 year of experience.

A start up is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

If me and a few friends created some simple programs with complex user interfaces to make the programs seem complex and created a website to ""sell"" the programs then I won't really be lying on my resume since the ""failed start up"" is a temporary organization with an online shopping business model."
3viury,19,2015-12-05,Advice to incoming grads from a 20-something that fucked up both her college and graduate school time. (It bears repeating),seapancake321,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3viury/advice_to_incoming_grads_from_a_20something_that/,"I posted this to an individual redditor so it's a bit of a jumble...this is my advice to you seniors and current students, though I am basing this off of shitty decisions and hating my sociology degree by the end of it/not knowing what to do with it. This is a mishmash on how to get through college and make it a worthwhile experience of three things--EMPLOYABLE skills/experience (sad truth is that none of the history courses I took--not a single one--could gt me an entry level job, but that Quickbooks or CRM software course marketing majors take would, even when I'm just applying as an assistant or receptionist); actual work experience at a point in your adulthood where you will have access to your office of career services offices, your professors, faculty,and their own projects and need for labor (they might need assistants, teaching or administrative, right on campus!); and a decent GPA/resume based on academic and extracurricular accomplishments. 

On college: 
1) Learn to manage your time.

2) Try to pick a major or take courses with what I'd call universally transferrable skills. I failed to do that by choosing sociology over say, marketing. In marketing I would have learned Excel, Quickbooks, and certain skills that would have made me a fit for entry level work in financial settings and any office I wanted to be in. This is a horrible truth of college. I knew nobody employed and had never really thought about what temping agency postings, indeed, idealist, or craigslist were telling me--the information was all there. Ask yourself--what is a major employer in (place I want to live someday)? Keep that in mind when you select your major.


College is a grace period, the last one. The horrible thing is there are more jobs that expect you to know 25% of how to do the job--baseline skills--because training budgets have been cut, at least in the city where I live and where the only jobs hiring are finance, marketing/or, healthcare software, and startup related stuff (coding, customer service...specifically FOR a start-up). YMMV. 

3) You still want to take some actual fun courses, right? Ask yourself--can you design your own major, as you can in NYU's Gallatin school? Can you get an accounting degree but still count some fun electives towards your major or the liberal arts core? Learn about the school of your college that teaches what you like. If I could go back in time I would have gotten a marketing degree (bearable, more so than finance) but taken many electives in my actual major/the school of public service I had originally been hoping to attend. (My grades were too low and I was too broke.)

4) This is very hard--you must treat college like a long recruitment process. Hit up your career services or HR early and get established on how you will write an entry level resume or if there are part time positions--paid or unpaid--where you can learn something employers in the real world value (even if it's managing a switchboard or customer service...something a lot of start-ups where I am now want). INTERN. Network with your professors and classmates. In the long run, who you know is who will get you a job. 

5) Be careful to read course evaluations because one professor might teach a course (e.g., Research Methods) for your course reasonably, give you lots of quizzes and exams, teach good lectures, and other might be a slave driver. Ratemyprofessor helped me alot. I recommend all of you review your professors (if you can--fuckers changed the site) as well and tell others how a teacher teaches their class/what they expect. 


6) Know how to write a good paper. I would make outlines as a write and read the syllabus the first week of classes so I could plan in advance and chip away at my goals over the long term. I would save passages I know I would come back to later in MS Word (page number and a little quote or two) so I would know exactly where to return to when it was assignment time.

7_ Treat your professors well because you need these people for recommendations. If they have pet projects (one of my adjuncts ran a not-for-profit and liked having his students volunteer with him--would have been a great work/learning experience), look into it.

8) Realize your (better) profs REALLY, REALLY want to pass you, so you don't need to obsess over writing each paper as a magnum opus, but you must turn them in on time so they have a reasonable time to grade, demonstrate basic understanding of the ideas they want you to, and use the write format.
If you get online homework on a site like APLIA...take a look at the supplemental tests or questions, because the professors might base exams off of those. I think that principle holds true across the board.
Look into clubs (political, based on your department/major, based on skills you want to learn like Adobe, etc.) early and often.

9)  Please do not let drinking, alcoholism, shitty sexual practices likely to get you knocked up, or mental illness decide this. If you need to see a psychiatrist off campus, take a smaller dose of a prescribed drug to try it...do it.

 I blew it. When I got better and could function, it didn't matter. It was too late and I had already fucked up my GPA, failed to seek out even the courses that might have been helpful when I looked for jobs (read job postings, PLEASE--if they advertise for specific software, like Excel for business, or Quickbooks, or Adobe CSS...take a workshop, learn to use them when you have the time) for real, and the things that were feeding my depression....were no longer really things I could solve with meds. 

That's the present, actually. My life is a failure; no Zoloft is going to help me. Taking needed ADHD drugs, a small dose of antidepressant, and getting a hold on a relationship with a narcissistic, abusive mother that forced me into a horrible major she did not understand did. For those of you with domineering parents pushing you into majors--don't let them. Explore for yourself. 

I could have made sociology work for me if I'd had more work experience and taken a few of the same courses those marketing and public relations students got to, but it's much harder. I could have seen the writing on the wall, gone into marketing, and taken many of my desired electives (preferable).

It's all about who will employ you; titles of work positions (associate of blah; office manager of blorp; entry level blip); and demonstrated work experiences/people that will vouch for you. you're collecting all of these things on the journey to a happy adulthood like lucky pennies. 

I know college can be horribly lonely, isolating, and exhausting, but it's such a brief window of life and the loneliness you experience is all-consuming but is secondary to the guidance you're there to receive when you move on. If you need to see a psychiatrist, get treated for depression.

You have a portfolio you need to write to get through a class? Ask to a see a sample. You have a big midterm? Ask the format (essay? Multiple choice? Both?), what it covers, and what will be expected of you and then meet the bare minimum of those expectations, because often that's all you can (or will need to). 


Focus on the good choices you can make with this time and get all the help and advice you can get from career services and also find out about what steps the people holding jobs you want to had to take. (Find that person's Linkedin...that marketing manager for a company you love might have started in art history first, but see what point she started working on an actual career.)

On work: 

1) This is the last time in your life it's okay not to know how the fuck to write a resume or get through an interview--seriously, look at your school's office of career services, their calendar, their events. Do they have resume review days? One-on-one counseling sessions so you can start talking to someone--say, by sophomore year, when it matters more that you start interning than interning in a job that uses your history degree to a T--about these things? 

2) INTERN, INTERN, INTERN. You can volunteer in an office and request it be called an internship (it's still unpaid and you're still there to learn software or a function of work, so why not?) Try to get at least two internships--one might even one into school time, so you really need to learn how to budget your time. You can choose something that asks for 15 hours a week or less, do it on campus, do it in summer--but you must do it.

You will. not. get. a. job. without any office or ""work""/volunteer experience in a setting comparable to where you'd like to work for a living and I have learned the shitty way babysitting doesn't count so much. If you've graduated in the last year and didn't intern, it's okay to go back and ask for help finding some (RELEVANT) ""work experience"" just to put on a resume and so you can speak confidentially when an entry level job requires ""communication and public relations"" skills and 1-2 years of working in an office. 

Use your school's office of career services early and often. If this is a good school, they are a vital resource on how to write an entry level resume, assemble a portfolio of work, interview, skills you will need during/after college and for life. Check their calendar--as I noted to someone else, you might go to a community college that still accesses career fairs of better-supplied schools (like--as an example--NYU). 




In my city, sadly, college is now viewed as prep for a job as much as self-discovery. It doesn't have to be ONLY that, but...have it in mind.

I'm only 21 but I feel so old. I feel like everything has come so easy in my life. I'm 190 cm (6.3) 90 kg, athletic and go to a Russel group university. I've landed a HSBC commercial banking and wealth management summer internship last year. I have a beautiful Russian girlfriend of two years with Brandi Love's body. I've never had problems with making new friends or girlfriends. I've never really pursued a girl, I've only made moves after I've seen clear signs; and If I didn't then I would just move on to the next. I've been living on my own since I've reached the age of 17 and been entirely financially independent since the age of 19. I'm on my current year abroad and I live in a studio flat in the centre of ... (probably better not to say) for next to nothing because of the exchange rate (300 USD). I speak three languages fluently and lived in 6 countries throughout my life.

I realise that I come off as a narcissistic prick. This is not why I'm writing this post. I've actually been holding back from writing this down for a long time. I'm not looking for attention or gratification I just want to get out of this seemingly never ending hole of carelessness, procrastination and regret. 

I should be applying for internships this year but I can't seem to get out of bed and do anything. My friend got a graduate placement as a generalist in an investment bank and it would usually put more pressure on me to get the applications cracking but I just can't seem to fucking do anything. I've usually been motivated in the past by stress, but not this time. I wake up at 3pm and go to sleep at 7am. I can't sleep, I miss a lot of university classes. I should be doing work but I end up just playing video games that bring me back to my childhood (Diablo 2, Heroes 3, Dota, Custom wc3, PoP). I remember I used to be so happy back then... when I played. I had a good relationship with my family and didn't feel the pressure of getting them out of debt back in those days. I never had a good relationship with my mother, I haven't seen her in 10 years. I was brought up by my father and used to have a great relationship with him. I used to look up to him. Now we barely keep in touch and I'm not coming home for Christmas (don't even want to get into this story).

For past month I've stopped going to the gym and I feel so overpowered by daily activities. I have a genuine choice - I can either get out of this bed, put away the laptop and cook some delicious food or get out of the house, or go to uni, or meet friends, or do a billion other things. I don't. All I do is fucking masturbate and lay there and only get up if I'm really desperate for food. That is the only time I get up and then as soon as I get get less hungry I sit back on the laptop looking to be CONSTANTLY entertained or to take my mind off reality. I spend loads of time just lurking reddit, youtube, twitch and ... even 9gag. I can't stress enough how much I want to be entertained and to escape into my screen only to wake up 12 hours later full of guilt and regret.

I feel so mentally weak and I hate myself for it. I used to be so productive and successful for my age. I got into a great university and I worked my ass off to achieve the physique I have now. I'm only where I am now because of what I've done in the past and I feel like I've stopped and I'm just temporarily floating. I also feel like an actor. Nobody knows about how I feel, they all think I'm doing great and that nothing has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm literally wearing a mask.

I'm fucking petrified of ending up working in retail full-time. I've worked in a restaurant on the weekends last year and I hated it with a passion. I guess my greatest fear is ending up like that, disappointing my whole family and my girlfriend and even her family. Another recent fear I've acquired is my girlfriend ending up with someone who is not as weak as me and will be able to support her in all the ways I can't whenever I'm feeling down. I've never had this fear before.

This is not the first time I'm feeling like this, it seems to go away and come back once triggered by something very stressful. 

Anyway, I already feel better from sharing all of this. Even though I haven't expended on three very stressful topics that (now that I think of it) seem to be triggering my carelessness. I might write about the Christmas situation, engagement and getting back to retail (if I don't land an internship) when I get down again.

I'm really hungry, I've been planning on cooking a basic meal (grilled chicken with cheese, mustard and a little ketchup in between two toasted bread slices) and then going to the coffee shop next to my flat in order to practice psychometric tests for the internships I've managed to apply to a while ago. I just hope when I come back I won't lay down again.

I have internship experience in the real estate industry as well as a few research assistantships and projects with faculty that span several different research domains. I also have experience using R, SQL, Python, SAS, SPSS, ArcGIS, and Linux distros.

From predictive modeling to text mining, I've learned all of the skills necessary to answer whatever questions that may arise. I'm very comfortable with navigating databases, working with different kinds of data (cross sectional, time series, network, etc.), and creating clear and concise reports and visualizations. Beyond just my classes, I've spent a great deal of time learning as much as possible and honing my skills; I'm extraordinarily passionate about my field and I can't help but want to constantly learn more about everything!

If your organization is looking for someone who can use data to create and communicate actionable information, send me a message and we can talk things over in greater detail.

3vizhv,7,2015-12-05,Do I have a chance with my 3.1 GPA?,blueyfooey,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3vizhv/do_i_have_a_chance_with_my_31_gpa/,"Hey there, I'm looking for pretty brutal honesty. I went into college as a chemistry major under the urging of my parents, but I absolutely hated it and ended up struggling with the classes. I found that I liked computer science more and decided to try to pursue that more instead, so in a span of a bit more than a year, I self-studied multiple languages and programs and brought myself up to a proficient enough level to help design a website, obtain an internship at a software company, and act as a volunteer research assistant for a UCLA professor in the cardiology department (using python to reconstruct cell reproduction, etc.). My GRE scores are solid, I think, with a 165 in quant and 162 in verb, writing to be determined. I should have solid rec letters from the professor I'm volunteering for, and my director at the company, as well as one professor from my university. 

I'm not hoping for too much, but I'm at least hoping that I look appealing to rank 20-50 grad school MS programs for computer science. Do I have a shot, or should I aim lower?

I have an internship creating a build with an RPi that detects when a door has been opened and closed and sends an SMS and currently has a GSM USB Module and a WIFI Module in the USB ports. To make the project smaller I'll be using the RPi A+ which only has one USB port so I can't simple plug in the two USBs. As a high schooler, I don't really have much experience in making 'advanced' circuitry but this is a little sketch I came up with:


http://imgur.com/gFMvAdq




Ok so basically, to make things small as possible, the RPi was going to be powered by a normal USB Phone charger (5V 2A), but now I'm going to have it split and power the RPi and the two USBs.


Ok so a line can just go directly to the Pi but then how do I step the 5v @ 2A down to the correct volts and amps needed to power two USBs (Wifi and GSM modules) and have the data inputs and outputs of the two usbs connect to fit into a single USB that be plugged into the single port of the Pi?




I know I sound like an idiot, but I'm much more software based and would like to get more into hardware. Any help would be appreciated!"

3vka3r,109,2015-12-05,Welcome to CSCareerQuestions! Please read this post for posting/commenting guidelines and advice!,Himekat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vka3r/welcome_to_cscareerquestions_please_read_this/,"Welcome to the Computer Science Career Questions subreddit!

## General Information

* This subreddit is for asking questions related to **careers** and **degrees** in **computer science** only. This includes software development, computer engineering, QA, software management, technical project management, and similar software-related roles. 

  Although you *may* ask IT-related questions here, you might have better luck and get more responses on the more specialized /r/ITCareerQuestions subreddit (see posting advice below).

* We have user flair in this subreddit that is based on comment karma. You can read more about what the colors mean and how to get flair if you think you meet the requirements [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3qg1ns/meta_changes_to_user_flair_please_read/), but the basic gist is that the darker-colored a user's flair is indicates how active and upvoted they are as a member of the community.

* User flair should be *pertinent to the subreddit*, *helpful*, and *not offensive*. If you need ideas, look at our pre-canned user flair. In general, it should refer to something about yourself and your relationship to the CS/tech industry.

## Guidelines and Advice For Posters

* **Again**, this is a subreddit for computer science career questions. If you aren't asking about a computer science/software-related career, please see /r/Jobs, or search for a more appropriate subreddit. Posts that aren't CS-related will be removed.

* [We have an FAQ and you should read it before asking your question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index) Many people have the same questions and seeing the same questions over and over discourages people from answering those questions. If your question could be easily found in the FAQ, it may be deleted.

* If your question cannot be found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index), please [search the subreddit for relevant terms](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/search?restrict_sr=on). You are very likely to find someone has already asked a similar question.

* Please go to /r/ITCareerQuestions to ask questions about jobs as a system administrator, network administrator, working a helpdesk, etc. They can provide more specialized advice on those topics.

* Please go to /r/LearnProgramming or a language/technology-specific subreddit to ask questions which are technical in nature (eg. ""How do I set up Flask with Python?"" or ""Help, I don't understand arrays!"").

* For **resume critiques and advice**, **internship questions and advice**, and **interview questions**, please find the weekly resume/interview advice thread and post there. Relevant postings outside these threads will be removed.

* Surveys are not allowed on this subreddit without approval of the mods. Please message /r/cscareerquestions before submitting a survey or survey request. Any survey posts without approval will be removed.

* Posts which are promotional in nature are not allowed on this subreddit and will be removed. This includes offering paid services, linking to your own content (outside of reddit) for hits, or doing anything else which makes it clear your intention is to promote yourself and not to help others.

* **Do not troll.** Questions are fine. Advice requests are fine. Deliberately provoking the community via those means is not. Do not use a post as a soapbox, a place to brag, an attack platform, or even just as a place to ramble on with no real ultimate goal of asking a question.

* If you still want to ask your question, please make sure to include all relevant details. It's better to have too many details about your situation than too few. **Your geographic location is often important**, especially for degree and salary questions.

* If you post *without any text besides the title*, your post will probably be removed. Remember: context and details are good things. The more, the better. Putting effort into your question/explanation will yield better answers.

* If your post contains only a link to an article without any questions or commentary, it may be removed.

* If your post does not contain a question, it may be removed at moderator discretion. We are a question-and-answer subreddit, not a blogging site.

* If you want answers, use a title which indicates what you are asking about. ""I have a question"", ""Looking for advice!"", and ""I'm lost, frustrated, confused, and sad"" are not good titles.

* Please provide additional information, if asked. In order to give accurate advice, commenters will often ask for more details about your situation.

* Please be polite. Everyone is volunteering their time and advice to help you out.


## Guidelines and Advice For Commenters

* Ask clarifying questions of the OP, if needed, in order to give the best advice possible.

* Please keep your responses on-topic. Top-level comments should directly address the questions posed by the OP in a courteous and professional manner.

* Be honest and thoughtful when commenting. Our community is predicated on people sharing real-life experiences and advice. Do your best to advise people like you would want to be advised. Many people come here because they don't know where else to turn.

* Do not troll. If you don't like a question, don't answer it. If you feel it violates the rules of the subreddit, report it. You do not have permission to be rude or mean.

* Do not belittle or denigrate other commenters' responses. Everyone is taking time to share their stories and advice. If you feel someone's comment is not contributing appropriately to the thread, that's what the downvote button is for. If you feel a comment is meant to troll the OP, please report it. Do not resort to name-calling.

* In many cases, one-word comments are not good responses in this subreddit. Please take the time to explain to the OP why you are giving particular advice, don't expect them to be able to read your mind and intentions.

* Do not feed the trolls! Downvote them and report offensive comments. The mods can't be looking at every thread 24/7, but we *definitely* look at all reports. You can report harassment to the mods by messaging /r/CSCareerQuestions.

Some of the background: I'm 23, living in a central Europe, in a half year finishing my master degree in econometrics. 
Since february I am working as an intern in a manufacturing company. The job itself is fine, I am satsified with what I do and the salary is decent as for person that is still studying. 

Last month I sent two resumes. One to my current company for the quality specialist job and the second one to the bank company that is one of the biggest banks in my country. Well, I got the call from the bank and they are interesed in hiring me for a intern programme that is 1 year long. I'll be sure of it around 15 of December. Now... When I shoud tell my current boss that I found something and am leaving? As an intern I don't have any leave time in my agreement. I am paid for the amount of hours that I work through the month and it is not specified how early I should give my leave notification. 

The smartest move would be to do this after 15 of December, but with christmas comming I guess I leave my department with no time to find anybody for my place. Would that be a bridge burner?"

3vkxid,5,2015-12-05,I'm depressed because of how little I know and how much better everyone at work is.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vkxid/im_depressed_because_of_how_little_i_know_and_how/,"I'm interning at a company in California. I've had other internships before and one of those internships even became a full job as a developer until I left to intern in California. 

I'm depressed because at work, other people who started out at the same time as me (not as interns, but as contractors for their first job out of school) are learning faster than me. They're committing more code, they know how to fix bugs faster, they're able to make features from scratch more quickly than me.

I'm very eager to work hard, but I'm starting to think that maybe I just don't have the mind for this. I have nearly a perfect GPA for my CS degree but that's just academics. Doesn't translate into real-world development. I have a good resume, but I interned at a lot of places and piggy-backed on the better engineers to help me get my work done wherever I was. For example, SQL - I can write SQL and even use basic joins when I need to. But after many months of working with it at my previous job, I still had to rely on the senior dev for writing stored procs and understanding more complex joins and if I had to write a join or use a cursor or do something involving complex SQL right here and now, I wouldn't be able to do it. I had an interview question for a different company where they asked me to do some weird but not impossible stuff with some columns, and I wasn't able to do it. :(

I have a hard time building stuff from scratch. Maybe it's because I've been working full-time and also doing school full-time? I have a hard time remembering which libraries are available to me and which language constructs are useful. For example, I know what C# properties are because I've been using C# for the last year...but I don't write enough of them to remember their syntax or to use them at the best time. I've read many professional texts on C# and other things but I only remember high-level details. 

I'm just not prepared for the real world. I don't know, it's not imposter syndrome. It's not that, because I'm not GOOD. If I was given a task, I could probably struggle with it on my own (like I have to do now) but it'll take me longer than anyone else. I don't know what's wrong with me, maybe I'm just burned out from doing both work and school full time? Maybe I just need to finish off my last semester and then I'll have more time to build toy programs and learn libraries for my favorite language?

It just seems like things come easier to other people. Or maybe I'm only seeing the surface and not seeing their own struggle and their own insecurities? What should a good software engineer be able to do? I enjoy my work but I want to be EXCELLENT at it. Please help me with tips. Thanks so much."
3vl2i2,14,2015-12-05,I feel like the company I signed an offer for is stuck in 1995,redpurple3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vl2i2/i_feel_like_the_company_i_signed_an_offer_for_is/,"I'm a CS student in the SF Bay Area that is graduating next year. I already signed an offer for $92,000/yr starting when I graduate, working in the north bay area.

I interned with this company over the summer and the work was okay. Most of the devs were quite old (in their 40s and 50s) but were very nice people. There were only a couple of devs that were under 30. The work wasn't the most interesting (mostly working in Microsoft C++ and C#) but I was able to do it well and the 8 hour days passed by relatively quickly. The company has a very good retention rate and most people who work there stay a very long time since the benefits are good and the work-life balance is good (they have a strict policy against working over 8 hours per day and not getting paid for it. If they find that you need overtime work then they switch you to hourly so you get paid well for your overtime.)

The only thing that I am concerned about is that this company is very old fashioned. I felt like their development standards were quite old. They used SVN and TFS but not Git. Everything revolved around Microsoft's software. A lot of the time I would be programming in very outdated versions of Visual Studio and working in 10+ year old versions of Microsoft Server.

Are these some red flags? Should I try and find a job at a more modern company? It's not like I hated my internship with them or anything. It was a good internship. I just feel like this company is not using modern software development practices. They keep their employees for a very long time (lots of people here have been here over 30 years) but honestly the work is a little bland and very outdated.

Should I try and find a job elsewhere? I don't consider myself a great software developer but I do well in classes, have a decent GPA (3.3/4.0), and have good social skills. I'm not 100% sure about this but I feel like someone like me would be better suited in a more ""modern"" company, if that makes sense. Plus I live in Palo Alto so I am surrounded by lots of tech companies!"

There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

I'm aiming for a top tier company (such as A Thinking Ape or Amazon), and they pay their interns $5,000/month. That kind of salary will allow me to live on my own for the first time ever.

However, I learned from /r/vancouver that trying to find a place in Vancouver is very difficult, at least if you want a full lease. You won't find anything decent under $1000-1100/month, and you will have to compete up to 40-50 people for one unit. I don't know about shared accomodations.

I thought about getting a place in Burnaby, maybe it will be cheaper or less competitive. I would like to spend no more than $800-900/month in rent. In addition, these are my preferences:

* Close to a Skytrain station or Frequent Transit Network (FTN) route; I don't want to have to rely on an infrequent route like the 129 or 136

* Semi-quiet; I'm not expecting total serenity, but I also don't really want motorcycles ripping up and down the street close by or emergency vehicles screaming past at all hours of the day.

* I don't mind either a full lease (apartment, or townhouse, or a basement suite), or shared accomodation.

Which areas should I look at? Do places only show up at the start of the month (or will I find more places available immediately)? What kind of competition will I face when applying? Or will the expectations be lower than in Vancouver (e.g. only requirement is having a job/steady income)?"

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

So, in case you haven't noticed yet, the Eastern BoS is going very heavily authoritarian, to the point that they are increasingly looking similar to 20th century fascism. Just going down the checklist of historical fascist governments:

*Use of Romantic historical imagery and related propaganda to provide 
legitimacy to the ruling government. (The Prydwyn, the use of latin phrases such as Ad Victoriam, neo-knightly imagery, titles, and organization)

*Idealistic stated goal, often based on history, used to unite the people. (Preservation of prewar technology to prevent a second apocalypse)

*The idea of a brotherhood among the majority or represented group (Humans)

*Suppression and demonization of minorities (Ghouls, reformed Synths)

*A common foreign enemy used to unite the people, often the target of extensive propaganda. (The Institute, Super-Mutants)

*Military and authoritarian style of governance under an absolute and often charismatic ruler (Maxxson)

*Idolization of militaristic values (They are the embodiment of this)

*Use of the military as a unifying cultural force (The Brotherhood accepts new recruits regardless of their current status or past history, as long as they are human)

*Focus on military technology in all areas of research (Liberty Prime, as well as pretty much every technological advancement they make, is military tech)

*Suppression of Liberalism (Minutemen), Communism (Liberty Prime is a giant anti-Communist robot), and Anarchism (The Railroad), and the promotion of far-right ideologies.

*Aggressive Imperialism (They're attempting to conquer the Commonwealth in order to extract military tech, ignoring the views of the natives and often viewing themselves as superior - similar to 19th and 20th century Imperialism)

*The idea of self-sufficiency (From their code of honor: He died for the sins of others. That will never happen again to us. We will become self-sufficient. We will become keepers of knowledge and lore. We will survive the end of civilization. We will take responsibility for our actions, and we will hold accountable the actions of others.)

*Protectionist trade policy (The Brotherhood rarely trades with locals, and even then is very careful about what it is willing to sell)

*Sometimes: Attempted development of WMDs or other major military projects (Liberty Prime)

This is very different from past Brotherhood chapters. While some derogatively called past chapters tech fascists, they never fit all of these points. As stated in Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 2, the Western Brotherhood doesn't care in the least about history, much less the use of it to provide legitimacy. Additionally, they were more isolationist, uninterested in establishing any sort of authoritarian government or cleansing the wasteland in any serious manner. The Lyons regime certainly had some of the elements of it - they provided a military for the Capital Wasteland, they united against the Enclave, and they (albeit less aggressively) suppressed ghoul rights by shooting (and missing) non-feral ghouls on sight. However, they were were substantially less authoritarian, more interested in providing safety to the settlements than developing a strong military base or pulling rule away from local settlements. In comparison to that last point, the Brotherhood actually takes over Diamond City in their ending. The Midwest Brotherhood under the General Barnacky was probably the closest to what we're seeing right now, but even they allowed the mutants to stay alive in internship camps - the new Eastern Brotherhood is looking for total eradication of ghouls, synths, and other mutants.

TLDR; The Brotherhood is a textbook example of 20th century fascism, and is looking far more like the Enclave than even the West Coast Brotherhood at this point.

I'm graduating in a few weeks with an electrical engineering degree, but more and more I feel as though I appear unqualified even for entry level software development roles. I have been trying to learn as much as I can about programming and development to prepare me. For example, I've been learning Java and doing a project and CTCI problems. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but I do think that I have enough of a background for an entry level role (I may be completely wrong about this). However, I am not sure if my resume conveys that at all. I was hoping you guys could help spot what is wrong with it, what I can improve upon, etc, since I am not completely confident in it. Especially with the lack of an internship and a CS degree.

*****
&gt; It&amp;#039;s been some thirteen years now since R. Kelly was first charged with child pornography possession, and since his acquital we&amp;#039;ve settled into a dredgingly predictable pattern in which every few years the spotlight fades and then brightens again on the &amp;quot;Stomach churning&amp;quot; sexual assault allegations R. Kelly has faced, after which we see a wave of intellectualized articles about separating great art from the sometimes terrible people who make great art, after which absolutely nothing happens, largely because of the media&amp;#039;s insistence on reframing R. Kelly&amp;#039;s alleged systematic, repeated rape of children as a question about art.

&gt; Barry Hankerson, Aaliyah&amp;#039;s uncle and Kelly&amp;#039;s then manager, writes a letter to Kelly&amp;#039;s attorney in an attempt to get Kelly psychiatric help for his &amp;quot;Compulsion to pursue underage girls.&amp;quot;Tiffany Hawkins sues Kelly, alleging that beginning when she was 15-years-old he repeatedly had group sex with her and other underage girls.

&gt; According to Jones&amp;#039; lawyer, &amp;quot;That abortion haunts her to this day. She&amp;#039;s under psychological care now. It&amp;#039;s changed her life.&amp;quot;Tracy Sampson sues Kelly, alleging that Kelly began having sex with her when she was a 17-year-old intern at Epic Records and that Kelly impregnated her.

&gt; A woman told the Chicago Sun-Times that Kelly began having sex with her when she was 17 after they met at a video shoot, another said she was involved in group sex along Hawkins, another said she was one of the other girls from Kentwood Academy whom Kelly routinely had sex with, and Chicago area police twice investigated Kelly for completely separate incidents than the incident he was eventually charged for, but dropped those charges when the women declined to press charges.

&gt; Kelly&amp;#039;s longtime publicist, Regina Daniels, abruptly quit saying that Kelly has &amp;quot;Crossed a line&amp;quot; by having sex with their then college-age daughter, who Kelly had known since she was seven.

&gt; Kelly&amp;#039;s brother, Carey Kelly, alleges that Kelly attempted to get him to say he was the one in the sex tape, which he refused to do.

3vmdhf,2,2015-12-05,What's going on with my mom (unstable and volatile) and what should I do?,strawb3rry96,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3vmdhf/whats_going_on_with_my_mom_unstable_and_volatile/,"I was homeschooled for 4 years and am now living at home while taking a gap year (am applying to colleges for next year). My mom has always been quickly angered and emotionally unsupportive, but things are getting worse. 

- Mom's political beliefs are increasingly absurd and militant (gays are the devil and try to recruit loners and shy people to their evil club, the socialists are using Obama as their puppet to destroy America, Christianity is under attack

- Mom draws paranoid conclusions (she freaked out that because I met a black friend for lunch once, white guys would see us around town (in a huge city), think I was dating a black guy, and never go near me again; my reputation would be destroyed. Mom also heard my sister baked cupcakes for a friend's birthday and decided my sister was in a cult because she was baking for people.) 

- She gets extremely angry (yells for 20+ minutes, calls me names and makes me feel terrible about myself) over things like leaving clothes hanging over the bathtub instead of my dresser, or leaving a tissue on my desk. Little things like this happen and I get yelled at very least several times each day. 
This is what gets to me the most. I love my mom and could put up with crazy beliefs and rules, but getting this everyday really tears me down. 

- I'm not allowed to go anywhere without asking her first. The only places I'm allowed to go are school, the park, grocery stores, and occasionally a coffee shop. 
I'm not allowed to see anyone without telling her who first, and since she doesn't approve of anyone who's not white, straight, and fairly wealthy, I often lie about who I'm seeing. 

- I'm not allowed to join any exercise groups or classes, but my mom yells at me everyday for being lazy and not exercising enough. My mom wants me to walk several miles a day in the park for exercise and won't allow anything else. This takes lots of time, is boring, and doesn't work any of my muscles so I don't do it everyday. My mom interprets this as rebellion and punishes me. She's also judgmental about my weight and told me I was fat for years even when the pediatrician said I was underweight. 

- For all that my mom seems over-protective, she's unsupportive in the things that really matter. I struggled with a social phobia for years of eating in public (still do), and all the times I've told my mom she either ridiculed me for it, or promised under duress to take me to a psychiatrist then never did. 
I was severely depressed for years also and my mom, despite always worrying about whether my sister and friends are depressed, entirely blew it off. Despite seeing me struggling with fatigue, brain fog, self-esteem, hope, and just about everything else, all my mom did was call me a lazy brat. I never had the courage to tell her I was suicidal, but one time she said something like ""I have enough on my hands with college classes, college apps, and not killing myself"" and she entirely ignored it. 

- My mom doesn't hit me anymore because I learned to deflect it, but my childhood was full of being cursed at, called names, and hit on the head/thrown on the ground/bitten.

And as much as I want it not to matter, my mom never hugs me or tells me she loves me anymore (since I turned like 14).

OK, enough complaining. Here are the relevant details: 

- I'm 18. I don't want to walk away or move out on my own, because I love my parents anyway and don't want to break their hearts, because I don't think I could emotionally sustain that myself, and because honestly I have great financial privilege. Also, like 20% of the time my mom is totally normal and super nice to me.

- I haven't told anyone. I find it hard to because 1)my family is pretty much rich, my parents buy me plenty of clothes/belongings and even stuff like expensive tutoring. I would look like a jerk for complaining. and 2)my mom is super charismatic and friendly to my friends, and I don't think they could really believe that she's different with me. 

- Talking to her about it isn't possible. After a recent huge argument I was crying and crying and she pushed me to say something, so I confessed I felt like she was always angry at me over stupid things and I just wished she would act like a real mother. This enraged her more, and for weeks afterward she made fun of me for ""wanting her to sugar-coat everything"" or ""not call me out on things"", neither of which I ever suggested wanting. 

So, I have somewhere between 2 and 7 months left at home with my mom (depending if she allows me to go to an internship). Does anyone understand what's going on with my mom? What can I do to make things better or at least not take things to heart?"

Me and your friends can then reference each other.

I graduated from college with a computer science degree but I am still unemployed so I am thinking for creating a ""failed start up"" so that I can write down work experience on my resume.

I don't live in USA so there isn't really much software development internships or entry level software development jobs where I live.

Most entry level software development jobs I have seen require at least 1 year of experience.

A start up is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

If me and a few friends created some simple programs with complex user interfaces to make the programs seem complex and created a website to ""sell"" the programs then I won't really be lying on my resume since the ""failed start up"" is a temporary organization with an online shopping business model.

What do I need to do to make sure my ""failed start up"" looks like a legitimate start up?"

3vnfrn,11,2015-12-06,Mom found out,kuromadosama,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/3vnfrn/mom_found_out/,"This was back in July this year, 1 week after I turned 20 years old.
I came home from college after a exam and the first thing I notice was the wierd atmosphere, not knowing what    happened I go up to my room, as I always do, and I notice stuff have been moved around. After trying to talk to my mother and just getting ignored or answered in a really bad tone I asked my younger brother what's going on. 

He then tells me my mother cleaned my room and that she found some papers and she cried all day over them.
She didn't talk to me the whole month and would drop shade on me by talking loud with other people and in a rude, angry tone so I could hear. Then one day I backfired just a tiny bit and she just goes balistic on me, she called me disgusting and said that my life disgusted her. Latter that day my godmother came to visit and she said, loudly so I could hear, ""A son is always a son"" and I tought thigs were getting better, but no, another month passed with the same atitude from her, till the time came for me to leave for college again.

That day all hell broke loose, we had ""the talk"", as right before I left the car she just went like, ""Do I need to say anything?"" And I oppened the car door and said ""what you are doing to me, I have enemies to do it"" (sounds better in portuguese) and she called me back and said, ""I haven't talked before because I didn't know how to talk to you, I can't sleep at night, thinking of what you are doing"" ""what will the people say"" "" I can't walk in the street cause I'm ashamed and always wondering who knows"" ""You'll become a man, do you hear me?"" ""I have spent all these hears looking out for you, so you'd pay me like this?"" ""Have some respect for your parents"" and I asked what had I done to deserve such hatred and if it wouldn't be worse if I was a thief, a junkie or even a killer and she just said ""you don't need any of those to be evil, what you have done is the worst ting you could ever do"". Then the bus came and I left.

6 months have passed and things haven't gotten any better in fact I think she is trying to convice herself I decided to ""stop being gay"" but she never misses the chance to hurt me and make nasty comments. In these last 6 months she called my name once, the other times I was refered as ""the other"". This really hurts me and I feel stressed all the time, I hate being back home at the weekends and I just want to get out of their lives. I can't stand it, I can't stand the monster she became. I miss my mom, I miss being loved. I just fell confused and angry.
Obs.: the paper was a sort of a jornal, back from when I had a major depression and in wich I refered the word boyfriend which as the only thing she gave any atention to, but still using certain phrases to hurt me like "" be usefull for once"" because I said I was a disapointment to my parentes, friends and the world in the paper and that I should just disappear.

Now I have to find a new house for my next internship but I am so afraid of telling her anything about it cause I know she'll flip, what should I do guys?"

&gt; It&amp;#039;s been some thirteen years now since R. Kelly was first charged with child pornography possession, and since his acquital we&amp;#039;ve settled into a dredgingly predictable pattern in which every few years the spotlight fades and then brightens again on the &amp;quot;Stomach churning&amp;quot; sexual assault allegations R. Kelly has faced, after which we see a wave of intellectualized articles about separating great art from the sometimes terrible people who make great art, after which absolutely nothing happens, largely because of the media&amp;#039;s insistence on reframing R. Kelly&amp;#039;s alleged systematic, repeated rape of children as a question about art.

&gt; Barry Hankerson, Aaliyah&amp;#039;s uncle and Kelly&amp;#039;s then manager, writes a letter to Kelly&amp;#039;s attorney in an attempt to get Kelly psychiatric help for his &amp;quot;Compulsion to pursue underage girls.&amp;quot;Tiffany Hawkins sues Kelly, alleging that beginning when she was 15-years-old he repeatedly had group sex with her and other underage girls.

&gt; According to Jones&amp;#039; lawyer, &amp;quot;That abortion haunts her to this day. She&amp;#039;s under psychological care now. It&amp;#039;s changed her life.&amp;quot;Tracy Sampson sues Kelly, alleging that Kelly began having sex with her when she was a 17-year-old intern at Epic Records and that Kelly impregnated her.

&gt; A woman told the Chicago Sun-Times that Kelly began having sex with her when she was 17 after they met at a video shoot, another said she was involved in group sex along Hawkins, another said she was one of the other girls from Kentwood Academy whom Kelly routinely had sex with, and Chicago area police twice investigated Kelly for completely separate incidents than the incident he was eventually charged for, but dropped those charges when the women declined to press charges.

&gt; Kelly&amp;#039;s longtime publicist, Regina Daniels, abruptly quit saying that Kelly has &amp;quot;Crossed a line&amp;quot; by having sex with their then college-age daughter, who Kelly had known since she was seven.

&gt; Kelly&amp;#039;s brother, Carey Kelly, alleges that Kelly attempted to get him to say he was the one in the sex tape, which he refused to do.

I am a Petroleum Engineering undergraduate student in my 1st year in a highly ranked brazilian university. I've achieved fluency in English (although still improving in everyday), and I do my best to keep my grades as high as possible. In the end of my 2nd year, after I finish what we brazilians call ""Common Engineering Subjects"", I'll be looking for an internship at a company or university research lab, to improve my resumé, adding some professional experience.

I've been to the US and Canada a few times and even did a language exchange program, living in the US for two months. After these experiences and some research, I decided that living in one of those countries is something I really want in my life.

Due to the recent oil crisis, I am considering pursuing a post-graduate degree right after I finish my course (I'm already saving money for it).

So, given this profile, what do you think I can do to improve my chances to move to the US or Canada? What path should I take to make it possible?


Thanks in advance!

3vopn3,3,2015-12-06,My 3 roommates [19-20F] and I [19F] want to live without our 4th roommate [20F] but don't know how to break it to her.,Roommatethrowaway699,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vopn3/my_3_roommates_1920f_and_i_19f_want_to_live/,"I currently live in a 5 bedroom townhouse with 4 other roommates, we are all attending the same college and are going into our junior years. Before moving in the 5 of us all seemed to get along very well, and even now we still get along well with the exception of our 5th roommate, let's call her Sherry. The 4 of us, not including Sherry, are very laid back and have fun being around each other. Obviously, living with anyone they can get on your nerves, but overall my 3 roommates not including Sherry are fun to be around and I don't find myself upset at their behavior or trying to avoid them. We all like living with each other, so much so that the 4 of us have begun looking at places to live with each other next year.

Here is where Sherry comes in. Sherry is incredibly loud and obnoxious, her personality is very over the top and wherever she is she becomes the center of attention. Not because she has something particularly interesting to say or the rest of us want to pay attention to her, but when she enters a room you *have* to pay attention to her, she makes sure of it. Sherry is incredibly passive aggressive, we all take turns doing dishes and household chores but she takes it upon herself to do other peoples chores and will complain about it the whole time she's doing them. For instance, if there are dirty dishes in the sink and someone  is planning on getting to them shortly Sherry will take it upon herself to clean the dishes but while she does so she will obviously throw them around and clank them to draw attention to the fact she's doing the dishes, as well as make comments like ""Wow, these are so dirty I can't believe anyone would just leave these here"".

Sherry also doesn't have the greatest manners. On multiple occasions she has belched in front of all of us without the slightest clue that the people around her might be offended or grossed out by what she's doing. She has no awareness of her surroundings.

The final issue at hand here is my roommates and I believe that Sherry has a crush on one of my roommates, we will call her Jennifer. Sherry, Jennifer, and I all went to the same high school. Sherry and Jennifer met our senior year and quickly became best friends. Sherry and Jennifer lived alone with each other their first year, and according to Jennifer it was absolute hell. Sherry treats Jennifer like she is her girlfriend; always checking in to make sure where she is, scheduling her life around her, at one point when talking about an internship possibility over the summer Sherry commented ""It's a good opportunity but I've never spent that much time away from Jennifer"". It's clear that Sherry has an unhealthy obsession with Jennifer which Jennifer thought would get better moving in with more people this year but it has not.

In short; neither my roommates or I like Sherry. We do not want to live with her next year. The 4 of us are undoubtedly at our happiest when she is not around. Jennifer hides in her room when Sherry is around, one of my roommates does not bring her friends to our place because she does not want them to meet Sherry, the other roommate constantly complains about her passive aggressiveness, and while I am the least vocal about Sherry I share all of their grievances and don't want to live with her next year.

The problem comes in here. None of us want to live with her again, but the 4 of us are probably the only people Sherry considers friends. Sherry is focused on school more than anything else. She takes hard classes and even teaches a class once a week at the University. She does not really have time to go out and make new friends. If the 4 of us were to pick a new place to live and exclude her from it, it would crush her. If she were to realize 4 people she considers herself closest to, including her ""best friend"" who she treats like a girlfriend, do not want to be around her she would be devastated because not only would she be losing her friends she really wouldn't have anyone else to live with next year.

The 4 of us do not want to live with Sherry, she is a constant source of stress and we all wholeheartedly agree we do not want to do another year of living with her. How do we go about telling Sherry that she needs to find a new place to live for next year that doesn't include us? 


**tl;dr**: My 4 roommates and I do not want to live with out 5th roommate again next year. Our 5th roommate considers the 4 of us her closest friends, and one of my roommates is considered our 5th roommates best friend to the point of being treated like a girlfriend. How do we go about telling her that the 4 of us don't want to live with her again?"

3vp1t9,2,2015-12-06,Keep getting typecast into IT operations because of my experience,squarecompass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vp1t9/keep_getting_typecast_into_it_operations_because/,"Four years ago, I graduated with a two-year degree in computer network (CCNA based curriculum) and my Net+.

I worked for two years in a support role with the network admin. I did everything from ""help desk"" to system administration - it was very much a ""jack of all trades"" environment.

I left there to move with my girlfriend, and eventually found myself working tickets at a data center. Mostly hardware fixes, server builds, and basic troubleshooting. The constant 12 hour days were brutal, so I left after a few months.

After assessing my passions, skills and interests, I realized I wanted to make a transition into software development. I've always been fascinated by how computers work, enjoy digging deeper, and want to build things. I like the idea that as a programmer, my skills from work can be transferable to my hobbies and vice versa.

Now I'm 25 years old, going back to university to get a BS in CS. I just recently interviewed for an internship and my technical interviewer started out by asking if I was aiming to be in DevOps - which I'm not.

This isn't the first time I've been pigeon holed into support/ops position interviews because of my experience. I have personal projects I've built at home to try and shift the focus away.

I have tried as much as possible to word my experience section in a way that demonstrates how the position is relevant to development. Yes, I worked in operations. Yes, I know a thing or two about TCP/IP. Yes, I have experience with linux. No, I'm not looking to work in devops because of that.

I've even added an objective section in my resume that states, ""Seeking Software Engineering internship for Summer 2016."" 

The only thing I can think to do is be even more specific and mention ""seeking transition to Software Engineering"" somewhere in my CV.

What else can I do to make it obvious that I want to transition into a strictly development (not devops) role, whether it's now for internships or later for FTE?

**TL;DR: 3 years experience in IT ops. Want to work in development. Interviewers/recruiters think I want to work in devops. How do I get employers to stop focusing on my ops background and start focusing on my development skils?**"
3vp5bt,2,2015-12-06,My [M/22] roommate [F/21] is very anti-social and has some tendencies that make her hard to live with...how can I make this work?,justwannahang,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vp5bt/my_m22_roommate_f21_is_very_antisocial_and_has/,"By nature, I'm a very social guy. I'm extroverted and I love spending time around other people. I heartily dislike being alone for too long.

My roommate is the opposite. We've been friends for a few years and decided to live together this school year. She told me before we moved in together that she can be introverted at times and treats her home like her safe haven - she doesn't like to mix her social life with her home life. That immediately struck me, because I saw our apartment as the ""go-to"" spot and I wanted to entertain a lot. She said she'd be fine with that, as long as it wasn't every week or people didn't stay over too late or leave the apartment a mess.

I just find it hard to live with her. Whenever she's home, she's locked in her room doing work or on her computer or reading. She hardly spends any time in the living area, in fact she has taken to asking me to spend LESS time in the living area since it's right outside her door and I do watch TV a lot/spend most of my time when I'm home in the living room. I think I should be allowed to be in the living room whenever I want, but the way she put it was, ""I don't mind if you're in the living room but I don't get why when I'm watching TV or I have my friends over, you don't just go in your room more often and give us privacy"". I will say that the TV is hers, and I probably use it 80% more than she does, but still, we decided to share it so I don't like being kicked out of that space.

Basically she gets annoyed when it's a weekend day and I'm out in the living room all day because she can hear my shows/hear me laughing/on the phone/etc because her door is right next to the living area. But it's a small apartment, and I never like to spend time in my room because I like to eat a lot and I don't want crumbs in my room. 

I invite people over and she always asks them to leave by midnight so she can go to sleep. I think midnight is way too early, especially on a weekend night, but she always says she needs rest and can't sleep if I have people over because we drink and yell a lot. But we're in college, and midnight is way too early to go to bed. 

She also cancels my plans to invite people over. I invited a few friends over to drink and cook breakfast food on Friday night, and when I came home and told her they were coming over, she told me that she had been planning on working on internship applications all night and, since I didn't ask her ahead of time if I could invite people over, I should consider taking the party to someone else's apartment. 

But I want to entertain! I like having people over, I like being a host, and I hate how she prevents that from happening. I get that we're not compatible as far as that stuff goes, but why does she get her way all the time and I don't get to entertain ever? She always goes, ""Well why can't you do it somewhere else, all of our friends have their own houses/apartments, we don't have to do it here"" or ""I hate cleaning up after people, whenever they come over they leave pizza boxes and red cups of alcohol everywhere"". 

She even called me out and told me that since I'm a med school student, I should be doing a little less partying and more work. She got all pissy and told me she never sees me doing work or applications or applying anywhere. I told her that's none of her business, but she basically told me ""it's time to grow up"" and stop acting like a freshman. I can't move out, because we signed a year long lease and if we break it we have to pay a lot, and neither of us can afford to live anywhere else.

How can I communicate with her and come to compromises here?

Are my parents being reasonable or should I start to cut them off?",awefiown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vp64g/me_20f_with_my_parents_41m_41f_ultimatums_for/,"Going to try to streamline this as much as possible.

**Quick background on the shitty history with my family**    
_My mother was extremely religious.  
_Therapy has now taught me that I grew up in an emotionally abusive home.  
_I had no real friends growing up, because of their strict rules on visiting other people. I still have a hard time making friends now.  
_In my big city, I have my boyfriend, and 2 acquaintances. No real friends. However, I namedrop a lot of people in my classes to my parents so that they believe I have a huge pool of friends.  
_My father is in the military.  
_I live in a big city, while my parents live 800 miles away.  
_Despite his deployments, my father *never* missed Christmas.  

I currently go to one of the best universities in the world, and am trying very hard to set the groundwork to get into a good law school. I have 2 really good internships (one of which pays!), a nice job at a law library that pays well and is extremely flexible with my school schedule. I also babysit for a family regularly, and they have become extremely close to my heart. I have a really sweet boyfriend of almost a year. In short, I have a life in this city (and this is the city where I want to work and go to law school.) 

For the Christmas holidays, my school lets me off for 6 weeks. This is because we get 2 weeks vacation, and then there is a January term which most students elect to take off. However, all of my jobs allow me 3 weeks max for the holidays. I told this to my parents, and they told me that was unacceptable. If any of my jobs refused to let me off for the whole 6 weeks, then I should just quit and find new ones: ~*~FAMILY~*~ is the main priority.

The issue escalated. My father gave me an ultimatum--I either stay home for the entire 6 weeks, or he will not pay for my school next year (my senior year!). I asked him in what world it makes sense to punish his child for taking steps to become financially independent, by cutting her off entirely and leaving her alone in a big city. He told me he doesn't care what I want to argue--either I stay at home for 6 weeks or I'm paying myself.

My sister told me the ultimatum comes from my having a serious boyfriend. My parents think I'm living with him and having mad sex with him every night. They don't think this for any reason, meaning, they don't have any evidence to believe this. I do spend just about every night at his place, and I am sexually active, but like I said, they have no real reason to believe this. They are not in my city. I'm not being thick or ignorant when I say they have no real reason to believe this--since I was 15, they accused me of having mad sex and running off with boys, etc. And at the time, all I ever did was read books and play videogames. Didn't even *kiss* boys.  My parents were very strict, and despite my excellent reputation at school, were quick to assume the worst. It's almost a default accusation whenever they think I'm trying to distance myself (even a healthy distance!) from my family. 

Now, I *can* pay for my last year of college myself. I have a great scholarship, so tuition is easily affordable. But it means that I would have nowhere to stay. My city is CRAZY expensive, and housing is through the roof.  My parents' money helps me to afford a place to stay. If they cut me off, I'm homeless.

My boyfriend told me I could continue staying with him. We are compatible, but I'm afraid that by distancing myself from my family, I will naturally want to be closer to my boyfriend--and I do not want my relationship with him to feel like it's one out of necessity. I want to feel close to him because of who he is, not because I have nobody else. And I especially don't want to convince myself I'm in love with him next year just because if I stop loving him, I will be homeless. He wouldn't ever kick me out, but I don't want to force him to be around me if we ever do break up.  

Another problem to this is that: even though my parents believe I have a lot of friends I could stay with, they would immediately assume that I'm living with my boyfriend. They always jump to the worst. I would be ostracised by my extended family as well, because they would deem me 'living in sin.' Meaning that, if my parents cut me off and I stay and put myself through school in the city, I lose just about *all* of my family.
 
The ultimatum is recurring. :/ Happened this past summer as well. Seems like anytime I want to do something my parents don't agree with, they strongarm me with school funds. 

I think the issue is that my parents have always been controlling, and don't know how to let go. I also feel like they don't believe me when I say that my primary motivation for staying in the city is to keep finding good job opportunities that will help me with my law track. They think I'm just having a ton of demonic sex, and that I'm turning away from them for earthly pleasures. 

I guess I'm leaning toward just cutting my family off entirely, and taking a leap of faith with my boyfriend and try to make a new life for myself without the religious bullcrap. But he and his father are all I have in terms of support. That worries me a lot. 

My dad is calling me because he says we need to resolve this. But talking on the phone makes me a mess. I turned in some essays late because I couldn't focus or sleep well, and I'm having a hard time doing my schoolwork now. I have about 40 pages due in the coming week and I feel like I'm going crazy. I asked him to message me instead so I could have space , and he told me phone calls or nothing. :/

Sorry, I know this was a mess to read. :(

**tl;dr**: Family demands I come home for Christmas for 6 weeks. My jobs permit only 3 weeks of vacation. Family refuses to understand how important these jobs are to my hopes for law school. Dad delivered ultimatum: 6 weeks or I pay for school myself. Feel like the time has come to cut off my family. But I'm nervous because the only support I have is my boyfriend and boyfriend's father. 

Also don't want to be a spoiled brat if my family *is* being reasonable in this case. Really stressed from finals and looking for help/advice/insight. 

Thanks."

I am also receiving a certificate in community development and arts management. I will be graduating this May. 

I am currently an unpaid intern at a local art museum in the Development Department. I also spent a semester as an unpaid intern at a local non-profit contemporary gallery. So realistically I have about a (patchy) year of experience in art related non-profits. 

I am currently looking at 3 internships for my next semester, all non-profit art related. In my initial contact with all of these organizations I noted that I was exploring both paid and unpaid internships. Which is completely true, but if one of these three internships is paid I will probably pick that one over the others. 

Even more, if one of these organizations can offer me a potential job at the end of the internship and once I graduate I would pick that one.

My question is, how do I go about asking this? At what point do I have that conversation?

Going to try to streamline this as much as possible.

**Quick background on the shitty history with my family**    
_My mother was extremely religious.  
_Therapy has now taught me that I grew up in an emotionally abusive home.  
_I had no real friends growing up, because of their strict rules on visiting other people. I still have a hard time making friends now.  
_In my big city, I have my boyfriend, and 2 acquaintances. No real friends. However, I namedrop a lot of people in my classes to my parents so that they believe I have a huge pool of friends.  
_My father is in the military.  
_I live in a big city, while my parents live 800 miles away.  
_Despite his deployments, my father *never* missed Christmas.  

I currently go to one of the best universities in the world, and am trying very hard to set the groundwork to get into a good law school. I have 2 really good internships (one of which pays!), a nice job at a law library that pays well and is extremely flexible with my school schedule. I also babysit for a family regularly, and they have become extremely close to my heart. I have a really sweet boyfriend of almost a year. In short, I have a life in this city (and this is the city where I want to work and go to law school.) 

For the Christmas holidays, my school lets me off for 6 weeks. This is because we get 2 weeks vacation, and then there is a January term which most students elect to take off. However, all of my jobs allow me 3 weeks max for the holidays. I told this to my parents, and they told me that was unacceptable. If any of my jobs refused to let me off for the whole 6 weeks, then I should just quit and find new ones: ~*~FAMILY~*~ is the main priority.

The issue escalated. My father gave me an ultimatum--I either stay home for the entire 6 weeks, or he will not pay for my school next year (my senior year!). I asked him in what world it makes sense to punish his child for taking steps to become financially independent, by cutting her off entirely and leaving her alone in a big city. He told me he doesn't care what I want to argue--either I stay at home for 6 weeks or I'm paying myself.

My sister told me the ultimatum comes from my having a serious boyfriend. My parents think I'm living with him and having mad sex with him every night. They don't think this for any reason, meaning, they don't have any evidence to believe this. I do spend just about every night at his place, and I am sexually active, but like I said, they have no real reason to believe this. They are not in my city. I'm not being thick or ignorant when I say they have no real reason to believe this--since I was 15, they accused me of having mad sex and running off with boys, etc. And at the time, all I ever did was read books and play videogames. Didn't even *kiss* boys.  My parents were very strict, and despite my excellent reputation at school, were quick to assume the worst. It's almost a default accusation whenever they think I'm trying to distance myself (even a healthy distance!) from my family. 

Now, I *can* pay for my last year of college myself. I have a great scholarship, so tuition is easily affordable. But it means that I would have nowhere to stay. My city is CRAZY expensive, and housing is through the roof.  My parents' money helps me to afford a place to stay. If they cut me off, I'm homeless.

My boyfriend told me I could continue staying with him. We are compatible, but I'm afraid that by distancing myself from my family, I will naturally want to be closer to my boyfriend--and I do not want my relationship with him to feel like it's one out of necessity. I want to feel close to him because of who he is, not because I have nobody else. And I especially don't want to convince myself I'm in love with him next year just because if I stop loving him, I will be homeless. He wouldn't ever kick me out, but I don't want to force him to be around me if we ever do break up.  

Another problem to this is that: even though my parents believe I have a lot of friends I could stay with, they would immediately assume that I'm living with my boyfriend. They always jump to the worst. I would be ostracised by my extended family as well, because they would deem me 'living in sin.' Meaning that, if my parents cut me off and I stay and put myself through school in the city, I lose just about *all* of my family.
 
The ultimatum is recurring. :/ Happened this past summer as well. Seems like anytime I want to do something my parents don't agree with, they strongarm me with school funds. 

I think the issue is that my parents have always been controlling, and don't know how to let go. I also feel like they don't believe me when I say that my primary motivation for staying in the city is to keep finding good job opportunities that will help me with my law track. They think I'm just having a ton of demonic sex, and that I'm turning away from them for earthly pleasures. 

I guess I'm leaning toward just cutting my family off entirely, and taking a leap of faith with my boyfriend and try to make a new life for myself without the religious bullcrap. But he and his father are all I have in terms of support. That worries me a lot. 

My dad is calling me because he says we need to resolve this. But talking on the phone makes me a mess. I turned in some essays late because I couldn't focus or sleep well, and I'm having a hard time doing my schoolwork now. I have about 40 pages due in the coming week and I feel like I'm going crazy. I asked him to message me instead so I could have space , and he told me phone calls or nothing. :/

Sorry, I know this was a mess to read. :(

**tl;dr**: Family demands I come home for Christmas for 6 weeks. My jobs permit only 3 weeks of vacation. Family refuses to understand how important these jobs are to my hopes for law school. Dad delivered ultimatum: 6 weeks or I pay for school myself. Feel like the time has come to cut off my family. But I'm nervous because the only support I have is my boyfriend and boyfriend's father. 

Also don't want to be a spoiled brat if my family *is* being reasonable in this case. Really stressed from finals and looking for help/advice/insight. 

Thanks."
3vpdrw,1,2015-12-06,We've been friends for a long time... but also more than that.,throwwwwmeawayy,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3vpdrw/weve_been_friends_for_a_long_time_but_also_more/,"Hi everyone. I'm torn with this one and would like some advice on how to move forward with this. I've tried to forget about him and move on loads of time, but we both seem to be drawn to eachother constantly.

This guy, let's call him C, and I met 4 years ago and immediately hit it off. 

Became very good friends and would talk often. C went to a different uni than me, but everytime we met up, it would be great fun. He started flirting with one of my closest friend and I got jealous (I had never seen him in that light but suddenly I realised I probably had a crush on him) so... I went up to visit a friend at C's university, went out to a club with all our friends, and ended up going home together. I knew he was still seeing my friend on the side, so I kinda dropped it. We never talked about the subject but it was clear we were both affected by it, and our friendship suffered. 

C and this girl stopped dating, I was seeing someone else, and we started talking again (the guy I was seeing lived in a different continent so it was never gonna work). We would talk about serious topics, and even video skype a couple of times. A couple months later, he gets a serious girlfriend. I realise I'm still holding a candle to him, so I try to break all contact. Internship pops up in a new country, so I move, and we don't speak a lot during that year. I forget about him.

Last year, and when I'm back at uni, he has training in my town, and we meet up for dinner with all our mutual friends. We keep up with the banter we've always had. A couple of my friends ask me, once C's left, if there's something between us, since we have such great chemistry. Once again, I'm left wondering.

A month ago I found this crazy story on Reddit, and because I know we have the same sense of humour, I pass it over to him. No hidden intentions, I knew he would find it hilarious. A couple of days later, he sends me a message while he's drunk. In them, he tells me he's always felt like there was something between us, that we've somehow missed eachother, that he feels we have a future together, that he wants to come and see me...

It doesn't take a genius to realise he was drunk, but he confirms a couple of days later that his feelings were genuine. We continue flirting over text message. I can't help but feel that this is slightly selfish, as I'm always supposed to be around waiting for him, but then he always goes and gets a girlfriend. So, to be clear, I tell him how I feel. He says he feels the same way, but that he was still hurting from the breakup, and that it wouldn't work out because we live in different places.

I didn't tell him my feelings with the hopes that we'd start dating, but I felt like it was time after so long.

It's been too long and there's been too many things happen to just pretend like we don't have feelings for eachother. We've talked about having a future together. I want to respect the time he needs to get over his girlfriend, but I really want to see him. However, I don't want him to take me for granted. I'm not even looking for a serious relationship, but everytime we see eachother it's magical, and I'd like to see him more often.

What are my next steps? 

TL;DR: Long history with this guy. Confessed our feelings for eachother, he's getting over a breakup. What to do."

I've had the last few weeks off after exams and I was really pumped to start my first job in the software industry. 

I was supposed to arrive at 9:30am and was so excited I genuinely woke up at 4:30am, spent a good hour getting ready and arrived 20minutes early. Rang the number at reception  for the person who was supposed to help me get started and she arrived with a confused look on her face, turns out TIFU by arriving 7 days early.

I was originally supposed to start working today, but the background checks they have to perform on people took longer than expected and I didn't read the new start date on the contract. Feelsawful. "

I attend a university which has a top CS undergrad program. The CS program is very prestigious and the classes are challenging, and while I'm trying my best, I'm stuck with a 2.7 GPA, mostly because of my terrible study skills and depression. I'm actively working on both.

I did not manage to get a prestigious internship my Sophomore year, instead I was working at a medium sized business, working with their tech department to basically re-design their website. I hated doing HTML and CSS, I definitely like the back end side of things. But, I'm struggling to get an internship for the next summer.

I've applied for many internships, and I hear back from many of them. However, once they talk to me, or once I complete their coding challenges, they often don't contact me back. I think its because I often mess up questions I've mostly avoiding applying to the Big-4 because of this. 

I've participated in extracurricular clubs and I'm even working on a project with others which is mostly me coding .. I feel burnt out. I want a fulfilling career in CS- I'd really like to work in NYC or SV with a successful job.  I don't know how to get there and I'm afraid I'll be burnt out by the end of college.

I've identified my weakness, data structures and OOP questions, but don't really know how to fix them. "
3vps8u,3,2015-12-06,Career: undergraduate research vs internships,MistrDarp,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/3vps8u/career_undergraduate_research_vs_internships/,"I recently accepted an offer as a sophomore from one of my electrical engineering professors to do research under him. The way he worded it, it seemed like I would be trained for several years to eventually be a contributing member of his research team, which also means grad school may now be an option. 

My main question is that because I will be doing this research it will get in the way of getting internship experience, so which is preferred by companies? I'm guessing internships are preferred because they are functional job experience, but having the research experience is a rare opportunity which would help me to stand out. I haven't really though about grad school, but if I am going to be doing this it seems it would make sense to get at least my masters from the school I go to now (state university)

 I was hoping to start working after I got my BS and eventually have whatever company I work for pay for me to get my masters at a better school. As of now I have maintained a high GPA (will most likely remain around a 3.97 after the completion of my third semester), which would likely allow me to go to grad school at a very good university. 

Any input from your experience would be helpful, as I really don't have the perspective to make an informed decision about this. I am obviously going to take the research position now and continue with it during the semester and this upcoming summer, but would it be best to eventually continue with it?

TLDR: which would hiring companies prefer, undergraduate research experience or internship experience?

Edit:

I have been saving since June for a new desktop with saving money from my internship. I recently sold my old Mac on Ebay and I now have money to make my desktop I have been wanting to become a reality. 

I will be using this for mostly gaming along with other stuff that won't really be too intensive. I have gotten these parts mainly from other builds that I have been looking at on PCPartPicker but I have changed some things up. I am wanting to get the new DDR4 ram because it isn't too much more to get than DDR3. 

I am however having issues on deciding which CPU and Motherboard I should get. I currently have the i5-6600 but I have also been looking at the 6600K but it is currently about $50 more, it is really worth it? After a long time of searching I have decided on the R9 390 over the GTX 970 which I think would be more than I need. 

I bought Windows 7 two years ago when I found it on sale for $20 (a legit copy, not torrented) and I also bought the power supply this past back friday (was on sale for $17 after a mail in rebate). 

The monitor, keyboard, mouse, and headset were things that I used for my old computer. And depending on how much I have I might buy a 144 Hz monitor (once one goes on sale, $220 is a lot more than I would like to spend).
 
I would like to hear any suggestions you might have for my build, other then the stuff I already have purchased. I also need the Optical Drive for school and I need the Wi-Fi adapter to get internet (can't get an Ethernet in my current situation). "

And anything else I should know ahead of time?",GreatWhiteLies,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3vq96a/request_resources_or_methods_to_familiarize/,"Hi everybody!  I'm a CC student, CS major, and I'm starting an internship with Reddit's favourite government agency this coming January working on the Model-Based Engineering Environment, and I will be programming mostly back-end, server-side code for the project (which can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-MBEE).  The Project Wiki is a good place to get an idea of the installation steps for anyone who's interested, but once I finish that I still have to link and install the MagicDraw plugin which I frankly don't even understand completely (I'm pretty sure it's a 3D-modeling environment, but not 100% on that).

I'm really very overwhelmed by this.  I have to get it done before the internship begins, and don't really know exactly what I'm doing during the install.  I've taken all of my programming courses in Java and know it well, and learned HTML and CSS on my own (as well as a little C), but running the commands for the servers and entire systems like in this project setup is, right now, making me feel like I'm a bit over my head. It's probably this way for more than a few people in my internship group, and I probably have some Impostor's Syndrome going on, but there are only 5 or 6 of us, and 3 are college graduates, 2 with Masters from very competitive institutions.  

I'd appreciate any resources I can learn from or reference, or any ideas that you guys may have that would allow me to be more familiar with this kind of stuff before I absolutely have to be.  "

I have constant ups and downs. Sometimes, I feel like I am literally on top of the world and am so happy and hyper that I can't even handle it. Other times, I feel so depressed that I worry that I'm going to hurt myself. It fluctuates wildly (I feel up and down several times a day) and it's exhausting, horrible, and makes me feel crazy. None of my emotions even feel genuine because they're so extreme.

I see the pdoc on a monthly basis and the psychologist on a weekly basis. I feel like the psychologist really doesn't understand me. She always cuts our sessions short (supposed to be 50 minutes, almost always ends at the 25 minute mark) and thinks that I just need to get out there and be social as opposed to that I have any real problems. This is the 3rd psychologist I've seen at this counseling center: the 1st was an intern who left after the first semester and the 2nd told me I was throwing myself a pity party because I was upset about something and so I switched to this one. Because I'm at college and my insurance is horrible, I can find neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist within 50 miles of either my school or my home. 

Over the past year, I have tried prozac, luvox, trazodone, hydroxyzine, zoloft, klonopin, and lamictal. Right now I'm prescribed 100mg Zoloft and .5mg klonopin and I was just on 100mg lamictal but was horribly disappointed: no results whatsoever. I was really upset by this because I'd seen so many people here talking about how lamictal was their savior. Currently, the pdoc is trying to get Abilify covered by my insurance so I can start that. 

I'm hoping for the best, but really feel discouraged. I just don't know what else to do anymore. I feel incredibly hopeless and at this point just feel like going to a hospital. I feel like I'll never get help or be better or normal. I just feel crazy and sad and like I don't even know or understand who I am. I don't know where to go from here or how to get more help."

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3vqiyb/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3vqoo6,25,2015-12-06,How come you aren't a Christian anymore?,plumplum16,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/3vqoo6/how_come_you_arent_a_christian_anymore/,"It's a lot of things, but I'll keep it as short as possible.
A few years back I went to Passion (a huge Christian conference) with my college group and girlfriend. Well, while I was there I told her for the first time that I loved her. A few days later she broke up with me because ""God felt that for her"" or something like that.

Another was, when I was at camp my second summer I applied for a leadership position (that I really wanted and felt by God at the time ready for) and I didn't get that. So it bothered me. A lot. Especially since I was a returner. Suppose let the staff ""prays"" about their decision. 

With those two instances (happening within a year of each other) made me feel like I wasn't good enough for Him.

Then after I leave my camp internship at the end of that fall after summer (2013) I come home and go to church but start hearing about all the political bullshit that takes place there and I start to hate it and stop going. During that I'm in a phase where I'm feeling really depressed and lonely. And I'm wondering where God is at to take all this away. I went most of 2014-2015 trying to do better as a Christian and I briefly went back to my old church and was kept being asked to volunteer (I forgot to mention back in 2013 at that church before camp and after the breakup is where my depression came back and I became burnt out from helping so much in the church) that I stopped going to that church in August. I went to two more the following week but I got nothing out of it so I stopped going and in these past months I've realized how much I hate where Christianity is going and want no part in it and being angry at God because of all the shit that happened so I just gave up on it and moved on.

Also, during the summer at a group pool party I realized I was the only single person there and got drunk. My two best friends helped me (both Christian) well one of my best friends fiancée (at the time) was there too. Well, later on I found at her bridal shower or some bride party her and another friend (that I was friends with that went to my church at that time) talked shit about how I shouldn't do that because I'm a Christian or whatever and that really pissed me off to. Just a lot of things"

3vqrsk,9,2015-12-06,What would count as love bombing from Nparents?,91lightning,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3vqrsk/what_would_count_as_love_bombing_from_nparents/,"Hey guys! A lot of good things are happening for me right now. I am almost done with all of my classes for my degree and I already have an internship along with a documentary and a commercial fresh from post production. Many things are going great!

Except for one thing. My Nparents have been acting nice around me lately and it's making me uncomfortable. Because I think this is just some sort of ploy to suck me back into more contact with them and in turn more control over my life and sanity. Ndad found my documentary from an anonymous source (I will ask them where they found it on Christmas Eve) and told me how proud they are of me. 

This was odd because before the fall semester started and I told them about the one class I failed, they berated me about how I'm wasting their money and implied how I'm not going to mount up to anything in life because of the one class out of the several others I did well in. When I confronted Nmom on her personal attack and told her that I didn't like the way she talked to me, she told me, ""I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but it's the truth and someone had to tell you."" She then goes on to berate me over me avoiding the Nfamily. Gee Nmom! Maybe if you and Ndad would actually validate my side of the story, maybe I wouldn't be so prone to avoiding you! Ugh!

Now that I'm doing well with everything, they have been praising me and gave me a lot of attention during thanksgiving. I suspect love bombing. Do you guys think these people are love bombing me? What would be some other examples of love bombing and why are they doing it?"
3vqs1o,4,2015-12-06,Changing name on work badges/emails without first having a legal name change?,transatlanticturker,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/3vqs1o/changing_name_on_work_badgesemails_without_first/,"Hey, Reddit! Not really sure where else to look, so I thought maybe someone here could help me. I’m a junior in college, and want to start applying to internships so I can beef up my resume a bit for law school/graduate school, but I’m getting rather hesitant and concerned about a few things.

Currently, I’m not out at my college. I’ve kind of tried to come out, and I’ve even gotten my faculty advisor/professor of two classes/person I’m closest with on campus. At the start of the semester she had us fill out these cards and put the names we wanted her to call us as well as our major/year in class/and “anything else important” to us that she needed to know. At this point, I briefly considered giving her a disclosure so I wouldn’t be misgendered or called by the incorrect name, but decided against it. (My chosen name is extremely masculine and only used in males, so I guess a part of me assumed that after seeing that she would use correct pronouns. I now know that wasn’t the wisest decision.) She now calls me by my preferred name, and hasn’t called me my legal name once, but continues to use feminine pronouns when referring to me. Some of my professors use my legal name, and at this point I’m too uncomfortable with myself to change that because I don’t want to make things confusing. I’m typically quiet and don’t really interact with anyone at my school, but I go to a tiny, tiny, tiny liberal arts college where everyone on campus (or at least everyone in my two major areas of study would be aware, since it’s on the same floor of one of our buildings). 

When looking at these internships, I’ve been wondering what I should put on my resume, and on my applications. I understand that there’s often a spot for a preferred name, which I would utilize. I also thought on my resume I’d put the first initial of my first name, followed by my preferred name, and then my surname. Once I receive an offer/am accepted into the internship, I would then inform HR or whomever of the situation. 

I’m worried about my correspondence with other employees, and security issues that may arise. Although I may be able to get colleagues and others to use my preferred name and correct pronouns, when getting set up with a photographed badge in order to gain admittance into and out of the buildings, I’m 100% sure that they’ll put my legal name. In addition, organizational email addresses have legal names on them, and I’m really concerned about having an email address that completely differs from the name in the email signature. To me it just seems like a lot of problems that don’t need to occur, and as if it would provoke colleagues and others to ask questions that I don’t think is any of their business. 

I’d be willing to go through a legal name change and avoid all of this mess, but I’m only 20. I’m still on my parents’ auto insurance policy, and they have absolutely no idea of what’s going on right now and the transition. They’ve approached me, and my mother and various family members have gone so far as to ask if I’m using hormones to become more masculine, but I’ve denied it, knowing for a fact that I would be disowned since we’re an extremely devout Roman Catholic family (my father is a deacon in our church). For now, living halfway across the country for college is working out in my favor, and I figure I can just deny their questions until I’m ready to let them know what’s going on. If I could legally change my name without them finding out, I’d do it in a heartbeat. 

At this moment, I just don’t really know what to do, and it’s making me really anxious and really hesitant to apply for these internships and get these things that will give me the experience I need to be successful in my future. I’m also worried about not being able to change my name because of my parents finding out, and having to continuously be misgendered and called by the incorrect name because of identification badges and email addresses. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Has anyone had success with the changing of emails/badges/employee directories without first legally changing your name? Any help or comments would be appreciated. "

3vr1t6,4,2015-12-06,Need advice on negotiating Facebook new grad offer,fbthrowaway2016,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vr1t6/need_advice_on_negotiating_facebook_new_grad_offer/,"Hey everyone,  


I am currently interning at Facebook and I've been told by my manager that I will get an FTE offer based on the hiring meeting. As a result, I've been thinking about how I should negotiate my offer to maximize my earnings for the next few years.  


From friends that have also gotten intern to full time conversion offers, the typical offer is 105k base, 75k signing bonus, 150k stock which is around 160k a year averaged out.   


When time comes for me to meet with the recruiter, how should I negotiate a 10-20% bump from the average offer? Particularly, what sort of things can/should I use as leverage and how should I communicate these things effectively?

Some extra context: 

I have 2 other offers but one is about 140k average per year and the other is about 120k. In my performance reviews I am ranked pretty highly when compared to past interns and had lots of praise (self-directed, fast learner, excellent code, etc.) with very little constructive feedback (improve area that is good but not great).

Thanks in advance! I'll be sure to share my experience and results after my hiring meeting in 2 weeks :)"
3vrdad,6,2015-12-07,Career Help,ineedcareeradvice718,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/3vrdad/career_help/,"I've currently accepted an offer with a major tech company. After speaking with colleagues who have been hired for the same position we will be receiving the same compensation. The only difference is they will have graduated in May with Bachelor degrees in math, material science, information technology etc. and I will be graduating with a masters in electrical engineering.
Am I being underpaid? (Around 83k potentially Dallas TX) Why have I not been compensated for my higher degree in a more difficult field. The role does require technical background and know-how. They were hired on to support different platforms.
I have already accepted the offer but have not started yet. How do I go about renegotiating the base salary/ or benefits?

The job is an entry level ""support engineer"" position providing enterprise level support to developers and enterprise customers.
I've had two internships one with a top company in the electronic industry and the other with a fortune 5 conglomerate. A third internship with a small startup like company.
Unfortunately I didn't do in-depth research for starting salary. The numbers seemed nice in the short amount of time I had to decide.
I would assume my colleagues also had internship experience as this is a position with a top tech company.
Could I potentially burn a bridge by asking to renegotiate after accepting? Or accepting another offer with better compensation?


Am I essentially doing high level tech support? Will I lose my soul? I am a people person but also have issues with feeling like bottom-tier ""IT"" baby.  
Also if anyone has any experience with this or a similar position any advice would be really appreciated.

Situation (Going off of the""★ RULES ★"") :
I am from the USA, living in Southern California. I'm a 19year old student (20 in January) attending community college. Right now I am getting general education out of the way, to eventually get a bachelors in engineering/computer science.
. I've been moving all my life, but only to different cities in Cali. As far as qualifications go, I don't have ant impressive titles, which is why I'm worried about the move in the first place.
wondering if I'd be able to land a job at a restaurant/coffee shop type deal. (paid intern would be the most ideal, but would probably only happen after living there for a bit)

budget: I work at a restaurant paying 10/hr, (averaging maybe 800/mnth on the low end 1000+ on the high) and after I sell my broken car and save for a month, I'd have enough for a plane ticket. However, I'd like to be saving as much as I can(for obvious reasons) till the summer time to make this thing happen. 

Not sure what I am looking for in responses, but everything will be taken into consideration, thank you. "

I'm currently a sophomore at MIT and never thought I'd find myself in this position. 

MY first semester of MIT I pledged a fraternity in which we were required to go on an outdoors ""bonding"" trip. During the trip I did something incredibly stupid. Myself and two other pledges took a canoe out on the lake to one of various islands in the lake. On the island we found several houses that seemed to be only used for the summers. Somehow, I made the biggest fucking mistake that will end up costing me my life, and decided to go into the house because another pledge said ""this looks interesting, let's go inside"". We had no malicious intent, no intent to steal anything, literally just to look at this cottage sort of house on an island in a lake because how often does one stumble upon such a thing. However, before going into the house we used the ladder positioned next to the house to go onto the roof to ""get a better view of the island"". As we descended from the roof we jumped onto the bottomost tier and an old style window crashed and broke. We didn't know what the loud noise was but we shrugged it off, and walked inside the house to see the interior. Stupid as fuck, I know. Well right as we walked inside the woman of the husband who owns the house walked in, saw three people she didn't know, was obviously very intimidated and wrote down our names despite us telling her that we weren't there to do anything malicious. Later that night, we had a cop take our ID's and numbers, etc. 

I couldn't believe that within a week at my dream school I had already fucked over my life. Little did I know that I actually ended up killing myself right there, years later.

Through a gruelling process we went back and forth with the owners of the house, all communication existing between my fraternitys national chapter and the owners themselves- they were too sickened to speak with us directly. They came to the conclusion that they wouldn't press charges as long as all three of us would perform 80 hours of community service that involves helping other human beings in a specific way (e.g. homeless shelter works, but sweeping up the city does not qualify) .

I also happened to realize that I'm not smart enough for this school.  With all of the stress of me not being smart enough for the school, and this incident I fell into a pattern of addiction and lying. Aside from several family issues I have, I started lying to my friends and family about classes. I started drinking and smoking heavily, in addition to playing video games to escape life. I failed all of my classes first semester, went through a difficult conversation with my parents after they found out, and the second semester I pulled C-'s in all of the intro classes. In all of this time I accrued 8 hours of working at a homeless shelter, but only 8 because SURPRISE here's another fucking wrench in my life:

During the second semester I was raped by another male. I had been drinking and smoking heavily and woke up to him on top of me fondling me and sticking his tongue down my throat. He was someone I was very close to, but I made it very apparent and clear to him several times beforehand that I was not gay. Afterwards it made it very difficult to venture out of my dorm, and my escapes continued. 

This past summer I expected to do a majority of the hours. but also wanted to take summer classes because I failed my first semester classes and was behind. I took classes at Boston University, and still failed physics 2, while passing multi-variable calculus. I didn;t do any community service because I couldn't find that many options, although I didn't really try that hard. I fucked myself. I can't cope with the difficulties of school, the addictions and escapes I seem to use on a daily basis, as well as the possibility of going to court and MOST SURELY being convicted of a goddamn Felony. 

Here I find myself at the end of second semester, poised to fail two more classes, get a D in physics 2- the class I took over the summer and failed- and a B in a business psychology class that is a complete fucking joke. I have no new hours despite having reached out to organizations who have said that they will take me in on Saturdays to work for a sizeable chunk. This past week I dislocated my shoulder twice that I had surgery on a year ago, got the stomach flu and spent my time all weekend in misery thinking about how it would be better to just kill myself. 

I'm so ashamed with myself that I've spiraled downwards into a state where I can't do anything. I don't do well in classes because I don't spend time on them, instead looking for any opportunity to use as an excuse to do something else. I lie to everyone about what I'm doing, and no one knows my true story. 

I see everyone around me, top students in their field and the world, landing these huge internships, actually learning material in their classes, succeding in their lives and here I am jerking off playing video games poised to be sued and get a felony because I can't fucking get out of this depression and go serve the greater community of Boston.

In a week I take finals, have christmas break, and then return to MIT in January. A week into January I'll end it with some pills and leave a spot open for a transfer student who will actually contribute to the world. "
3vs8hu,2,2015-12-07,Degree Apprenticeship vs Computer Science at Top 20 University (UK),trojanrob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vs8hu/degree_apprenticeship_vs_computer_science_at_top/,"The UK govt has released a new Apprenticeship scheme where people can get a degree (for free) and work (and get experience at the same time). The only hinderance with this is that I would have to go to a slighty worse Unviersity, like Aston, and get a less reputed degree title (because it was only released this year) ""BSc (Hons) in Digital &amp; Technology Solutions (Software Engineer"". 

Alternatively, I can go the traditional route of a redbrick Uni (Newcastle) and swim in £70k debt straight outta Uni.


I wanted to know, what would you guys do? What are the pros and cons of each and will an apprenticeship hinder my career progression with top firm.

Pros of Apprenticeship (and free Degree):

    No tuition fees (free Digital &amp; Technology Solutions (Software Engineering) BSc degree from Aston or Exeter/QMUL)
    70K+ upon graduation (5yrs pay)
    5yrs Work Experience as a Full Time Software Engineer
    Jump start into competitive careers eg defence
    Get additional qualifcations on top of the degree they give me
    I could probably afford to do a Masters at Oxbridge/London in CS



Pros of University:

    Stronger degree from well reputed university
    Degree completed in less time
    University experience
    3/4 more years of Formal education
    Can go onto doing MSc at Oxbridge
    Diverse networking
    Lead societies, software side projects, internships
    Flexibility of specialising and knowing what I want to do (so many different routes)
    Chance to get a scholarship anyway
    


Would you rather do a CS degree with a year in industry, with an additional internship, extra work experience part time (eg in a start up), 
or
Go the apprenticeship degree route of a free (but worse) degree, 5 years of experience as a Software Engiuneer, but not experience the Uni social life. I do start on 16.5k a year too (and this goes up to about £20k) by 2nd year and progresses to about 30k in the final 5th year.

Or is it better to build myself through making side projects and applying around February/March?

I just feel a little rushed due to the fact that I hear about so many people landing internships already and whatnot."

Help?!",cleresident,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3vsxef/employees_hired_above_me_still_treated_as_an/,"I first came onto a data startup as an intern in 2013. I worked throughout school, and (if I may say so myself) earned a high reputation around the office for my work. After graduating last December, I was offered a full-time position as a research analyst.

Fast-forward to one year later... I still seem to be treated as an intern, being asked (but essentially told) to do tasks such as picking up lunch for higher ranking employees or dropping off business mail of the owner. I have voiced my opinions to my managers that I feel I am capable of more, and was told that I would have the opportunity.

Since that discussion, two additional analysts have been hired and seem to have more responsibility than I do! My situation has not changed, and seems to be getting more toxic. Last week, the CFO was angry at me for not knowing that he was moving his office and volunteering to move his things. I was essentially told that I should be jumping to serve his needs in any way possible.

I have at least 8 months of expenses saved- At one point do I cut my losses and quit my job? I've been applying, and would continue for at least eight hours per day if I left my current position. My biggest worry is that potential employers would be scared off by the employment gamp.

Any help or advice is appreciated.

TLDR: Still treated as an intern, employees being hired over me after asking for more responsibility. Should I quit?"
3vtg6d,0,2015-12-07,Is it possible to become a full time pastor without a college degree?,YesImaThrowaway12312,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3vtg6d/is_it_possible_to_become_a_full_time_pastor/,"Hi. I feel strongly convicted by God to become a full time pastor, with a focus on youth. I was accepted into a four year university, but I'm simply unable to finance college tuition, so I dropped out during the first semester of my freshmen year, about 3/4s the way into the term. However, my vocation is still as strong as ever, and I feel as if God is readily equipping me for ministry. I've been involved at my previous church, doing activities with children, and I've recently been blessed with an internship with a local baptist church.

So I ask, is a degree *necessary* to become an ordained, full time youth pastor? I don't expect myself to be immediately placed into a church, but with experience (I signed a contract to work, unpaid, for the Baptist church for one year, I plan on renewing it January 2017, plus I have a couple years of children's ministry under my belt), do you think a church would take me in without a degree?

I believe God has called humanity to a greater understanding of Scripture, (this calling having *that* much of a greater impact on somebody who wants to dedicate themselves to full time ministry), yet I don't see myself being financially able to attend a four year university and acquire a theology/ministry/religion degree. 
However, I actively enjoy exploring scripture, understanding context, and deriving beliefs from it. I don't want to sound snobbish or anything, but I'd like to think I have a better understanding of scripture than the average Joe. I also have several ""teachers"" (who are either pastors, or former pastors) whom I enjoy learning underneath; we tend to spend a few hours simply talking about modern issues within the church, theology, what the average person needs to know about Jesus, etc. Another thing I enjoy doing is reading commentaries from accredited priests and pastors. I like to hear others' opinions on Scripture and the Christian faith, and I enjoy discerning them from my own beliefs. I wasn't born into a Christian home, but I've been around the block long enough have a solid foundation upon which I've built my faith, and I have wonderful people in my life who readily teach me what I need to know. 

On a personal level, my relationship with God is peculiar. Not in a bad way, mind you, but I find it unique. God has instilled within me a passion for young people, particularly broken young people, and I believe firmly that it's my calling to be intimate with the broken-hearted generation of tomorrow, to love them and show them the light that is Jesus Christ. I believe God wants me to faithfully deliver his message to this age group. When I'm intimate with God in prayer, this vocation is only strengthened.

As for my own standing, I am not perfect, but I am integral. I struggle with what any other man struggles with, pornography, and there are times when I fall. When I do fall, I feel convicted **STRONGLY** by the Spirit, and I'm always led back to a place of repentance. I'm aware that God has called me above sexual immorality (1 Thes 4:3-5), and through His victory on the cross, we are working to overcome that! I've also been praying that God provides a faithful wife for me, so that passion doesn't burn within.

Somewhat related, I plan on starting over my scholastic progression at a local community college this year (which is ridiculously more manageable, honestly, it's what I should've started with) with a focus on either religion (which if I do pursue, would make this question more or less moot), or some other ""tent-making"" skill. Perhaps if my financial situation changes (which I'm uncertain of), I would be able to transfer to a four year school and secure a degree

...

That's enough typing for now. What lies above is essentially what has been swimming around in my mind for the past week, so please bear with me if it seems like a wall of text with no real coherence. I know that if God wills it for me to become a full time minister, the way will be provided. I'm just a bit concerned about my future. (which makes my faith weak in a way. Go figure, eh?) 

tl;dr: feel called to be a youth pastor, no money for college, would a church still hire me with experience and ""secular"" education + discipleship from older pastors?"

Here is a little background to help you guys understand my situation. Currently, I am finishing my under grad degree in IT. English is not my native language. I moved to america around 5 years ago. I am in my 20s. I do have an accent but most people do understand me. My accent is not that thick. On the other hand, my writing skill is absolutely horrible. I make a lot of grammar errors when I send out emails to end users and I cannot split out a proper paragraph to describe the situation to a coworker or an end user. In the past, I did not spend time to improve my communication skills because I thought that I will be an IT and I would be working with computers. Up until this point, that is my biggest mistake. I spent most of the time messing with computers which is a good thing because my technical skill is pretty good compare to other people my age. I also have experience in the IT field. Through out the years, I went through 4 IT jobs (x2 desktop support, it consultant, and junior sysadmin). Now I am doing an internship and they have offered me a full-time position but my performance in the past weeks probably will change their minds. I was not able to make good communication with end users. At this point, I'm mentally prepared that my internship will end soon and I won't get that full-time offer. That's is ok. This internship allows me to learn more about IT. I will be leaving this internship with tons of experience. Now, I know that communication is essential for every job.




I have been trying to improve my writing skill. I start reading books for children above 12 mainly because it is an easy start for me. I also spent time reading email conversations between other IT coworkers and end users (we use a distribution list to get in touch with users so I am not doing anything that is trespassing people's privacy, I hope). What else can I do to improve my communication skills? Do you guys know anyone in the same situation? I know we sub reddit for everything so which one is a good start for me? I know my problem and I want to improve it."
3vtxco,2,2015-12-07,"I(21F) am concerned about a buddy (21M) moving in with his girlfriend of 2 months. I'm right to not say anything, right? Do you try to convince otherwise or just be there if/when he falls?",LemonyArtist,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vtxco/i21f_am_concerned_about_a_buddy_21m_moving_in/,"We've been friends for about three years. 

My buddy Roland(M21) met a cute gal, Lilith(F25) a few months ago. I was really his only friend here for a couple years before he got out of his shell with therapy and started making more friends other than myself. Yeah, he's got a best guy friend back in his home in Florida, but like I said, he and I were were really eachothers go-to buddy for a long ass time.

Don't get me wrong. I'm happy he found a gal that is also like him and likes him for who he is. He's asexaul and so is his new girlfriend. His girlfriend, though, I'm a little concerned about. We all have a friend or have had a friend, or even know a guy that has got into a relationship with a girl who has issues. This girl was in a loveless relationship for 5+ years and still lives with her ex (23M) in a four person roommate situation in a two bed, in the same building my buddy Roland lives. Lilith asked Roland out about a month and a half ago. 

The relationship Lilith had with her ex Mordecai was turbulent and seriously emotionally abusive. This girl has serious issues that isn't getting addressed with therapy, and much like a lot of new agey students, they're embraced in the culture of 'take mental health days off' and 'treat yo self'. This girl is a senior in industrial design and doesn't even have any real work portfolio stuff, no internships and no job prospects. She'll be graduating next may, and the plan that Lilth and Roland has is that Roland is gonna move out and Lilth and her buddy Maya will move in with Roland. Lilith and Maya will just get a retail job around where Roland works. We all go to an expensive as fuck private school, so I mean.. a min wage job isn't exactly gonna pay a lot in the tune of student loan repayment. Sweethearted Roland will support them until they can get a job. 

I know its wrong to use myself as a measuring chip, but for context's sake I have been through the ringer of horrible shit kids/adults shouldn't have to go through. I, however, addressed I had a problem and with three therapy at Uni, I have healed to the point that I am functional when shit goes wrong instead of devolving into a serious panic/anxiety attack. Because of this, I sort of seriously um.. ""look down"" isn't the word, but I wouldn't move in with someone who has their shit not-together, I guess? Lilith's sweet and all, I think. I just wouldn't depend on her to have a plan or anything right now. 

In the end of it all, I told my buddy Roland my concerns, finally. That I loved him and cared for him and am proud of him, but his plans seem really shakey and open room for him to seriously fuck up, and if that happens I wouldn't be able to help him like I usually can when shit for him goes down. He ended up saying ""I'm readin what you're saying"" but then asked me about a house I rented last year. 

Guy is pretty non confrontational. I'm worried that when he finally has a chance at being 'normal' since his transition, he might be going a little overboard with it. But at the same time, how can anyone grow and mature without making their own mistakes without having a safety net to fall on?

Going forward I think I should just try to support him if I can, and maybe get to know Lilith so maybe I could be a non-crazy or non-ex person she could go to as support. Maybe they both just need a little faith in them- we all know I'd like to be wrong and everything turns out peachy. Anything else I should think about/keep in mind/not say? I haven't breathed a word that moving in with a girl you've only known ~4 months with known serious ex issues might be a bad idea, because this is his first real shot at happiness. 

 
**tl;dr**: Asexual male fren meets another asexual female and they start going out. Now they're making plans to move in together in the next month or so, with the female not having any way to support herself. Said some things, not all things. What is my role as a friend, here?"

Did I Pick the Right Internship?,CSThrowaway7777,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vtymu/quant_hedge_fund_vs_big_4_did_i_pick_the_right/,"I'm a junior who recently signed a big 4 internship offer (lets call the company B4). B4 has been my top choice since my freshman year. I'm interested in machine learning, parallel computing, and algorithms, and B4 has some of the best, if not the best, groups in all of those areas. The full-time salary (if I'm lucky enough to convert) is incredible, the perks are great, and the casual dress-code and hours are exactly what I want. 

However, I was also lucky enough to receive an internship from a very selective quantitative hedge fund firm (one of Two Sigma, DE Shaw, Citadel). Let's call this company QHF. QHF is very much a traditional company. Everyone gets to work by 9am, the dress code is business casual, no massive cafeterias, and no crazy perks.  However, the monthly salary was incredible. I go to a top CS university and no one I know has been offered a salary that high. It was significantly higher than even Palantir and Dropbox. I'm not sure what full-time salary is like, but given the internship salary, I can't help think the full-time is as competitive. 

Now, in terms of culture and work, I definitely prefer B4. However, I can't help but think I've missed out on a very unique, and possibly very lucrative, opportunity. Did I make the right choice?

EDIT: I'm also wondering about career path and upside. How would the two fields compare?  "
3vu3up,2,2015-12-07,"Me [20 M] with myself duration 3 months, don't know what to do with my life.",Whywelose,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vu3up/me_20_m_with_myself_duration_3_months_dont_know/,"Hi guys!
So I visit this subreddit from time to time on my main account, people do know my name and since I am not a talker much and stay to myself a lot I don't want them to know about this.

So a little backstory, well, for the better off a 2 maybe 3 years I have been dealing with a bit off a depression and through that my self esteem has been shit lately. But it's not your typical depression, I do socialize with my friends, so to them this comes as a surprise because I do not tell my friends this as much as I maybe should, I don't know, I don't want ""symphathy"" or make them feel bad for me. I am not like that, AT ALL. And I go to school etc, just so you know.



Now, my dream and my passion has always been gaming, humor and informing people. Making people laugh, happy etc, I follow everything there is when it comes to gaming. I am THE guy. No I am not fat or got a neck beard and a fedora. 

Now, 5 maybe 6 years ago, I had a shot on doing something with my hobby. I turned it down for reasons. Way to young, I didn't have an education so this would be a risk so high, if it failed for what ever reason I would be so screwed for life. Now all these years later and this thought in my head, about doing something, trying something with my dream to make it a reality is still there. And I have immense passion and dedication to achieve at least SOMETHING with it, at least I think I do. 


Now on to my problem, last summer I finished an education which, in my eyes, wasn't something for me at all. I just took the course off 3 years because I didn't know what else to do. The last year was extremely hard for me because off my depression getting worse and the work that I had to do was pretty hard to keep my attention because off all the other stuff going on in my life. I did pass though! 


Now with this diploma, I could, if I wanted, finish an extra course within a year, this specific course is something my best friend has been doing as well and he/she wanted to start a company with me, this and the reason I didn't know what else to do with my life were the sole reasons I am taken this course. Now, my friend and our ""own company"" isn't happening anytime soon and I think the entire idea is off the table. So the only reason I am actually taking this course is for the money I still get from going to school and because I didn't know what else to do. Now I did some research on schools and I am going to visit some school beginning next year to see whats for me and what I want to do with my life moving forward, BUT this is getting restricted because off my intern hours I have to do, at least, I am 99% certain my boss would't want me to go to a school on Monday. 


Anyway, the course is basically running intern until June. Working all week, 1 day school and thats it. At school, the first few weeks, the work was fun. It were awesome jobs I had to do and not because I was at school, but because the work I had to do for others was sweet. Now having run my intern for the past month and a half and I absolutely hate it. I am not a guy for lifting heavy shit, going on high stands etc etc. 

Now for the past few weeks I am feeling my depression playing again, I feel like I am wasting my time here, I feel like my time is better spend looking for an education I DO want to do or even trying to achieve my dream and making money with what I LOVE to do, instead I am working my ass off on an education I do not like, do not want to do anything with it in the future, at all. 

I am looking for help, before you ask, I have been to a counselor, it didn't do much for me and I am looking for other help with my self esteem problems and my chronic depression. 


Now, my question is, what should I do ? What can I do ? 


Do I quit with what I am doing now, trying to get myself back on track in this year, mentally, look for an education I do want to do and try to achieve my dream ? Doing this means I lose my funding for school, for ever, I lose my monthly income and I would have to find a job to pay my bills, BUT I would have the time in the world, besides a part time job, to work on myself. ( I don't have many, I still live at home, but like phone, smokes etc ) 


Or do I finish this education and try to find the energy to find an education I want to do besides doing this. I get to keep my monthly pay, which is a lot more than I would get for working part time..and thats..the only positive thing I can think off really, besides getting an extra diploma. 



   
**tl;dr**: Chronic depressed, Running this extra course since October untill now, the first few weeks at school learning the basics and now working in a company for the rest off the year until June, I hate the work and I didn't expect it to be this different than it was at school. I kind off want to quit but the down and plus sides off the matter are all very important. 

EDIT : I have to make a discussion before February 1st. Else I have to pay 3,5 years in student loan debt or finish this course. Neither off which I am happy to do. "

**Description**

My final semester, which is this upcoming January, consists of a 3 day per week internship. I have 2 interested parties: one as an IT for a 500 employee company, and the other as a solo web developer for a University Research Team. 

I have a passion for software development, and I see that as being the path I would like to do for the foreseeable future. My concerns lay with where these 2 internships could leave me.

The cons I'm seeing about the large company is that I may corner my future prospects afterwards to IT positions in a company. I keep telling myself why would a software dev take on an employee who has only professionally done IT work beforehand. However, since I do code on the side, my personal projects could fill in that gap possibly?

On the other hand, I don't know how credible employers would see me from having worked for a university research project and not in the industry. I wouldn't be putting some big company on my resume, and I would be self trained to put together the website that is desired. However I would have items to add to my portfolio.

Any advice?

I'm 22 and have only worked at two places: a diner and an IT department of a construction company, my current job. I started working in the department during the summer two years into college as one of the two interns original interns in the department. I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science and got promoted to staff after two years of interning. This was a couple months ago.


**Department setup**


Now here's the thing. This is what I would call an unorthodox department, or at least it seems like that to me. Everybody just comes up either their own accurate-enough job title and has general duties. No meetings, just casual drop-ins and a bit of rare department email to communicate bigger plans. There's also some wiggle room for getting into something new if you can prove its worth to the department (which is very nice). The department is fairly small for a group of people running IT for about 2,000 users across the country.


**Career thus far**


Us interns spent a decent amount of time ghosting computers for a while, but when the Ghost server mysteriously died and no one knew how to fix it, we resorted to setting them up with all our programs and configurations manually. Each and every one. And there were a lot. The portion of my and my fellow intern's time spent on setting up new computers skyrocketed to about 70-80%. I got tired of doing that and pieced together what OS imaging was and how to get it done over the next few months, then created my own (and very, very patched together) complete imaging system using nothing but a VM, imagex, external HDDs, and a bit of scripting. It was my nice little accomplishment, and I made it well enough so that it got the job done neatly and never crashed. With a bit of updating every now and again, it was our official imaging solution for almost the next year.

During our phase of serious manpower expansion, the department hired a guy who had been an SCCM administrator at his last job. We were pretty quickly able to get my thick image working over the server, and we spent the next few months working on getting modular imaging and company-wide application management running, which eventually came through. We've been holding it to just maintenance status ever since.

Once time freed up from that, I chose to dig deep into GPO since it had just been messed with a bit over the last decade by several people who may or may not have known what they were doing. After a while of slow but steady progress (during which they offered to hire a consultant for a bit to help things along), management approached me with MDM instead, something other people had been eyeing for the last year but could never find the time to follow through with. They knew I had the time now, and it was important for some upcoming projects, so I've spent the last couple months getting our solution setup with a baseline configuration that I can then hand off to the person handling all our company smartphones, tablets, etc. for day-to-day while I administer some elements in the background (somewhere between administrator and tier 2 support, depending).


**The freaking point**


I feel like I've had quite the unorthodox career progression over the last couple years here, and I have no idea if I can even match it to a common path at all. It just feels like things happened too unorderly and too fast. As for income, I currently make close to $48k, and I'm perfectly content with it. I just want a baseline to compare against, higher or lower, whatever gives me a good answer and some sort of standard to work with. On that note, it's also worth mentioning that I work in one of the more largely populated areas of the southern US (not Texas).

Seriously though guys, absolutely any help on this would be fantastic. No one in my family or friends has even worked in an office like I do or IT at all, so I have no idea where I'm at here. More than not being able to quite articulate where I'm at in my career is *not knowing for myself*. I can't stand it.

Thanks guys!



**TL;DR**


**I work in a fairly densely populated area where I created our imaging system from scratch while still an intern, then built up to creating a PROPER one with the help of a new hire. Now I'm setting up our initial MDM stuff. I'm 22 and essentially fresh out of college. Where am I in my career here?**"

We became pretty good friends, always joking around and she would laugh the hardest at jokes I made during lectures. We went out for drinks from time to time and it was always great. A few months later, she broke up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her. A few classmates told me I should start dating her, but I was like “Hmm no, we are really just friends.”. 


At the first semester of the second year, I dropped out because I wanted to study something else, but we remained in touch. Fast forward a few months, when we met at a wine bar in town to catch up. She told me she would go abroad for a few months as an intern, and I thought that was great. However, I started to get feelings for her. 


In the beginning I thought nothing of it and just ignored them. Every time we met I would get a little more nervous so it was growing but I decided to just let it go. She would leave in a short period anyway. 
When she was abroad she texted me a lot. We talked through the whole day and this made my feelings for her grow even more. I knew every little thing she had done every day. 
When she got back I started to look for signals every time we saw each other. I couldn’t really tell, so I set up something which looked like a date to see how she responded (I know, really stupid idea, but I was really worried to ruin the friendship). As a surprise I took her out for dinner and to a comedy show. We had a great night, but it was obvious she didn’t see it as a date at all. 


A few days later I decided to tell her anyway, since this wasn’t really a base for a healthy friendship. At first she didn’t know what to say, because she never expected it. She proposed to meet that night at a café to talk about it. It ended up being a great talk and it was really great to get it off my chest. It seemed she never looked at me that way and rather wanted to stay just friends. I was ok with that. She was really cool about the whole thing, asking if I needed some time and she said she hoped I would still want to see her.


All this turned out to be great. I started seeing her as a friend again over the course of a few months and we became much closer than before. We both opened up more and shared more personal things and problems with each other. I was genuinely happy this was working out so great. 


Last Saturday we planned on seeing each other again. At first we met at a café at noon, talked the whole day about everything. We went out for dinner, got to the movies and ended up in another bar where she ordered a bottle of wine. 


When the wine was doing it’s thing the topic landed on the feelings I have had for her. And the ‘date’ thing I had set up, which she didn’t see as a date back then. “Well”, she jokingly said, “today could be seen as a date too, but should I think something of this?”. I told her “No”, and that I didn’t have the illusion of her changing her mind on this. She told me she didn’t either, but she felt like she only started to know me since the conversation we had a few months back and that she really liked how I turned out to be and how we became so close. I was starting to get a bit tipsy so I asked her what made her turn me down back then. She thought for a few seconds, and told me she didn’t really know but it probably was because we started out as friends and that never changed for her. When I walked her back to the train station we were both a bit drunk. I wrapped my arm around her. At the train station, she gave me a kiss on the cheeck and hugged me very long, telling me how great of a day she had. 
The next morning I woke up feeling really miserable. The day before clearly either refueled old feelings or started new ones. I felt like I’ve thrown myself back a year and all the ‘progress’ I made was lost. 


I don’t know what to do right now. I kinda want to go to her right now, telling her it was a mistake to not giving this a change. Five minutes later I realize what a stupid idea that would be. How it would ruin the great friendship we have built and how I actually don’t want to put her through something like this again. Any advice?


TL;DR: Fell in love with a girl after being friends for a few years, told her, turned down, got over her, became much better friends, fell in love again.

From what I can gather on this sub, students and recent grads have a general tier list of hot startup/unicorn&gt;Facebook&gt;Google&gt;Microsoft&gt;Amazon, but would a recruiter or hiring manager really look at a resume, see that someone ""only"" worked at Amazon, and bin it? Would the exact same resume, but having Facebook instead of Amazon lead to an interview? Or do these rankings really only exist in the minds of students and recent grads?

While Amazon still seems to be seen as having a high hiring bar (though perhaps not as high as the other aforementioned companies?), there's a lot of other tech giants that aren't talked about as being on the same level. For example, having a position at Oracle, IBM, or Yahoo doesn't seem to be viewed as highly as the big 4, but again, would a rejected resume that had IBM on it have gotten an interview if it said Amazon instead? At what point does this stop mattering?"

I recently graduated college, and I'm now looking for my first full time position, hopefully as an entry level data analyst or data scientist. I've worked with R, MATLAB, Java, and Excel in classes and internships, and I've decided to teach myself SQL while I continue to look for a position. 

This week I met with a family friend who's been successful in the field I'm looking to enter, and he gave me a number of helpful tips on my resume. One thing he mentioned was to add a ""relevant class work and projects"" section as a way of demonstrating what I've accomplished using R, MATLAB, etc. so far. As for SQL, he said that it would be good even to mention that I've been working on it independently, and to perhaps describe a small project I've built... So here's my question: do you all have any suggestions for a tool I could make using SQL that is attainable for a beginner, but also wouldn't be laughable on an entry level resume? Any tips are welcome. Thanks in advance!"

It's exhilarating to know that someone finally acknowledges my progress, but I don't want to make an uninformed decision and would appreciate feedback from different perspectives for red flags, and things to caution for.

  I started learning from scratch 6 months ago and since then have created a few of my own websites, along with securing my first freelance job for a start up company. I'm familiar with html, sass, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, and django. 

 I just got home from work and I get an e-mail from the president of this company (I live in Windsor Ontario, so it's probably a small-med company). He says he can't use me now at my skill level but is offering a 2-3 month fulltime internship doing self-training or working on some projects to familiarize myself with a LAMP stack at which point they would consider me for full time. They don't have budget for junior, which is why they're offering me this.

  First off, there is no doubt in my mind that web development and programming is going to be my career choice regardless of the ups and downs. Any opportunity to learn like this is a blessing to me. 

 Is this kind of offer usually paid? should I ask about it? is it a red flag if they don't offer me anything? what should I ask and do to find out that they're not going to just use me to complete a few projects and dump me afterwards with no pay/compensation? I'm really new to this in general, only have had 1 legit job and have only heard/read about people being cheated from internships. What questions or things should I look out for to protect myself? And does this offer seem legit to you guys?

edit: the job is also for PHP. I have no experience in PHP right now, and only know python/front-end."

(Sorry if there are mistakes, English is not my mother tongue).

In 2014 I moved to the US for my studies. I am studying English, I had several work experiences in my country and I was able to have a great internship thanks to these latter. This is how I met him. We have been together since this period. I loved him immediately, it never happened to me before ( I have been in 2 long relationships before and they were for the most part : abusive).
He is treating me so well. He introduced my to his parents and his relatives and few months ago, he asked me to live with him. He is telling me everyday that he loves me, that we have such a good relationship, that I am his best friend and lover at the same time.
For me it was a big step in our relationship and I thought he was loving me as much as I do. 

Now, my visa is coming to an end very soon, so I will have to comeback to my country and probably find a job and start a new life. It has been months that I am searching for a solution and he knows it... I want to stay with him and I don't feel like he is ready for a long distance relationship... 
I asked him as we are in love and such a good match I don't feel myself like leaving him right now so I told him why we couldn't marry ? ( I am living in Europe...) and he started crying telling me that he is too young, that it is too soon, that he is immature, that introducing his relatives to me was just being polite...( they are living in an other state and they are barely coming to visit him ).
I feel what I believed was all faked...

I am lost... I don't understand why he is with me, why he is making up all these reasons...He said, I am going to save money to see you once or twice a year... 
Lately he his finding all the weirdest/random solutions to let me stay, but they are not valuable (ie : he didn't check on the internet at all), I feel he is taking me for a fool... I am desperate... 



I don't know what to think anymore... can you help me to see through this?
What should I do?

Long story short, I'm a European Software Engineer and I did my final year internship in the US on J-1. At the end of my internship my employer offered me to stay and sponsor me for an H-1B. I stayed, but after one year I started burning out and having some kind of a break down. The reason was mostly because I didn't like the tasks I was assigned, and because I was tired of putting pieces of tape on problems instead of really fixing them. He listened to me, and took me off the project that was burning me out the next week and gave me a 10% pay-raise. He also promised to give me better tasks, and also promised to give me the ability to fix problems instead of working around them.

This was more than 7 or 8 months ago. But after 5 months, I was still working around bugs and not instead of fixing them because of time constraint. I took 1.5 week of vacation but it didn't recharge my batteries, and I only have half a week of paid time off left now...

So, two months ago, I started looking for another job, in Europe, the salaries are about the same than in the US now, and you get full benefits (6 weeks of paid holidays, budget to go to conferences, ...) I found a job, signed my contract last week, and I bought my plane ticket for next month, I just have to tell my boss that I'm leaving now.

The question is how should I go about it? I have a very good relationship with him. He's a very nice and caring person. He cares about his employees' well being, and he takes a lot on himself. Moreover, the last month, while I was looking for a job, the situation improved, I started having tasks I liked, and really fixing things. But, it's too late...

In addition to this, he gave me a lead position on big project of which we're in the middle.

How do I tell him that I'm leaving without sounding rude? I really feel guilty about leaving in the middle of the project, while the situation is improving. I started writing as much stuff as possible down and documenting. I'm also a single point of failure on a lot of things, so I tried to share as much knowledge as possible with my colleagues the last two months. How can I make sure that I'm not considered like a dick once I'm gone?

Thank you,"

It feels like only yesterday I was moving into my college dorm, sober and happy, albeit anxious, about my new life. I took my first toke about a month afterwards, and thus took my first step down an incredibly slippery slope.

Now, 4 years and one college degree later, it feels like I've coasted through the past years. I barely remember so many things that I should. What was supposed to be the best time of my life is a blurry haze. 

It wasn't always like this - a gnawing pressure in the back of my head, craving just one more bowl, one more hit, urging me to pull $30 more out of savings to get another bag. 

It used to be the thing I'd do once a week or so with a friend in his dorm room while playing video games. My friends back home had told me they liked doing it, so I knew I probably would too. But I should have seen this addiction coming - as they say, addiction runs in the family. 

I'm literally writing this so I don't text my dealer. I'm unemployed, living in my parents' basement, wondering how it didn't go according to plan. I was supposed to get offered a job after my summer internship, find the love of my life in college, and be well on my way to maxing out my monthly additions to an IRA. 

Instead I'm here, wondering if I'll actually make it to tomorrow without smoking. I have my talents, and I know I'm capable of greatness. But I've held myself back, inadvertently at first, with the help of a little green friend. Now every step in the right direction is prefaced with leaving my green friend behind, but it's the hardest part of every step. 

I want to do so many things with my life - write the next great sitcom, or novel, or screenplay. Inspire someone to be better than I am. Perform a piano recital for friends and family. At the bottom line - be important in the life of someone else. But all of these things have proved impossible for me to accomplish when I'm high. 

I'm a lost boy, stuck in a man's body, wondering why the world expects so much of me. Everyone says it's supposed to get easier once you're on ""the other side."" I sincerely hope that's true, but I've never been farther from the other side than I am now.

It was a magical date and every day talking to her is better than the last. I feel a connection with her that I've never felt before in my entire life. It hasn't been much time, but we're both just overwhelmed by our meeting.

The, what I'm calling, half-promotion is moving forward and my training begins this week. Everyone at work is excited for me. And work in my current position has been generally good. Knock on wood, I've been performing the best I ever have these last few days, even heading into a 7 day work week. And having Nancy around keeps me motivated. She has finals and I have this crazy week going on, so seeing each other at the end of this craziness is keeping us both going.

And today, after getting home from work, I opened my email. I got the internship in Denver... I have it. The opportunity to runaway. To start a life of hard work on the frontier of independence... I was ready to look at apartments, to drive across the country, to leave everything behind...

But now I have this promotion... and Nancy. Things are finally going my way, and I don't know if I want to abandon it. On one hand, Denver will always be there. I'll have more time to save some money and find a more substantial position. I can see where this half-promotion takes me. I can really pursue things with Nancy, who's making me feel more loved than I have in years. On the other hand, what if I suck at these new duties and get stuck working til 3AM every night? What if things with Nancy don't work out? Will throwing away the internship have been for nothing? 

Trolls, I know what I want to do. I know what I should do. I just don't know if I can stomach myself pussying out of running away.

I am a sophomore undergrad at a state college. I was lucky enough to snag myself an internship last summer, though it wasn't with any particularly well-known company. This year, I threw everything I had into getting a more prestigious internship. Companies I applied to included the Big 4, as well as the lesser-known but still popular companies that are Epic, Cisco, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Qualcomm.

I failed every single one of them. Half of them I never heard back from (as to be expected, of course). However, two of the Big 4 companies actually gave me interviews. Of those two, I failed the on-campus interview of one, and got to the final round of the other. I gave up my birthday and the entirety of my Fall Break to study CTCI and Glassdoor for the final-round interview, and was extremely disappointed to learn that I had been rejected there as well. It made me feel like a failure, especially considering all that effort I had put into it, coupled by everyone else showing off their cool Jane Street/Uber/Big 4 internships.

Now, before you roll your eyes, this isn't a whine post. Yes, I feel pretty pathetic right now, but that's not why I made this post. I realized that rather than moping around and feeling sorry for myself, I should channel that energy into studying hard and improving my CS skills, now that I know exactly how difficult it is to land an internship.

So I now have two questions. 

I know hackathons are a great way to improve my skills, when they occur. But I was looking for something that I could work on every day. I've heard good things about Hackerrank, and want to try that. I've also heard that spending my time on free projects was an excellent idea, though I'm not sure what ""projects"" I should be making - a game of some sort? So my first question to you all - what's a good ""daily"" way to improve myself, that I can incorporate into my routine? Keep in mind that while I'd like something that would improve me as a coder, I'd prefer something that *also* helped me to snag a nice internship next year.

And secondly, is there any hope for me to grab an internship at a decently-known company *this* coming summer? Like I said, I've applied to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and all the smaller companies like IBM, Cisco and Epic. Most of these just flat-out ignored me. I understand that spring recruitment does happen, but my understanding was that most of these companies would have finished their recruitment process during the fall (aka done by now).

Thank you for your time.

I have most of my credits dont and after next semsster ill be taking pure CSE courses specialized in gaming and hopefully graduate in a year or two.

Whats the best path i can take to get a job?

I just took my first two programming course this semester, one used python (easier class) and the other was java and intro. Technically we dont need to know GUIs but my professor taught it because he felt like  cs course isnt complete without it, so i have some understanding of it.

So anyways i wont actually learn GUIs until my next fall semester, the one in spring is gonna be mostly about data structures.

I am trying to learn C++. Over my break i bought a gaming textbook using linear algebra to make 3d graphics which i plan to look at over winter break and study. The book uses C++ so i plan to play around and learn C++ over the winter too.

Additionally i plan to make a game if i get good enough at everything, in 2d though.

I eventually would like to make a 3d game or simulation after making a few 2d games.

So....i was wondering if this is possible? If this is easy and what resources do you guys suggest i use to help make this happen besides what i already am using? (Textbook, c++ learner, school...)

So eventually i would like an internship so i can get a job in CSE as soon as im done with college since ill have experience. So i am trying to build a portfolio....

What else should i make? How much programs should i show off? When do you think i will have learned enough to get an internship?"

It's an in house call center for a large charity organization. It's so awful. All of the other departments have flexible schedules except us. 

The people who donate to us are usually kind hearted, but the stupidity is absolutely astonishing. People sometimes call to give a new card and ask if they need to give us the whole number. 

90% of callers are 70+ years old. Most do not understand the concept of our website. 

I'm a college a graduate but stuck making 13 an hour. My friends who work in restaurants make at least twice as much as I do. I do the same thing every day and my job is extremely monotonous. I don't do emails or anything anymore. Just phone calls and then mindless data entry. I feel like I've wasted two years of my life. Ive grown stupider as a result. Ive become cold an uncaring. Ive gone from a vivacious young man to feeling like I lost my balls. Our department is incredibly female dominated. All my managers and bosses aside from the CEO are women. I always considered myself a feminist and down for equality but I feel like working in this industry has made me more woman like. I'm less likely to be assertive. I just have to sit there and take it. Whether it's calls from donors or whatever new project or script other departments decide we need to push. I just sit back and take it like a lubed up ragdoll. 

I think that's why there's so many women in this profession. They're used to putting up with a lot of shit. I can't believe the creepy old fucks who call in just to speak to certain women. I can't believe the women put up with the conversations and don't try to be boring or cold to get them to hang up. I guess we need that money. Some dudes just call to chat. 

There's no proactive role for us. I hated the job the moment I started but I said I'd stay for a year to build my resume. One year turned into two...my spirit is crushed. Every time the phone rings my adrenaline spikes. I instantly disdain people calling in even though most of them mean well and want to do good in the world. I hate the anxious and nervousness of some people who call in. You can tell they lead busy lives. So many housewives and retired people who call us and have nothing else to worry about other than their sponsored child, many of whom imagine them to be adopted or their own flesh and blood. The old women who cry on the phone when someone leaves the program. I feel like I either end up taking on callers anxieties or I end up being a cold uncaring asshole. 

Im just venting here. Don't even really expect any replies. I just can't believe this is the life I've chosen for myself. I honestly fantasize about being homeless that's how much I hate my lifestyle. Fuck 8-5, fuck being the bottom rung of a company where you have no power and get shat on. I rebel by being incredibly lazy and am always on my phone on Reddit or whatever but no one complains. Tbh I've been hoping to get fired for well over a year because I hate this so much. 

No offense but I work with plenty of people who barely graduated high school. They're great, but I can't help but feel like an extreme failure. We have interns from a local high school who work with us. They basically do the same work I do aside from a few things. I feel so underutilized. I'm not a math person but it feels like I know how to do calculus but my job only allows me to add and subtract. 

I know I have it ""good"" compared to other call center jobs. I don't have as many calls as others do. I don't deal with as many angry calls as others. It still sucks though. My personal life is awful, it used to be okay but now I come home from work and isolate myself until the next day. Drugs and alcohol no longer allow me to cope. What girl would want to be with some guy in a call center who hates his life? I legit want to kill one of my coworkers who robbed me. I never could do that, but it really sucks. I know who did it but have no proof. I absolutely detest this individual but have to see her or him everyday. I used to consider myself a peaceful love everyone type and now I fantasize about murder daily. 

Call centers are the worst."

My definitive question is, is this setup good?
and what changes could i make? Which brand RAM?
Which motherboard? And is 600W power supply enough?

I'm currently running Ubuntu 15.04 on my laptop, but instead of bumping up to 15.10, I've considered switching to Arch. 

What advantages are there that I should consider?

**Important to note:**  I don't use Unity. I use i3 and that's the first thing I would install on any Linux distro. The biggest thing I like about Ubuntu in specific is the package manager, but I don't know how any others compare. 
 
**Use cases:** I'm studying Computer Science and wouldn't consider myself a noob user. I do programming for my job, and I only used Ubuntu to begin with because that's what they installed on my computer when I started as an intern. "

What should I do?,TwOne97,linuxquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/3vxnlb/setting_up_old_pcs_for_educational_kids_use_what/,"So, I am an intern at an elementary school, and we currently run 43 machines on Windows 7 with a custom (fully proprietary :/) 'desktop environment' that looks like Metro. 

However, there are a bunch of PCs that run regular old Windows 7, because they are pretty old (considered low-end in 2007-2009). I told my supervisor that I wanted to try a more suitable and easy to use environment for the kids. They currently prefer to use Android tablets, but I want to encourage use of the PCs as well (because it's  about 1 tablet for 10 children). 

So what I was thinking, a sleek but not too demanding DE/WM that is easy to use, and just have a few desktop icons to the web based programs they will use (Presentation software, search engine etc.).

I had tried a few distros already. Mint Cinnamon ran reasonably well. I even tried Android-x86 for fun and while the interface is really nice and familiar, it was unstable and wasn't a great option.

The hardware we are talking about:

* some Intel Celeron D 325, Celeron 430/440, Pentium E5300

* 1-2GB DDR2 to work with in each machine

* integrated graphics (mostly Intel GMA 3100)

* 40-80GB of storage


So, what would you guys do? I was thinking of something Ubuntu/Mint based, but nothing brilliant has come up in me yet. They will be using keyboards and mice, so touch support is not required at all."

I graduated from top-20 computer science schools in the US (May 2014). I had okayish gpa - 3.54. Unfortunately, I had severe depression during my study, I did not go to lectures a lot and did not study hard. There were even times when I saw my professor for the first time at final exam. But even then, I managed get As and Bs. Did not do any significant side projects. Did not have any internships as well. So, I came to back to my country, worked as developer and 1.5 years later, I want to leave xD.

Fortunately, I think my depression problems are in the past. I feel hungry. I want to learn stuff, build stuff. Never felt that way in the long time. Have some regrets about not being able to use time properly during my study.

However, in my country, cs scene is fucking dead. Low pay, shit jobs. Developers are treated like shit. Economy's going mad as well. Feeling like I get dumber everyday.

I am looking for a job in the US or London, mb Berlin as well. I am not brightest kid around, but with right amout of preparation I think I am ok.

Personally, my top choices are fintech companies like Two - Sigma, Jump trading, Jane Street and etc. But I am not sure whether they even consider internationals.

What companies (besides big-4) are willing to sponsor Visas?
Where should I apply to? ( I have friends that can refer me to Google, Amazon and SIG)
Should I mention in my resume that I need visa sponsorship?
When is the best time to apply?
General tips appreciated as well.

3vxypk,299,2015-12-08,Homophobe put back in his box,PoshSpiceBurger,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3vxypk/homophobe_put_back_in_his_box/,"I can't believe I have never posted this thinking about, I'm quite happy with the outcome but I dont think it belongs in pro - but anyway to the story!

So basically I use to work for this large american financial institute (its worldwide, everyone has heard of them) as an intern and I really did love my job. Its also important to point out I'm a gay and can be a bit camp but that's fine. Anyway I got on with everyone on the team (or so I thought) a part from this one guy - we'll call him CrapBag. CrapBag was a 40 year old something married guy with 3 kids and had the maturity span of a tea spoon - you know the type of guy Im talking about, thinks he's still young, think's he's hilarious but he isn't, loves the attention? Well me and CrapBag absolutely hated each other from the word go. and he made it quite obvious.

CrapBag would offer everyone a sweet except for me OR he would send everyone in the team a funny joke except for me. I didn't really care because I was 20 years old and this guy is older so if he want's to behave like that thats okay! Then things got a little difficult. CrapBag would sort of make these jokes that were about people being gay or making sly innuendos but they were almost toeing on the boarder of offensive, and after he would make them he would quickly look at me with this little smug look on his face for a split second, obviously knowing that he was offending me and being mean but I couldn't do anything about it.

Anyway on one particular day which my boss was working from home, one of my colleagues (we'll call him B-Bag) was telling us how he had been to see a particularly girly movie the night before with his guy friends. Well CrapBag and the guy who sits beside him were questioning why he did something like this? It is simply unacceptable to go to the movies to see a girly movie with your wife or GF, you cannot go to see this type of movie with your friends. So I was sort of like, okay I know what type of conversation this is and where it may be headed... and low and behold a part time employee beside me piped up that he had been spending too much time at the local gay bar. Yep, I definitely knew where this conversation was headed. They continued to discuss how wrong he was for doing this and how as a man you dont go to things like this. The worst part was, was that crap bag had a look on his face that he knew he was being an asshole but his toe hadn't slipped over the line so it was fine.

Revenge Part 

Not 5 minutes after this conversation had ended I received an instant message on our work chat from Crapbag which said ""The *Homophobic Slur* is being awfully quiet today"". Well my mouth hit the floor. I couldn't believe that A) this guy was bitching to someone else on the team about me because I assumed I was nice and quiet and got on with everyone B) that he would refer to me as this character C)How I was going to get him back. The conversation quickly went:
CrapBag: ""Oh sorry I sent you a very cryptic message""
Me:""No, I understand exactly what you're trying to say to me""
CrapBag: ""You don't understand anything""
So, naturally I went straight down to HR. Now my boss hated HR and said that if I ever had a problem speak to him first (which I did, I screenshoted it and sent it to him and explained what was going on and that he had to do something), but I had basically went into a meeting with CrapBag and my Boss on the phone and it had been an hour since the incident occured, I didn't feel comfortable so I went to HR. 

HR were furious needless to say, saying they were sick of the immaturity of my team (not including me, the guys were all dicks to be fair looking back at it) and they demanded to speak to my boss. I said he was at home, I had informed him and lets wait to see what he says before we take action. buuut HR didnt see it that way and got straight on the phone to boss. When I got back to my desk there was a shitty email from my boss basically being like - Oh, sorry that happened, I'll deal with it next week. I was like wtf? 

But then next thing my mobile phone starts ringing and its my boss so it's time to make crapbag crap himself for the first round. 
Boss: Hi PoshSpice
Me: HI *Bosses Name*
Boss: Can you go into the meeting room please?
ME: YOU WANT ME TO GO INTO THE MEETING ROOM? OKAY!
I go into the room and explain to my boss what's happened and he sends me home and that he doesnt want me in that environment and no one should be treated like this (he was a really good guy). Anyway I walk back to my desk and see CrapBag is as white as a ghost and he has completely frozen, well aware of what he has truly done. So I pack up and leave work, and now have basically been told that the fate of his job will depend on me (with the evidence and proof I had against him, plus the fact his chatlogs would be investigated and seeing as he had been bitching about me, it would all be looked at). 

Part of me wanted that guy fired, to make his life an absolute misery, for the pain and all the petty shit he had thrown at me through the year. Even when I came back in the following week CrapBag came out of the meeting room crying his eyes out after speaking to my boss, I knew fine rightly he was just trying to save his skin because he knows what he's done. However, I decided to be the bigger person, and when I was asked what I would like to happen to him, I asked for the lesser charge, and that it be dealt with quietly and nothing happen to him because he had a wife, and kids, and probably a mortgage and I was only an intern, Im only starting my life. But the good/uncomfortable news was that I had 40 year old crap bag crying in my face the next day apologizing for how sorry he was and how mature I was about the whole thing. The rest of the team got told off too because basically the message sent to me was meant for someone else. 

I guess the revenge in it all was making the 40 year old guy worry all weekend he was going to lose his job because he knew what he had been doing and saying was wrong and thought he could get away with it until he accidentally slipped up and sent a gay message to me. And I was 20.

TL;DR : Guy picked on me for months for being gay, slips up, I make him think he will lose his job, but decide not to.

UPDATE - Just wanted to say thank you all so much for the lovely comments, haven't read one bad one yet! I just want to add a few things - My boss sadly left the company about 6 months after this event and my internship was a year long so I only had 2 months to go. CrapBag and another guy were also given redundancy packages when my boss left - the company still exists its just it was taken over by another company and the bigger company had a bigger and better team so they took our information and files and were kind of like seeya later! As for the company, I say they reacted quite quickly in the situation because of how much damage could have been done to their name had I have really escalated this situation - equality laws are a very serious matter.

 I don't know what CrapBag or the rest of the guys in the team do now - and I don't really want to - after what happened I never fully trusted them again and there was a few instances where they tried to toe the line again and my boss quickly put them firmly back where they belonged. Those guys aren't professional's sadly and I guess its the nature of the country I come from for them to behave the way they do (it can be backward sometimes). The only one I keep in touch with every so often is my boss, he was a really decent guy.

I also have to say that when I had that weekend to make up my mind of what I was going to do, I did quite enjoy it, because finally I had a bit of power over CrapBag and he was well aware someone 20 years younger than him had his fate in his big gay hands!"

* Graduated in 2013 with CS degree (most internships want December 2015 graduates or later)

* Worked for a backwards company that employed an old AIX system and Server 2003 (no powershell, still practicing it in my own time though).  Was pretty cool, I got to research a lot of different things and carved out a quasi-SysAdmin role there.  But it's definitely not industry standard SysAdmin.

* Studying Puppet, Chef, and Ansible in my own time (mostly the learning VMs for now, if anyone has any practice projects they recommond I look at, let me know!)

* Practicing Python and Ruby daily to make sure I don't lose the syntax

One of the biggest employers in the country. Their internship program is so big they actually house their interns in (fairly nice) apartment complexes. Along with this internship there are some...oddly strict rules. In a previous post on here I mentioned how one night I sleepwalked and ended up peeing on my roommate. Well, my roommate ended up reporting me to security. Not to get me fired, but he just wanted things to get sorted out properly. He even stated in writing he didn't want me to receive a punishment, he just wanted to talk it out.

Well, I ended up getting fired anyway. Never mind that I was sleepwalking and had absolutely no control over my actions. Never mind that I sought counseling immediately after. Never mind that sleepwalking runs in my family especially after times of high stress. Never mind that none of us wanted to be fired over this. Never mind that in any other circumstance the victim would have some say in the punishment of the perpetrator. They fired me anyway. Company policy.

I feel like my life is over. I've worked my whole life towards working for this place ever since I was a child. It was my dream job, and I had it. And now I have nothing. All because of something I couldn't even control. I don't know what to do. I have 24 hours to vacate the premises. My life is over, and honestly I told my parents they might need to hospitalize me because I may do something stupid to myself. Literally. I'm never gonna get hired anywhere again. Who the fuck wants to hire someone who gets fired? Nobody. I fucked up my entire life and now I'm fucking worthless trash. It's not fucking fair. I'm a good person. This shit shouldn't be happening to me. Even worse my home back home got destroyed so right now my family is living in a hotel in chicago while repairs are being made so I literally don't have a home right now. Why the fuck is this happening to me. I honestly wish I was dead and I fully intend to be soon."

I'm currently a sophomore at Berkeley, studying CS. This summer through Berkeley's Huang Program I have the opportunity to study Chinese intensively at Beijing. The following fall/spring semester, I'll have to take fourth-year Chinese (effectively fluent by then). The following summer, I'll get a lot of help to secure an internship in CS, but in China. 

As far as opportunities go, how does this one sound on a resume? I actually don't know, but it seems to me that doing CS internships in America looks better than doing CS internships in China. 

I don't think I'll ever get a shot at the Big Four (I still don't have any personal projects), and I don't have anything lined up this summer or next otherwise. But I'm worried that locking my summer-after-junior-year into a CS internship in China will prevent me from some better CS internships in America down the line. 

If this changes anything: I do have Chinese heritage (but obviously not fluent, growing up in America), female, and have a Vietnamese last name. The Chinese internship will probably be very low or no pay."

3vz5n6,1,2015-12-08,Advice on how to proceed with my job search (consulting vs software development)?,abacona,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vz5n6/advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_my_job_search/,"Hello,

Recently I've received a few job offers to pursue computer-science careers that aren't perfect matches for me.

My long-term goal has always been to work as higher management at a tech startup or even own one one day.

The FT offers I've received were:
1) in an IT back office for a large industrial engineering firm that I interned at this summer (I declined)
1) technical consultant at a cloud solutions startup that is expected to IPO/be acquired in a few years (still deciding).

My dream job is to work as a mobile developer at a startup after graduation, however I have only just begun Android mobile development this year (first relatively simple app idea is currently nearing completion). 

Luckily, I have worked at a small startup as an Android development intern, but my experience there was largely UI/UX consulting, testing for usability/functionality suggestions, and some basic web work that ultimately wasn't used. However, my Android developing skills are developing quickly and I feel like I'll soon be able to spin that experience as more of a role involved in development (I can talk about the concepts that were going way over my head during my time there, since I will now have the experience and knowledge to back it up).

Side note: I was let go from the Android development role due to their size and my lack of experience at the time (this was in 2014/early 2015). I haven't included this experience in my resume/linkedin, but plan on adding it now that my Android development skills have gotten stronger.

My question is this- do I have a chance of getting a mobile development position by graduation, or should I be happy with my job offer for the time being? Should I focus on gaining more experience before I try for a more technical role? My soft skills are very strong, and I'm being offered more salary than most CS graduates in my department, but the location isn't in the Bay area (something that is also important to me).

I haven't prepared for technical interviews etc at all, because I was honestly pretty naive about the whole job search for CS students. I stupidly thought that I would be able to easily land a mobile development position. I recently had a technical interview with a financial software firm (data engineering role) and didn't advance because I had no idea how technical interviews were conducted, and what I was being evaluated on. It was a wake-up call to say the least. Should I keep trying with other firms, or should I focus on building skills?

Here are my qualifications:

top 50 liberal arts university in midwest usa (CS major)
3.15 cum gpa
3.25 major gpa

Professional experience:

-ID tech camp CS instructor @ Stanford (summer 2014)

3vz8yx,2,2015-12-08,Can I pick your brain about undergrad research internships?,Butter_Flyer,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/3vz8yx/can_i_pick_your_brain_about_undergrad_research/,"Hi guys, 

I'm an international Life Sciences - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology student in the Netherlands (applied sciences bachelor, focused on research). About 1 year ago my family relocated to San Jose, California, but I stayed behind in order to finish my classes and will be heading to US by the end of January to stay. In order to graduate, I need to complete 2 different research internship placements (each 6 months long), where I need to be in charge of some side project for some current research the lab is doing.

Here in the Netherlands, my bachelor program has a very good reputation and the research labs actually line up to take us, because of our extensive practical skills. However, I need to get back to my family and my uni gave me the ""go ahead"", so I can get my internships done there. The problem I'm facing is the following: I've sent several applications to research labs in the area where we live, but have never heard back from any of them.

I have a good resume with my qualifications, also description of all the research projects I've worked on the past 3 years (lots of practical experience). I've made individual motivation letters to each one of the applications (yes, I actually took the time to read on their research and all), but I never heard back from anyone. 

I was wondering if there is a special way to apply for internships in the US and if yes, how I can improve my chances? I'm not American, but have an L-2 visa, which allows me to study and work without issues. I have accomplished a lot in my studies and I'm in this for the science. 

It is a bit frustrating not to be able to reach out to people, when I'm so eager to collaborate. I don't know if I'm breaking some basic ettiquete rule by the way I'm applying or if they simply have no interest in international undergrads. I like to think that they are just too busy making amazing discoveries and had no time to read my email.

I'm ready to start in February, but have nothing in sight. I'm slowly starting to freak out. Is there any tip you could give me?

So I am currently a 17 year old in Minnesota, specifically Hennepin county. I was driving from school to my internship when after going down a straight shot of road and then turning right I was stopped by an officer.

I drive another intern so she was in my passenger seat.  The cop approached me from the passenger window and asked why I was going 45 in a 30 mph zone. At this point I was confused, at no point did I feel like I was recklessly driving and I definitely don't believe I was going 45 miles and hour, not to mention there was a hill on the way to the stoplight. Anyways, I responded saying ""I was on my way to work"" she then asked for my licence and insurance which I pulled out and gave to her. Then she returned with a ticket for reckless driving and asked if I had any questions. I said no and went on my way. I felt that I was polite the whole time, I did not argue and I gave her everything she asked for. I would of maybe tried to smile and be a bit more friendly but I was so confused.

I really don't want a reckless driving on my record, I felt that I was in control of the car and that my speed was also due to the incline I was traveling down.

When she asked why I was going so fast and I responded that I was on my way to work.. Did I admit guilt?

This is also my first traffic violation, I want to fight this and I am not sure what steps to take.

This whole thing is stressing me out and I appreciate any help I can get. Thanks."

I had originally transferred from community college with a mathematics associates, and finished Calc I - III, but now that I'm in my first semester of a 4 year university, I decided that I would take 3 math courses in one semester, One being Theory of Combinatorics, and the other Math Theory of probability. I have bombed all quizzes and tests in both of these classes. Just today I got a zero, a fucking zero on my combinatorics quiz. I just can't wrap my head around the type of thinking that is involved in this type of branch of math, in addition with the probability course, I'm starting to understand the material as finals approach, but I know I fucked up the second mid term I just know it. I was hoping I could bang out my math minor within this semester, because If I pass these three classes, then I complete my math minor. I study for hours, just staring at a problem, then I have no clue how to approach, then I have to look at the solution (I KNOW THIS IS NOT GOOD), then I understand the work, but to come to the conclusion on approaching the problem in that certain matter would have never popped into my head. Afterwards I just feel like an idiot for looking at the solution and try to move onto another problem.

I just feel depressed and incompetent and just feel that I'm not going to be a good programmer if I can't even learn these two classes. I'm in classes where I just feel like everyone is a god damn genius and if they knew how to program, they'd be ten times better than me. If I can't even learn combinatorics, how am I going to make fucking efficient algorithms for programs? I really don't want to be a mediocre programmer, but the thought of failing these two classes, just makes it seem that will be the case.

Finals are in a week, and I have another quiz on thursday in combinatorics that will reflect what will be on the final. I don't want to give up, but it's just so fucking hard seeing an awful grade after trying to understand something for hours.

I'm worried that I won't be able to get an internship if I fail these two classes. I had an internship before, but had to go to the four year university, so I had to leave that internship after a year of working there as a programmer.

Do I even have a shot at applying at Google, Amazon, etc...?

3vzvih,4,2015-12-08,I need help moving forwards in my life.,ReyAzulejos,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/3vzvih/i_need_help_moving_forwards_in_my_life/,"Hi, I would be incredibly appreciative if you would take the time to look over my situation.

**Background**

* I am 21 years old. 

* Senior at Vanderbilt University (#15 in the nation)

* First to go to college in my family.

* Born in US. Parents from Mexico.

* As of writing this, I have not applied anywhere. I know, terrible. This is what my winter break will be.

* Majoring in Economics

*  Minoring in Corporate Strategy (things like marketing, accounting, entrepreneurship)

* Minoring in Spanish. 

* I plan to graduate May 2016.

* President and founder of my own organization, focuses on social dance instruction.
* Musically talented- play a few instruments, most notably the button accordion which ties me back to my Mexican heritage.
* Part of Vanderbilt’s team in a national competition for Credit Karma. We did not win :(
* I came in pre-med, got a few D's and F's in science classes so I switched to econ.

**Stats**

* My overall GPA upon graduation will be around 2.6, maybe as high as 2.8 as I have been doing much better in my classes this semester. 

* My econ GPA will be in the 2.1-2.4 range

* My corporate strategy 3.6-3.8

* My Spanish GPA in the 3.5-3.8 range.

I have work experience (about 2 years on and off, 2 summers but this can be fudged because I do some work remotely) with a small company run by a family friend. I was literally the only employee besides the founder and excelled at everything I was asked to do there. I have a glowing recommendation from her and an offer to come back after I graduate. I explain the problem with this later on. I put all her ecommerce stuff in place, the website, design, etc if that helps my case.

I can also get great recommendations from my Corporate Strategy and Spanish professors as these are the areas where I do the best and enjoy the most.

My parents are incredibly supportive and money is not much of an issue. Although we are not rich, our family has not even noticed any significant hit due to Vanderbilt's incredible financial aid. Moving forward, I estimate I have around $60k (not including any money from me actually working) for an MBA, MS, or whatever I can do as long as it furthers my career and isn't frivolous spending.

**Problem: I feel lost and like no noteworthy company could want me straight out of college due to my low GPA.**

Everywhere I look, companies list their required minimum GPA at 3.0 to even be considered as an applicant. 

I don't have any internship under my belt for the same reason; I did the summer job at the tiny company instead.


**But I already have a job offer right?** 

The problem is that the family friend's company is exceedingly small (it's just her and I with seasonally another worker), and she can barely afford to pay me $10 an hour for the short hours I work there. 

* This does not seem like a good choice to me because I do not see it furthering me in a real career. My parents agree. They want me to further my education.

* Most likely I would make around $250 a week if I did this. 

* I would live with my parents rent free. Which is great.

* I would do many small part-time jobs at making about an average of $50 per day. This would be taken care of by my dad, who has many lined up.

* Taking this road, I estimate I could pull off making $30k a year. But this isn’t about the money, it’s about my career.


**So...**

I want to further my education. What does that mean to me? Here are 2 paths I can think of:

* **Become a CPA- I know this sub isn’t about this, so just disregard if it doesn’t contribute to anything**

 * Go home once I graduate.

 * Take online courses while I work at the small company.

 * Pass CPA exam.

* **Get an MBA- this is what I see myself ideally doing, although I am not dead-set on it before I hear as much advice as I can.**

 * Go home once I graduate.

 * Work at the small company for 2ish years. Not sure how ""worthwhile"" or ""legitimate"" this kind of job would look to schools/employers.

 * Study extensively for relevant exams. 

     * Price for preparation, even if it's $20k-$30k, should not a limiting factor in this regard.
     * I understand this may be a very high estimate, but I am willing to invest everything I make into getting into school as are my parents. If a more realistic price is something like $1k, thats great too.

 * Take relevant business school exams.

 * Get into school, earn an MBA.

**My questions:**

* Is getting into a business school still realistic for me?

 * If so, is getting into a top school still realistic for me?

 * If not, what can I do to better my chances? Or is this path over for me?

* Now disregard my ""preferred"" path of an MBA. My friends are getting jobs at companies like Deloitte, Sachs, large banks, etc. I understand those are not realistic for me right after college. From your experience, what can I do to climb back to the level I fell from?

* What other advice do you have for me?

* Can you lay out some realistic paths for me and/or adjust my proposed paths to better reflect reality?

* Longshot- Do you know of any jobs that would take a chance with someone like me? Anywhere in the US is fair game for me as long as it is beneficial to getting me back on the right path. 

**Thank you SO SO much for any input you may have. Let me know if there is any other info I can provide to better aid your insight.**

After school, I was employed in a large research institution managing grants. After a few months, I learned the job and quickly became bored. That’s when I started to search for my true calling.

I took a biopsych course since I loved the courses I took in college, but realized that it didn’t interest me as much. Thinking that maybe I could use my heal policy degree for something, I decided to apply for health policy doctoral programs even though they sounded really boring. I applied to a few programs, but was not accepted into any of the three schools to which I applied – thank God. So the search continued…

I’ve always liked architecture, so I tried that route. I took an architecture course at a local community college and really enjoyed it. I decided to apply for architecture master’s degree programs in the area and re-took the GREs to get a better score, took a drawing class at the same local community college to fulfill the prerequisites of the masters programs, put the required portfolio together for the application, obtained letters of recommendations, and applied. I was accepted to two of the three programs to which I applied. However, I talked with a few architects before informing the Universities of my decision to attend, and decided that the profession was a little different than what I had imagined. I turned down the two offers and decided to keep searching…

Another thing I’ve always loved is food. I gained weight when I started working after college, I learned how to cook and found joy in managing my diet. The wealth of knowledge I’ve gained learning how to maintain my health has been an amazing experience. I get questioned all the time about my eating habits and I truly enjoy talking about what I eat and how I maintain my weight with others. Realizing this, I took a nutrition class at the same community college as before and found my calling. Ever since taking the class, I’ve been trying to figure out how to become a nutritionist. I would love to work with the community and reach individuals who may not have access to a nutritionist.

Ideally, I’d love to quit my job and go to school full time. I don’t have a family right now, but I have about $80k in loans from college (which I’m aggressively paying down) and two dogs – one of whom is sick and requires that I have some sort of income. I’ve done well in my current job. I’ve been promoted several times and was recently recruited by my current boss to come work with him. My current boss is great, but I am drained when I get home leaving very little time for studying. I’m officially on the path to entering one of the two accredited online nutrition programs, and although, my current job pays well, I still cannot afford the cost of the classes in addition to my loan payments ($1,100/mo.) and other living expenses. I therefore cannot take more than one class at a time and it will take years before I am able to complete the classes I need to get into a dietetic internship.

I considered going to Canada for cheaper tuition and taking out more loans to cover additional expenses, but I don’t know if that’s the best idea. Also, foreign nutrition certifications may not transfer back to the US. I’ve finally figured out what I want to do with my life, but I don’t know how to make it a reality. Any suggestions?

We've been long distance since August for school, but we're both taking breaks from school, and living back at home (her for an internship and I got a very good job opportunity) come January.

So, onto the issue. When it comes to my politics,  I am very much a moderate, with views all across the board. Typically I won't talk about my views, unless it is on a specific subject I am vocal about. My SO, on the other hand is a hardcore libertarian, bumper stickers and all. She is very vocal both in person, and on social media about her views. 

She frequently goes on long rants about taxes, and gun control, and other topics, not really letting me get a word in, and when I do she treats me like I don't know what I'm talking about. And the few times I've tried to talk to her about it, she pulls back and is hurt.

It feels like I'm talking to a different person once politics come up in conversation, and I really don't like that person so much. I do love my SO, and could see things going long term, but this has been bothering me recently.

**TL;DR: My SO can get severe when talking politics, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.**

As I get closer and closer to graduating college (2 semesters left) I feel like I'm slipping further and further down a rabbit hole I don't know how to get out of. I had an awesome internship this past summer and as interesting as it was, it made me realize that no matter how much I love my area of study, it's not what I want to do for my life and I feel like I've been wasting my time and feel ashamed about wasting my parents investment. This compounded with the fact that I have no idea what I'm doing after I graduate and I've started to get into a funk that feels like depression. 

I spend more and more time zoned out, I'm enjoying some of my favorite hobbies less and less and the nail in the coffin is that social interaction is more and more taxing, which hurts since I'm usually really outgoing and I hate being alone. 

Usually I'd turn to a friend to talk to but I've kind of taken on the role of the sounding board for my friend group since I'm one of the oldest members and have a lot of experience. Don't get me wrong, I love helping others, but it's frustrating since I really don't want to put my burdens on them since they have a lot on their own plates. 

I really wish I had somewhere to turn because I have a history of suicidal tendencies and I don't want to go back down that road. I know I should just reach out and they'll be happy to help and I know I should get some professional help. Maybe I'm just stubborn but it feels good to put this out there and get it off my chest.

I'm a goddamn fighter, I came back from being paralyzed when the doctors told me I'd be lucky to get out in a wheelchair (I was 14 at the time). I discovered girls soon after, and going from football and lacrosse to a hospital bed didn't do much for my figure. I wanted to ask a girl out, but I wasn't confident enough, so I dropped from 210 to 155 post stroke.

Long story short I asked her to junior prom, she said yes, I found out it was a pity date by the end of the night.

So I fight harder. I do more extracurriculars, I join student governance, I graduate, I go to college, I leave a trail of rejection behind me. I do the same thing in colege, extracurriculars in all my spare time, different student and greek governance boards, rise quickly to the top, get rejected through the years. Finally I get a girlfriend off campus. Solid 8/10 and 4'8"". Heights not a problem, strokes not a problem, and I'm not balding yet. Constantly complains how her ex was jacked and I'm not. So I dumped her and hit the gym because I'm not going to spend everyday being reminded how she settled for me.

Now here I am a year later, close to finishing my degree, struggling through SS because half my body is fucked up because I came back from the stroke but never fully recovered and I wasted 6 months doing Bro-splits, sitting on top of the world leading organizations, on governance boards, working paid internships and having to turn down job offers from recruiters.

And  I feel like a piece of shit.

I'm balding so badly at 22 that I just shave my head, when I should take pride in my recovery I just try to hide it, and I know I've been eliminated from half the dating pool because of my size. I can achieve any and everything so long as that's not a woman.

Maybe it gets to me because it's the one thing I can't win at, maybe it's because I finally found something that is impossible for me to overcome. No matter how hard I fight, I can't be taller, I can't have more hair, and I can't be less crippled."

I am a 3rd year in-state student majoring in Management Information Systems. I will be graduating with ~40K debt. That is not my concern. I will be handling that once I am finished with school. 

I am trying to get credit-debt free. I was paying down my cards until my car died and I had to buy a new one. I bought a reasonable car (02 Saturn Vue 82K miles previously owned and well-taken care of by an elderly lady) for 2K in cash. I am also taking steps to reduce my bills. I split utilities with my roommate, so here is a breakdown of my expenses: 

- Internet - 30$ month
- Electricity/gas - between 30-40 a month 
- Rent - $500 a month (prepaid 6 months at a time with my financial aid) 
- Food - I don't have a budget, but roughly 100$ a month groceries and maybe 100 eating out with my girlfriend

I am trying to cook more at home, and I am trying to find a cheaper place to live next school year to save more money. 

I currently work at Best Buy part time, and have been interviewing for second part time job. I would like to make ~ 200/ a week (I currently make 11.50/hour at Best Buy and would try to negotiate to that at the second job) 

I also will be working full-time somewhere this summer as I have the past few years. I am currently looking at a number of technical internships, and as I made 15/hour last summer, I hope to make at least 17/hr this summer. 

Here is the challenge: 

-CC#1: Maxed out 750$, 24% APR, minimum payment 45$
- CC#2: Maxed out, $2450, 21% APR, Minimum Payment 57$

The last few months have been different. I'm currently finishing up my first semester in Computer Science at a decent (but not relatively renowned) regional school in the Northeast, and, provided I do decently on my finals, on track to receive at least a 3.8 GPA for the semester, if not higher. I'm hoping I can keep this up for the spring semester. I'm also applying for summer internships at the moment, and hopefully I should be able to secure one in my field.

My question is: will this be enough? I'm afraid that the more prestigious schools will take one look at my high school GPA and throw my application into the fire, without even considering all the hard work I've been putting in since August. 

Realistically, where can I look as to top-tier universities for CS that will give my application at least a fighting chance?"
3w0hzl,3,2015-12-08,"Me [22 F] with my sister [25 F], she has bought me a more expensive gift, but I don't really have the means to return the favor.",Strugglebus_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3w0hzl/me_22_f_with_my_sister_25_f_she_has_bought_me_a/,"So I'm a recent college grad who has yet to land a full-time job, AKA, I'm pretty strapped for cash right now, especially because I might be moving soon to take an internship in a city with pretty expensive rent, so I'd like to save as much as I can before then. (Note: This post isn't for anyone to give me advice on how to save money or deal with my financial issues, I have enough money saved, just am in a place where I don't really want to spend a lot on unexpected things.)

My sister has had a full-time job for the past 3 years, and has saved up a good amount of cash, as she is a smart spender and a hard worker.  She is now in grad school (where, luckily, most of her expenses are paid for because she is extremely smart), and in the past two months has landed two part-time jobs.  She's basically killin it!  One of her jobs is a high-end clothing store that is adored by many, and she gets an awesome discount.  She recently bought a jacket from there, but said after trying it on again, she realized it didn't fit her well (they take the tags off after an employee makes a purchase), so she told me to try it on in the store and see if I liked it.  I tried it on and it fit really well (luckily her and I are the same size up top), and I told her i loved it!  She said that she would keep that in mind, and I think there was a winky face in there somewhere.  Basically, I think she's giving it to me for Christmas.  

The only thing is, even with her discount, the jacket is about $100.  My sister and I always exchange gifts for Christmas, but normally we decide the price range after one of us purchases a gift for the other.  For instance, if I find a $40 ticket to a show that I know she will love, I will say ""I spent $40 on you, so let's do $40 each this Christmas"".  We like to keep things even and it normally works out really well.

I guess my question here is, what do you guys think I could do that would be equivalent to spending $100 without actually...spending $100?  I want to maybe make her something that she will get good use out of, or get her something special, so it doesn't seem like I'm letting her spoil me and half-assing it on her.  If I had to spend $100, I would, but I'd like to avoid shelling out so much cash! And she also hasn't given me a lot of ideas on what to get her, so I think that finding $100 worth of things to get her would just end with me buying a $50 Anthropologie giftcard on top of some other gift, and then calling it a day.

I should also add that for my graduation, she gave me a very nice and unexpected gift; a hefty giftcard to a nicer clothing store so I could buy interview clothing, a nice notebook with my initials inscribed on the front, and a beautiful scarf.  I could tell she didn't expect anything in return for her sweet gifts, and that she was happy to give them.  I guess this just adds on that I don't think she would be mad if I were to not spend $100 on her, as long as I gave a heartfelt gift.

So finally, these are my questions to you:
1. What are some gifts that I could make for my sister/have you guys done anything that I could put a creative spin on that my sister would love?
and 
2. If you're an older sibling who has a good relationship with their younger sibling, how would you feel toward the situation?  

I dont think my sister will feel upset either way, as she is not just doing this for me so that she will get an expensive gift in return. Just looking for some ideas and advice.  Thanks!

Oh and also, I haven't really asked her about our spending limit yes, as we are talking on the phone tonight, but even if she says ""you don't have to spend $100 on me!"" I would like to give her a nice present. :)

TL;DR- My sister is more well-off than I am, mostly due to her being older, and is likely giving me an expensive Christmas gift.  Looking for ideas of things to get her/make for her that are special and creative to match an expensive gift."

3w13ls,1,2015-12-08,How to Get Interviews?,dzdizzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w13ls/how_to_get_interviews/,"Hello Reddit!

Here's my situation. I'd like to get an internship with a decently sized company this summer.

I went to my school's career fair and met with the Big 4, gave the recruiters my resumes, chatted and whatnot. I was told to apply online, but most of them did end up taking my resume as well (to ""put in the applicant pile"").

I ended up getting interviews from two of the big four. Though I sadly didn't get an offer from either (need some improvement there, I guess :) ), I'm encouraged by the fact that they even decided to interview me at all after looking at my resume.

Now, I also talked to some of the larger companies at the career fair that weren't Big 4, but still well known. Intel, IBM, Oracle, and the like. These companies all asked me to apply online, which I promptly did. That was back in September, and I really haven't heard back from most of them. Logging into IBM, for example, I can see that all of my applications are ""pending"". The same with HP, Motorola, and everything else. I've maybe gotten one or two rejections out of the dozens of companies I've applied online to, but I seem to be stuck in application limbo for the rest.

Here's the thing - I know that it's quite common for applications to be ignored in the CS field. Last year, I might've just chalked it up to none of them wanting me as an intern and me not being good enough. But this year, that theory just doesn't seem to make as much sense. Companies from the Big 4, known to be highly competitive for CS, are giving me interviews, and even spending thousands on airplane tickets for my on-sites, and yet I don't receive so much as an email from literally anyone else? I feel more like I'm stuck in application limbo from my online apps than I am being purposely ignored.

Is it possible that the Big 4 will give me interviews, while I get ignored by pretty much every other large company out there (Epic, IBM, VMware, Motorola, Lockheed Martin, etc...)? Was it because the recruiters for the Big 4 companies actually took my resume, while all the others told me to apply online? How can I get myself ""unstuck"" from limbo?

I'm not trying to humblebrag or anything, but I'm fairly confident that if I can get to the final round of Big 4 interviews, I should be able to secure an offer from a large company that has a lower hiring bar. It just feels like I'm not getting noticed by them, which is really confusing for me.

Any tips to get out of this hole? "
3w13mw,2,2015-12-08,My Success Story - Recent Civil Engineer Grad Changing Jobs,iwantashinyarcanine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3w13mw/my_success_story_recent_civil_engineer_grad/,"TLDR: 1. Network, Network, Network. 
2. If you already have a job, you can be picky when you are trying to switch - believe me. 

I wanted to share my story about changing jobs a year and a half after graduation. I really felt I needed to share because this sub helped through my frustrations and my triumph.

Background:

I graduated with a Civil Engineering Degree from a program in British Columbia in May 2014. The December before I graduated my friend working for a heavy civil construction company gave me a call saying they wanted a recent civil engineering grad. Sent in my resume on the Thursday, interview Saturday, job offer Monday. I was happy as hell because I had a job lined up as soon as I graduated plus they offered me much more than I was expecting as a starting salary.

When I started working, I immediately was shipped out of town onto a project where I worked a 12 and 2 rotation, working around 13 hour days. The money was amazing, but the work was mindless, the crew was enjoyed belittling me, and ultimately, the owners of the company enjoyed tearing me a new one any chance they could get. Really, I was lied to about my role and felt that the long term career projection was not taking me anywhere. So i decided to switch.

The Search:
About Mid-August 2015, I had an exceptionally bad day at work. Bad enough that when I got back to my rental suite that evening, I dug up my resume and started polishing it up and began my search. That evening, I decided that I would only apply for jobs that I truly felt was a good fit for me. Having a job that at least made ends meet while getting me a decent skill set allowed me to be exceptionally choosey about jobs I applied for. Most jobs that i pursued were what I honestly thought would be a good fit for me. Being honest about where I wanted me career to go and where I saw myself in 1-5 years allowed me to hone in on companies and roles. 

I used APEGBC (engineering regulatory body) for a good job listing data base to give me an idea of jobs coming out. I cant speak for other fields, but if there is a regulatory body or an association that companies have to sign up for can give you a good list of companies in the field that you are interested in.

My Statistics:
Job Applications: 6
Job Interview: 2
Job Offer: 1

Like I said, extremely picky. That averages a little under two applications each month when I was actively looking. Essentially, I had to sift through jobs that I knew were not a good fit for me and find the ones that I felt I was a strong candidate.

The Networking:
A lot of people are going to sigh when I say this, but both companies where I received an interviews were from someone in my network who was willing to refer me for the position. One I met through volunteering during school (something I highly recommend) and one was a classmate from my program. Going even farther back, I received my first job after graduation through a referral through a friend (used to play football with him) and my summer internships I got through a referral through my uncle (both of which were at professional firms directly related to my degree).

Point is: everybody has a network. You just have to dig through it sometimes to find the connections. 

The Interviews:
I don't have too much magic in regards to my interviews. Make sure you come in dressed to impress, confident, knowledgeable about the position etc etc. One thing I felt really helps is being able to have a good concise summary of your employment history. Both interviews asked me to give them a play by play of my two previous professional jobs and it was something at the first interview that I felt I did poorly.

I am not an expert but that was just my experience and a couple of tips to help contribute to the community that helped me so much. Feel free to pm me or comment if you have questions and I can try and answer them!

3w15x3,4,2015-12-08,Chatrealmer's Ridiculously Unofficial Movie Draft Update Memo (CRUMDUM) - Week 10 - Mid-Season Report,MovieLeagueMike,DiamondClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondClub/comments/3w15x3/chatrealmers_ridiculously_unofficial_movie_draft/,"**CRUMDUM Week 10 - Mid-Season Report**

&amp;nbsp;

Gotcha!

We bet you all fell for that prank ""Pre-Season Predictions"" CRUMDUM. Classic CRUMDUM staff hijinks, pretending we didn't know who was actually going to win! We wish we could see your faces now! Whoo-boy!

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, fun's fun, but let's see how it's really going to play out.

&amp;nbsp;

The midpoint of the Movie Draft season is the time when we here at the CRUMDUM traditionally send an intern over to the faded army-green, dented, four-drawer metal filing cabinet to retrieve the ""W"" folder from the bottom drawer, which contains everything we file under ""What Were We Thinking?"", like the set of iron-on t-shirt transfers reading *Super Bowl Champion Cleveland Browns*, the other t-shirt transfers reading *Cleveland Browns: 8-8 Isn't So Bad*, and the Movie Draft Pre-Season Predictions.

Then the intern comes back empty-handed, and we all remember that in a move to efficiency, we started printing the pre-season predictions and walking them directly to the shredder. This year though, some high-energy, real go-getter intern actually backed up the pre-season data from the office computer. Not sure where he picked up that skill, as none of us on staff has bothered to learn how it's done. The last thing we cared about enough to back up was our game progress in *Zork*, and a lot of good that did us, because by the time we had finally gotten to the second Mirror Room, they stopped putting floppy drives on PCs.

Anyhow...

The film industry is going through what insiders call a BOL stretch (for ""Browns Offensive Line"" because so few movies are creating decent openings). Everyone in the Movie Draft (save one abstainer) has been affected by, if not an outright bomb, a disappointing entry on their slate. In that respect, it appears that Brian's *War Games* strategy to this point is the right one: the only way to win is not to play. In the long run, though, while that may be fine in Global Thermonuclear War, the Movie Draft requires that you eventually do play, and Brian enters the fray very soon.

But this overall dearth of big movies makes our mid-season job quite a bit easier. We're actually somewhat *confident (!)* about the general order of finish, although the only question that really matters is still in doubt.

&amp;nbsp;

**Justin - Now: 5th Place ($110M) - Pre-Season Prediction: 6th Place ($425M) - Updated Prediction: 6th Place ($317M) Slate Killer^1: Steve Jobs**
If the Movie Draft was played in halves, Justin would be in decent shape for the second-half crown with *Creed* and *Krampus* (okay, and if Brian got only 37.5% of *Star Wars*). But *Krampus*, with its $16M opening weekend, looks to not only be the buy of the season, but very possibly the best purchase in the history of the game. At a cost of $2 and a likely take of $50M, it would reach a stratospheric *25x multiplier!* When Team Amtrekker (remember them?) won the 2014 Summer Movie Draft thanks in large part to *The Fault in Our Stars* and its 21x multiplier, that looked like an untouchable mark. *Krampus* is not only a great movie title, but also the best two dollars ever spent in the game.

It is not a split season, however, and the albatrosses (albatreese? -tri?) of *Steve Jobs* and *The 33* look to leave Justin anchored to the bottom of the standings.

&amp;nbsp;

**Kristi - Now: 3rd ($232M) - Pre-Season: 4th ($555M) - Updated: 5th ($348M) - Killer: Hunger Games**
How long have we been gone? Step away for two-and-a-half weeks and it looks like we missed two-and-a-half months. Last time we checked in, Kristi had both earned and spent zero dollars. Now she's got over $200M in the bank, and spent all but $15, and by next week she'll have spent it all. If nothing else, that *is* the true spirit of the holidays, to spend all your money in a three week stretch around Thanksgiving.

While it's tough to call something that earns $200M in a couple weeks the killer of your chances, *Mockingjay - Part 2* is 12% behind Part 1, the previous low-earner of the series, and looks like it will top out around $275M, or $100M below our prediction. *Harry Potterstein* didn't do her any favors, either. But, if nothing else, she can keep *Jurassic World* and *Minions* on constant rotation and reminisce about her sweet summer success.

&amp;nbsp;

**Brian I - Now: 4th ($138M) - Pre-Season: 5th ($550) - Updated: 4th ($406M) - Killer: Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocolypse**
Damn, we wanted *Scout's Guide* to be good. Its 44% Rotten Tomatoes grade is probably just high enough that we'll make time for it on Netflix, but it got bit (ha!) by Paramount's early Video On Demand plan which cost it half its theaters.

If there were bonuses for Oscar nominations, Brian would probably be in the thick of things, with a possible four nominees on his slate--*Bridge of Spies* and his Christmas Day trio of *Joy, The Hateful Eight, and The Revenant*. We think those holiday hopefuls will just about triple his current score, pushing him past $400M and keeping him in fourth place.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mulango - Now: 2nd ($315M) - Pre-Season: 1st ($720M) - Updated: 3rd ($480M) - Killer: Paranormal Activia 6: Yogurt of Doom**
Mulango started out well with *The Martian*, on pace for $230M, right on the verge of an 8x multiplier, excellent in the winter draft. But then came *Paranormal Activity 6: The Ghost Detention*^2, which brought him back to earth, as it were. *PA6* saved its biggest scares for when Mulango checked weekly box office results.

And then the unthinkable happened. *The Good Dinosaur*, a *Pixar* movie, opened to only $55M over a holiday weekend, then dropped a Pixar record 61% in its second week. Nobody saw that coming. At a cost to Mulango of only $20, it definitely won't be a flop, but hopes were so much higher. If *The Big Short* or *The Fifth Wave* over-perform, Mulango could still crack $500M. We see him finishing in the top three, but can no longer predict a championship repeat.

&amp;nbsp;

We've been wrong before. Pretty often, it turns out. But we feel pretty good about those four projections. The last two get dicey.

&amp;nbsp;

In last place, over $100M behind the nearest competitor, Brian B has had the least stressful season to this point. No movies released, nothing to care about. No worries over the early Thursday shows, opening day Friday results, what they indicate for the weekend, how my other movies are holding--none of that. No real reason to look at box office numbers at all, or even read the CRUMDUM (apart from its refined entertainment value, of course).

But now things change. We *have* been looking across the web at numerous projections for all the remaining movies, and we're now convinced that Brian's hopes for a WMD championship could very well be significantly influenced by how well his next movie does.

So *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is going to be big. Probably historically big. It will at least *double* the best December opening ever ($85M - *The Hobbit*) and could very well have the best opening ever ($209M - *Jurassic World*). Some are calling for $300M. And it looks like weather will be cooperating (60 degrees here in winter vacation destination Cleveland, Ohio). And all real competition has cleared out a month in either direction.

But... we can't help thinking holiday commitments will stunt rabid repeat viewing from the generation that grew up with Han, Luke, and Leia. We say it barely misses a $200M opening weekend, it *does* break *Avatar*'s all-time record of $761M, but not soon enough. If this were the Summer Movie Draft, we think the numbers would come faster and we'd go with Brian. But...

&amp;nbsp;

**Brian B - Now: 6th ($0) - Pre-Season: 3rd ($580) - Updated: 2nd ($580) - Killer: None**

&amp;nbsp;

**Tom - Now: 1st ($445M) - Pre-Season: 2nd ($705M) - Updated: 1st ($623M) - Killer: None (unless we're wrong and Brian wins, then it's that piece of unholy crap Jem and the Holograms)**
Tom currently has the two best value movies in *Goosebumps* (16x) and *The Peanuts Movie* (11x) (though they'll be 2nd and 3rd in a couple days, no match for the phenom that is *Krampus*). Throw in *The Last Witch Hunter* and *Spectre* and he's got four of the top seven. We guess there's another $45M to be had from his already released movies, and enough love for *Saturday Night Live* grads Fey, Poehler, and Ferrell to grab $135M combined for *Sisters* and *Daddy's Home* (the SNLers are apparently feeling very familial this winter). Yes, *Sisters* opens head-to-head against *Star Wars*, which sounds crazy stupid, but besides the thousands of moviegoers who happen to say ""Sith Lord"" while in line and are given tickets to *Sisters*, it's also perfect counter-programming.

As tough as it is for us to understand, there is a large part of the population that gives something less than a complete rat's ass about *Star Wars*, and wouldn't know a Skywalker from a streetwalker. *They* are *Sisters* audience, and they will go watch those wacky ladies, if only for the joy of strolling leisurely past the hordes of desperately impatient, line-locked ""space movie geeks."" 

Cap off Tom's season with a final bargain in $70M from $6 *Daddy's Home*, and that should be enough to walk away with the 2015 Winter Movie Draft championship.

&amp;nbsp;

(Or, there's always the chance that Star Wars makes a billion dollars in a week-an-a-half and nothing else means anything.)

Anyways this happened over a course of the past 7 months but the 3rd time just happened on Sunday. It all started when I was studying abroad in Finland. We frequently went out and had some pretty crazy nights. Fast forward to April when I tore my ligaments in my left ankle by running home from the bars with my friend absolutely smashed at 5am. We were walking at first but I felt like shit and my friend told me to see if I could throw up. So, that I did and hurled quite a bit alcohol into the sea. I felt great after that and decided it was time to run! We were making our way home when I started running off course a bit and running along walls and what not. That's when I decided it was time to try and do a 360 off of a 2 foot retaining wall... It didn't go as plan and I laid there reenacting [Peter Griffin after he hurt his knee running.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEZQ2rg-Rlg) My friend wanted to hit the sack so he told me to hurry the hell up just thinking I was kidding. I tried to stand up and instantly fell over. Now this part's kinda funny; my friend is a medical intern at the hospital and I tell him to call and ambulance and for some damn reason he has no idea what the number was so we had to Google and try and explain where we were. They said they would send and ambulance right over which felt like an forever. We saw the ambulance driving around but it wouldn't come near us and then we got a phone call saying they couldn't find us. I went to the hospital and proceed to get xrays and was sent home the next morning with crutches and brace. It ended up being a level 3 tear which is considered the worse. That being said IDK if it was lost in the language barrier or what but I wasn't really told to come back and get PT or anything on those lines. So I kinda just laid in bed until it didn't hurt and started trying to keep up with everyone else. Once I got home to the US and back to school I went out with some friends to catch up and have a welcome home back weekend sort of thing. We drank quite a bit before heading downtown and then ended up parking on the 4th floor of the parking ramp. A couple of my friends started running down the ramp so obviously I joined (Don't make some smart ass remark about if your friends jumped off a bridge would you?). Now that's when I once again decided to try and jump up and hit one of the exit signs with my hand because ya know I got those mad hops. And once again it didn't quite go as planned... I instantly knew what I did and asked my friend who drove us downtown to drive me to the hospital as he was the only sober one. Show up to the hospital, wait quite sometime and get the whole shindig again xrays and all on my right ankle and it ended up being a level 2 tear. I get a boot and crutches and make sure to take care of it this time. set up an appointment with my Orthopedics office and get the proper care and also take this opportunity to talk about my ankle from Finland. My doc runs me through some tests and tells me I did some pretty permanent damage to it, but doesn't need any surgery unless it starts to hurt. Now fast forward to this weekend it was my good friends birthday and I hadn't drank since last time I messed up my left ankle so I decided it was about time considering I was finally in a small brace and out of my boot. My two roommates and I just recently had gotten new beds so we had 3 twin sized mattress in our closet and people tended to jump on them when they were drunk (They honestly were bouncy than a trampoline). Once again people decided to start jumping on them like always I knew not to jump but I decided to stand on it and just kind of bounce with everyone's jumps and my friends accidentally jumped into me and I slipped off the 3 bed thick closet trampoline onto my left ankle (the Finland one) and instantly twisted it severely I knew once again instantly that I re-tore it. I went to my room grabbed my old boot from my left ankle and put it on and went to bed. I can only assume it was this week because It didn't properly heal in the first place. So I woke up the next day and drove my self to the hospital again and I meet with my Ortho doc on Friday to get it evaluated. So ya don't be a dumb ass like me but enjoy being young just understand the consequences. I have so many plans and things to look forward too, but now I have to wait until I get better. I'm an extremely ambitious person and I'm always pushing myself to the limits. I know a bunch of you will call me a dumb ass and what not, but to be honest I enjoyed every moment up to those points and don't regret any of those nights. I have to live with it and I don't fear anything but fear itself. I have a trip planned to Chile this winter break and I'm hiking the W in Patagonia, I'm not going to let any of this stop me from pursuing my dreams!

TL;DR: Fucked up and tore the ligaments in my ankles 3 different times within a year all because I was drunk.

Anyone here know anything about it?,kondor35,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3w1bm8/industrial_andor_systems_engineering_anyone_here/,"Hello. I am a high school senior about to enter college at SJSU for Industrial and Systems Engineering.

A month ago, I was set on changing my major to Comp Sci. or Software Engineering because I have an interest in software and computers, but mostly because of it's great job placement and salary. But as I did more research on ISE, I thought that I might like this major and profession. Being that your a professional in this field, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

1. What is the job search like? If I attend SJSU, which is a pretty reputable University in Silicon Valley, and get good grades, is it pretty simple to land internships and jobs after college? How saturated is the job market for ISE? I read that a lot of ISE's are unemployed somewhere :P.

2. Do you love your job? Is it fun?

3. If you don't mind me asking, what should I expect for the starting salary and my mid-career salary? Money is not everything to me, but it is pretty important. 

4. What are some skills I should learn or something I should do while in college to help my chances of succeeding at landing a job and doing well? I understand that this is a very broad field

5. I heard that it is very possible to become a Project Manager with ISE. What must I do to increase my chances to becoming a manager? I've always liked being in charge and being the one who makes sure stuff gets done, I think I have a natural talent for it.

Thank you :). I really appreciate it."

This internship will be a full-time thing with it hopefully leading to a permanent position at the company. 

Small summary of my relevant history: graduated with a Bachelors in IT a year ago, been doing IT odd jobs here and there the past year, and I've had a passion for computers (building, fixing, giving advice on, etc..) since I was around 15 (I am now 24).

Any advice you guys can give me? I have looked over the wiki and seen some of the past posts on this subreddit (I just found out about it today). I would greatly appreciate anything I can learn from your replies. Thanks!

P.S. I see some posts have the ""seeking advice"" tag but I'm not sure how to put the tag.

I am hired for a position in Berlin, I am in my last year of a master in Computer Science Engineering in France, but the internship is more a front-end web developer internship. 

They ask me for the salary I expect, and I have like no idea of what would be a normal wage, and also of living cost in Berlin.
I should also mention that the company is a start-up, so for sure they won't be able to compete with super big software companies.

So my questions are what is a reasonable salary, that could cover my expenses in Berlin?"

First off the back, I've interviewed with Google before for an internship. It consisted of a couple back to back phone interviews preceding the host matching phase.

For the full time graduate SWE position, I had a phone screen with an interviewer. She told me she'll be sending a ""coding sample"" which I have to finish in a week and (one hour after opening them which I haven't got so far). I haven't heard of this step before.

Does anyone have any experience with this step ? What should I revise? I'm usually good at phone interviews, but it might also be the fact that I was guided  by the interviewers. So I am not sure what to expect from this step."

I am new to the Reddit community so please bare with me.

I am currently finishing up my Senior year at Macalester College with a Biology major and I have become increasingly worried about my qualifications going forward to Entry Level MSN programs. I eventually want to become a Nurse Midwife and Family Nurse Practitioner, but I'm worried that I may not be able to get into grad school.

What I am most worried about is my low GPA (3.15, science GPA is 3.33) and probably low GRE since I haven't been able to study very much (taking it in two weeks). I had a very shitty Freshman year due to family responsibilities (only child of an immigrant family) but have steadily picked up on mostly Bs and some As in Sophomore and Junior year. I have no research experience outside of lab but have had multiple medical internships with audiologists, oncologists, physical therapists, and women's health nurse practitioners throughout college trying to figure out what I want to do. I am currently a medical scribe in the emergency room, I love working there, but I'm afraid my grades are slipping again because of the time commitment and fatigue along with family responsibilities.

My question is, how likely am I going to get into an Entry to MSN program with a low GPA and GRE but great medical experience? I am trying my hardest to write the best personal statements of my life. Two of my professors and a physician I work with have agreed to write recommendation letters for me, but should I suggest that they speak about my GPA? How do I go about doing that? 

It's 4 in the morning here and I am just palpating outta my chest from stress. I mainly need reassurance and also realistic news (such as, ""Alright, you ain't getting in"") so I can move on from this thought with some kind of determination.

I recently came out to my father as gay and he freaked out. It's been 4 months and there is no sign of him changing his mind about being in my life. 

I pay for school with financial aid and what that doesn't cover I use student loans. I wait tables on weekends but unfortunately I'm in an unpaid internship program now, that is really taking up more of my time than I need for it to. But I get credit for it. 

I cannot afford to take out anymore loans. 

After my dad stopped helping with rent, power, cell phone, Internet, etc.  I was okay a while just always behind or late which is more expensive. 

My car was in my fathers name and he had an extra key and came and got it one night without telling me. So I can't travel very far from home. I bike/walk to work and school. 

I was hoping someone out there would have the know how, to get caught up during Christmas break. Anything will help I'm sure! I need to raise/make approximately $1,500-$2,000 before January. 

This would catch me up as far as 2.5 months rent, 2 power bills, 2 cellphone bills and 3 internet bills and groceries for a while. 

I had a suggestion for cutting off my internet and using cellular data. I did cut back my cellphone  plan and cancelled my Hulu, Netflix and other luxury expenses. But I can not cancel my internet, it's to big of a necessity for school. 

I really hope to get a lot of feed back. I can't really go home if I don't find a solution.  

Thanks in advance! "

Fast forward six months and I am absolutely miserable. I have always struggled with anxiety to an extent, but it is now eating me alive. Aside from the intense misery I feel about it, I feel it is also affecting my job performance and I don't think I am doing a good job. I have felt this way for 3 months and I am slowly getting more and more depressed as well as anxious, like tonight I cried for 2 hours thinking about going to work tomorrow.

The amount of stress in the job is insane, and I hate feeling inadequate. I hate the work, I hate the culture, and I am becoming less and less interested in pursuing law as a career.

It sounds ridiculous, but I live in a fifth storey apartment and I frequently think about how I could end it all and stop going to the job. I have started self-medicating with alcohol to give my mind a break from how stressed I am all the time.

I am, however, afraid that it is my anxiety talking and if I were to quit, I would 'recover' and regret throwing away this opportunity.

On the other hand, I have $25,000 in savings and my friend has offered me a job at a cafe. I would like to explore starting my own business or working in a different type of law job. I want more freedom and less stress than this job will ever offer me. If they were to offer me a job at the end of this period I would run away screaming.

What should I do?"
3w2ofj,4,2015-12-09,When you least expect it....my story,Enjoyingthesneak,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/3w2ofj/when_you_least_expect_itmy_story/,"As most of you can assume, first post. I was elated when I found this sub and I am so thankful for the positivity and community here. Not talking about my situation is making me crazy! 


I've been with my husband for 5+ years. Happily married-ish. Our bedroom is kinda dead. He travels every week in medical sales. And our interactions during the week are usually only about money or bills or just general operations of our lives. It burns me out. He gets home every weekend and is so tired and so grouchy and rarely does anything sweet for me. He's also terribly timid in bed. Very vanilla. 


I cheated. Last week. I knew it was coming, I knew it from the first day we met. 


We both got jobs working for a new startup in town, and we were connected through a mutual friend. After talking to him for 5 minutes I was hooked. I referred him to my boss for a position and he hadn't even applied. My boss offered him the job - and it took him two weeks to accept it, he said he was weighing his options. Between the offer and the acceptance, we saw one another a lot. I kept making excuses to swing by his work, and since we have mutual friends who also work there - I camouflaged it with visiting them. He's very high up in his current job and it is so sexy. He knows everyone and it always telling jokes and can connect you with anyone you need to know. His smile literally glows and his laugh is infectious. He winks a lot and is a touchy feely kinda guy - to everyone. He's just addicting, can't you tell?


After he accepted the job, we met for drinks a few times. One night we ended up eating and staying out until 1am, just talking. I would come home and touch myself just thinking about him. I would be so embarassed like, ""this guy would think I'm crazy!"" 


Since we are both working for a new company, we don't have an office yet - we are in the process of getting that setup here - and he had a high profile job he was leaving to take the position so for about two weeks - I was the only person in real life who knew about the new job. So it became like summer camp. We constantly wanted to get together to talk shop and ideas. Every single day we would text and atleast try to hang out. 


I realized very quickly he wasn't happy at home. Who gets a new job and doesn't tell their wife?!? He said he didn't want to upset her if the offer wasn't high enough - essentially wanted all the details ironed out and then he will tell her. He never talks about her. Talks about his kids (did I mention he has kids?) all the time. But her, never - which was very telling to me. (She knows now)


Throughout this process we have always been very flirty making sexy jokes or talking about breasts or whatever - like guy humor. So I've always kind enjoyed our banter. Two weeks ago we were out and he had to go to his office to hit a deadline before midnight - so we had been drinking and talking shop from about 8-11pm and he stood up to leave and kissed me on the cheek. I froze, but I was so insanely turned on. It turned into to awkward hug thing and he said ""isn't it funny these people probably think I'm fucking you."" Well, there it was. I grinned and felt my crotch moisten in literally 1 second. 


We continued having casual interactions and he even met up with me and my girl friends one night when we went dancing. He loves to party and have a good time and they all knew him as my coworker. As the drinks kept flowing I felt his hand on my lower back and it would take my breath away. We danced to one song and I caught myself trying to rub my ass all over his crotch. Oops. We stayed out until 6am and I was fairly drunk. We started texting at 9am the following morning and that was two weeks ago and it hasn't stopped. 


As our company continues to lay groundwork - we continue to work together as we can. We have tasks but they're so abstract but we always get them done and then stay later to flirt. Last week we had a fundraiser to attend to represent the new company. We got there late but split a bottle of wine. Then the entire group, all friends of ours, went out to a bar. Slowly people trickled out and we kept talking about work and flirting a little. Finally it was last call, and I decided I drank to much, and insisted on some greasy White Castle before I headed home. 


I rode with him to the bar - along with others, but at this point it was just the two of us. On the way to get a burger he flat out asked me ""What are you thinking?"" 
""I'm hungry is what I'm thinking."" - he pulls over, ""no, what are you really thinking about what's going on between us?""


I froze and took a deep deep breath. ""I'm thinking things I shouldn't be thinking."" He smiled, ""Me too.""


At this point I'm done for. Just done. I know I cannot resist him. We go through the drive thru and he puts his hand on my knee. I love it. And I feel myself getting so wet and my breathing was insane. 


We continue silly flirting the entire way back to my car and he parks behind me on the street. I continue to eat and joke and after a sip of drink he grabs my face and kisses me. So hard and passionately it makes me sweat just thinking about it. We pull away and both make a statement like ""what are we doing?!"" But we both knew what we are doing. 


We make out some more and his hands are everywhere. He feels over my crotch and stops, looks at me and I grin. He felt how wet I was because it was coming through my damn pants. I guided his hand down the front of my pants and he lost his mind. ""How are you so wet, WHAT!"" He couldn't keep his hands off my clit and by this point I was rubbing him through his jeans. He made me cum in 2 minutes. ""Your turn."" I said as I decided to give him head. His dick was beautiful. Not too big but a good thickness. He came very quickly and very hard. We were like animals, panting.


After that we both straighten up in our seats and he very clearly said ""you gotta get out."" I kinda freaked like, did I do something wrong? - ""You gotta go because I want to fuck you so bad."" - I smiled and hopped out.


We saw one another the next afternoon at a luncheon. Acted totally normal. Then he called me after ""you gonna be awkward around me now?"" I said ""nope."" And he said ""Even though I still want to fuck you?"" And I replied ""The feeling is mutual."" We didn't discuss it again for 3 days.


We had an event two nights ago to attend for work and we were meeting some interns to discuss things with them. I sent them to dinner early and said I would meet them in a second. He and I were standing in the middle of our busy downtown and as soon as they were out of earshot he looked at me, ""I cannot get you out of my head."" I grinned ""I know, you've got me worked up."" We talked in this sexy banter as we walked to dinner and stood outside the restaurant for 5 minutes discussing how turned on we both were. He had to run to another meeting - so I was handling the interns, we hugged goodbye and he whispered ""just talking to you makes me so hard."" Kissed my ear and left.


I didn't hear a word the interns said. I don't even remember. Because we started furiously texting, filthy. After his meeting we met up and had a similar encounter as before. We were just more sober and more comfortable so it was even better. 


Saw him yesterday morning, and although his current company is casual, they had meetings yesterday so he was dressed up. And I was raging hot. Watching him work was so hot. Shit. When I left we started texting and it didn't stop until we met up that evening. The day was full of fantasy and pictures and steamy stuff. And he came by the bar I was at. Sat down, didn't order a drink but just spoke to me about what he wanted to do to me. We pretended to be having a professional conversation. But it was far from it. He left after 10 minutes. TEASE. And I closed out and went outside and he was sitting in his car stroking it. I climbed in - we drove around the block and I give him the most intense blow job - ""Now you can go to your meeting..."" I said. He laughed and kissed me. Wow.


That was 12 hours ago and I cannot quit thinking about it.
We are planning to get a hotel this weekend and once next week.
The idea of not being in a car and not having any distractions makes me flustered.


 I know work relations isn't advisable so please spare me. We are both more independent contractors right now than brick and mortar coworkers. Just wanted to share. 


We are shifting our talks to Kik today. Any more advice?

Wow, another exclamation point in the title!  This month is going on stupendously!

Funny word that.  ""Stupendously.""  lol

ANYWAYS.  The week so far has been meh.  Since it's almost Christmas, a lot of people are on leave so it's been quiet.  On Monday when I came in for work, I was told that I had won November's safety awareness thing.

Every month, they choose 3 of the best health and safety thing and give each person who won a 50$ voucher and honestly, I did try my best 'cause 50$ is quite a bit of money so yea, I tried and every month different people would get it so I thought I had a chance.  But eventually, the same people kept winning so I guess everyone, including me, just like slacked off and just really stopped caring after a while.

Ok, I'm rambling.  

The point is, I won!  lol at least I can cross that off my list ahaha It really was one of my aims to get one so I'm glad I did!  Even though it was done half-heartedly lol I never really win anything so that was a nice surprise!  I'm gonna give it to Mum and Dad to use when they go buy groceries.  50$ is too much just for me to spend so I might as well give it to them to buy stuff for the house and siblings.  If it was broken down in like 10s or 20s I would buy a few things but I can't ""break"" it.  It's cool.  We can just buy more pie pans so I can have more pie!  Easy!

Other than that, nothing has been happening.  Saw an old buddy of mine and we chatted for a bit.  We were under the same program as apprentices but he started a few months before me but was under an unpaid internship I believe before he got picked up by this apprenticeship program.  That was cool.  I told him I'm thinking of going diving sometime in the next few months and he said he'd love to go but he has to make sure it's cool with his girlfriend and make sure he can afford it.  I did tell him to just bring her along if she wanted to come and to let me know if he could afford it so we can plan it more accordingly.  If not then it would be just me and probably family.  They don't dive though so I told them to plan something else for themselves so they don't get bored.

Haven't played much Hearthstone.  Like just to do my dailies but I'm really just waiting for Tavern Brawl and the next wing in League of Explorers.  IT'S TAKING FOREVER.  WHY.  Ok, ok.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Tavern Brawl then Friday is League of Explorers.  Soon.  SOON.

I'm meeting a couple of friends tomorrow for dinner.  Haven't seen either of them for a while so it would be nice to catch up.  Not sure if anyone else will be there actually.  Not that it matters lol I just want food ahaha

Oh, I've been reminiscing about Game of Thrones lately lol Like I remembered about stuff that happened all of a sudden so I started looking at Game of Thrones stuff.  Pictures.  Videos.  The books.  The maps.  GIFS.  Anything really lol I think I got a bit over emotional when it showed Robb ugh And Oberyn.  Ok.  I am gonna have a Game of Thrones marathon soon.  Be it the show or the books, I don't care.  I just need to fill this ache I have about it!

So yea.  This has gotten a bit long but, it's a diary entry right?  lol just some of my feelings and thoughts on things.  I'll end here.  

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"

However, I don't want to just go join the IT department of a random company, I would much rather join a software developer or a consulting firm. My ideal job would be a mixture of coding, software design and software architecture, but realistically speaking I will most likely start in a coding position and hopefully grow towards the more high-level positions.

As for my education, I have a Master's degree in Computer Science, specialisation AI with a sidefocus on software design. I did a one month programming internship where I had to optimize a mixture of java/SQL code for ORM and database queries.

So these are some questions I have about getting the best offer possible:

- What skills should I learn/strengthen that employers in software development value?

Throwaway time. I live in a third world country, and I've been passionately programming ever since I was a kid. I got multiple freelance gigs over the years, and have even been accepted into the Google Summer of Code program.

I just recently received an offer for a job in Europe. As you can imagine this is an incredibly big opportunity for me (coming from a third world dev). I came to them asking for an internship, but they think I'm a good fit they're willing to bring me in full time (as they'll be taking care of visa and all that stuff, so it's a pretty big commitment on their part).

I'm now seriously considering taking it up. I love College, but I think this opportunity is too good to pass up. I'm literally living paycheck to paycheck (or gig to gig) right now, as I'm self supporting, while also helping my family as my dad is a stroke victim.

I'm 19 by the way. What do you guys think? I know that this incredibly subjective, but I just want to have your guys opinion on it.

Eventually I want to work on the big companies, somewhere like Google. Maybe I should stay in college, learn theoretical stuff, and try my best to get an internship there, but then again I could learn the theoretical stuff on my own free time as well.

EDIT: I've heard that US H1B visa is not given to people without degrees. Is there no possibility for me for example to work at Google HQ just because I don't have a degree? Well anyway, if ever I get a job, I won't give up and will look into part time colleges, but that might be tough for a bachelors. I already have one year and a semester done in my home country but I'm not sure if the credits would transfer."

I accepted a summer '16 internship offer at Yahoo, and I'm concerned right now as to what will happen to the offer, considering I've been turning down all my other interviews because of it.

There are also talks that other companies might be looking into buying off their core business, and there might be massive layoffs, etc etc - all the stuff that comes with the grapevine.

Should I contact my Yahoo recruiter or future team lead about this? I'm waiting for a couple of other interview results but I'd really feel bad reneging on this one because I like the company and the opportunity.

Any advice would be great. Thanks!"

3w3f1y,2,2015-12-09,Help me understand my process?,prettylittlearrow,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/3w3f1y/help_me_understand_my_process/,"Been lurking for awhile and thought it was time for a post :) Like many people I'm still not sure if I'm an INFJ or not. I've taken the actual Myers-Briggs twice. In high school as a senior 3 years ago, and I got INTJ. I took it again last year as a sophomore and got INFJ. Whenever I take the short online quizzes I get some variation of INFJ/INFP/ENFP/ENFJ. I did some reading and one of the [fundamental differences is the decision making process.](http://www.personalityhacker.com/infp-vs-infj/) I'm currently in a dilemma where I have to make a fairly big decision and so I thought-- maybe if I explained how I'm thinking, I could get some outside feedback on what type of decision making I'm using. (And yes I probably would be better off talking to a professional but I don't have the resources right now to talk to my counselor about it).

I'll make the backstory short: Went off to college (ABC University) during a rough period in my life and was not happy about the school I was going to (it was my last choice, parents basically chose it for me, etc). Hated it all the first semester and planned on transferring somewhere else in-state after my first year was up. Circumstances changed and I went back for another semester and by the time it was over I realized that I had it pretty damn great (guy I liked, good roommates/friends, amazing job, grades were great, seeing a good counselor), but I still wanted something ""different"". Transferred somewhere else (XYZ University). Had a ROUGH semester there and am afraid to go back. More circumstances and I ended up staying home a semester; I've had MONTHS to think about this. My thinking so far:

**Continue at XYZ University:**
- I want to go back because I feel like 1 semester isn't a good enough period to know if I like it or not; I hated the first school and ended up loving it, so maybe that's the case here. I WANT to love it there.
- Joined a group and while it wasn't what I expected I would feel guilty for ""wasting"" my parents' money, letting the group down, and quitting something. I was raised to always finish what you start and I would feel bad for others wasting their time and for myself for quitting.
- I'm afraid to go back because the drinking environment wasn't at all right for me and I got too caught up in it...BUT now I do now that it's not for me and can avoid the mistakes I made. 
- I don't have very many friends and will feel alone, but with a different major I could still make friends.
- Still opportunities to join activities.
- Had a bad experience with random roommates and I don't want to live alone...but I don't have anyone I could live with.
- MUCH cheaper than my other school, but I am a year behind and would have to stay a 5th year.
- I have work study so getting a job isn't a problem.

**Go back to ABC University:**
- Would feel awkward having to explain to everyone why I decided to come back and why I lied about LOVING XYZ Uni when I was actually miserable and hungover 99% of the time.
- It feels like home, and it's in a major city meaning I don't have to spend all of my time on campus.
- Not many opportunities to join outside activities but being in a city means I could intern and join things outside of school.
- My absolute best friends, as well as someone I'm in love with (but not involved with), are there and I cherish them more than anything.
- I could potentially get my amazing job back or find something equally as good with the amount of connections I have there.
- INSANELY expensive and not sure I can afford to pay back the loans.
- I'm very close to graduating on time and would possibly only need to stay an extra semester as opposed to another year. Plus I want to graduate with my friends.


I'm NOT asking you to help me with my decision (though if you have some worldly advice I would not be opposed to it); I'm asking what kind of decision processing is this? INFJ ""Harmonizing"" or INFP ""Authorizing""? I'm just feeling torn between what's logical and what will make the most sense in the long run vs. what's best for me RIGHT NOW.

Edit: formatting my bad lol

I am currently a senior in college and I will be graduating in May with a computer engineering degree. My grades are strong and I have internship experience on my resume. The problem that I am facing is that I have been interviewing for jobs and I am not exactly sure how to evaluate the offers I have been receiving. So far I have received 3 job offers, but only one is still valid.

The job offer that is still currently on the table is as follows, 68k + 5k signing + 4% IRA match + 7% bonus based on company performance. The company as a whole is not performing great, but I would be working for a small (somewhat self-sufficient group) within the company where only the benefits would be affected by the larger company. The location that I would be working in is outside of Chicago.

The issue that I am worried about is that I am afraid to turn down this offer and start over looking for jobs again. I am a good student with a good resume but I sometimes struggle with technical interviews. The offer that I still have is the second best offer that I received in terms of compensation and benefits, but the work is the best (which is why I turned down the best offer). I'm just looking for some advice as to either taking this job or searching for a different one.

Thanks

As a side note, I have already tried to negotiate with the company, and they said they already gave me the top of their budget and the offer is as stands. This slightly worries me that there is not a lot of growth potential with the company."

I graduated about two years ago. I was working in customer service (cashier) for a while. Passed P last November. Passed FM this Aug. Took MFE and failed this November. 

Before I had taken any exams, everyone said you only needed one. Then two. Now three. I know it has to do with increasing competitiveness, but it's seriously discouraging me.

I didn't take undergrad seriously, so I didn't do any internships or anything. I graduated with a low but decent GPA. I'm trying to develop my skills using Tia's technical skills course. 

Currently I've been applying to any and every job I can. Some analyst roles. Claims. Etc. I get some interest, but no real offers. I don't know what to do.

So... What do you think is better? Keep applying for any position? Take a job as a data entry clerk from a temp agency? Take MFE next year and reapply for actuarial positions? Or go to a no name grad school nearby and try to land a summer internship?

I am in my second semester of grad school, getting my MS in Operations Research, concentrating in data science/analytics. 

So this company actually contacted me about their internship via my resume on either LinkedIn, Indeed, or my school's career site; I did not apply or contact them initially. Their glassdoor review seems a little questionable as of recently due to a lot of rough reviews this past month about their management team (it's a very fast growing 2 year old startup), and I was additionally little skeptical considering they contacted me...but I thought it wouldn't hurt to do a phone interview at least. A few questions for you guys:

What is a ""good"" offer or compensation for a summer internship? This company in particular seems to pay its data scientists ~90k. Also, they said they don't have any positions open at the moment, should I care about that? They are local (research triangle), so that is nice.

Did any of you all get internship/job offers from places you never contacted or applied to?

I have yet to have the chance to really apply to anything else, and have never been offered an internship so I don't know the procedures...should I scoop it up if they say end up wanting me, or try my luck at some other places first? Do places often give you some time to decide? 

Also, any tips regarding interviews with this field specifically in mind would be great. I generally am pretty confident and comfortable in interviews, but all tips are appreciated! 

Thanks!!!

3w3zo6,6,2015-12-09,Seeking advice on how to get money together to pay lawyer fees as a college student without consistent income,LaneCake,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3w3zo6/seeking_advice_on_how_to_get_money_together_to/,"I am a 21 year old female college student in my junior year of my undergraduate studies, and my boyfriend is a 20 year old college student who is also a junior in his undergraduate studies. Last night we were both arrested for possession of controlled substances. This was the first time that either of us has been arrested. I received two misdemeanors, and he received two felonies and two misdemeanors. The whole ordeal was entirely my fault, so I have told him that I will be paying both of our legal fees. After speaking with a couple friends who have faced similar cases in the past, I am expecting that my legal fees will cost something like $5k, and his will cost something like $20k or $25k after hiring lawyers and paying all fines and taking all recommended/required classes. So, that's $25k to $30k all together. I currently have $3k in savings, $2k tied up in CD's, and $3k in a Roth IRA account that I can withdraw without penalty. My parents have the paperwork for another bank account in my name that was given to me by my grandparents, and intended for use on my first down payment on a house whenever I graduate and get a full time job. I believe that it contains $30k or $40k. I have not told my parents about what happened, so I currently do not have access to this money. Our court dates are on January 26th, so I would need to at least have the money to pay both of our lawyers well in advance of that date. For this reason, I am expecting that I will need to take out a loan. First of all, I know very little about loans, or what goes into getting approved for them. I do know that when my same grandparents gave me a bank account to be used to buy a car when I graduated from high school (they are very generous people), I took out a short term loan in my name and paid it back with the money from that account in order to build my credit. The last time I saw my credit score, it was exceptionally high. I want to handle all of this on my own if at all possible, without telling my parents. I plan on starting to sell my plasma, and getting a part time job once I get back from winter break (finals week is next week for us). I plan on applying to work at a hotel some time this week, so I'm hoping that I will be hired by them in time to be able to report that I am employed when I apply for the loan. I have an internship this summer that will be paying me very well, and they did my background check a while ago, so I don't see my employment status with them being any kind of issue. I also plan on getting a night job over the summer, such as waitressing. With time, I will certainly be able to pay off any kind of debt. I am a very motivated and hardworking person, so I plan on doing everything in my power to fix this, both legally and monetarily, for the two of us. Can anyone offer advice on where to start on getting this money together? I am young and clueless and I need as much advice as I can get moving forward. Thank you in advance!"

We have had multiple confrontations. I've tried talking to them one on one, with a coworker present, and with our boss. She'll change for a few weeks then go back to her old behavior. She constantly points out and makes a huge deal about any mistakes I make, micromanages me, and is very passive aggressive. Once to my face she asked me ""No offense, but how do you manage to work solo shifts?"" 

I know she's dealing with depression, but I have depression myself. She constantly undermines me and makes me feel useless and terrible at my job, even though no one has a problem with me and everyone (including our boss) says it's her not me. She was supposed to be let go in may after she made me leave work in tears but it never happened. :( this left me distrustful of my boss so I haven't spoken to him since before that incident in April and I've just been putting up with her behavior because I really need the money for this job to pay down student debt and I get tuition discount for working here. So if I took another job I know I'd have to take a pay cut, plus pay more for school (I'm trying to change careers and get a programming degree. I have a business/hr bachelors). 

Anyway. Today I got in a fight with her in front of the whole office-the first time since may when she had me in tears. I just want to quit so badly. It sucks to have everyone say they're on my side but not help stand up to her or move me to a different position away from her or anything to actually fix the situation. Should I go talk to our boss and tell him this is the last straw? Should I just find another job and then quit? Should i finish my first year or school (not til may) and try to land an internship in my new career? I'm assuming he won't bother talking to me since he never spoke to me after the other incident either. I can't deal with her anymore and we have to sit right next to each other and work together so ignoring her is not an option. "

In case someone asks, no, she didn't follow me here. It's a great school for our respective majors. 

We both are commuters, roughly ~40 minutes one way. I took this most recent Fall semester off to intern at a big tech company, and planned on using some of the money to rent a bedroom near campus. 

So I came back from my internship in late November, and have been looking for a room near campus every since. I'm interested in subleasing a room for the Spring semester. The problem is there really aren't many options available. The best room I could find is in a 4 bedroom apartment right next to campus. The price is right, and the location is great. 

However, my girlfriend isn't happy with my potential roommates. They are as follows: a 19 year old female student, a 23 year old female fresh grad, and a 22 year old male grad student. I've met them all, and they seem like respectable individuals. Both girls have boyfriends, and the guy is single. 

She does not like the idea of me living with other females. When I told her I am considering signing the sublease, she became very upset and quiet. She says it's ""fucking weird"" that I will be living with two other girls, and has been upset about this for the past couple of days. When I ask her what makes it weird, she doesn't give me any specifics and says, ""everything about it."" 

Here's the thing, our relationship is good. We both trust each other, and we're good about communicating our feelings. But in this instance she's not telling me what about this living situation is ""weird."" I know the idea of it is making her uncomfortable and she'd rather I live with all guys. She's not preventing me from signing the lease, but she is seriously upset that I want to sign it. I told her that if I were to live there, I'd make sure to tell her about everything and make sure she never feels uncomfortable.

I want the sign the lease because I have 3 semesters left before graduating, and really want to live near campus for all of them. I'm 100% sure I won't find a room if I don't sign this lease. After the Spring semester is over, I'd look for an apartment with all guys.  Am I in the wrong for wanting to go through with this?

   
**tl;dr**: Want to rent a bedroom near campus for 5 months, roommates would be 2 females and 1 male, girlfriend is upset that I might be living with females. Am I wrong for wanting to live there?"

They extended my internship by a month and a half but then on monday, broke the news that they decided to go with someone with more experience... the thiing is, they basically had to make a position for me, there wasn't really enough work for one person, and the manager had to be convinced, so after all that work and seeing me work there I guess they decided I wasn't good enough?

Im calling them all today to beg for a forebearance for two months but I can't gaurantee I will get it.

Now I find out that my fiance isn't doing so hot at his job. Hes made some mistakes and his boss is not happy with him. If he loses that job we won't have any income.

Im sitting here, supposed to be looking for jobs, but I just want to cry all the time. I feel like I failed at my life in such a big way its irreversable.

To make matters worse I recently had health problems come up and had to pay out of pocket for 300-500 dollars (don't know how much the bill will be for the labwork yet).

3w4d9g,1,2015-12-09,Employer is paying me to get off the couch,aromogato,whichbike,https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/3w4d9g/employer_is_paying_me_to_get_off_the_couch/,"Like a lot of other posters in this subreddit, I want to get a bike to ride to work. My employer is letting me reimburse some of the cost, so this seems like a no brainer. During my internship a few years ago I rented a road bike to travel to work and it was an amazing experience due to the speed and lightness of the bike. Because of this I would prefer a road bike to a commuter bike.

Experience: Three years ago when I had a summer internship I rode to and back from the office ~15 miles roundtrip. Not much serious biking before or after that. Currently, I'm in fair to poor athletic condition, but I want to change that as I get into biking! I'm 5'7"" 190lbs if that is relevant.

Price range: My employer gives me a yearly fitness budget of which I have $550 left. I'd like to stay as close to that number as possible but am willing to go up to $750. Because this is through my company, I need a receipt when I buy the bike so used bikes off craigslist are not going to be feasible.

Intention with the bike: I'm going to use it to commute back and forth from work.

How far and how often will you ride: Work is 11 miles one way. Probably will start by doing one way 2-3 times a week and will increase it as I get more fit.

Riding conditions: Road/pavement the whole way. There's 800ft elevation gain and 700ft elevation loss (it's reversed on the way back obviously). Traffic will not be too bad because most of it follows the highway. The weather is typical Seattle weather - rains a lot but doesn't get extremely cold.

Location: Seattle

I've looked on amazon, but there just seems to be too many options which I can't properly compare (I don't have much experience with bike parts). I also checked out diamondback's site (I get a discount on some of their bikes) and I saw the following bikes for what seems to be a good price:

[$750 - Haanjo Comp](http://www.diamondback.com/bikes-road-alternative-road-haanjo-comp)

[$500 - Century](http://www.diamondback.com/bikes-road-endurance-century)

Thanks folks!"

In a few weeks I'll be starting my graduation internship for 6 months, as a Research Software Engineer Intern.
It's my first internship, I'm very motivated to learn new things and I'm wondering how can I get 100% of benefits from this inernship.

Since I have to provide a report for the school at the end, so let's start with that : 

1. Try to keep a daily notes, I'm thinking about Google Docs it seem to be pretty good and it's online (maybe evernote too) ! 
these notes will be personal notes, to help me write my final report. 
But I don't really know the best way to do it, what should I keep track of ? everything I learned ? everything useful ?

2. Networking, looking for a job :
I'm kind of introverted person, the kind that have a one job to do, do it properly and go home.
Should I start also looking for a job somewhere else while doing my internship ?


Thank you all for your help !

It was definitely not a firing, they liked me and offered to give me references, but I don't want them saying that I got let go for lack of experience because that obviously looks bad.

The problem is that the other company I interviewed at last week, doesn't know I got laid off. I told them the internship would last until January, because that was what I was promised.
I do not want to lie and get caught in a lie, but obviously if they want to hire me they will ask for a start date and I will have to tell them that I am no longer employed there. 

I could say ""My internship ended earlier than I expected because there was a communication error as to how long I was promised to be able to work there"".

Or I could say"" The internship ended a little earlier than expected"" and if they prod I could say ""they went with someone with more experience"".

Also, is it ok to give my previous bosses as references even though they may say I got laid off because they went with someone with more experience? I asked them when they laid me off if it was performance related or I did something wrong and they insisted it wasn't, but I don't know if that was the truth and I don't want them saying bad things about me.

How should I handle this?"
3w4rw6,64,2015-12-09,My Love for Game Grumps ended with a fizzle. (Long Rant),AlternateButtons,rantgrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/3w4rw6/my_love_for_game_grumps_ended_with_a_fizzle_long/,"After about two or three years of being a Grump fan, I finally unsubbed from their channel. It wasn't a momentous occasion. It wasn't huge or an explosion of rage and anger. It just kind of...ended. 

I unsubbed when Bloodborne returned. Why? Because Galaxy ended and I was excited to see what new things they had in store. I wanted to know what journey they were going to take next and after the loooong and drawn out series they've been putting out recently, I desperately wanted something new.

But then I saw Bloodborne and it was just kind of like ""Oh.....alright then."" And in that moment I thought to myself ""Y'know, the reason why I've been subbed to the Grumps for so long despite the huge drop in quality is because I've always held out hope that they'll get better and be as good as I know they can be. But it's clear that they don't WANT to get better. They're content with what they're putting out and they'll never change. So I think I'm done. I'm moving on."" and unsubbed without a second thought. 

It's disappointing really. Here's the channel that inspired my friend and I to make our own Let's Play channel and yet here I was, just leaving as a fan. I think the worst part is, is that I KNOW they can be funny. I know they can make me laugh if they actually put effort into their work. But they don't. They're content with the repetitive jokes, the lazy and sometimes under par editing. They're content with putting on these characters they've made for themselves and losing the genuine feel of their show. They're content with mediocrity. 

I'm posting this because I just took a lookback at their channel to see what they're up to and....it's a fucking mess. 

When Game Grumps started it was just two friends playing games. It was a simple formula that was genuine and entertaining. Just two friends being goofballs. That's it. I was fine when the roster expanded to Ross and Danny because it still felt genuine and fun. But then they just kept adding people and adding interns and adding editors. Now we have SEVEN people, (including Kevin because they count him) and most of them don't even work well with each other. Some of their interactions just seem mean and uncalled for. 

I can't even begin to tell you how angry it makes me when they pick on Ross. Look, ""God Dammit Ross"" was funny when Danny did it. But they treat him like literal shit. Brian especially with his cocky arrogance. I can't STAND Brian's arrogant ""I have a Ph'd"" attitude. He reminds me of that shitty friend that thinks he's better than you at everything because he has better grades or is better off. It's just not funny and it's mean spirited to the Nth degree. 

But don't you think seven people is a bit much? The original Grump show doesn't even feel special anymore. It just feels like it's there simply because it HAS to be and because it's their name. Arin and Danny have lost any sort of chemistry they once had. It's non-existent now. Danny himself is just ALWAYS fucking tired and uninterested. Arin puts on this shitty rage character that has no genuine qualities about it and is just an act because it's what's popular for views. Barry is awkward as fuck on camera with his slurred speech and doesn't seem invested at all. Suzy comes off as an ungrateful, whiny child who's humor does NOT fit in with anything they do, Brian as I mentioned is an asshole. Kevin is the LAZIEST son of a bitch I've ever seen in my life (Seriously I could edit circles around him.) and poor Ross is the only one with a lick of humor to him that is just sandwiched between all of these negative people. (Seriously, he deserves better. Here's hoping Gameoververse works out.)

I mean is THIS what Game Grumps is? It just seems like such a hollow shit show with no focus and no care put into it. It's not even recognizable anymore! Look guys, I'm not saying change is a bad thing. If you don't change and keep doing the same thing until the end of time, you will burn out. But this is not how change should be handled. 

When you change, you always need to keep in mind what worked in the first place. In Game Grumps case, it was the genuine, two best friends having a good time aspect that drew people in. But now it's just a cluster fuck of fake characters to appeal to a mainstream teen audience. There's no magic anymore.

It's like Mario and Sonic now that I think of it. Think about it. Mario games work because they keep what works best. Jumping and platforming with game mechanics revolving around jumping and platforming. Anything added to the formula is meant to compliment the main aspect and that's why Mario has barely any bad games. Sonic on the other hand kept trying to throw in game mechanics like no tomorrow. You had pointless treasure hunting, shoot 'em ups, Werehogs, Psychic Hedgehogs, the list just goes on. And every single one of those gameplay mechanics I mentioned were easily the worst parts of those respective games. People just want to see Sonic run fast and when Sega evolves that aspect alone, it makes for a good Sonic game hence Colors, Generations and the original trilogy. Sonic Lost World was a fuck up because they once again deviated away from the main aspect and added too much experimentation to something that WORKED. 

And Game Grumps is no different in this regard. They just keep throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. 

Evolve what works. That's the lesson they should learn. But they never will. And that's why I left and will never come back. Game Grumps is just a name now. There's no meaning behind it anymore. 

Sorry for the long rant. I only intended for this to be a be a few paragraphs believe it or not. 

**So TL;DR** I left Game Grumps because they're content with mediocrity, are evolving in all the wrong ways and will never change to the quality they once were.

3w4suw,1,2015-12-09,I'm seriously going fucking crazy.,DizzyBunnies,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3w4suw/im_seriously_going_fucking_crazy/,"I can't anymore. I am so tired. I am so, so, so tired.

I tend to post here a lot and delete these posts after an hour or two but this one I plan on keeping up only to receive as much advice as I possibly can.

I'm a 20 year old girl (turning 21 later this month).

My issue? I stress about everything, and the stressing makes me feel so angry and so upset and so sad. I don't know if I have anxiety or depression or maybe both but I don't want to be the 'woe is me' kind of person and self-diagnose.

My mother stresses me to no end. She constantly says she loves me and is only watching out for me, and I know she does not intentionally stress me out, but she does. She gets mad at almost everything I do (at least I am interpreting it this way) but said she is not ever really mad. I say sorry for almost anything I do (not only to her) because I feel like I everything I do is wrong.

A few years back, I was as shy as shy can be. I was almost worried I had social anxiety. Then in the past year or two I sort of 'came out of my shell'. I am still incredibly shy, but less so than before. I started going out more, doing things, making more friends, but last year, one of my best friends decided to just cut ties and now I don't do much. I go out with my boyfriend, go to our friends' house, but not *out*. 

I've been doing my first internship (teaching) for the past 6 weeks and it's been brutal. Assignments and reports due for theory part made everything more stressful. I haven't been working during this period, so I haven't made any money in over a month.

I tried to quit my job a few weeks back but realised I had no other job to fall back on so I got someone to take off my two week notice from the board in the office.

My mother also tells me I need to go out more and do more things. But I am broke! Furthermore, she complains when I am never home to take care of the cat and dog, and how I do nothing around the house. Does she want me out doing things or at home doing things, then? I am not entirely sure what she wants.

I cannot balance anything. I rarely see my other friends outside of the two I go see with my boyfriend. I can't balance social time with friends, social time with family, work, school, internship, my relationship with my boyfriend...

I can't. I am so tired and I just can't. I want help but don't know where to begin. I will try to get an appointment with my school counselor and see how that goes.

I am hypersensitive and take everything everyone says to heart. Whether it is a joke or not, I will take offence. Most of the time (85%) I will cry about it. I can't help it. 

I don't hear 'voices' per se, but I catch myself always 'telling' myself: ""you are useless, you are ugly, you are annoying. What are you good for? Why are you living?"" Yet I can't kill myself because I'm scared. Humans tend to be scared of the unknown. What if death is worse than living? What if a greater pain awaits me upon dying? I don't want to know. 

I don't want to kill myself, but yet I do. But I am scared. I know I won't be able to do it, but I wish I could. I wish I could run away from everything.

Oh, I can't talk to my mom about any of this, nor my dad; they would get so mad. The typical ""well, when I was your age..."" or even ""you are in school, have a job and a boyfriend, you live in a house with a roof over your head..."" blah blah so why should I feel the way I feel, right? What do I know?! I'm just a stupid almost 21 year old kid that knows nothing, right?!

I am so tired!!!! Mentally, physically. No matter how much I sleep I am still so fucking goddamned tired and I just want to scream and punch something or slam my head against a wall I just want this pain to end! I can't take it anymore I'm at my breaking point but I guess it's not important since I have no intention of kiling myself right?!

I hate this so much I really do the world is a fucking horrid place and I wish I could just vanish into thin air and never take another fucking breath on this planet.

Edit: sorry if my thoughts are all over the place and sorry for the ending of this post becoming sort of less coherent I guess I gradually got more and more emotional, lol."

3w4zj3,4,2015-12-09,Quitting after 6 years,Awholenewhorse,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3w4zj3/quitting_after_6_years/,"Hi!


I've been in a PhD for 6 years now and am heavily leaning towards quitting. I'd like to discuss this with as many people as possible before I go through with it, so thanks for any input!


I've passed into candidacy, but have only 1 (well-respected) conference paper in publication. I have 2 other technical conference papers but they're not well-respected. I have a second authorship on a journal paper. 


Based on my oral exam, my committee would like me to have 2 journal papers accepted before being able to write up and defend my thesis. The first of two papers is an extension of the well-respected conference paper so some of the work is done.. however, I just found out the results from the conference paper didn't generalize as well as I hoped and the results aren't great. 


I'm tired of grad school.. it's negatively affecting my relationships, and my mental and physical health. I feel really stifled, like I'm trapped. I'm tired of working in solitude. I don't enjoy the work, and plan on going into industry in a slightly different area of work, post-grad. I have two job offers lined up (yay!) in that area (I got them after doing internships and part-time contract work). I'm not sure how much longer it would take for me to finish, my guess is in the range of 10-20 months. 


It's not clear to me that finishing a PhD will provide added benefit, as I think work experience is much more highly valued for the direction I'm headed (I'll be doing applied machine learning work). Financially, in the short term, continuing grad school is a terrible decision. In the long term, I'm not sure if finishing would provide added financial benefit. Would having a PhD open doors to more interesting jobs? Potentially... but I have some years of research experience... Also, I'm leaning more towards a position with more of a engineering role as opposed to research. 


Thanks for listening to my mind barf :) and thank you for any input!!!

Things are going really well for me, or at least it looks that way.  I'm set to graduate next year with not only my BS in Finance, but also an MBA.  I'll have some debt, $20,000 I think, but it's all government loans, not private, and I don't feel too overwhelmed by that.  I'm ridiculously frugal as it is.

My issue is getting through the next year and a half of school.  I hate it here.  I go to a small, Christian university near my hometown that isn't very academically challenging.  I have a GPA of 3.96 without studying because this school is so easy.  It boggles my mind, how little we're learning.  I'm really, really bored with my classes.

I've been considering studying abroad for a semester.  I have a German minor; the only thing I need for the major is a study abroad.  Still, it would be expensive, and it would away from time worked at my internship (see below).

Moreover, I have little ambition for my field of study.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I became a business major.  Specifically, I'm a Finance major.

I have an internship.  I really love the company--the culture is very positive and friendly, and my supervisor has expanded and adjusted my role to help me grow and integrate myself within the company.  They've told me several times that they'd like to hire me after graduation.  I like the company, and I don't think I'll find anywhere as positive and rewarding as there.  That being said, I'm not too fond of cubicle life.  I'm sure lots of people feel this way, but seriously, working in an office is slowly killing me.  

Nothing in my life seems really...real.  Everything I see seems to be through a sheet of something, not really there.  It's weird, but I have a lot of friends who I know care about me, but I feel really alone.  I know I shouldn't--they remind me that they care about me, and would be there to talk if I need them--but I still do anyways.  It seems I've duped them all into believing I'm worth knowing.

I guess I just really feel aimless.  I want to just drop out of school or something.  I don't feel like I'm learning anything, or doing anything worthwhile, nor do I believe I'm on the track to doing so.

I feel so lost--so disconnected--so detached from everything.  I would appreciate any advice you have for me."

If you don't believe me, take a break from finals, make some tea, and listen to my tale",PM_ME_PLATYPUS_TALES,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3w5pwa/1ls_youre_going_to_be_fine_if_you_dont_believe_me/,"Hello everyone.  Throwaway account, but it's that time of year where everyone's freaking out and I really wanted to share my experience, or at the least an anecdote to help people put things in perspective.

When I began law school, I had been out of school for a few years, having just returned from teaching English and sports (basically PE) overseas in a few countries where I spoke the native language.  The transition for me was immense.  Not only was I re-adjusting back to the US, but it was in a city I had never lived in before, nor knew anybody in.  

My first semester 1L was, well, probably the hardest time of my life.  New adjustments, a new life, difficult coursework, and all of the normal things 1L year would bring you.  

Except... I got arrested about a month into school starting (not a DWI, something pretty minor) but significant enough where I had to obviously amend applications, the law school freaked, put me on probation.... it really jarred me.  Ontop of knowing nobody, feeling desperately alone... wondering if I'd seriously jeopardized my future.

Then I met someone.  The most beautiful, kindest person I'd ever met.  They helped me out of the rut I was in, made me feel good about myself after the arrest and we dated for awhile my first semester.  Until I contracted an incurable STD from them (that they say they didn't know they had, but who knows).  So my life was jarred... *again*... in a completely different way.  They broke it off with me almost immediately after.  I guess they couldn't live with the guilt.  This happened like mid-November my first semester 1L year.  Doctor's appointments, learning about prescriptions, how to manage this, how it will affect my life, dating, etc... On top of school, and still feeling shitty after the arrest.  

And then the beginning of December my first semester 1L, my car was totaled in the parking lot of my apartment complex after a drunk driver rammed into it, and I lived far away from the school and needed to get a rental car somehow to make the commute, couldn't afford a new car.  Oh and I should also mention that I had left my notebooks in my gym bag in the back seat but the crash had hit the side where the seat was, so it basically ruined all of my notes from the entire semester.  

I was a nervous, depressed, frightened mess of a person.  Exams were like the next week.  Yeah, I studied, as well as I could given the circumstances and how rattled my brain was.  Scored dead median.  The next semester, I knew I had to do better, ended up top 10% of my class (for that semester, so ended up around 1/3).

Went off to have a successful OCI that summer.  Point is, guys, life throws us curveballs all the time and it's going to seem extremely difficult, maybe even impossible to get through it but... you will.  I remember telling myself after my diagnosis that, well... the sun's still gonna come up tomorrow.  And during exams, hell, even if I just copy and paste a million lenny faces into the exam, the world's still gonna spin.

Now, the rest of my tale doesn't end so hot, but this point of this post was grades, studying, and how everyone's gonna make it.  As for me, I had worked for a law firm my 2L summer and made great money but the firm couldn't hire me due to financial reasons.  Panicked obviously, did a few in-year internships... nada, no job.  Still couldn't even get a job after the bar.  

After months of a fruitless search and volunteering my time to various legal aid, I ended up forming a band - we play country music.  I play guitar/sing.  I've got a sick beard now and grew my hair out, but I wear a baseball cap or cowboy hat most of the time now anyway.  We basically drive around about 60% of the country in a beat-up pick-up truck hitting college towns and small towns to play music living off what we get paid.  I drink a lot now, and smoke cigarettes more than ever.  Started out with just covering ""Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound"" and ""I Think I'll Just Sit Here and Drink"" but we have some original stuff now too. 

Good luck to everyone during this finals season and beyond.  God Bless.

Last summer I was lucky enough to get an internship at a big 4 company.  I was not lucky enough to receive a return offer.  I was upset about this, but it was OK, I was sure I would find another opportunity soon.

Now I got to go to Grace Hopper in October and got a lot of interviews there.  Unfortunately, only one offered me a job and I turned it down.  Everytime I asked for feedback, all my recruiters told me my interviewers only had positive things to say about me.  Some said I lacked technical skill.  OK I get that.  Others didn't say anything else.  In those cases, I assumed I simply was not competitive enough (these companies were like Airbnb).  How do you compete with top 10 school grads?  To be honest, I feel like a very mediocre programmer.  I got As in my programming classes and I know how to code, but there's no way I could beat a top 10 grad.  How do people get out of feeling this way?

Also, I've literally gotten all my interviews from Grace Hopper.  I've cold-applied to about 30 companies and only 1 of them responded to me.  These companies I've been applying to are mostly companies like Groupon and Hulu to smaller startups like FiveStars and Dot&amp;Bo.  To be honest, I was under the assumption that companies would love to give me at least an interview with a big 4 on my resume.  Now I realize that it's not true at all.  So I guess with this I'm asking what other companies should I be applying to and if someone could take a look at my resume?  Also, I know I don't have to exclusively apply to New Grad roles, but how do I convince a company who has a general listing to give me, a new grad, an interview?

One last thing...some of my interviews have non-standard technical questions.  For the most part I almost always expect a general coding question, and although I haven't done well on all of them, I know I can practice this and get better.  However, some questions get web specific.  For example, ""what is RESTful?"", ""what happens when you type in a URL?"".  I guess this isn't that unexpected as I list some web projects on my resume.  I mean yes, I do build these web projects, but I guess I don't know the full extent of what I'm doing.  And it also sucks because these are simply ""spit back what you know"" questions that I'm just not prepared for.  How can I better prepare myself for another interview like this?  I just feel like there's just so much to learn and I don't know how to prepare or where to start.  Is it fair to be asking new grads these types of questions?  Should I expect a lot of companies to do this?

So, sorry for the long post, but I need general advice on how to really get an offer and how to seem like an ideal candidate to hire.  I've been feeling a lot of mediocrity lately and I want to know how to get out of that.

**Edit:** changed ""startup"" to just ""companies"".  Startup was definitely poor word choice.

**Edit2:** I don't know if anyone else will be looking at this, but I wanted to say thanks to everyone that commented!  I know I've wasted a lot of my opportunities and that anyone would be happy to be where I am, but I think I just need to keep pushing through and working on my technical skills. There's still plenty of opportunity out there! I always knew referrals would help in getting interviews, but I guess I didn't know how much they really meant.  I was lucky enough last year to have one of my only technical interviews with a Big 4 through cold-applying, so I didn't think it would be hard to go through this again.

I also wanted to mention that a lot of my peers and family have been expecting me to get some amazing job offer (especially after interning at a big company) and I think that's been slowly getting to me.  I'm even too embarrassed to tell my mom that I didn't get a return offer.  And after failing interview after interview, it's starting to make me feel like I'm letting people and myself down and that getting that internship was a fluke.  I'm just so eager to get a job so that I wouldn't have to feel this way.  But, I think that how some of you said that a great internship doesn't promise a great job has grounded me a bit.  I always knew that, but I was surrounded by people who expected that from me which messed with me.

Also, I think it's pretty funny that people assume that I'm male even after I mention Grace Hopper :P

**Edit3:**  Again, I just wanted to emphasize that this is about *not getting interviews through conventional ways* (cold-applying).  Hence why the title says ""not getting any new grad interviews"" as opposed to ""not getting any new grad offers"".  I get that I don't just get offers because I just so happened to intern at a good company.  But I think a lot of people have helped me realize that it's not necessarily my application, but it's more of the process, so that's, in some ways, really reassuring to hear."

it's the type of sex that's so full of emotional baggage that it pushes your mutual sex to a whole new level.

It's the guy you dated who's a completely asshole and was a mistake from the get go.  You already broke up multiple times but here you are bouncing on his delicious cock.  You can't stand him, you fucking hate his guts but fuck you love his god damn cock buried inside you.

Here's my pitch for a few ideas that I would love to explore further.

---
**The Better Man**:

I heard a lot about you over the years.  First it was the brilliant new junior coworker that's was working with my husband full of potential and promise.  Then slowly over time as you rose in the ranks it turned from what a great new employee we have to what 'that guy' did, to the 'prick' as he fondly referred to you.  You rose faster then anyone at the company.  My husband is a few years older then me, he's 35 years old.  Now, his once former intern of 25 years is the CEO favorite and is likely to be running the company in a few years.  Jason can't fucking stand you and I.. well I barely met you but frankly I'm just fucking tired of hearing him whine about it.  

I just had a fight with Jason and I'm annoyed with him as it is.  I'm wearing a tight fitting little red dress a few inches shorter then what I'd normally wear at work events.  We're all at the work Christmas party as I finally meet 'Marcus'.  A brilliant young man with a radiant smile who bright eyes that seems to take in everything and everyone in the room yet still are able to rapidly roam over my body and leaving me feeling like he's taken in every inch of my body and approves thoroughly of my gym membership and the work I've been putting into it.

At the same time, I can feel the animosity between Jason and Marcus.  

                              . . . 

A few hours later in the VIP lounge that's empty except for the two of us. My dress is in pieces feeling his mouth on my body, roughly handling me and he calls me a little whore and respond in kind.  Our hot sweaty bodies pressed against one another as he finally pins me against the large glass wall over looking the party.  His young powerful cock slamming into my married pussy fucking me as I look down on the large gathering.. somewhere down there my own husband is looking for me as I'm betraying him.....I can feel Marcus hate for Jason....each thrust making me moan and  beg for more.  Each time I hear him call my husband a waste of space, a worthless prick as he's slamming into me again and again.  Pulling my hair, spanking my ass... he's hurting me and the pain is blissful to both of us.

Hours later... several orgasms later I look at Marcus' naked body.... mmmmm, I don't personally hate him...though he's a cocky little fuck.  One thing I know for sure.  I want him to hate Jason as much as he wants especially if he continues to fuck me like that.  I get up on the conference table spreading my legs for him inviting him in for another go.....



-----------
**Father In Law Version**

I've met 'Marcus' several times over the course of my relationship with Jason.  I heard some of the things he'd tell his son but never really directly to me.  I wasn't good enough for his son.  I would destroy his focus, I was a harlot.  Jason studied law and I've met him in my undergrad years.  His father always thought I was a 'distraction' from the vision he had for his son.  The older senator expected his son to follow in his footsteps.  Marcus is a legend in South Carolina.  He's held his seat as Senator for the past 30 years though at this point he's lost the momentum and is far too old to really think of the presidency as an attainable goal.  He was grooming Jason to become just that.

Jason, he adopted son.  He can swing the black votes coming from a proper African american family with strong values.  His hearth felt story of how he never met his real family and such would bring in the soccer moms and in turn a much of the middle class.  

There was a dream damn it 'till that little redheaded whore came into the picture.  Date the girl, fuck the girl... christ gangbang her and her mom and her entire family if you're into it, but don't fucking Marry her!  You marry for power and for politics not for love.

                                  . . .

 I knew how he felt, I knew Marcus hated me....though I'm still trying to piece the events that led me to this... yet here I am my ass red from the spanking he gave me earlier.  I hear him calling me a whore behind me....his cock slamming into me again as all I am able to say in response is letting out a long and loud moan of delight.   I'm on all 4s sitting on the bed like a good little cum puppy feeling Marcus dick slamming into my 'whoring cunt' again and again.  I can feel his hate for me... his distaste at the 'slut'.  I can feel his hands in my hair pulling me back as he uses me again.  ooooooohhhh....yyyessss harder ""Daddy""....

I just need advice on whether this is a reasonable concern to a normal person or just me overthinking things. 

I have anxiety and since summer I have been having headaches. Like consistently, I am currently waiting for a referral to a neurologist but it's slow going. 

I've also been having back pain that I believe is related to a cyst (this is based off of the fact that I have PCOS and I've had cysts in the past.) 

But I'm concerned about something new and I'm afraid to bring it up to my doctor because I don't want her to think I'm a hypochondriac or rather I don't want her to not care about my big problems like my headaches. 

I've had freckles for a long time but I'm concerned now because I think two of them have become slightly raised up? To clarify, these two freckles are not moles but legit freckles. Like the color hasn't changed and they haven't grown as far as I can tell but when I touch them they just feel slightly different. 

Adding to this is that I work at the hospital during the summers as an intern and I often see my doctor while working so I'm afraid if I bring this up to her and it's nothing that she's going to think I'm weird/crazy. 

I also have to figure out if it's worth mentioning to my mom since it's on her insurance and I cannot drive. The same issue pops up with her that I don't want her to think I'm a hypochondriac or bothering her about every little thing. 
   
So is this just my anxiety or  a legitimate problem? The reason I'm worried that this is just my anxiety is because when I first started getting my headaches I kept thinking it was like a brain tumor even though I had no proof. :/

**tl;dr**: I have anxiety that is manifesting itself through my help. Afraid to ask my mom and doctor about a new problem because I don't want them to think my actual issues aren't real. "
3w6pek,1,2015-12-10,To Grad or not to Grad?,TalismanButt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w6pek/to_grad_or_not_to_grad/,"I'm about to graduate with a degree in CS and a degree in Math. All my life I've been adamant about getting my Ph.D., but drawing towards the end of my Bachelor's I think I need a break from school for a year or two. 

I have been looking at all the jobs in the Seattle area, my dream city since I was 15, and I'm noticing that all of the cooler sounding positions like data scientist, graphics engine engineer, VR engineer, and ML stuff require a graduate degree. As a mathematician, these more theory heavy fields are incredibly alluring to me.

Sure I've taken OpenGL graphics, VR, and AI in undergrad, but I don't know if that will be enough to get me a position out of undergrad. I suppose my fear is that I'll end up cornered into the same web dev. stuff I've been doing and dreading for the last two years of my internship.

Has anyone else taken a gap before graduate school? If you could do it over, would you? I've already let the deadlines for most of my top choice schools pass me by for the Fall, but I could stay in my undergrad town and just get my Master's here and Ph.D. elsewhere, but I heard a lot of the CS Ph.D. programs prefer you not have a Master's so that you fulfill the breadth requirement there."
3w6s52,18,2015-12-10,Finding an internship and eventually a career in software dev. with a criminal record.,sheepscum77,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w6s52/finding_an_internship_and_eventually_a_career_in/,"        Hello everyone. Let me start off with some background info. I just turned 25 this month, and I'm 62 credits deep with a 3.4 GPA at the best CS/engineering school in the state. When I was 21 I was arrested while sleeping in my car for a DUI(misdemeanor) and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription(felony). The felony I'd adjudication withheld, meaning I wasn't actually convicted, and I still have all my rights. However, I'm still obligated to check the box. Also, no, I'm not eligible for expungement or a sealed record since both charges occurred in one arrest. 


        Now, the older I get, the more I'm wondering if I'm wasting my time. It's pretty depressing, actually. I've been pretty depressed about it all year. I've been busting my ass taking all math, programming, and science electives, and in the back of my mind lingers the constant worry that I'm fucked for life. I spent my late teens and early twenties heavily addicted to pain killers and xanax, and quit cold turkey almost 4 years ago after the arrest. Despite all of the progress I've made, I can't help but feel like I've been dealt a life sentence. 


        I haven't had a job in two years because of my charges. I've actually been playing poker professionally in that time span, alongside school. On top of classes, it's incredibly stressful, and I'm constantly stressed and depressed/irritable. Working part time 30 hrs a week at some place for $8-$10 an hour is a complete waste of time at my age while trying to be independent. 


        My worst fear is that after I complete my B.S., I won't be able to find a job, and I'll be trapped grinding poker. 


        I'm getting to the point where I have to start worrying about landing an internship. My chances seem pretty slim, having to list the felony and the d.u.i. on applications, with a barren resume as well. 


        If I can't find an internship, I'll have to invest all of my free time working on top notch projects. Thing is, I don't have any free time, between poker and classes. I might have to quit playing poker completely just so I'll have the time, and take out max loans so I can focus on projects till graduation. I'm just so stressed and depressed, I can't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy or at peace. I love CS and programming, it's just my daunting future that worries me. Most nights I can't even sleep thinking about it. 



       Sorry for rambling on, and the wall of text. I feel like Im screwed for life. Any advice would be appreciated. "

Earlier this year there was a lot of heat directed at these channels that distribute and monetize plagarized/stolen content. But everyone agreed that they uploaded VODs quicker. Of course everyone is going to jump to their channels. It's like asking viewers not to watch leaks of trailers or movies. Sure, you provide a better product, but I, like many Dota players are just trying to our fix as fast as possible. 

Please upload faster. You're just losing business if you don't. It is entirely possible to produce quality content fast, considering you have volunteers (interns?), and this is kind of your job. Not a complaint as much as a concern. "

I started sleeping a lot more, or not sleeping at all, not eating, missing my classes, doing poorly because I can't concentrate, etc. I've never had bad thoughts, it's just more of me being unmotivated and just breaking down. I made the phone call to talk to the counselor here and I was feeling really good about this.

I had my initial appointment with an intern who did an indepth questionnaire, which went awesome and I felt really good about it. I met with my actual counselor last week and I felt more lost than I ever was. I'm not saying that I have depression, but a half hour into talking to my counselor about past relationships (because that was the last thing that I broke down about), she said I needed to be put on antidepressants. After telling her that I do not want to be put on any medication, she was confused and asked me ""Well what else would you take to get rid of the depressed feelings?""

I felt lost because I felt like she didn't want to take time and help me through what I'm feeling by doing her job to counsel me. She just jumped to the medication. I've been up all night worrying about my appointment that's this afternoon and how she might not hear me out about how I do not want to be put on medication. I don't want to be put with another counselor because then I'd feel bad about leaving her and I feel like she would feel bad about herself, which is what I hate about me because I'm not being selfish enough in this situation. Also, the waiting list is long at my school.

I want to talk to someone but I don't think counseling is right for me, or maybe just her. I just don't know what I should say to her. My walls are up with her and I don't want that to happen because she is suppose to be there to help me break them down and talk to her about what is going on. But if I just keep my walls up, then she won't think there is a problem and she won't bug me about the medication."

After the point of no return, it became clear that this was not really a non-profit, but an idea that a lady had and wanted help bringing to life.

Anyway, I did very little in the internship, but what I did do looks pretty good on my LinkedIn, so I have it listed. 

The struggle is that the non-profit never took off. The lady had other things come up in her life and she didn't want to do the hard logistical work that was required to make it into a recognized 503(c). So the non-profit died and doesn't exist anymore.

My question is this: How do I best note this on my LinkedIn? I have the position and the description of the things I did on there already, but I don't think it's appropriate for to just put ""ultimately this failed"" on there. All of the website and social media pages have been taken down, so I can't link to anything.

Company A is a solid, well known company with thousands of employees. But not really well known for software engineers. They are offering me a full-time position with a solid starting salary. I like the area its in, I like the company, I just am unsure if the work is truly what I want in the long run and can already see myself applying elsewhere in about 2 years. 

Company B is a smaller company, about 200 employees. I wanted to work here because there work is directly focused on an area of programming that has been my hobby for the past couple years in my free time, and this job would let me turn it into a full time career. They got the whole startup feel but with more job security, the location is again good, and the people are great. They offered me an internship which, upon performance, would turn into a full-time position offer. 

Now if Company B had offered me a full time position, I almost certainly would've taken it immediately. But now I would have to pack up and move to an expensive city on an interns salary ($24/hr) where half goes to rent and half goes to my food/bills for 3 months in the hopes that I get a full time offer and am not left jobless and have to move back home. 

Company A is obviously offering me a solid and stable gig, but I feel like I'll want to move on fast to a new company that will challenge me more as a software engineer.

Though I was young, I remember 9/11 and the institutionalized and widely accepted discrimination that took place after those events. I think it is important to remember during this difficult time that we should not turn our anger at the situation into hatred or marginalization to groups of people. 

I'm saddened by the events that took place but I am hearing things at internship and school that are attacking persons of just Muslim faith (non-radicals and those that have not pledged to ISIS). I am seeing the discrimination and the potential areas of concern firsthand. 

I think that it is a terrible event that happened, and I know it's soon after the event but I'm afraid the media is running away with some of these stories and causing excessive trauma. I am concerned greatly of the impact that will face people that are-- I guess I will say different-- in the future. 

I also think that we need to evaluate at some point what happened to these two individuals to make them so radical and changed them both so drastically. There are mental health implications involved here, there are red flags that went unnoticed, there are areas for improvement and potential preventative care measures that can be implemented to stop this senseless violence and combat any future similar situations. I don't understand why we as professionals are not looking at this from a person-in-environment perspective and practice what we preach?"

 |Brighter colours seem to suggest for me a brighter day, and I hope to infect others with the same idea! Men in drab grey socks are a grim and distressing sight.
[What can be done to save the distinct voice of Channel 4 news ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5d4w?context=5)|Raise your voice! Get a petition going! Tell your MP to do something about it! It's yours, it costs you nothing, and it's genuinely different from anything else on offer.
 |If they sold it off, they wouldn't give you the money, and whatever followed afterwards would not be able to afford Channel 4 News.
[Do you think British newsrooms are diverse enough? Not just ethnicity but it feels like all walks of life aren't really represented in the press. For example lower socio-economic backgrounds and those with disabilities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4tdd?context=5)|Well although I am an upper-middle class twit, I'm an exception in my office. I have watched the newsroom become more and more diverse as time goes by, and I would point to the groundbreaking report we did with the brother of the man accused of stabbing tube passengers in East London, which we secured because we had reporters and producers who came from the communities affected.
[Do you watch BBC News much and what do you make of it if you do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu516a?context=5)|I listen to BBC News more than I watch it, and I think BBC radio news and the news-based programming is exceptional. In all honesty, I have television news on my desk from assorted channels, all day, so I have very little appetite to watch any more of it when I get home.
[Who is the most impressive politician you've talked with before?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu56xm?context=5)|Well, inevitably, Nelson Mandela. But there are others, too: there was an amazing Norwegian foreign minister called Jonas Gahr Støre, who had a brilliant grasp of world affairs and I reckon could yet be a candidate for Secretary General of the United Nations.
[As someone looking to become a journalist what tips have you got for getting into the industry? Also is it worth applying for Student membership of the National Union of Journalists?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4sba?context=5)|Work experience, internships — neither of these will make you any money at all, but they will introduce you to our world, and to people who may become useful contacts when you try to get a job.
 |In the meantime, wherever you are, try to blog or tweet or Facebook what you're seeing. Good luck!
[Will you be returning for season 6?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4gzn?context=5)|My contract forbids me from discussing any of my appearances, but I am still basking in the glow of a red wedding and I love going north!
 |And I am certain... that [winter is coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGjH0FL-OoE).
[Where do you get your ties?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5dir?context=5)|Anywhere I can find them – particularly craft shows – but I have a favourite, who has made ties that I have bought for 30 years, and she's called Victoria Richards and operates out of Peckham – funny? Peckham Rye tie?
[What would you say are the key differences between UK and USA news, if any?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5qdo?context=5)|US news, with notable exceptions (NY Times), is incredible parochial and myopic and despite its sensationalism and absurdity the diversity of the British press does serve to ensure that there is some brilliant reporting across the board.
[Are there any news stories that you've found emotionally difficult to cover?  How do you deal with stories that contain huge human suffering?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4och?context=5)|I found the atrocity in Paris very difficult. I [interviewed a woman doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANfWOBN_LVA) who had tended some of the maimed and dying. She managed to contain her own emotions, but I found tears rolling down my face.
[Jon, do you believe that more news organisations should refer to ISIS as 'Daesh'?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu64sm?context=5)|I think it probably would be a good idea to agree what they're actually called, and I think the more we use the words Islamic and State we play into the prospect that, in some dastardly way, they will come to represent both.
[What do you think of Donald Trump? How will you react if he eventually wins the US presidential election? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5efr?context=5)|I don't think of Donald Trump. I find it the easiest way to get over him, and I think if the rest of the world followed suit, we won't need to worry about him ever becoming President of the United States.
[Hi Jon, thanks for doing this AMA!  What do you think is currently the biggest political problem facing Britain at the moment? And how do you think it might develop? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu58zn?context=5)|Housing and the deep inequality between rich and poor. Particularly between very rich and very poor. I don't think there will be a revolution but it has all the characteristics of what has led to revolution in the past.
[Two Billion Miles sounds like a gripping narrative piece that is painfully relevant in times like this. Was there an event or a person that didn't quite make it onto the show that you're still thinking about and wanted to share with the world? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5jrb?context=5)|I think there's an event every single day that didn't quite make it on to the show but that I wish had sone so. The refugee crisis is still a crisis even when we don't show it and that is true of so much else - Gaza, Boko Haram's activities in northern Nigeria, I could go on more.
[What event have you reported that surprised you as it saw the biggest social change despite it possibly being not the biggest story at the time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4ll4?context=5)|Although I knew it was massive, 9/11 created a far bigger social and political impact than I imagined at the time.
 |It cast negative shadows over many Muslim communities and we are all still struggling to reverse that.
[How much of what happened in 2001 do you see resonating today in the wake of Paris?  Edit: I feel special now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5pyg?context=5)|I think 9/11 and the consequent wars have all infected the world we live in to a far greater extent than we even begin to understand.
[It's a matter of record that the UK Secret Intelligence Service tried and failed to recruit you in the mid 70s. Have you ever regretted your decision to turn them down given how the nature of threats to the UK have changed, and did they ever try again? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5b56?context=5)|How do you know I really did turn them down?! Maybe I was just conning you.
 |But seriously, I did turn them down. I have never regretted it, I couldn't possibly have been a journalist and a spook on the side, and nothing that has happened since has made me change my mind.
[What's your opinion on the media providing a platform for organisations like ISIS through publicising their content, or for racist public figures such as Donald Trump? Should the media publish everything or should we not provide a platform for racist, hate-filled comments?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4vy7?context=5)|Well, the fundamental is that we must strive to protect free speech and that includes having to put up with people like Donald Trump. BUT there are laws that govern racism, homophobia and other grim conditions and those laws should be upheld at every turn.
[How do you feel about the mainstream medias lack of objectivety? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5j2n?context=5)|I think in some ways it creates a bit of absurdity, but then you could argue that in a capitalist system, somebody's got to put the money up and make a profit. I'm glad I don't.
[How many times have people made stupid jokes about you ""knowing nothing"" in the past 6 years or so?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4yyz?context=5)|My estimate would be in excess of 100,000 times. And the funny thing is, lots of people still think they're the first person to do it.

She is a teacher at a somewhat underprivileged school, but there are some bright students that have shown interest in the engineering field. I'm trying to figure out what I can say to these kids or some things I can show them, but I'm not sure what. I want to engage the kids and get them interested. Any ideas?

3w943h,11,2015-12-10,Depressed and needing some support,augustautumn,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/3w943h/depressed_and_needing_some_support/,"I am a long time lurker here. I have stories but not nearly as bad some of you guys here. All in all, I ended up depressed with some anxiety issues growing up around the typical Asian household. My parents aren't bad people. They don't hound me nearly as much. But I grew up having those high expectations for myself. I saw the struggle and negatives of being in a typical Asian household and I wanted out. I didn't want to struggle like they did or fail and be around the people who would not let you forget it. Except that I did fail, or I stumbled badly. I graduated with a degree in Accounting but have only done unpaid internships and low paying contractor work in the industry. I have suffered from depression for my entire adult life with signs of vulnerability to it when I was younger. Now I'm not blaming my parents for how I turned out but I can't deny that they had a big role in how I developed over the years. Now that I had this big scare with a real interview this entire week and feeling like my heart would jump out of my chest and run away from me, I realize now that I need to get my life together. Yeah, some of you guys may roll your eyes. But for the past few years out of school, I haven't had the best people around me. The few friends I do have are depressed as well. With parents who only shit on you with no real insight on how to succeed besides doing well in school, I wasn't prepared for the real world. I always skirted by and faked it and I didn't end up learning anything whether academically or socially. So I need some help. I'm looking for a pen pal of some sorts who is willing to hear me out. I literally have no support system in real life. I'm fairly desperate for some real talk.

Now that I've been scared out of my comfort zone. I have an interview tomorrow that I am planning to ace or basically do the best I could possibly do after hiding from the real world for so long. If I bomb it, I plan on keeping in contact with the person. I haven't been able to sleep all week and I don't think I will until I either get the job or I get a rejection email. It's all good with me. I don't plan on sulking in my bed afterward. I plan on moving forward but I need someone to remind me. It's a big thing to ask especially from a faceless account on Reddit. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could find it elsewhere. Depression lies and it has really changed my mindset concerning things with myself. I have been active in the accounting field for years but yet, I feel like I have done nothing. I'm not sure if there's ever a real sign on if you're doing something right. So I'm hoping to work together being okay with that.

I have done some research on some old classmates and alumni from my school who did not go the conventional route of Big 4 to CPA to private industry. I have updated myself on the requirements for the CPA. I already own several self study guides for the CPA and I'm ready to really start studying. I've realized that the lack of support for my field really hindered my own push toward achieving this goal of becoming a CPA. I'm tired of hearing about how hard accounting classes are or the jokes about how a lot of marketing people were former accounting majors or accounting is so boring or anything else negative about accounting. That's what I had to put up with every since I said I was studying accounting. I want some positive feedback in the field or real feedback. I want to speak to motivated individuals and not slackers.

I lost quite a few years of my life to depression. But I still have the lingering issues of not feeling good enough and that's the Asian upbringing. The depression just exacerbated that issue. If any of you guys have dealt with this, can you let me know your methods on how to get better? I have sought out professional help through my school's counseling center when I was still a student. I was assigned to the only other asian person in the department. She was a nice person but completely unhelpful with my issues. My depression was made worse when I suddenly lost an important member of my family. That's when I truly gave up on life. But I do not have the best health insurance so it's been hard to find someone else who would understand the issues with an asian upbringing. So I want to try to tackle this without professional help as of right now. The amount of change that the scare of an interview did for me was incredible so I can see myself doing better with my own will. 

I hope to get a job by June next year so I can start paying off my loans, have some savings, and move out of my parents' place. I know that once I do, I'll only keep getting better. I've been feeling too guilty for wanting to live my life after the death of the family member. I always feel so guilty for wanting a life for myself and I hate that my parents instilled that in me. My life at home is awful really. I have trouble sleeping and my parents stay up until after midnight. Even when I was in school, I always had to wait until after they were asleep for me to sleep. They just don't care that I have to wake up early for class or being so sleep deprived does nothing for knowledge retention. The walls are paper thin and my bedroom is right next to the TV. Everything else I can avoid like their dinner times and the food issues. But I can't avoid not being able to sleep. No, I cannot move out yet because I literally have no money. I cannot crash at a friend's place. I can't escape just quite yet. They just really irritate me. "

My brains's problem-solving part goes off after like hour of doing stuff in Indesign, and stuff like streching, 5 min pauses help for few minutes, then everything goes back...

Do you encounter this problem ?  

I tried some techniques against this, such as do more sketching and spend time on computer by just necessary executive work, but at some point you are forced to leave paper&amp;pencil and continue clicking...

3w9f1o,522,2015-12-10,An analysis of what went wrong with the recent update from a software developer and former games studio employee,Study_Smarter,GlobalOffensive,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3w9f1o/an_analysis_of_what_went_wrong_with_the_recent/,"Just to give a bit of background and clarification from the title:  I have two years of commercial software development experience.  15-months of that was at a games studio (a one-year internship that got extended).  This post is not to discuss the merits of the R8 or any of the other balance changes, but to discuss *why* the alleged imbalance now exists, and to ask the community for suggestions on how to ensure it doesn't happen again (within the context of how Valve works as a company).  I also do not work at Valve, and never have.
  
First Issue:  
Valve don't appear to hire dedicated QA testers (they have vacancies for everything except this on their careers page).  From the outside looking in, it appears they adopt the mentality of ""Developers can test their own work.""  Now, theoretically, this is possible, but in reality, it doesn't turn out well (which we, as Valve's users, have just experienced).  However, there are a lot of benefits to a dedicated QA team, because they:  
  
A. Find the use cases the developer didn't think about.  (i.e., holding right-click and tapping left-click to pre-charge your R8 shot).  
B. Hold the developers accountable for their work prior to launch.  
C. Maintain a rigorous QA process that ensures bugs don't get into the wild, existing functionality is not broken, and quality remains high.  
  
Valve, quite clearly, does not have a rigorous QA process.  If they did, this would have never happened.  
  
  
Second Issue:  
We appear to have the issue of design-by-committee.  Nobody is anybody else's boss at Valve.  Seriously.  Check out their employee handbook: [http://valvesoftware.com/jobs/](http://valvesoftware.com/jobs/)  
  
At the games studio I worked at, we had a lead game designer for each game, who was responsible for making design decisions (such as adding a new weapon, altering spray patterns, etc.).  This person always had decades of industry experience, and a great knowledge of both the games mechanics and its playerbase.  Sometimes the game designer was wrong, and that became apparent when our dedicated QA team (and often, the rest of the team) did play tests.  We'd reason with the game designer and have him/her present his/her case, but ultimately s/he had the final say.  The benefit of this was that it is hard to find something that pleases everybody, and often compromises just leave everyone with a lot of shit they didn't want in order to accommodate a little bit of what they did want.  This is bad.  It leads to lots of bad shit being made.  
  
Valve having no official management structure leads to design by committee.  Notice how certain elements of the R8 are actually a really good idea, but combined it just doesn't work.  This is a *classic* example of design-by-committee gone wrong.  Bob wants a longer time-till-fire in a weapon, Sally wants a new pistol, and Liz wants another one-hit-kill weapon.  Tada, they compromise with the R8.  If a lead game designer had the majority of the power, it would have never happened.  
  
So how can Valve, as a games studio, improve?  It's actually really difficult to say, because a lot of the stuff that resulted in this update is also, in other situations, beneficial.  However, I think somebody at the company needs to step up and say, ""My job is to create a rigorous QA process across all of our games.""  Of course, nobody would have to follow that person, because nobody is anybody's boss, but that person could get buy-in from everyone, and as long as they retained solo ownership of the QA process project, it'd avoid any design-by-committee shortcomings.  Valve could also nominate a lead game designer for each game.  That person doesn't necessarily have to be anyone's boss.  
  
Thanks for taking the time to read.  This post has two objectives, to be informative and to provoke constructive criticism from the community.  What do you all think?  What else do you think Valve could do to improve?  If we keep this constructive, we'll all benefit :-).  
  
Edit 1: Accidentally submitted my first draft whilst closing the ""big editor"" window.  Reworded some stuff and fixed some formatting.  
Edit 2: Formatting.  Rewording.  Removing redundancies.  
Edit 3: Reworded first sentence on Valve's QA hiring.  Added the words 'appear' and 'dedicated' for clarification.  
Edit 4: Fixed typo and spacing.  Really regretting the initial, accidental submission :-P.  
Edit 5: I just want to add, I do not work at Valve, and never have.  This analysis is like analyzing a train wreck to figure out why it crashed.  We can't be 100% sure on anything, but we can probably get a good idea as to what happened by putting the pieces together, and increase safety measures to prevent future wrecks.  
Edit 6: I'm off to bed.  I'll reply to comments in ~10 hours :-)."

3w9w7b,1,2015-12-10,Dorms - Inspiration or Obstacle? How about both.,amalia13,NinjaEssays,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaEssays/comments/3w9w7b/dorms_inspiration_or_obstacle_how_about_both/,"College Dorms: An Inspiration or an Obstacle for Students' Progress?
	When you can’t afford college, usually the decision for living off campus is out of the picture. From what I saw, all my friends who didn’t have the money, chose to live at home with their families. Sometimes I wish I had done this myself. I realize I probably would have saved a lot of money, wouldn’t have worked as much and would’ve been able to see my family more. Instead, not letting my financial situation affect my decision, I chose to go off to live in the dorms. Only a 15 minute drive from my house, I chose to live with this new sense of independence. I could go home (my dorm) whenever I wanted to, went out with whoever I wanted to and in general, started a new life of experience. I’m not sure what inspiration I was looking for but there sure were obstacles of learning what is really good for me. 	
	Inspiration. We all seek it. When I decided to live in the dorms, it wasn’t because I was seeking inspiration. In my mind, it was simply to gain experience about college life. But the thing about inspiration is that it usually comes unexpectedly. It happened for me with boys, with school, work, my career, internship ideas, goals, dreams, and with how I started to treat and eventually care for myself. I somehow found myself making all these connections in clubs, classes, and events and found someone to call my best friend. With everyone I spoke to, something in my own thoughts shifted. Every opinion I have ever had, I can tell you have all changed in some aspect. My mind was open to more, to new things and that is an inspiration in itself. To be able to let your guard down, hear what others have to say and really learn about how different yet similar the world can be. 
	We all have made similar mistakes living in dorms. Maybe getting too loud and someone calling the CA on you, having problems with your roommate, choosing to have sex (although this one doesn’t have to necessarily be considered a mistake) and many other little things. But when you are coming right out of high school, it seems a little unfair to be expected to automatically be adults. I’m not speaking for myself since I did grow up completing my own chores but there are many people out there who didn’t grow up washing their own clothes, cleaning up their room or even cooking dinner. Students who now have to learn to do all this when they move out go through a bit of a challenge. Not even that, it’s a learning process. It’s a small obstacle that once you overcome it, there is this sense of achievement in knowing you really are learning how to be on your own. You are growing up and I’ll just say, that is an inspiration for the high school students at your old school or any younger siblings who are probably following in your footsteps. 
	Being homesick. You’re lying if you say you were never homesick once you moved into the dorms. For at least a minute, there is that moment of wondering if you made the right decision. But if you’re like me, you snapped out of it within thirty seconds because you thought of how much fun you were about to have being free. But for some, being homesick can become a serious issue. I’ve seen it first-hand where a friend of mine freshman year would have panic attacks from how much she wanted to be back home. She was from out of state so every week she would try to plan a flight back home. She was surrounded by good friends and had a supportive roommate and together we helped her get through her first semester. At the end, she did go back home. But before going back, she made sure she had a plan. She questioned what she was really going to school for and did continue her education back home. It was something small but she knew her family was her inspiration and she did want to be near them more than anything. And it is perfectly okay to want to be near your family Out of state and living in dorms isn’t for everyone, but sometimes trying the experience is the only way you can find out for sure. 
	By this time, you’ve probably noticed how many random things I can bring up. But that’s the way my mind tends to think. With a million spiraling ideas. But I believe that is a lot of college students. I do believe that is how many of our minds are when we are first moving into our dorms. Are we going to like our roommate, can we really do this, can I handle this? There is a lot to put on your plate when we barely know how classes are going to be. But dorm life will always be an obstacle in one way or another. One we can learn from and eventually share our experiences about with others. As for inspiration, when we overcome our obstacles is when we will realize how much work we have done for ourselves without even seeing it.

I graduated with a civil engineering degree from UCLA back in 2010. It's hard for me to admit, but I didn't have a very good GPA at all, and partied a little too much thinking, as long as I have a degree I will be able to find a job, but unfortunately that naivety has plagued me to this day. Currently I am working in an unfulfilling IT position and am desperate to get back to working as an engineer.

I try to apply to many positions and any interviews I do manage to get, usually get the same response, that I do not have any experience in the field. I unfortunately did not apply to any internships when in school because I didn't think I would need them, again a decision that has plagued me to this day.

So my question to you all is, what can I do to gain experience and prove that I am able to do the work if given the opportunity? What can I do to show employers that i am capable of doing the work, even though i have been out of school for 5 years now. Every job I have ever done, I haven't felt like its a good match for me, but I feel getting an engineering job is all that will fulfill me professionally and any advice anyone can give me would be extremely valuable.

Thank you for reading this."

I am really confused as to what to do and am in dire need of advice on whether or not to pursue PA school, and if so, how can I boost my chances of getting in?

Here is my background: 

I absolutely love caring for people in need.  During high school and my undergrad, I spent much of my time volunteering in hospitals and homeless shelter, being a medical research intern, and secretary of my pre-med honor society.  I decided towards the end of my undergrad that I wanted to become an elementary teacher instead since I felt I would build more rapport  with students and their families for years to come, making a bigger impact.  I went directly to graduate school and obtained my Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction since I wanted to be a master educator.  During that time, I also went off to Peace Corps, only to leave early since I was engaged right before I left and felt I couldn't commit to the 27 months.  Upon returning home, I became a teacher for two and half years, and realized I wanted to amount to something much more.  I love being with my students, but I felt I would make greater impact in the lives of many in the medical profession.  As a teacher, I felt under valued, disrespected, and underpaid.  

At this time, I have opted to tutoring at a learning center and substitute teaching as I try to navigate as to what to do with my career.  I am also married now, 29, and my husband is thinking of starting a family in the near future...  

I feel that if I am to pursue becoming a PA, I would need to put starting my family life on hold another 3 to 4 years.  I still need to take 5 science classes to meet the pre-requisite requirements, take my GRE, and build upon my medical background (considering applying at the local hospital as a PCA, shadowing a PA, or volunteering in the hospital again) before applying.  I still have student loans to pay off so I am afraid the tuition and fees of PA school will be an extra heavy burden on our family.  

I feel that if I don't pursue PA now, I will never get a better chance to.  I don't want to live a life of regret in that I could have become a Physician Assistant.  I just don't know if it is the right time for my family.  My husband is also at a crossroads.  He feels that we are ready to start settling down and start a family.  He is already making a six figure income, and if I just stick to teaching, it should be more than enough for our future family.  

What are your thoughts?  

I am also afraid that I am not a successful candidate for PA school since I made  Bs in chemistry, and C in organic chemistry in my undergrad.  My Biology grades are A and A&amp;P I is an A-.  I have yet to take Immunology, Genetics, A&amp;P II, and Microbiology.  I am hoping that since I love biology so much and have done well in the past, that I would manage well in the other courses.  I am not too sure if I should take Organic Chemistry again since I made a C.  I really loathe O-Chem.  Thoughts?

My plan if I am to pursue PA school is the following:

I was thinking of taking Microbiology, A&amp;P II in the Spring, while working as a PCA at the local hospital on PRN (7pm-7am).  I am not too sure if it is a wise idea working while taking those classes, but I figured it would give me more patient care experience to make me a better candidate for PA school.  Then take Genetics and Immunology in the summer before applying by September 1st.  Thoughts?

Also what would you suggest: being a PCA, shadowing PAs, or volunteering at the hospital in the ER? Or, which of the two would increase my chances?

Thank you again in advance.  I wish I had decided on PA school beforehand as I was pursuing grad school, but life happens.  I just hope that in making the decision, I would be satisfied with it in the long term.  Thank you."

3wbfb3,25,2015-12-10,[M/F]Asking Mary to be my girlfriend,throwaway83495720934,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3wbfb3/mfasking_mary_to_be_my_girlfriend/,"I first met Mary at a work conference during my internship. She's got the cute girl next door look down to a tee, sly and charismatic, jet black hair which she tied up at times to look more professional. Brown eyes that hinted at the mischief underneath. Her business clothes hid a athletic frame and a hinted at the set of perfect C cups that hid under her blazer. Her casual giggles let me know she liked me, and we flirted briefly at the conference, trying not to make our intentions too obvious to our other colleagues. Although I was able to get her number, she lived across the country, and the ritualistic dance, phone tag, and texting continued for months thereafter.

She was cautious at first but it was a drunken phone call on her birthday that finally revealed that she liked me. The harmless flirting became realistic plans, and soon I was on a plane to Texas to see her. I had planned to ask her out with an elaborate scheme of personalized note cards, and also teased about kissing her at the airport.

She was waiting for me at the bottom of the escalators when I arrived. The confidence I had over the phone evaporated and was replaced by a lump in my throat. She was no longer in the stuffy suit, and looked even more adorable. With a cute tank top that gave the slightest hint to her cleavage below and yoga tights that showed off her figure. Her bangs falling over her baby face. ""hi!"" we both said awkwardly as we hugged. I clumsily made an attempt to kiss her as we separated from the hug. She pushed me away with that trademark giggle.  ""you dared me!"" I said, trying to hide my clumsiness. I grabbed her hand and held it in a poor effort the salvage the awkward hello, and we walked to her car. 

We arrived to a pristinely made hotel room after a short drive, the queens size bed being center piece. We sat down on the bed and laughed at ourselves, two college kids meeting for only the second time in a strange hotel room. I broke a long silence by giving her the cards I made her and asking her to be my girl friend, and she said yes, letting out another giggle. it was only then that we kissed, laying face to face on the still made bed.

""Gosh I can't remember the last time I did this she said."" ""did what?"" I responded slyly, as I slipped my tongue into her mouth. She gave in and pressed her body into mine, our hands fumbling over each other, tugging on the other's clothes. I was admittedly getting carried away, my hands cupping her breasts, and then exploring lower, reaching under her panties and to my surprise, finding it soaked.  She jumped and grabbed my hand. ""stop, I have something to tell you, she said."" A thousand thoughts run through my head, I panicked, I must have moved too fast, I'm an idiot. ""well.. this is kind of embarrassing, but I am not exactly what you would call experienced"". silence. ""you are a virgin?"" I asked. She nodded shyly.

""would you like me to stop?"" ""no, I want it"" she said, that was my que and my hands slowly trace their way back down... I played with her panty lines, noting the feel of the lacy fabric.  going slower this time, tracing my fingers over her panties and feeling the warmth radiating off of her. I pulled the fabric aside and pushed my index fingers between her lips. Instantly my fingers were covered with her juices. I bit my lips, my cock now rock hard as I sink my fingers deeper into her, letting her warmth swallow the length of my finger. she let out a visible moan and clutched me tigher. I pushed my tongue into her gaping mouth, curling my fingers up and feeling her legs close tighter around my arm. ""is this okay?"" I asked, she nodded, her eyes closed, still clutching me. I sank a second finger into her, curling them up so I can press them against her g spot. ""fuck..."" She squirmed and whimpered in excitement. It was the first time that I've heard her curse.

I couldn't take it anymore, I got on my knees and pulled her tights off. Even her black lacy panties couldn't hide the wet spot she made. I hooked my arms under her knees and pulled her towards me, lowering my head between her thighs. I pushed my nose and lips into her wet panties and tasted her through the fabric. She instantly tightened her legs around me, her hips slowly gyrating into my face. I responded by forcing her legs apart and pulling her panties aside, my lips touched her naked pussy for the first time and I ran my tongue between her pussy lips..

I knew I wanted her, all of her. I pulled her panties off with one arm, as I repositioned myself on top of her. There was no words exchanged, she breathed heavily against my neck as I pushed my now throbbing cock against her clit, our juices oozed out in between, I tried my best to be gentle, watching as the head of my cock slowly disappeared into her. But as I pushed, I felt the tightest pussy pushing back. Mary's moans turned into screams, and I gave a final thrust as her lips gave way. Her hand dug into my back as my cock filled her up.

I gave only a few more thrusts before she had to stop from the pain. We laughed a bit and cleaned up the now mess of sheets around us. I made a few crude jokes about the blood and the cleaning lady before she playfully punched me. We got ready to go out for the night, but that wasn't the last time I had her before bed time. Happy to share more of our stories if you guys are interested.

I get really nervous before i do something important.. like my heart races and i cant think straight. Ive been sent to the ER because of this.

I am scared as hell to contact my former friends/ professors esp. Now that i need to ask them to be my character references. Ive also dodged a lot of employment opportunities because im afraid to be interviewed and be rejected. Also, whenever i imagine social interaction.. i just freeze and get scared..

I wanted to start a business but i worry constantly on how i will market the product to people to the extent that i will just shove those ideas off and wont work on it.
When i think of the future, thats when my anxiety goes overdrive because i feel stuck and worthless. I wasnt like this before, i was a cheerful, motivated and driven girl who had her goals waiting to be achieved. What triggered this was when i failed to meet my sales quota in college because i didnt sell the product enough to people because i was scared of rejection.

My mom dismisses my plea for help and it isnt helping me at all.

I'm a 22 year old male and currently finishing up my last semester at a university in California. I was told this morning that I would have to be finding a job elsewhere as I am hired as an ""intern status"" and as soon as I finish school, I can no longer be working with the company. I was working part-time when school had started and full-time hours during the summer prior to school. My start date was in late June of this year. 

Around the beginning of November, my supervisor had asked me when my last day would be. Convo going something like this:

Supervisor: Any thoughts on when your last day would be?

Me: I didn't know I was being let go..?

S: Oh if you're an intern, you must be a student in order for you to continue working here.

Me: I see, are there any opportunities for full-time here at this office? I would love to continue working here.

S: Let me look into that for you.

***fast forward a few weeks, now in mid November***

S: So I have good news, you don't have to be a student to stay on board as an intern! So yay!

Me: Whew, nice. (This gave me more time to think about what I want to do in terms of try and stay with the company or if I should look elsewhere as I've already almost been let go abruptly.)

***fast forward to today 12/10***

S: When you're done, let's meet briefly

Me: -finishes work up- Ok, what's up?

S: I'm sorry to inform you but I verified and found out you do indeed have to be a student in order to stay on. And I apologize our office is not looking to hire any full-time at this point in time.

Is this just the end of the line for me? I figured an employer would have to give me a reasonable amount of time for me (the colloquial ""2 weeks notice"" that I hear often in the workplace) to collect my things and allow myself time to maybe look for other work without having to have a break in employment status. Are there resources for me to seek out in terms of unemployment, etc.?

I officially left at age 24, now 26, and I've come a long way since I left.  At first I was scared, confused, not sure of who I was or why I left.

Now I am back in school (got accepted into University) and putting my life together.  I'm not nearly as emotionally down as I was back then, and I feel much more ""myself.""

I was a born again, tongue praying, charismatic christian from age 15 to 24, and I was obsessed.  I moved to Colorado Springs, CO to attend New Life Church as an intern (YES, the Ted Haggard church for anyone perceptive), and I spent HOURS a week there.  The church was known for its elaborate music, lights, sound and powerful preaching.  I was absorbed in it, and ended up being emotionally manipulated.  I transitioned from a boy to a man in that world.  It was where I first pursued goals, had my first sexual experiences (against rules, might I add), had my first serious heartbreak.  I was engaged to be married only for the church to recommend me to call off my wedding one month before.  I was such a believer that I accepted without question.

Eventually, I left, recognizing that the church was harming my life more than helping.  Now that I'm out, I can look back and process the whole experience with some distance and some sobermindedness.  And I'm grieving, in a way.  I'm not old, but I'm older, and I realize that I lost my late teenage years and early 20s in that world.  All the music, friends, relationships I had are pretty much gone.  The world is a much more quiet, if peaceful place for me now.  

And I feel a sense of pain.  I wonder how much of it is missing the religion, and how much of it is simply grieving my youth.  Leaving at age 24, I felt so much pressure to suddenly GROW UP.  Take responsibility for my life.  And I miss that old, idealized world.  Again, I'm trying to figure out how much of that is related to the religion, and how much of it is just getting older.   

Not sure what I hope to accomplish by sharing besides someone else hearing me vent.  Has anyone else gone through similar experiences?"

Just transferred to a decent state university with a 3.85 GPA. I had always planned on pursuing the academic route, so my current situation is pretty depressing.

This semester has been incredibly horrible for me, I basically have experienced a very rough patch in my personal life (including temporary homelessness and depression), this impacted my grades severely. It's looking like I'm going to make 2 B's and at least one C, with one bordering on a D, depending on my final score tomorrow. (Calculus I, which I would think would be a horrible class to fail on a transcript) This will effectively drop my GPA close to a 3.2. I feel like I have, in one semester, ruined any chance at actually pursuing a meaningful graduate education, because I have diminished my chances at getting into a desirable program. (Was wanting to do something in computational neuroscience) I want some opinions or maybe stories of people actually coming out on top from a similar situation.

End of my undergraduate education, I could have a 3.7ish GPA, and I plan on actually getting involved in research next semester. (Had a small internship so far, but it was only five weeks and probably not worth much in the long run.) I am worried that this horrible semester will haunt me forever and ruin any chance at me being competitive.

So... Should I throw in the towel? If not, where do I start rebuilding my academic career so I can get back on track to applying for graduate school in 2 years?"

I love what we do, how we do it, and what it involves. The startup took a pretty big chance bringing me in, but it's been great so far. I am 'interning' until February, and then we will reassess my contributions to the team and hopefully I will continue working with them with a slight pay increase.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Here is where the struggle begins, I recently got an offer for a summer internship with a different company, company Y. They are offering substantially more pay, but the work isn't exactly what I want to be doing and it also seems like it may be more monotonous and boring.

Basically, should I potentially take the risk at work for X and have more fun while I'm still young and can still be supported by my parents, or take risks later and take a less risky internship now?"
3wcwxt,3,2015-12-11,I [20F] want to maintain a friendship with and be supportive of my ex [23M] but not sure of the right way of approaching/executing it.,candyapplez_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wcwxt/i_20f_want_to_maintain_a_friendship_with_and_be/,"Background: I am a 20F university student that is currently on internship working with various construction companies. From my job, I met my ex as he was a construction worker. We’ve known each other for 8 months and had a relationship for about 3 of those months (ended last month), which did not work out but stayed friends. From my pov, I feel like we were only attracted to each other as we spent 10 hr+ days together, 7 days a week  (construction life) as well as being the only two people in our age group. 


It pretty much went down hill as soon as he got laid off because its now winter/off season where we live. Now, I knew that he has a very bad gambling addiction, smoked weed everyday, and did drugs occasionally, but it was curbed when we were dating/friends because we were both so busy with work. He did express that he wanted to change – eventually (without me pushing anything), and wanted my help/support. I never understood the full extent of it until he had free time, and gambled his entire last paycheck and bonus in one night. As well, he admitted that he was dealing drugs now that he didn’t have a stable source of income. 


Communication slowed down, and we agreed to be friends but I do feel like I’m putting in most of the effort in keeping the conversation going. I do genuinely care about his well-being as a friend, as well he doesn’t have a very supportive network because his family is heavily religious (and would greatly disprove of his habits) and his friends are living the same lifestyle. He avoids seeing me face –to-face, but has no problem with texts/calls. 


The lack of effort on his end makes me want to leave it behind me because I feel like my efforts are futile, but in the past he really did seem genuine about changing his habits, and I did promise back then to be supportive. I feel like if I can make a difference I should, but don’t know how to approach it without overstepping my boundaries as a friend. 

I feel that the fact that he acknowledges that he does have a problem and wants to change it is a good sign. But his worst problem is his lack of follow through – he knows what he wants but not how to get it/put the effort in getting it. A good example is that he wants to finish school, but puts it off constantly because he never has money.


My friends already see this guy as a dead-beat and bad news, and advise me to just stay away. Reddit what do you think? 




   
**tl;dr**: I feel like I am over any lingering feeling for my ex, but want to have a supportive role in his down-spiraling lifestyle. Don’t know if it’s pushing my boundaries as a friend, but can’t stand by and watch it happen. "

3wdjr9,1,2015-12-11,Thoughts on university foundation years?,nextgRival,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wdjr9/thoughts_on_university_foundation_years/,"I've been on this sub for a while and I've been researching the benefits of university education, so I came to realise the importance of extracurricular stuff (internships, programming clubs, competitions, hackathons and so on and so on). I had originally completely dismissed the concept of ""foundational year"" courses (courses that ""prepare"" you for the actual CS course), because they seemed like a waste of time, but when I thought about it, all the university related opportunities are still (or should be still) present - career related options, socialising with tech people, joining programming clubs and stuff like that. I've been wondering if this is actually worth an year of someone's life or is it better to just get on into the actual Computer Science course? I'd be very happy to know you guys' opinion on this. Lastly, sorry about this not being completely directly related to salaries/companies/business, as I am sure you'd enjoy such a conversation more, but this topic is also related to CS careers so it should hopefully be fine.



**tl;dr** I've got an offer for a CS programme from a decent university (City University London), but I got an offer for a foundational year + CS programme from an another decent university /it also has the Russel Group label attached to it/ (Queen Mary). I am wondering if the second offer provides me with any significant benefit."

This is my original post!

It's been a long ten days. So many things have happened. Jameson has been wearing underwear all week and only a diaper to go to bed. He has done so well with pooping and peeing in the potty. I really needed diapers when I put them on my list but I took them off because I really think he's doing well. We have enough for night time for over a month. This is great news. I am ready for this diaper thing to be done with. Haha. Anyone else who has ever potty trained a child when it wasn't easy can relate I'm sure. 

Jameson and I are doing crafts today. We made holiday masks. I tried to get him to sit still for a picture. HAHAHA No.. He's so excited and jumping. He wont sit still for pictures. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/oB9o5) This is the best I could get. lol

Anywho so far we are getting a super fun Christmas outfit. We would really appreciate it if we could get something else for under the tree that is a toy he can open up and play with or maybe some books we can read. He has a few stocking stuffers from a lady down the street. She brought some over for us the other day. It was the sweetest thing. I dont know what they are but they're small presents. It looks like a few matchbox cars and something else. That woman has a good heart. I met her this past year while taking Jameson for a walk. We had just had two of my back teeth pulled and I have zero ibuprofen or anything and I was in so much pain and just walking with the baby and he stopped to play with her grandchildren and she saw my mouth and saved my entire day. She really did. Jameson and I are going to paint something for her. I was thinking about giving her one of my pictures that I've painted. 

Jameson loves to play Othello and Connect Four with me. He hasn't quite gotten the concept just yet but we are still working on it. Chess will be right around the corner once he gets Othello! That's pretty exciting. He's a wicked smart kid. He's so excited for Santa to come. 

I never know what to say and I feel like I've rambled enough. If there's any more questions please feel free to ask. We need help because I am out of a job at the moment. I had a paid internship that fell through. I'm a full time student going for information technology. Plan on going to a 4 year at some point. School money wont kick in until January. Thank you so much!!

Merry Christmas

EDIT: Gifted toys, a book, pj's, christmas outfit. It looks like we have reached our five limit. This is excellent. Thank you so much. What I had wanted to get him was that track set. We found some of the bigger items at a tag sale this summer and he has gone crazy over the larger pieces. But we need some more of the smaller pieces so I wanted to get him that track set. I have it all set up in his room and we always need more tracks to lay out. BUT, he did need a book. I mean, i want to buy him ALL the books but I really think the track set would be best. It's something that he can play with regularly with me, by himself, or with other friends. We do have books and sometimes I get sick of reading the same ones but I think we can make do. He got this book called ""The Little Old Lady Who Wasn't Afraid Of Anything"" It's an excellent book. He would act out the actions in it. I loved it. I even brought it to his daycare and I would read to the kids and I had them involved in the actions too. Oh it was so fun. He got it in August. We read that book every single day I swear to you up until Halloween before I was like, okay... we have to find a new one. We have to. We just have to. lol. We haven't found a book like that one yet but he does enjoy pete the cat and some other random books we have. Anyway, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am grateful. I appreciate this. Thank you so much. &lt;3"

**Demographics:**

* White, Jewish male with Moldovan citizenship living in Germany

* Go to an IB-only international school

* Will not request financial aid

* First generation

**Intended major(s): Economics**

**Academics:**

* **UW GPA: 3.78** &lt;--- Biggest worry

* UC GPA: ~4.2-ish

* ACT: 35 w/ 28 Writing (36 Writing Superscored) (English: 35 Math: 34 Reading: 34 Science: 35)

* SAT: 2160 (single sitting) (Reading 720, Math 780, Writing 660 w/ 8 Essay)

* SAT II: Math II: 780, German Listening: 730 (lol), English Lit: 610 (lol)

* IB Predicted: 44/45

* iGCSE: A in CompSci, Math, English Lang. (A+), Spanish (A+), and a B in German and English Lit.

* Class rank: Not reported officially but it is in the counselor letter. My class is EXTREMELY competitive - best class the school ever had in its 25 years - and I'm in only the 20th percentile.

**Coursework: My school only offers the IB Diploma program and does not designate honors courses.**

* 9th Grade: Highest level English/German/Spanish. Other courses only had one option.

* 10th Grade: Highest level Math, highest level English/German/Spanish. Other courses only had one option.

* 11/12th Grade: Physics, Economics, CompSci HL, English A1, German A1, Math SL

tl;dr: Most rigorous

**Awards:**

* Honor Roll

* Best in Economics - 12th Grade

**Extracurriculars:**

* Ran an online currency resale business with a partner (we coded an autobuyer for FIFA Ultimate Team and then sold the trading profits online. Together, we probably made around $7000 in two years, so $3500/person) (9-10)

* Risky Common App/UC Prompt 2 essay about being the captain of a semi-pro CS:GO team (see [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3c7c6l/how_are_esports_viewed_in_an_application/). Should I include this as an EC?)

* Solid UC Prompt 1 essay about coming from an ever-changing world and hence not having plans for the future and just being adaptable

* Feel confident in my supplements, especially the ""Why NYU/Columbia"" and Harvard's topic of your choice

**Rec Letters:**

Obviously I haven't actually seen them so I'm just going off of my feeling and what my counselor has told me:

* 10/10 amazing from CompSci teacher

* 5/10 meh from Physics teacher

* 7/10 solid from Economics teacher

* 7/10 solid from prior head of secondary education (K-12 school)

* 11/10 incredible counselor report. He told me he had to tinker with the formatting to fit it all on two pages - the limit is one.

**Schools:**

* Columbia College/Harvard

* UC Berkeley/UCLA/UCSD

* Northwestern

* NYU CAS (demonstrated interest by visiting)

* Boston University

Additionally, someone from my class got accepted Columbia ED today, and she was a literally perfect applicant: 4.0 GPA, 2160 SAT, incredible ECs, the best rec letters ever and presumably amazing essays. There's no way I'm going to be able to live up to her in any regard except for standardized tests, diversity and maybe essays. I feel like I'll be compared to her no matter what happens, which will inevitably sway admissions towards the big fat ""Denied"". Then you also have this one girl who got deferred from Harvard today and will now also apply to Columbia. Once again, she's a great applicant - 4.0 GPA, 2250 SAT, and the rest of her application is also presumably on a similar level to mine.

Basically, I guess my worry boils down to being compared to others, which might leave me behind. Or maybe they'll take all three of us? Who knows. Will admissions compare me to other applicants from my school, especially already accepted ones? Will they even accept more than one applicant from a school?

Thanks and good luck to all of you!"

Ive always suffered from anxiety, since I was in kindergarten  basically and for the past 6-8 months Ive been dealing with depression. A lot of the feelings come from lack of self confidence and feeling like a very large part of who I am is missing and theres nothing I can do about it right now, or for a while probably, and also a fear of whats ahead in my life and if im doing things right or not.


That huge part of me thats missing is the area I live in. Ive grown up in the same state my whole life, same big city, and then went to college in a small college town. My passion in life is traveling and exploring and seeing what the world has to offer besides city life. I feel so empty without being able to go see the world, or even the other side of the U.S. for that matter. Its always been my (small) dream to go camping in Colorado or Oregon for a week or two, and my ultimate goal is to go see New Zealand, Greenland, Iceland and hike and live off the land as much as possible, become part of the culture there, get to know new people and their stories and traditions, but my family has never been wealthy enough to travel more than a few states away. 


A few weeks ago my boyfriend got invited on a trip to Iceland with his friends from home. He was planning on going but once knew how I seemed to feel about it immediately said never mind. The reasons I was so upset about him going was because he never asked my opinion on it (not permission, opinion), he agreed to going knowing the trip would cost between $1200 and $1800 (he only has $1800 in his bank account) and didnt think about the consequences of that. He works minimal hours a week and can only save $10-$15 max every two week pay period, and the trip is in the beginning of summer.


I was a bit hurt by the fact that he was going to spend his entire savings on a trip, which would lead to him having to move 10 hours away next year in order to live with his parents if he could not find a job that paid well enough for a single person apartment in our college town area, and being a first year college grad with no internship experience (and a job that requires 6 months-1 year of lab experience), that isn't very likely. We already had a friend vacation planned with our friend group from school that he wouldn't be able to afford if he paid for the Iceland trip, and the worst part of it all is that I'm jealous that he gets the opportunity to live my dream without me. The jealousy creates resentment because while I'm dealing with depression for this situation, he'll be out doing what would make me ultimately happy. 


I feel like that is so selfish of me and I genuinely want to be happy for him and this opportunity he has, but its going to possibly cause our relationship to be long distance for a year or so, along with not being able to go on vacation with me and our friends anymore. I want to be supportive and excited for him but my jealousy of him living out something that is causing me to be depressed, and putting himself in a position to be long distance with me for a year or so, along with canceling on our friend vacation just really upsets me and irks me in a place that I cant shake.


Before you tell me to go to therapy and all that, I have been for years. I have good spurts and bad spurts and ive been stuck in a very large funk for the last 8 months. My boyfriend has been nothing but supportive and comforting towards me but I feel like im being selfish or taking advantage of how supportive he is with this one, but another part of me feels like he is being selfish in this situation given the circumstances. I dont know what to do.

TLDR; boyfriend might go to Iceland which is part of my depression, and him going may cause us to be long distance for a year or so, along with canceling our friend vacation. I want to be supportive of him like he is of me but I dont know how to handle this situation.

3we48m,1,2015-12-11,Two internship offers. First time negotiating salary!,ShittyAlgorithms,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3we48m/two_internship_offers_first_time_negotiating/,"Hi everyone,

I have recently heard back from a second company that they would like to extend me an offer. 

The first company is offering me ~$33/hr, but it would only be 10 weeks, I'd have to relocate (and pay rent in two places), and I think the work would be less interesting. After accounting for the additional expenses it works out to more like $25/hr for less weeks.

The second company is wanting to know what my expected salary would be. It sounds like they want to negotiate before making an offer. They're in the same city as me and are offering me a data science internship, which is really in line with what I'd like to do with my career. I wouldn't have to pay rent in two places and I'd be working for more weeks over the summer (which is good — I have debts).

Does anyone have any advice for how I should do this? I've never had an internship before. I think I'd be willing to take a lower offer from this second company because I believe it would be better for me in the long run. However, I don't want to sell myself short.

I was thinking of saying something along the lines of ""my other offer is for $33/hr, but I'm willing to negotiate"". Maybe I should place my bottom line at like $24/hr, though? It seems a bit weird to me to be negotiating salary at an internship when I don't really know my market value very well.

Thanks! :)"

I'd say that I have a pretty strong resume (I interned at NASA, and I have 3 years of research experience as well as a little over a year of project management experience on top of - as of today - a pair of Bachelors' in Physics and Computer Science), and plenty of people seem interested enough to speak with me, so it's got to be something I'm doing in the interviews.

In general, the interview process starts out with the introductions, questions about how much I know about the company in question (I generally look into what they do and the backgrounds of their CTO/CEOs if I can get my hands on the information), and I return with questions about what, particularly, they're looking for me to do so I can tailor the rest of my answers to that.  If there's something that was ambiguous or felt incomplete about the information on their website(s), I'll ask for more details about that.  After that, they ask why I'm interested in &lt;city they're located in&gt;, and I respond that I don't particularly mind where, but I want a place to settle down for awhile, since I've been moving halfway across the country every summer since my freshman year for different jobs, and I would like to stay in one place while I get my feet under me again.

Then they ask about why and when I got into programming (I dabbled around in middle and high school with arduinos and switched to CS after I got back from NASA), which, since I lead the conversation there, follows into questions about what I did during my internship and why that caused me to switch.  I make sure to mention that I didn't really know anything about what I was doing going in (and neither did my PI, so I had to learn it basically on my own) and that I still ended up with a functional prototype of a pretty complex system after 4 1/2 months, which they're still using in the lab.

Next come the questions about my personal projects - usually they start with the rockets, ignore the tesla coil, and move on to the quaternion library and the (in progress) NES emulator.  Occasionally (I think only if they were involved in scouts, themselves), there's a final question of affirmation that I am an Eagle Scout, and it moves on to the whiteboarding.

The white board is usually some banal example (fizzbuzz, reverse an array without a loop, print the numbers 1-100 starting with ""for(i=100;"", you know the type), though I occasionally see one that isn't instantly apparent, and then the interview concludes with a ""we'll contact you in the next week or so,"" I thank the interviewer for his/her time, and I say that I look forward to hearing from him/her.  Then I follow up in a little over a week (when they haven't contacted me, in direct contradiction with their statement at the end of the interview), and they've decided to pursue someone else with more experience, who's a better fit, etc.  ""We'll let you know if the situation changes.""

So, is there something that I'm doing wrong here?  How could I do better at convincing prospective employers to pull me in?  My rent contract expires at the end of the month, and I'm getting rather desperate at this point, so any tips would be appreciated.

**tldr;** I do pretty well at getting interviews, and they seem to go well, but no one bites hard enough to set the hook.  What can I do better?"

3wee45,0,2015-12-11,Begin my career or build a financial foundation,dentnexus7,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3wee45/begin_my_career_or_build_a_financial_foundation/,"I have a recent dilemma on my future and I have to make a decision. 

Background:
I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering in May 2015. I decided to backpack through Europe after college as a gift to myself. For the past two months or so since I got back I've been searching for a job. I am in the final interview stage for a company right now (interview is next week). I believe I can interview well next week and get my foot in the door to begin my career. The position is $25/hr for first 4-6 months and then switched to salary. 

This week, though, I've run into a new job opportunity that is not in my degree field but has excellent hours and excellent pay. It is a private driver. 3-4 days a week,  5-6 hours a day plus random extra hours here and there,  $70/hr. For 2 years with possibility of being longer. I part time valeted for 2 years in college and am currently a valet to pay bills while finding a better job. This opportunity would begin next Friday. 

Thoughts:

I am not sure what to do. My parents are expecting/wanting me to begin my career. But this driver job sounds like a great opportunity to create a financial foundation for myself and my future. 

If I choose my career,  I can get paid well, and gain more experience (already had 2 internships btw) but with longer hours. I can get my foot in the door but ultimately the position is not what I want to do in the long run (I'd be developing on a mainframe with an old language, cobol,  for an electric company. But really,  I want to develop and work on some newer,  more significant future technology. For example oculus rifts or something). 

If I choose the driver position, I will get paid much better with less hours but no experience in my field. I will not get my foot in the door with my career,  but I will create a financial foundation for my future and with the extra hours I'd have,  I can begin teaching myself how to develop on something I want my career to really be,  for example oculus rifts. 

Notes:

There are many other pros and cons to each choice, I'm sure,  but I just pointed out some big main ones. 

The driver position is for 2 years right now, but if I can't/dont want to do 2 years,  I'm sure it will be fine if a replacement is found accordingly. 

Oculus rifts is just an example of what I want to develop on. I actually still don't know where I want my career to go and what I want to work on.

I feel a career is the way to go,  being as people are raised to do the norm and start a career after college (at least I was,  I mean). But I can't help but think that I have the rest of my life to have a career job and I'm young and it will be ok to not begin it yet since people with Computer Science and Engineering degrees will still be heavily needed in the future. 



Anyone with any wisdom or solid input on my situation, please help me out on making a decision. Thanks."

I was laid off from my job a month ago. My old job caused me a kind of numbing dread, since I felt kind of trapped there for almost a decade and felt like I wasn't very good at it and nobody liked me. So when I got fired I actually thought ""maybe this is the best thing that could happen to me.""

But it hasn't been. I have just been a mess. I can't sleep, I have no appetite, and I am at this new internship that is more career oriented for me and anyone else would be thankful and excited to do it, but I am just like, terrified of the place. The day before I have to go into the internship I am just like trembling with anxiety...the entire day. All the other interns seem so upbeat and positive and relaxed and I feel constantly overwhelmed. I know it isn't likely I'd get a job there because I feel really held back by my stress and anxiety. The manager there is also kind of an intense, mean guy and I feel extremely nervous around him. And since taking on the internship, I've felt even more anxiety about the fact that I'm in my 30s and still don't know what I could do for a living...Almost every single person I know seems happy and confident in their careers, but I am still completely lost.

Anyone else dealing with this sort of thing? I don't see a therapist (no money) and I don't take any medication (bad luck with it in the past), except Xanax, which I can only use to go to sleep because it knocks me out. I can't use it during the day. So I'm really on my own here. "

However, as I'm looking through the application process for internships, their specifications are so high. 

Here is what one of the places I would like to intern at states.

As a freshman in university, how do i create an app with no background information in coding, or how do I write novels, or even how am i suppose to master a programming language in two years? 

I have friends in the company that are asking my when I'll apply for internship, however, with my specifications so low I'm sure that even if they do refer me to HR department; I won't make the cut. 

So fellow engineers any advice for me?

I'm the guy in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rT00QXqZak). Thanks to Reddit it was actually in the top 10 most viewed videos in the US the day it was released and generated many AMA requests!

Some background: In 2009/2010 my co-founder and I taught ourselves mobile development and launched iPhone Apps. We quickly realized that learning how to build and launch products was teaching us more relevant skills in a better way than our college CS curriculum. There was a huge missed opportunity in CS education to teach students industry-relevant skills, with a project-based curriculum, and without putting students into debt. Over the years, our dissatisfaction with college grew.

We left school to start our own in 2012 with funding from [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) and later from Alexis Ohanian and others. We run intensive summer programs teaching app development and as our programs and teaching style grew in popularity we launched our 2 year program this year. We created it to provide students with the college education we wish we had had.

We built the curriculum by talking to Silicon Valley companies to make sure we were teaching the technologies and skills that will best prepare our students for a career in tech. There's no up-front tuition cost - instead you pay us back through internship earnings and 25% of your first two years' salary, aligning our incentives with students and doing our part to fight the college debt crisis.

My bro in law works at Google, and he told me Google was looking for interns for summer 2016. I'm in computer science, so naturally, I was interested. So trying to show my self as best as possible, I uploaded all my work (as in my code) to github - from high school, to after class, to **current assignments in university**. Yeah. I don't know what the hell I was thinking at the time.  
As expected, some guy copied my code and put it in their own code. So a few days ago, I received an email from my prof saying that they detected an academic integrity violation in my assignment. I was really confused, because being a true asian, I would never cheat and I worked my butt off for 2 weeks on this assignment. It took hours of debugging, and they told me I cheated. Then I realized people could access my code, publicly, because I'm a rare breed of dumb asian. Also, turns out uploading code was an academic violation. Now I'll either get a 0 on the assignment, 0 on the course, or neither and get a permanent record on my transcript saying I cheated.  
I didn't even make it to the internship to Google.  
TL;DR: Didn't read university version's End User Agreement, someone copied code, probably getting kicked out of uni and disowned by asian parents"
3wf04h,3,2015-12-11,"Me (27 F) with my friend (28 F) and her mother (60-ish F). I'm almost fed up with their codependent relationship, and now the mother is texting me about financial issues. More background info inside...",theyseekherthere,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wf04h/me_27_f_with_my_friend_28_f_and_her_mother_60ish/,"My friend (hereby referred to as Tracy), lives a very...unconventional life for a late twentysomething.  We went to undergrad together - both pursuing degrees in the Psychology field.  I went on to more schooling and a career.  Tracy went on to grad school, had an interview for a paid internship program for job placement...and then quit her field of study all together.  Why is this?  When she went for the interview, the interviewer asked her uncomfortable questions about her failures in life, why she thought she could get into this program, etc.  While the interviewer might not have needed to be so forward, I feel like Tracy overreacted to this ""failure"".  I love the girl, but she tends to blame outward factors for her struggles instead of encountering them personally.  This will be an ongoing theme in the story I'm about to lay out.


Upon her leaving this field of study two years ago, she decided to go back to school because she has ""always had dreams of going into the medical field"".  Her mother (who she still lives with) backed her up.  This lead her to doing two years back at our old college for prep courses and now transferring to another for a pre-Physicians Assistant program.  Throughout these three years, other friends and I have been supportive of her pursuits.  She worked part time while taking these classes and would often talk about how she ""wished she had taken this path five years ago"" and other similar statements of regret.  


As this semester is winding down for her, she tells me that she might not be able to return to her program because she doesn't have enough money to pay off the tuition for that part of the year.  Because of the status of the program she is in, students do not receive as much financial aid as they would in undergrad or P.A. School itself.  I tried to brainstorm any way possible that she could get the money to continue.  Right now, she is doing incredibly well in her classes and she insists that if she ""leaves after this semester, she knows she'll never come back.""


Tracy came to terms that she would have to take out a small private loan to fund the rest of her semester.  Unfortunately, none of her family/family friends have good enough credit or are willing to cosign the loan.  I tell her that I wish I could help, but my husband and I are closing on a house next Tuesday and all of my credit/funds are tied up in this venture.  She understands as she has seen my husband and I go through the process of getting the home.  


A few days ago, I receive two text messages from her mother.  Her mother has texted me before (two years ago) in regards to a birthday surprise for Tracy.  Otherwise, we never talk - save from when she drops Tracy off somewhere because Tracy doesn't have a license.  This was the content of those messages:



**TM (Tracy's mom):** Theyseekherthere, it's TM, Tracy's mom.  Hope this evening finds you and (husband) well.  Tracy doesn't know I'm sending you this message.  I reached out to her father and told him I needed help on behalf of Tracy.  To be the cosigner of the loan.  He didn't say no.  Just that he had to think and talk with his wife.  Some progress.  I hope that it will happen.  Please pray that it does.  I know Tracy needs a miracle.  I haven't told her yet.  Thank you.  I wish you and (husband) well.

**Theyseekherthere:** No problem.  I have been talking to her a lot about this.  I really wish we could help but my hands are tied since we close on our new house next week.  I have told her if she needs anything else she can always ask.

**TM:** Yes, I understand and I know you would help.  It's important to start your life.  May a bolt of lightning strike Tracy's father in a good way.  Ha!



A little background on the father statements.  Tracy's father has only been back in her life after five or so years.  He walked out on his family (TM, son, Tracy) when Tracy was a toddler.  Their relationship is still being felt out.  


As for why I addressed the house issue, her mother has been known to try and manipulate help out of people as well as showing a habit of pathological lying.  Sure enough, she texted me yesterday to tell me that Tracy's dad declined to cosign the loan and that she hopes he reconsiders. I can usually see these people coming a mile away, and I do my hardest to stay away from them.  **Even if I hadn't been closing on a house, I would NOT have cosigned a loan for my friend.  As much as I love her, she has no immediate career prospects and I do not know what would end up happening to the standing of the loan.**  


In addition to my above reasoning, I do not wish to give Tracy's mother an ""inch"" as it were.  Tracy has expressed to me how much she wishes she could leave her house because of how overbearing her mother is.  I have told her many times that I would help find her an apartment.  She is convinced she could not work to save enough money to pay her rent.  I tell her that's not true.  I have tried to help her obtain a driving license, but she has this in her head as another ""obstacle"".  


Tracy's desire to leave home has reached a fevered pitch since her brother returned home to live.  Her brother had a bipolar episode some months ago and is now seeking treatment.  He was kicked out of his home by a girlfriend, lost his job, and moved in with Tracy and her mother.  Five months later, he got another job, quit, has been skipping treatment appointments, and creates problems in their home.  Tracy wishes her mother would kick the brother out, but her mother will not.  She set a ""loose"" date of late October, but that came and went.  


Right now, Tracy claims that her mother venting to her about what's going on at home (right now, Tracy lives in temporary graduate student housing) is causing her to lose focus on school.  


I have had endless conversations trying to help my friend understand that she needs to take control of her life, stand up to her mother, and grow up as it were.  I fear that the older she gets, the worse the codependency becomes.  


Reddit, I came here to find *anyone* that has been in/might be in a situation much like mine.  Did your friend end up making it out of their dysfunctional home, or are they still stuck in a phase of stunted growth?



**tl;dr**: I'm almost positive my friend and her mother are codependent.  Mother is now ""hinting"" to me that I should cosign a loan for friend, but I have no intentions to do so.  Friend wants out of house with mother, but thinks she is incapable.  Anyone else have a friend like this?  How did it end up?"
3wf4zr,5,2015-12-11,"Me [21F] with my friend [23M] of four years, things have got awkward between us and he won't tell me what's going on",LostFriendThrowA,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wf4zr/me_21f_with_my_friend_23m_of_four_years_things/,"Hi guys,

I’m looking for a stranger perspective on the whole thing, I hope you’ll be able to help me. 

**4 years ago:** I met my friend, let’s call him John. We were college freshmen, I didn’t know anyone, and I just happened to start hanging out with John, whom I met on the first day, and two other people, a girl and a guy. The three of them were very opinionated while I just didn’t really care/share their ideas. It put me under a lot of pressure, so I drifted apart from their “group” after a while. I was still casual friends with John and the girl. Now, let me detail my friend’s personality a bit. He’s two year older than the rest of us, very cultivated. Reading War and Peace in his free time, always discussing politics, sometimes coming across as being better than us and saying pretty nasty stuff, but saying it’s all an act. You never really know when he’s serious. Overall someone you can’t really figure out. John was in a toxic long term relationship but I wasn’t close enough to him to be able to help him on a personal level. 

**2 years 1/2 ago**: he cut ties with our girl friend when he thought she had made a move on him. The whole thing was really messy. I don’t know if our friend actually loved him but she cared for him and John went no contact without telling her why. He stopped talking to her, texting her all of a sudden. She was really hurt not to get an explanation. She never really got over it because of how close the three of them were, it basically broke their small group. It was a very difficult time, the three of us were in the same class. It was awful, I was stuck in between the two of them, trying not to hurt anyone, but things eventually settled. They never talked again, except formally for class exercises.

**1 year and half ago**: John’s gf broke up with him. He was an utter mess. I reached out for him, telling him we could meet anytime if he needed to talk. To my huge surprise, he said yes. We never were “that” close, but I thought why the hell not and brought my bf along. We then became a lot closer, we would have drinks together, talk about politics, philosophy, whatever, or even personal things. It felt good to be able to have that kind of talks with someone, I never really could before. 

**1 year ago**: My bf threw a party on my b-day, John was here as well as another friend of mine, Emma, and my bf’s best friend, James. Everyone really hit off, it was fun, and we eventually became a group. Emma started going out with my bf’s best friend and we would all hang out at John’s place and chill. John became good friends with James, they had the same kind of humor and had the same vision on politics.

Then, a girl, let’s call her Jane, appeared out of nowhere. John had noticed her in class and had a liking for her, we would spend time with her during our lunch breaks but I didn’t know her much, I wasn’t in her class. John was weird with her, being unnecessarily mean but on a joking tone. He was sometimes horribly gross even but as I said before, you never really know when he’s joking, we thought that was part of his persona, and she didn’t seem to mind at all, she kept texting him, etc. One day, they all went out for drinks (I wasn’t there, can’t remember why) and Jane behaved horrifically while being drunk. Everyone was mad at her and John later told me she had shown her true self, that she was toxic like his ex-gf and that he would now stay away for her. A couple of weeks later, they got together. When I tried to ask him why he had do that after what he had told me, he looked at me blankly and said he had never said that. I didn’t get, I thought their dynamic was weird as hell, but I didn’t know her personally and they seemed happy somehow, so I dropped the subject.

**8 months ago:** things started going downhill with Emma for petty reasons. Basically she got upset at John and I for being “know-it-alls” while she was struggling to get the same grades as we did. John got upset at her for upsetting me (she is very blunt and aggressive, I’m pretty much on the opposite of the spectrum) and also because he felt like she wasn’t a good person for James. He thought that because of her he couldn’t see James as much as he’d liked and that her “moods” were making James miserable. Emma and Jane left the country because they had an internship opportunity and it was just the four of us, my bf, John, James and I. Sometimes I would meet John by myself and he was still mad at Emma, planning a way to make her break up with James. I told him several times it was none of his business, that all we could do was be here for James if he needed to but he wouldn’t hear it. He also wanted me to cut contact with Emma but she and I eventually had a grownup discussion and settled the matter. Apart from that we met a lot over the summer, more than the 3 years we had known each other. Things were great, he told me our friendship mattered a lot to him, that he had very few friends but he valued loyalty above all, etc. I relaxed for the first time because I feel the same away about friendship and was glad I had found a “true” friend.

**4 months ago**: Then it was time to go back to college. To my horror, I felt like the story was repeating itself: I was stuck between John and Emma. John stopped sitting next to me during classes because I was with Emma, etc, and we spoke very rarely. When we did he was rude, petty, and when I called him out on it he said “Why are you upset, can’t you see it’s my persona”. I felt bad, he was so nice and open-minded the whole summer, why was he behaving in such a hurtful way? He had grown to hating our studies, I also thought things weren’t going well with Jane, so asked him several time if anything was wrong, if it was because of me hanging out with Emma, he told me everything was okay. I wasn’t buying it but I felt like I had done my part. He then went no contact. I was so horribly upset, I felt so dumb, that if he had behaved like that once he’d do it again. We met several days later, he explained himself (he was mad but not really because I didn’t go to one of his parties because I was feeling ill like what the fuck). And I thought, okay, let’s just patch things up. Except, you guess, things never got better. We almost never see each other (he skips a lot of classes), we barely talk (when we do text he sends me jokes/nonsense). 

**A month ago** we met at a bar and he told me that he didn’t understand why I’m thinking he’s not feeling okay, that he did get annoyed at me for being “overprotective”, aka me asking him if he was alright. We had an explanation and he did seem relieved when we left, like had got something off his chest and said we had to do something soon with Jane. Except we didn’t, texts are non-existent except for the weekly random jokes but he has recently said he wanted us to meet (just that, no other context). I couldn’t - he has a habit of asking only a couple of hours beforehand -  so I said no to several of his texts but he never replies or tries to get things further. I never ask him because it’s just so awkward now, I don’t want to be “overprotective” and annoying basically. And to be honest I don’t know what I could tell him if we were to meet, I’m feeling so awkward now. My bf did try to message him (they stopped sending each other texts too), but he got the same answer and John even said “was it LostFriendThrowA that told you to send me that text?” (for info, it wasn’t me, my bf told me that after it happened).

I’m sorry this is getting long, but as you see there’s a lot going on and I really don’t get it. Emma tells me to just quit worrying about his ass, that he doesn’t deserve it. She said that he's using me for when he's feeling lonely, that if Jane dumps him he will come back to me. I don't know what to think anymore, I've never wanted any of this mess, I feel like we're middle schoolers enjoying creating drama, but at the same time I don’t want to lose my friend. I don’t know what’s going on inside his head because he won’t tell me, he won’t answer my questions either. I tried so hard to be open-minded, I thought we were big enough to behave like adults and tell each other what is wrong. Should I really accept that we are not really friends anymore? How can I reach out to him? I’m stuck. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I can provide more details if needed, I tried to keep things as short as possible.

**Tl;dr**: my friend of four years recently got really cold towards me and I don’t understand why, he won’t tell me and pretty much just stopped talking me. Not sure if it’s because of recent events, because he might feel depressed, because I'm no use to him right now or if I'm just being paranoid. I don’t know if I should call it quits.

I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now. I feel like SWE is more of what I want to do, because I really enjoy coding, but at the same time I don't have a very clear idea of what DE entails. The people I spoke with seemed to emphasize how different these two roles are, which makes me hesitant, but at the same time.. it is Facebook. They also mentioned that I would be mainly working with product teams.

I'm excited, but anxious. This could be a major decision for me, does anyone have advice on how I should proceed (*if* I get an offer)?

This is my first post here although i have been reading this sub for a long time. I am a recovering weed addict and I quit a while as I realized I wasn't utilizing it in a responsible manner. I have felt pretty solid ever since but lately I haven't felt so solid. I am at the crossroads in my life and so I decided to post my story here to maybe get another point of view that can help me find some clarity.

After high school in 2010 I decided to get into computer science. I had already been smoking for about a year and a half although the structure of high school kept me in place and produced some really good marks when I graduated.

2011:
First year at university I was studying Bachelors in Engineering of Information Technology. It was a new course the school was trying out and had a handful of modules such as accounting and philosophy. I had to try handle 10 modules each semester and so I flunked out at the end of that year only passing 5 modules. I had classes 12 hours a day and smoked at the end of each to try and relax. I was really angry about school at this point. How crazy it was. .

2012:
Being kicked out of school I decided to start a company where students could trade items easily online without having to post ads on notice boards which could make the ads fly away and you couldn't manage how many people are viewing your ads. I worked on the site all year and tried to get funding although as the year came to an end I was skeptical of actually making any money from this idea. 

I was smoking all day every day with a hometown friend who was improving his high school marks. My thinking was that I didn't have enough drive to work on my site unless I got high so every morning when my mother and sister left for work and I'd go see my friend and he'd bunk school and use his pocket money to buy weed and smoke with me. When my family was sleeping I'd go out and smoke weed then come back to work on the site.

 I registered the company and launched the site end of the year but it was really sloppy as I wasn't that experienced. So I decided to just listen to my mom and try to go back to school.

2013:
I was enrolled in a new university and was getting very great marks. I looked for weed and found it easily and so began spending most of time trying to get weed or smoking it. I got a lot of video games and just smoked and played them all the time. I was getting good marks eve without studying and so got very comfortable. I even met other stoner gamers and we'd smoke and play games together or watch tv shows like breaking bad. 

As the year progressed my marks started to drop. I was skipping classes to smoke. Smoking before important tests and never putting much effort to study even though I loved programming. At the end of the year I was kicked out of campus residence and had to find a room outside of school in a very dodgy area.

2014:
I was living with a friend from campus residence who was also kicked out and we were smoking a lot together. We saved up for bongs and lots of weed and it was really getting out of hand. We would come back from school just to take a bong hit then walk back to school. It was about 10 minute walk up and down a hill.  I was on a mission to build a good gaming pc so I could play better games and so I was broke most of the time. 

I was walking home one day and smelled weed on the street where lived. Not even thinking clearly I just asked those guys to smoke and made friends with them. They weren't attending school or anything just sitting in the same corner everyday smoking. I just greeted them as I went to class but I was really embarrassed they I had made friends with such people. 

One day I went with them to buy weed and the police drove up the corner we were smoking at. I was the only one with weed as I was buying for me and my friend who I lived with. I told the cops I'm just a student and I have a bit of money but this were good cops. I was alone in the squad car as they questioned me. Fortunately they didn't cuff me and so it wasn't a horrible but people understood was going on and I felt embarrassed. They measured my weed at a clinic and took me into the cells. This is making me uneasy just to write about it. This happened on a Thursday. 

I walked into the cell and it smelled like piss and immediately people were calling me to come sit with them. We talked about how we all got in and I bought pack of cigarettes and made friends with heroin addicts. 

I thought I would get out the next day and raised my voice at the judge about how I am just a student and made a mistake. She said ""well you should have thought about that before"". And I kept quiet. I didn't have money on me as one guy conned me in the prison saying we should shove it up our ass. I stupidly believed him as my heroin friends were long gone (but I would later meet them in prison) so I couldn't afford bail. He took all the money I had and my sim card that I could have used to make calls on the inside. Turns out I would never see him again as he was sentenced to prison and I was just going to be in jail waiting to go to court. 

I met up with the heroin guys I met before and the 6 days I was in jail we talked and they helped me out, protected me. We smoked cigarettes and weed every night to sleep easier. The place was infested with bugs and they kept biting while you sleep. I got really depressed in there thinking about what I have become. Just a few years ago it was just clean teenage fun, getting high and listening to music. Now I am sleeping next to people have really done bad things in their life. 

Tuesday I was quiet in court looking down not really listening. I only heard ""you will be released on a warning"" I looked up and thought maybe I still have a chance at redeeming myself. I got out and went to where I was staying. My friend was excited to see me. I threw my clothes away and took a shower. Then went out to see the world again. I bought potato chips at a store and gave the change to a kid and walked around campus looking at ladies, birds, trees and breathing fresh air. 

My friend bought a big bag of weed to celebrate. I felt uneasy but I wasn't man enough to say anything. We smoked and I fell back to my old patterns. This is when money started to get tight. I bought a new phone (heroin friends took my old one before I left, but I ended up saying they should as a way for me to say thank you). And then went to the therapy session the judge sent me to. I found out it cost a bit of money and I couldn't afford it. I skipped practicals to go there and only payed half the price. The judge dropped the charges and I was a free man for good. No criminal record in the books.

I talked to all my lecturers for all the tests I missed and I wrote all of them. Passing all but one. My friend moved out and I was staying alone in the house. So I wanted to buy from the guys who were there when I was arrested. They walked with me to the place and when it was time to smoke I told them I'm not smoking with them because it turned sour the last time. They got mad and started making my life miserable. They robbed me off my new phone and broke into my room when I was out writing a test (which I felt good about and passed). I told my mom and went home that weekend. And came back with my sister's expensive laptop. They assaulted me in public while I was out trying to get groceries and so I started being afraid of going out during the day. I only went out late and night to buy weed. 

I was really depressed at this point just staying in and smoking. I tried looking for a new place but all of them were expensive. Beautiful ladies moved in and I was the only guy so I didn't look for a new place anymore. I never went to class and ended up failing all my modules. I didn't study enough because I felt confident during the semester. (My marks were okay, I only did bad during exams). 

During my birthday I went out clubbing. Turns out my new roommate made a deal with those guys to get me out the house so they could rob me of everything I own. That night they took my clothes, sister's computer, lcd screen, modem, keyboard, mouse, two phones and my microwave plus a couple of textbooks. My mom fetched me the next day and was pissed. Even worse the school kicked me out. And she would soon find out. She doesn't know I spent time in jail, not a 23:08:16 of people do. I will probably die with that secret.  

This is when I realized that my habits have lead me in the wrong direction. My smoking habit made me meet bad people, do bad things and have good things taken away. I quit on that day I got the message from the school. It was on the 3rd of December 2014. I was depressed and having withdrawals from weed thinking about what I can do to get back. I wrote an appeal stating what had happened and how I planned on changing. It was denied. I told my mother I want to go to therapy and do a few courses to show that I am still able to pass.

2015:
I did the therapy while staying clean. Then my mom said she will not fund the courses I wanted to do even though I showed her the emails I had with the Dean and Course coordinator how it would highly improve my chances at readmission. She still denied and told me to find a job. I applied for hundreds of jobs and haven't gotten a reply from a single one. I had no skills to show for myself just a high school diploma. I live in a country with 25% unemployment with the bulk of that being young adults (about 80%). Some even struggle to find a job even with a degree. So I was discouraged and stayed home cleaning the house and reading stuff on the internet. 

I only gave out 1hr computer literacy lessons to the professor who was my therapist. It rekindled my love for operating systems as I was cleaning and fixing up my old computer putting on an Arch Linux and making it look the way I want to. I started making comics and have gotten much better. And doing personal programming projects and posting them on github. I also kept a journal and upgrade my pc with the little money I made. I really took time to rebuild my whole sense of self. I was reading a lot and listening to different style of music. 

 My sister found me a job that made me develop a platform to manage ads on a free wifi network. It is my most ambitious project to date even though I was never payed for it. It was really good, lean and clean code that functioned wonderful (much better than the site I tried to make in 2012). I was doing this job and it was overlapping with university applications. I was going to apply telling the school that I went to therapy, had an unpaid internship, gave out computer literacy lessons and helped a high school kid pass mathematics. 

My mother planned on me getting a job so she could disown me and I didn't mind as I am well aware that I messed up my chances twice. She conjured a scheme to make me not apply for school and keep working on the free wifi ad system. I wanted to go back to school but she insisted on me doing the job. And so I felt really sorry for her. All the money I wasted. I could have been independent by now so she could enjoy  her old age life spending her money on things she wanted to do in her house.

 I didn't apply and the deadlines passed but later found out that, the job wouldn't pay me at all.  I got my drivers license and felt good except I didn't own a car.  I took a vacation with my mom for a week and spend time by the sea. Then applied for #borntocode when I came back from the vacation. It was going to be free tuition but you had to pass some tests. I got really far on the test judging from people who were tweeting how they were struggling and unfortanetly didn't make it. I got really sad as I thought that was my last chance to prove that I can do something. 

I don't have much to show for myself this year and I spend a year just sitting on the computer, my mom yelling at me for menial things, getting accused for smoking even though I am now 1year and 8days sober. I felt bad and made me feel like being clean for so long meant nothing. Like I am not making an effort to be a better person.  I didn't mind her yelling though as I was dirt poor and unemployed. My mother payed for rent and food so I had no right to talk back.  I felt bad being dirt poor and watching her and my sister buy an expensive fridge and redoing the kitchen and getting a new dishwasher and buying really expensive designer bags yet I can't even afford a USB to store things. I kept thinking this was the money that was supposed to be for school.

I got really depressed and came up with an idea to do computer so I can earn a bit of money the coming year. I sat around reading posts of people who have done it before. Taking notes and making plans on doing it. I had planned to make enough money to get an A+ certification in computer repair. It would show that I am very much still interested in computers. 

 A few days ago my mom told me to study something else. I told I still want to do computer science. And thought no matter what degree I was doing things would have been the same. We talked for 2 minutes before her phone rang and I stood listening to her talk with her friend for about half an hour. I felt pretty bad that she would rather catch up on gossip than talk to her own son. 

 She told me I shouldn't use my computer anymore and I was really angry because it is the only thing that has kept me sane. I didn't argue with her I just obeyed her and decided I should start the  computer repair business while waiting for next year August to apply for school again. This would keep me busy enough to not care that I am not on my computer and will help me make extra money for myself. 

I posted fliers around and got a few clients and fixed their computers, made some money. Today she told me I shouldn't fix people's anymore and if she finds out about it I should find another place to stay. I don't know if I am okay with this one as I am trying really hard to better myself and my life yet she keeps shutting down all of my plans. I feel like I'm pushing a boulder up the hill and she keeps pushing it down. I'm so exhausted. And I don't know what I'm going to do. 

Sometimes I wish I could smoke one just to relax but I cannot forego so much progress. Sometimes I wish I had enough money to move out but seems like I won't be allowed to make any. Sometimes I think about ending my life but I don't think it is worth it, I still have a long way to go. I am losing hope everyday that I will ever push that boulder to the top of the hill.

I am currently at a crossroads in life and would very much appreciate any advice/criticism. Sorry for the block of text.

25/ F - I worked at Geek Squad for 3.5 years doing IT troubleshooting/Repairing laptops and moved into a Database Administrator role. Loved that position, but I couldn't afford the last 2 years of university. I joined the USAF to get some funding for college, my job in no way relates to programming unfortunately. 

Fast forward 4 years and I am separating with my B.S in Information Technology (focus on programming). I am also admitted into Graduate School for my MS in Information Technology for Fall 2016. Currently I am applying for summer internships in programming or IT roles (trying to stay away from helpdesk/support) to get more experience. Additionally, I am moving to a completely to a new state where I do not have as many networking IT colleagues, but I have met a few.

I think ideally my future role would be more of a Project Management over software/IT, but I know that is not a ""starter"" role. The reason for this is because the business side of things interests me as well as the technical aspects. I feel that I have great communication/management skills that could be melded with the technical side. Before getting to that type of role I know it's important to have a focus.

Currently my focus is working on my programming, however my professional versus educational skills are not up to par and I want to LEARN more, hence wanting an internship. Although I do enjoy programming, I am not an expert at any one language. I have worked with several and dabble here and there (C++, Java, HTML, PHP, Python, VB). Math is not my strong subject (hence not getting a CS degree) and I am nervous I will not be up to par at all with other programmers. This is why I think it would be smart to try and get a programming internship, learn, and move from there.

The problem it seems, and understandably so, that your coveted programming internships are filled by CS or Software Engineering majors. I have applied for over 20 so far (a strong resume and cover letter) and have gotten one or two bites, but nothing has lined up. Granted I have not moved there yet and this has all been on job boards. I had a GREAT internship offer for an application developer / rotating internship, but they offered it for a different location.

Is there another area of IT that would fit the bill for what I am eventually wanting to do? What are some things that I can do to boost my programming skills? My friend back home talked to me a bit about GitHub (just signed up today, still a bit lost) and CodeForAmerica. Now that I am not in school full time and working full time I have more time to work on these skills outside of school, but as far as working on projects, where should I begin? 

I guess I am nervous about my place in the IT world, transitioning from the military, moving to a new state, and starting graduate school. Any advice would be appreciated....

Thanks! :)

EDIT: It also may help to put where I'm moving...Phoenix, AZ!"

3wgldj,1,2015-12-11,What kind of position is this called?,thezoomaster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wgldj/what_kind_of_position_is_this_called/,"So I recently got offered an internship at a really cool startup in SF. The recruiter says its a QA position, but I talked to the Manager I'll be working under (""Automation Engineer"") and after learning about the kind of stuff I'll be doing it doesn't sound like typical QA-ish type stuff I've heard about.

For example, I'll be:
*A ""full stack"" engineer
*Building applications and frameworks that will help developers dev faster, like computing data and building dashboards from it
*Build scalable automatic testing systems 
*Not do any actual testing - it seems like I'll be mostly be building the frameworks and various applications that will help developers test

It's a very small team right now so I'll  be able to build something with legitimate impact and with cool tech and be assigned a project to make over the summer.

I'm just wary of the ""QA intern"" title because it is my junior year summer and I have heard horror stories about being pigeonholed into QA positions and how difficult it is to get back to dev. However it seems like this position will have a lot more development than actual testing. I haven't received a formal offer letter yet, but I was wondering what exactly this type of work would be called? Is it actually still just QA? Or is it dev ops or engineering productivity or something else? "

Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

Never thought this day would come, but now I have a choice here of which I am both grateful and concerned.              
                       
**Company A**: I was an intern last year at this relatively ""well-known"" game company. They have offered me an internship this year again (related to big data, which is what I want), in a different department. However when I was there, I discovered gaming is not my thing and no matter how different work I'll do, it will always be related to gaming and I feel I will not be able to break out of that niche in future if I wanted to.             
              
**Company B**: The next choice is to sign the offer letter of a ""BIG4"" but the project I will be working on is not directly related to big data. I will have 2 other team mates doing the same work. The company is huge and has all sorts of departments and great perks, and my mentor from company A says that it will help me grow in the long run. I have a few days to reply back to company B. The pay at this place will be about 15% more than at company A.              
              
I feel like I am still not happy with either of these options in front of me. I have always wanted to work at G or FB, but I am still waiting to hear back from them, and am unsure whether I will get an interview date soon since it is already winter vacation. Plus I have to reply B soon. Last year, I got to the hiring committee review at G but was denied because they ran out of space for more interns. :(               
                            
I'm a hard worker and I have secured these offers by trying really hard, and they were never easy for me. However, I am unsatisfied and unsure whether choosing one (either A or B) will look like a good decision in retrospect when it is summer. My heart lies at G and FB. My interest lies in Big data and I want to gear my career towards it. G and FB pay almost 20% more than B and almost 50% more than A. Money is not important to me at this point, but it would be a great help if I could secure G or FB.              
                
Has anyone been in such a situation before? Are there suggestions for me? I would like to hear if any college student has been through such thoughts before, and how they resolved it.
             
Thank You."

Dick was amazed at all the shiny technology in those Cambridge offices. On his first day, Dick looked over the shoulder of a senior developer who was busy adjusting and tweaking a ship using an amazing modelling tool. ""Wow!"", exclaimed Dick, ""That sure looks like fun"" as he watched the developer twist and shape the ship into its final form. ""Here, have a go"", said the senior developer. ""Let me pull up a template for you. Take the Imperial Clipper as a starting point. I'm off to get a pizza.""

Dick sat down at the computer and stretched and elongated the body of the Imperial Clipper until it became wider and bigger. ""Hmm...I wonder what would happen if I dialled in some crazy numbers into those flight model settings?"" Dick found the setting for ""agility"", and entered a 1. He played around for a bit and entered minus 2 for ""pitch"", and 1000 for ""drift"". After a short while Dick found that inputting extreme numbers into the flight model settings produced a fun, but unflyable, monster of a ship. Dick chuckled as he tested the new ship as it drifted across the screen, uncontrollable, attempting unsuccessfully to pitch its nose up. Dick was having so much fun with his comedy ship model that he wanted to show it to the senior developer when he came back from lunch. Dick pressed the ""Save"" button and gave it a new file name - ""Imperial Cutter"" - inspired by the pizza cutter that the senior developer was using on his lunch.

Sadly, Dick didn't return for his second day at Frontier Developments' offices due to an alternative job offer. However, the file remained on the senior developer's computer..."

She's a single mother, going through a lot to help us get through life. I appreciate that. But she has no boundaries? Like

When I was in school, I almost made a boyfriend and she found out and went absolutely ape shit on me, grounded me and basically wrecked me for the entire year. Which was fine back then, you know. I was young and stupid and he was a shit guy.

But she's fucked my privacy since then. I gradually just learned to deal with it, and started telling her everything about my life because it was easier that way, she would not be suspicious and I would be left to live in peace. I stopped doing things I could mention infront of mumma, I was basically Golden Child for the first year of college. I got good grades (top 10), did internships, came home on time, had good friends, did good society stuff, everything.

Second year mai I started taking on too much and started burning out. Still no boy, but this whole ""tell mumma every detail and listen to every whim of hers"" was getting old. It was getting to the point that thinking of disobeying her would give me actual, physical anxiety. She would behave like a child with me- take my clothes and not return them, talk about her boyfriend troubles with me, check out guys with me. It was nice, but only because I had literally no one else to share my life with. She started turning into my whole world, like every decision I make and every breath i take revolves around her and if she doesnt want me to, I wont do it. My friends stopped inviting me to events and stopped doing stuff with me because I simply couldnt- if mummy wanted me in the metro and home by 4 means I had to be home by 4. Not doing that gave me so much anxiety because when she gets angry she says and does the most terrible stuff. I can even sleep in my own room because of this- i was told go sleep in my brother's room as he was getting lonely these days and I couldnt refuse. I feel like her doormat.

Two months ago, I met a guy. And. Just. I had avoided all sorts of relationships till then, but he's different. Theres a future there when I think of him. Problem is that he's leaving to study in the UK in May and I'll be here without him for a year (or even longer if I dont clear UK myself)

So when I realised I was really attached to this guy, mummy could see it too (in my behaviour) so she asked me about it and I told her. She told me that she supports this, but to hold off the loving feelings and just stay friends. Too late, I'm pretty sure I'm falling in love with him, and vice versa. No big deal, he and I both agreed to go slow and wait for each other till we have a solid base career to start stuff from. 

So now he and I are texting each other all the time, and we've kissed (nothing more) and we send a lot of lovey texts which I cannot let mumma see or else I'm fucked. But mother has problems with me texting people as well. SO yesterday (my exams are over now, I have nothing to do) I was in bed and texting him, and mumma came inside and got angry and took my phone. She may or maynot have read texts. I dont know, because today she wasnt showing any signs of reacting or being angry with me.

Either way, my fear is that she will somehow sabotage this and make me stop talking to him. I gave decent exams, hopefully 80+, definitely 70+ out of 100 in each paper this semester, but she might use my grades as an excuse to get me to stop talking to him which I dont want to do.

She knows the kind of hold she has on me, and if she yells at me and threatens me to stop talking to him, I'm afraid I'll be cowed into doing it. I want to stand up to her and tell her not to interfere in my relationships. How do I tell her this? How do I break free from her influence on me? I dont want to be scared anymore and I just want to give this guy a fair chance. If mummy tells me to cut contact, every time I meet him secretly, I'll be guilty and I cant take that. please help r/india"

3win56,115,2015-12-12,23yo. Screwed up in college. Graduated in 2014 with a degree I don't care for. Haven't done shit since graduation up until now (no interns/jobs) but finally realized I have to do something with my life. Here's 5 years of my life.,itsmepaulchan,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3win56/23yo_screwed_up_in_college_graduated_in_2014_with/,"I really need to share my story because I've been depressed lately since I JUST realized I fucked up the last 5 years of my life doing absolutely nothing and wasting my parents' money. This is going to be long but I'll include a TLDR at the end.

I present to you the past 5 years of my life

In 2010 I got into a good private school with intentions of majoring in chemistry. I was always a pretty good student in general but I never tried my hardest and I'm pretty sure I was the worst procrastinator (ex: started and finished 5+ page papers the MORNING it was due...crammed for exams few hours before it started...never did ungraded HW...never went to adviser/used any helpful resources)...you get the point. 

So much of my first year of college was somewhat lax...I took a bunch of random intro courses and got mostly B's and A's without doing much work. I talked to my chem adviser to plan out my courses for the next 3 years because I really really wanted to go study abroad in Japan. So she told me I had to take a advanced 300 level course that's usually taken by juniors/seniors because it was only offered during the fall. I took the course during my 2nd semester of my freshmen year but I had to drop this course because my grades were borderline failing. This ruined my plans to go abroad.

My sophomore year is when things started to get real problematic...but I didn't realize how bad it was until the 2nd semester of my junior year. Pretty much...I took organic chemistry and barely passed with a D- and got a C in physics...this was due to me doing absolutely shit, thinking I could wing all my exams just like I did in HS. I should have visited my adviser but I did not. I don't remember why but if I had to guess, it would be because I was embarrassed.

My parents always called me to see how I was doing and I kept telling them I was doing fine in school. My mom always told me to do internships and whatnot but I didn't listen because I was a fucking moron. 

My junior year came around and I started to take the more advanced courses for my major. To no surprise I got a C in one of the courses and this was when my adviser whom I barely have spoken to in the past called me in and told me that my major GPA was very low and if it falls beneath a certain threshold which I bordered, I was going to be forced to drop out of college (I did not know about this btw). 

So one would assume I would be shocked and scared. But no...I wasn't as worried as I should've been because I kept telling myself that everything would be fine. I managed to call my mom which was the hardest part because I've been telling her all this time that I've been doing ok in school. To my surprise, she was very considerate and told me to do what I thought was best. I went back to my adviser and she advised me to switch majors. I didn't want to do college all over again and the tuition isn't cheap as well so I ended up switching my major to sociology because I happened to have taken a bunch of sociology courses in the past 3 years of college because they were pretty easy. 

I switched my major to sociology and got to meet with the head of the department and etc. They were all super kind and helpful. In order for me to graduate on time, I needed more sociology credits so in the summer after junior year I went to a CUNY and finished all the required courses. I was back on track to graduate on time so my senior year played out exactly like my other years...I barely studied and didn't give a shit about my courses so pretty much I would go to class, come back to my dorm, play computer games for HOURS, sleep, and then wake up and do HW right before my classes. The one thing I am proud of is the fact that I presented my senior research at a big sociology conference. Other than that, I graduated with no honors or anything mentionable. I have no internships/job experiences in my 4 years of college because I have never sought out help from my school's career center.

From graduation up until right this moment, I haven't done ANYTHING in regards to my future or career. I've been slouching around in my house, living off of my parents. I've created an expensive annual gym membership and I haven't been going frequently. My mom has been constantly telling me to search for jobs or internships but I've been lying to her, telling her I've been looking when in reality I was just playing more games. I haven't even made a resume/LinkedIn for fucks sake. I am now still and will forever be super grateful and lucky that my parents (especially my father) are able to bear with me doing absolutely shit for so long and to provide for me.

Last month of November is probably the most important time for me in this long depressing story of mine. My mother and I went to Korea for a month to get a bunch of surgery done and to visit family. I got to meet a bunch of family members that I didn't know existed and realized that I've become an uncle. It was a really good experience for me. However, the most important part of the trip was that I had no access to games. I couldn't play games for a whole month and I can't remember the last time I didn't play games for a week. Albeit I did re watch the whole series of Friends when I was in my hotel. I didn't really do any sightseeing or anything super memorable but just seeing new family was more than enough for me to be content with the trip. My cousins there are much older than I am and they've been telling me their experiences with jobs and such. There wasn't really anything to take away from their experiences except the fact that getting a job isn't a cakewalk.

I came back home less than 2 weeks ago and something just snapped inside of me, telling me to do something with my life. I'm having strong feelings of regret which is why I'm feeling a bit depressed but I'm also kinda glad that I had this moment of realization. I've been lurking through some of my HS friends' LinkedIn profiles and am seeing that almost all of them are employed and have done internships/etc. I'm feeling left behind but I want to start my career now before it's too late. I've been playing less games than usual and have been going to the gym for the past week. I hope to maintain a healthy lifestyle as my past lifestyle was completely awful. Recently I've been looking at my options and have been thinking about several choices such as going to grad school, finally make my resume and start applying for jobs/interns, and to look into career counseling. 

My mind is pretty boggled since I'm trying to do so much at once in terms of finding a job for a career. I understand that a sociology degree isn't the most sought out degree for high paying jobs and I definitely don't want to do social work. I honestly just want a career in which I can advance in. Currently I've been looking into human resource positions because I believe that my degree in sociology is relevant to that line of work and the money is pretty good if I ever make it to a manager-level position. But first, I have to make my resume and etc. It really sucks that I don't have any relevant experiences or any internships as I found that most of the entry-level applicants do have some sort of experience. 

**I'd appreciate any advice or comments in regards to finding a job for someone such as myself.**

**TLDR** : Had to switch major from chem to sociology in my 2nd semester of my junior year in college to graduate on time b/c I fucked around too much. Fucked around for another year and a half (up till now) after graduating with no internships/past experiences under my belt so feeling depressed. Finally realized that I need to start a career ASAP.

Just to add, I'm very thankful for the few friends that I have whom have been very supportive about my situation. Without them, I would be feeling a lot worse and probably wouldn't have had the courage to post my story. "

Is it as simple as uploading school projects to github, being a good programmer, maintaining a good gpa, and just reaching out/applying to companies? What do they expect from undergrads? What is contributing to open source projects?

I am currently at a crossroads in life and would very much appreciate any advice/criticism. Sorry for the block of text. Also was told to post here since it's more programming based....


 25/ F - I worked at Geek Squad for 3.5 years doing IT troubleshooting/Repairing laptops and moved into a Database Administrator role. Loved that position, but I couldn't afford the last 2 years of university. I joined the USAF to get some funding for college, my job in no way relates to programming unfortunately.   

Fast forward 4 years and I am separating with my B.S in Information Technology (focus on programming). I am also admitted into Graduate School for my MS in Information Technology for Fall 2016. Currently I am applying for summer internships in programming or IT roles (trying to stay away from helpdesk/support) to get more experience. Additionally, I am moving to a completely to a new state where I do not have as many networking IT colleagues, but I have met a few.

I think ideally my future role would be more of a Project Management over software/IT, but I know that is not a ""starter"" role. The reason for this is because the business side of things interests me as well as the technical aspects. I feel that I have great communication/management skills that could be melded with the technical side. 

Before getting to that type of role I know it's important to have a focus.  Currently my focus is working on my programming, however my professional versus educational skills are not up to par and I want to LEARN more, hence wanting an internship. Although I do enjoy programming, I am not an expert at any one language. I have worked with several and dabble here and there (C++, Java, HTML, PHP, Python, VB). Math is not my strong subject (hence not getting a CS degree) and I am nervous I will not be up to par at all with other programmers. This is why I think it would be smart to try and get a programming internship, learn, and move from there.  

The problem it seems, and understandably so, that your coveted programming internships are filled by CS or Software Engineering majors. I have applied for over 20 so far (a strong resume and cover letter) and have gotten one or two bites, but nothing has lined up. Granted I have not moved there yet and this has all been on job boards. I had a GREAT internship offer for an application developer / rotating internship, but they offered it for a different location. 

 Is there another area of IT that would fit the bill for what I am eventually wanting to do? What are some things that I can do to boost my programming skills? My friend back home talked to me a bit about GitHub (just signed up today, still a bit lost) and CodeForAmerica. Now that I am not in school full time and working full time I have more time to work on these skills outside of school, but as far as working on projects, where should I begin?  

I guess I am nervous about my place in the IT world, transitioning from the military, moving to a new state, and starting graduate school. 

Also I am moving to Phoenix, AZ if that helps! 

Any advice would be appreciated....  Thanks! :)"
3wj2bl,54,2015-12-12,TIDTRT by giving a person a chance,tyr--,TIDTRT,https://www.reddit.com/r/TIDTRT/comments/3wj2bl/tidtrt_by_giving_a_person_a_chance/,"This actually happened a few months ago, but the results of what I did came to light a few days ago, so here goes..

I work for as a software engineer for a large company and, as every large company, we get lots of internship applications every year. In general, interviews for software engineering internships are done by three people (full-time positions have 5+ interviewers), one by one, and only after all the interviews are done we gather for a debrief meeting. As the internships are usually well paid, we are advised to look for the same skills and qualities as are the standards for full-time engineers, but to allow for mistakes due to inexperience.

So, the batch of interns I was interviewing that day was average, some good, some bad. But one guy stood out, as he was definitely older than 30, probably around 33-34. From his CV, I saw he dropped out of college, worked in jobs unrelated to IT and only recently enrolled back into his Bachelor's program. I was curious about the story, but as I'm not allowed to ask any (too) personal questions, I let it slide.

During the interview he was noticeably anxious and nervous, and felt very much out of place. After some soft-skills questions, I get to some technical questions where he was expected to solve a problem on the whiteboard. He didn't excel, and I'm sure he would not be able to solve the problem if left alone, so I tried to help him with hints, but he would still get stuck at the next phase. What I noticed, though, was that he would always take the hint onboard, learn something from it and go on. At the end of the interview, I was tasked with escorting the candidate out of the building and we chat a bit about his personal projects and I remembered he added a link to a blog to his CV. I check the blog and it only has two posts, but one was carefully dissecting a problem to the very minute details. Of course, the problem could have been solved much easier, but it showed how much did the candidate want to learn.

During the debrief meeting, the other two interviewers were against giving the candidate an offer, and I was also unsure if it was a good idea. Still, I went with my gut feeling that this person could achieve a lot if only given the right guidance and learning opportunity. I managed to somehow convince the other two into giving him a chance. After that, I had no further interaction with the candidate and had no idea if he even accepted the offer or not.

Fast-forward to a few days ago, when I see an email (managers usually send out emails about new hires, introducing them to the company) where this guy is announced as a new hire. Apparently he did so well in the internship and showed so much progress that he was offered a full-time position immediately after the internship was over. :)

Of course, he has no idea that he barely passed the internship interview, but I'm very glad he did!

TL;DR: Interviewed an internship candidate who went back to college after a long time. He did not do well. Still decided to give him an offer. He kicked ass during the internship and was offered a full-time position."

My story is basically this, I just got my BSc in CS and I'm working on my Master's. However, I'd prefer to start working full-time rather than finish my Master's. If I got a worthwhile internship though, I would probably keep going with the degree.

I want to apply to a couple places that are pretty selective.

Can I apply as full-time first and then if that doesn't work out apply as an intern? Or would I be auto-filtered out?
Is it generally ""easier"" to get in as an intern or new grad?

I have side projects, real experience, etc if that makes a difference. I.e. I'm not a totally inexperienced new grad."

First of all let me say I love reading through this sub and learning from all of you!  I plan to graduate with my bachelor's degree next winter (2016), and was wondering what the most common path people take when approaching graduation.

I definitely want to get started on my CPA exam as early as possible, but I also want to start getting some experience working (interested more in audit than tax).  

I plan to work really hard to get an internship position for the summer, so I at least have some experience for when I graduate.

Should I go right into full time work after graduation and study for the CPA in my free time?  Or is it wiser to dedicate more time to studying and less to working?  Is getting a master's degree necessary?  These are all questions that are stressing me out a bit.  Feel free to share what you guys did because I could really use some guidance! Thanks!"

For context, I'm a senior in college majoring in CS. On paper, it looks like I'm doing well -- I have a 3.5 GPA from a great school, I've worked on a really cool project with a student engineering group, and my GRE scores put me on the 90th percentile of all test takers. But the way my school talks about it, and comparing myself to my friends, I'm seriously struggling. It's just so discouraging to be made to feel like my supposedly-good stats aren't good enough, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

There are more stories than I can possibly recount here to explain what I mean about this atmosphere, but here's a few.

1) When I asked a professor to write me a letter of recommendation (I'm applying to do a master's in CS at the same institution so I can learn more about NLP because I think it's just the coolest thing ever and don't have time to take more classes in it during undergrad), his reply was that because I got 75% on one of six assignments in one of two classes I took with him, I wasn't grad school material. That class was two years ago, and I got an A in both classes overall.   

2) I was discussing my summer options with a friend last spring, and when I finished talking about two internships that I'd been offered and a research position on campus, he said, ""If that's all I was offered, I would frankly be insulted."" Before he said that I was excited.

3) I've applied to all the big-name tech companies every year (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft...) and never even gotten an interview. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I know only one other CS major in my cohort who has not interned at one of these big companies. What about me is so unappealing?? I've had professors and professionals review my resume, and they say it looks good.

4) When I interned at a ~300-person startup two summers ago, my boss gave me super positive feedback and the other people on the engineering team said I did a great job and they'd love to have me back. But I did try to find out about opportunities there the next year, and they just ignored my emails and online application until June, when they apologized that they hadn't gotten back to me for five months. While there, I also got lots of comments from people about how they assumed I was on the marketing team or were shocked at how quickly I finished the projects they assigned me.

I could go on and on but I don't know if I need to. I've applied to a broad range of internships for next summer (at big and small companies) and also fulltime positions, because with my track record I'm not optimistic about getting into grad school. But so far no interviews. And I'm not just spamming my resume at people, either -- I'm carefully writing cover letters and tailoring my resume if applicable. I just feel like this industry is impossible to get into and I don't know what I'm doing wrong :("

While he's already begun his career, I'm just getting started with mine. I'm making an effort to obtain an internship with a large company in my area and need to be smoke-free for about a month until I know where I stand a chance or not. During my break, he will continue to smoke.

I think the most difficult part has been dealing with the depressive symptoms that come as a result of me wanting to smoke but knowing that I can't.  During the day, I'm completely fine, but at night, that's when the negative emotions come into play.

My sadness gets so extreme that I literally find nothing that we do as enjoyable as I did before. It seems as if the only thing that relives these symptoms is going to bed, which I've been doing between 7:30-8 these past few days.

So for those of you who've been off longer than me: does it get better? And when will these intense cravings subside? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading."

There's a tldr at the bottom.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm still in school but I took the fall semester off for an internship that was such a good opportunity that I just couldn't pass up. It was hard work and long hours in a completely different city but it's done now and I'm back. I've re-enrolled for the Spring semester.

&amp;nbsp;

Another development is that I sort of have a fella now. I say ""sort of"" because we're not really exclusive or anything, but we have a Daddy/little, border-lining on Master/slave relationship going. This is the first relationship of this kind I've had so it's still kinda new to me. Him too actually, but he's got a pretty dominant personality anyways and with me being so submissive we're falling into our roles nicely.

&amp;nbsp;

I met him at the firm that I interned at. He's almost 20 years older than me, one of the senior guys there, not quite partner yet, but definitely on track for it in a year or so. From here on out when I mention ""Daddy"" I'm referring to him.

&amp;nbsp;

As an intern, I didn't work directly under him. He was like my boss's boss's boss's boss or something like that. However, because of some of the work I had to do, I just happen to have an opportunity to work quite closely with him and his assistant.

&amp;nbsp;

Just to give you some visuals, I'm about 5'4"" and 115lb measuring at 34C-25-35. Daddy is a lot taller than me, I think at least 6'3"". He's divorced and has a lot of time on his hands so he goes to the gym pretty frequently. Which gave him a nice strong and muscular body but he's not chiseled or anything.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, he took me out a few times and we got close. I teased him mercilessly with my exhibitionist tendencies. He took everything surprisingly well though, staying composed through every panty flash and nip slip. Then everything changed after a fancy party thrown by one of the firm's biggest clients.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course we didn't go together, that would have been too obvious, though I was wearing a dress that he bought me. We partied and danced and had a great time. Towards the end, I couldn't find him anymore. As I was looking for him, I got a text from him which just included an address and a room number. 

&amp;nbsp;

Curious and horny, I drove to the address he sent me and found myself at a nice hotel. Based on the room number, I figured out that the room is on the 10th floor and took the elevator and found the room easily enough. I knocked on the door, he opened it and pulled me inside. We kissed for the first time while franticly ripping off each other's clothes.

&amp;nbsp;

He pushed me down on the bed and entered my already wet pussy. With one slow push, he bottoms out inside me. I have NEVER had a real cock this deep inside me. We start getting into a rhythm, each stroke had his cock head pressed against the entrance of my womb. I put my legs over his shoulders and he slowly pushed his cock against my cervix and continued to apply pressure. Gently, he pushed further and his pelvis finally met my butt. His cock head is now embedded in the deepest part of my pussy, past my cervix. I've previously only able to reach this spot while riding my dildo. We picked up speed and he pumped his cock into me, bottoming out each time. He's hitting a magical spot deep inside me and I'm almost paralyzed with pleasure, quickly building up to a mind blowing orgasm. That's when he pulled his cock out completely.

&amp;nbsp;

After a pause, he plunged back in and continued. Just as I was getting close, he withdrew from my pussy and left me empty again. He continued to bring me to the edge and denying me my release, I was going out of my mind. I tried to rub my clit but he pinned my hands to the bed and continued his assault on my tiny cunt. I begged for my orgasm but he told me that I was being punished for teasing him over the last couple weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

He pulled me up from the bed and walked me to the floor to ceiling window overlooking the street and pressed my hands to the window with my arms outstretched to the side. My pussy stretched around his cock as he entered me from behind. His pelvis slammed into my ass with every thrust, which, in turn, pressed my tits into the cool glass. My G-spot is getting absolutely pummeled with each violent stroke.

&amp;nbsp;

Despite my pleading, he's still not letting me cum. He tells me to look down at the people and cars in the street, look at the people in the buildings across the street. People who are staying late in the office, or settling down in their condo for a evening in. If they only knew where to look, they can all have a front row seat of my pussy getting used by him. He asked me if this is what I wanted, if this turns me on. I tell him yes and that I want to be his little slut. I'm begging him to own me, to claim me, to be my Daddy and make me his little fuck toy, his little girl. He starts fucking me even harder, slamming me into the window. I can feel the orgasm that has been building is about to crash over me like a freight train. 

&amp;nbsp;

This time, he didn't stop. When my orgasm hit, it's like when the roller coaster finally reaches the top, that split second just before going over the edge. Every muscle in my body contracted as tight as possible for 10 to 15 seconds or so, and then I went over the edge. My pussy explodes and I started squirting all over his cock and spraying my juice down my thighs. my body starts shaking uncontrollably. He's not letting up even when my pussy is pulsing with a vice-grip like strength around his cock. I have never came like this in my life, a none-stop orgasm that crashes over me, over and over again. I lost track of how long I came, or how many times. Maybe they all blended into each other as one continuous climax. Then everything slowly faded to black.

&amp;nbsp;

When I finally regained my senses, I realized I'm still pinned to the window. I'm being supported by his strong hands holding my wrists above my head and my ass on his pelvis, his cock still buried to the hilt inside me. I guess I'm literally being supported by his cock. Apparently, I was only out for a few seconds. He pulled out of me inch by inch and lowers me gently to the ground. My body is numb and tingling. I glanced up at him, his cock still proud and erect, gleaming with my wetness. Streaks of my cum running down his muscular legs. I only wanted one thing, his cum inside me. I managed to get up to my knees and tried my best to swallow as much of his cock as possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been told that I give exceptional head, but I'm not very good at deep throating just yet. This is something that he would eventually train me on, but, at this point in time, I was just concentrating on extracting his cum as soon as possible. I keep just the head of his cock in my mouth and suck it in and out while stroking the rest of his length. Soon, I felt his cock tighten and filled my mouth with blast after blast of thick and delicious cum. I had to swallow three times to keep his sperm from overflowing my mouth. When he finally stopped I continue to gently suckle him and stroke him to make sure I got every single drop. I felt like I just had a meal from how much cum I had just ingested.

&amp;nbsp;

Since that night, we have had many sexual adventures, big and small. I always do as Daddy commands and Daddy uses his little slut any way he pleases. He loves showing me off and I love being his cum whore in public.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll eventually post more of our fun times. Some will be when we were together this past summer and fall, others might be more current. Perhaps assignments he has given me, or when he flys in and visits me here, which he does quite regularly.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry again if this was too long, but I felt like it was necessary to give some context.

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr**: Been away in a different city, met an older man who became my Daddy and ""master"". I'm allowed to date and be with other people, but he's my Daddy and I do as I'm told."

I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science so if you wanna hook me up with a software engineering internship for the summer of 2016 then I'll knock a nice sum off of the asking price LOL. But seriously, I'm looking for an internship and can send you my resume. I've previously worked at a lab working on computer vision algorithms for a robot to automate the assembly process of neural probes using OpenCV and have also worked at a startup and overhauled/refactored their backend completely, which was written in Django. And of course, I have a bunch of other side projects/hackathons that involve a mixture of all those skills. So^^pls^^help

But other things I'd be interested in is a 980ti because I have a BNIB MSI Gaming 980 that I did not timestamp or list but would want to trade up to a 980ti. Or if anyone here is into cycling and has a nice set of road wheels they'd like to trade (&lt; 1600 grams) then yah.

3wk0zu,4,2015-12-12,"Low GRE Score, not a great GPA reconsidering whether graduate school is the right option, anyone else feeling like this?",myinnerblues,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3wk0zu/low_gre_score_not_a_great_gpa_reconsidering/,"I recently took the GRE, and scored below my practice averages and scored  152V 156Q, and I am feeling so disappointed and discouraged right now.  I have pretty bad testing anxiety and choked during the second half of the test not even finishing the verbal sections.  My GPA isn't great either at a 3.4 with a BA in Econ (but I took the easy route in school, and still fucked up). I am now taking one class in economic research methods to boost my record a little, but I am not sure if this is really helping.        
     
I wanted to continue my education with an MPP or applied social research  masters for social policy in hopes to work for international organizations such as UNDP, UNDESA or local NGOs that emphasize on research for social and economic development.  I know that my grades could still get me into a lower tier MPP program, but I am not sure if it is worth the investment as I know that MPP graduates starting salary is usually not very high, and I don't think I would be qualified for any funding.       
     
I don't have much research experience, which I think is also holding my application back. I worked on a research project for one of my professors and under a PhD candidate (whom I worked directly with) in Tanzania as the assistant, collecting and cleaning data and managing local workers. I have one UN agency internship, and I am currently working as a volunteer research assistant for a local NGO that works in East Africa, collecting country background information for technical support.        
    
The professor I worked for on the project agreed to write a letter of rec for me, but asked to see my application packet before hand, specifically asking me for my GRE scores, letter of intent, and CV. I am too embarrassed to show him my scores, afraid he will reconsider his decision even after being in the top 20% of his class and working for him.    
    
Application deadlines are coming up in February (some are rolling but with no option of funding) and I don't know what to do. Most of the schools I wanted to apply to where in Europe which don't require the GRE, but I was still considering schools here such as, American University, and UMASS Amherst or the Demography program at UCI. Now I am thinking to just apply to European masters, they are less expensive and some are one year programs, maybe I can do this in lieu of post-bac or graduate diploma? I don't think the training I have right now is sufficient enough for me to get a job beyond an internship. I have applied for research assistant jobs all over the country and abroad and I haven't heard back aside from unpaid internships.    
     
I guess I am asking for advice or personal stories. I am just stuck in a rut beating myself over this.  My parents are not very supportive of my career route. I don't know whether its better for me to focus my energy on finding a job that is relevant and push back my masters until I feel like I am a more qualified candidate, or put in the effort now and just apply for the masters.  

TL;DR  Low GRE okay GPA, looking for advice on how to move forward and whether if it is worth it for me to apply.   
    
    
EDIT: If anyone was interested in what programs I wanted to apply for here are some schools I am interested in Europe:    
    
Univ. of Copenhagen- Global Development, Pompeu Fabra- Sociology and Demography, Central European University- MPA, University of Stockholm- Applied Social Research, UCL- Social Policy.  My goals for going into a masters program is to firstly gain more research experience within social policy preferably at an international level, and then learn more about the policy making/ managerial side of organizations, that's why I have been going back and forth between one-year research masters or policy programs that do have a significant research work related portion.

3wkcw9,377,2015-12-12,My parents need me [20F] to give them the money they saved for my college tuition to help pay for my brother's [19M] tuition.,HardHeart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wkcw9/my_parents_need_me_20f_to_give_them_the_money/,"My parents paid into a program that covers my tuition. I went to a cheap state school that gave me a full ride, so each semester I get that extra money my parents saved into my account.

My parents have taken money from my savings in the past, multiple times, without my permission, to pay bills. It's happened enough that as soon as I turned 18, I got my own bank account. So instead of just taking money from me when they need it (or ""need"" it), they now have to ASK.

Which they did my freshman year when they wanted to take a family trip to hawaii ($2,000). I wasn't happy about it, because I was still upset about the money they took my senior year of high school. But since it's their money, I gave it to them.

My brother is a year younger than me, but he didn't do so well his freshman year. He lost his scholarships, and my parents convinced him to drop his second semester for ""medical reasons"" (he wasn't following his ADHD treatment plan) before he did more damage to his GPA.

Now he's at a private university closer to home. He's working hard, and he's having trouble pulling his grades up, but he's trying and I respect that. I've even helped him with homework a couple times (we're both in engineering). The parents also have him on an expensive weight loss program, which I think is misguided, but it seems to be working better than the other diets they've put him on...

Because of this and other reasons (inheritance tax after my grandfather's recent death), my parents asked me for the money I received for tuition the previous fall. I expected them to ask for some money, but I didn't expect them to ask for ALL of it from FALL 2014 ($3,500)

I had a good amount of money saved up, because of an internship spring semester. And it was, in fact, their money to begin with. So I gave it to them.

After I asked my dad if I'd have to do this again, he told me yes.

I've had several talks with them about how upset this has made me, but they don't seem to think I should be upset. They don't think I should mind helping out the family. I applied to some really cool spring break study abroad trips so I wouldn't have to give up the money, but they said I could not go because they needed the money. So I withdrew my applications.

I don't know how to feel about this. I hate confrontation, but I HAVE confronted them about it several times, but they don't really see how them repeatedly needing money from me has hurt me and disrespected my boundaries. 

I can't just NOT give them the money, because then my brother would be screwed.

And I know this is awful of me, but I'm pretty upset that my 15 year old sister is currently having a much better high school experience than me, and she will probably won't have to make personal sacrifices for the family when she graduates. Maybe the parents are taking money from her, maybe they aren't. She doesn't know and she doesn't seem to care, because she doesn't check her bank account and the parents usually buy her what she wants anyway.

I don't know what to do about this. I don't know if they'll continue to ask me for money after I graduate. I certainly won't give it to them, because it'll actually be my money. But that doesn't really help me right now.
   
**tl;dr**: Parents using me as their personal bank account. Plz help.

**Edit:** 
Thank you to everyone who contributed.

Half of you have my point of view. The other half have my parents. This is extremely frustrating, but I guess at least neither points of view are unjustified... It helps me to have some perspective.

I am going to give the money to my parents. But I still do not think they should be putting me in this position. I know their financial situation better than you do, and I promise you they wouldn't need money from me if they quit spending so much on vacations and other unnecessary luxuries."

3wlasb,36,2015-12-12,Thank-you. 90 days in.,HeyItsDanelli,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3wlasb/thankyou_90_days_in/,"I am a long time lurker here and today I want to say thanks. Thanks for helping me take control of my life again.

I have been browsing and attempting nofap for about a year and a half now and I have finally made it to 90 days.

Backstory: When I was 19 I went off to University with a girlfriend that lived back home… this lead to a lot of PMOing. Halfway through the first year was when I started to change because of it. I stopped socializing, I stopped playing sports, and I started eating really bad and would just sit at home watching movies, playing video games and PMOing. Over the next two years I would go on to gain somewhere around 50 lbs, break up with my girlfriend, have bad ED, have severe social anxiety to the point where it was hard to take public transit, lose a lot of friends from me always bailing on them, and drop out of university because I would rather sit at home and PMO than attend class. 
So one day I was looking up ways to help beat depression on google when someone listed something called ‘nofap’. I looked more into and ended up here reading all your success stories, what nofap can do for an individual and the support everyone has for complete strangers here but are all feeling the same way. I had many streaks of 20 days, 30 days, and a few 50 days to get to this 90 today. It has taken me a year and a half to do it but it has been worth it. I don’t plan on stopping, my goal is now 180.

I feel better than ever. I am back in shape as I am motivated to hit the gym at least 4 times a week. I fixed my posture. I have read more books in the last 6 months than I have the previous 6 years. I take a cold shower daily. I dress a lot better now. I went to college and got an internship in a management position at a fortune 500 company. My friends want to be around me now. I now have plans to get a business degree. I am always now looking to better myself. This all started here.

Here is a list of nofap benefits that I have personally noticed:

-	Clearer mind
-	Anxiety and depression non existent (took a little more time than other benefits)
-	Confidence
-	Deeper voice
-	Clear skin (no more acne)
-	Eye contact is no problem for me anymore
-	More energized
-	Rock hard erections and huge loads (can go multiple rounds now too) 
-	ED is gone
-	Girls seem to be more attracted to me than ever before
-	People randomly compliment me more now
-	I am horny as hell
-	Sleep better/fall asleep easier
-	Not afraid of confrontation anymore. By this I simply mean I will not let people walk over me. I have boundaries and I keep those boundaries. I am very direct with people now. 

Don’t get me wrong, for a lot of these benefits to kick in you have to get off your ass and leave your comfort zone but nofap is how I started it all. 

The only cons I’ve had so far are wet dreams, flat lines, and the urge to relapse. I now do kegels until that urge goes away and it’s helped me ever since.

Again, I want to thank you all and wish everyone else all the best on their personal nofap journeys. I am now 23 and finally excited about the future and living life each day. I hope this story can contribute to somebody’s success just like the many stories on here have done with me.

3wleoo,1,2015-12-12,27M4F Up for (almost!) anything!,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wleoo/27m4f_up_for_almost_anything/,"As the title implies, I'm up for pretty much anything this evening. That encompasses dirty talk, RP'ing, or any other kind of back-and-forth you can imagine. As long as it doesn't fit into my no-goes list, which is down below, I'm game.

Long story short, I'm a giver. When a woman I'm going back and forth with enjoys herself and gets off, it turns me on. As such, I'm looking to give tonight, and I'm interested to see where that takes me.

If you're just looking for dirty chat, fire away with a naughty orange envelope and let's get started. If you're looking to RP, I've got a few sample prompts below as starting points, but I'm willing to consider a lot.

-----

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

That aforementioned list of limits: Animals/furries/non-humans, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, noncon, extreme age play.

Hope to hear from you ladies tonight!"

He said that they do not have any openings in the core tax group, but he will let me know if anything changes a couple of months before my start date. I know that I absolutely do not want to stay in multistate tax, so I know that I will do whatever it takes to make it happen. Also I feel like they would always need people in the core group in Chicago due to turnover and business need at such a large office.

Can anyone comment on how likely I am at getting a spot in the core tax group with about seven months until my start date? And if it does not happen, how would I approach the situation after starting? I do not want to spend time in something that I know I am not going to pursue, but I also do not want to seem like a quitter/whiner. Thank you!!!"

Working through practice problems but also deciding between reading The Algorithm Design Manual and Intro. to Algorithms (CLRS),routebeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wls0q/have_an_interview_with_a_big_company_in_1_month/,"Hi all,

I've got a big interview for an internship with one of the big 4 and I really want to kill it and get the job. I've been going over practice problems and reading through Cracking the Coding Interview and I wanted to cement my data structures/algorithms knowledge more, so I'm trying to decide between the two books in the title. 

I have CLRS and The Algorithm Design Manual, and both are highly reviewed and recommended, but to my understanding CLRS approaches the topic from a much more graduate/academic standpoint, and thus has a lot details, whereas The Algorithm Design Manual is less intensive.

From people that have read both, which do you think would be the most time-efficient for me to read? I'd like to know which I could realistically get through in less than a month and retain what I've read. I don't need/want to understand the implementation of Red-Black Trees, but I do want to get a good overview of Trees, Lists, Graphs, etc.

Thanks in advance, and any other advice on prepping would be much appreciated :)"

specs:

* i7-4720
* GTX980M 4GB

* 15.6"" 1080p screen

It works great for gaming but is also quite the workhorse for other applications. I used it to host a database for ISM 4212, did development work for ISM 3232, hosted a couple VMs and did pen testing and packet sniffing for ISM 4930, and did a fair amount of data mining and analytic work for a previous internship on it. Its an all around great laptop, I just need something with a larger screen and a number pad. 

asking $1500 but can negotiate. Cash or PayPal, no trades. 


Edit: The initial 1 year of hardware and accidental damage warranty expire May 22, 2016 and are transferable to the new owner. "
3wly0w,3,2015-12-12,javascript diagram layout,turleyn,yosys,https://www.reddit.com/r/yosys/comments/3wly0w/javascript_diagram_layout/,"I've been circling back around to take a look at building a javscript digital logic diagram from the json backend of yosys and I keep on being amazed at how many complicated problems I keep running into. That GSOC intern had his work cut out for him.

I've made a couple of prototypes at this point. Some of them were pretty neat looking. For the layout problem, I tried to do a force based layout (making wires act like springs, nodes repel each other like charged particles, etc) which worked pretty good for combinational logic but made a rats nest of anything with feedback. I've been reading about how to fix cycles. It looks like Graphviz dot tries to reverse links that create cycles and I could probably do something similar by just removing the force it exerts but I'm still a little confused how to pick which links are feedback links. My gut feeling is that the best links to be reversed are the ones that produce the longest path, but solving for the longest path seems like a difficult problem. In fact, it looks like wikipedia says it's an NP-Hard problem.

Has anyone else put some thought into this? I've been puzzling about it for a while now and my puzzler is sore. I might be overthinking this and just picking links at random might produce adequately aesthetic diagrams or perhaps our diagrams will always have few enough cycles that brute forcing it is trivial but I keep thinking there must be a better way to do this."

3wmbse,0,2015-12-13,"Co-op student, working 2 back-to-back B4 internships. Tips/advice?",cats-are-my-life,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3wmbse/coop_student_working_2_backtoback_b4_internships/,"Hi everyone,

So, after a hectic recruiting season, I had some good luck and received a few offers for a January internship, and one for a May internship. I chose to go with one big 4 firm for busy season internship in Jan, and a different big 4 firm for May. This way, I can get exposure to the culture of 2 firms and see what's the best fit for me. I really liked the people at both firms, and they both focused on mostly doing 4 month internships rather than 8. I also needed to get 2 internships under my belt to get my co-op terms done, which are 12 months total required - the Jan internship will be my first. 

I did speak to the career centre at my school after getting offers (and before signing), and they said working at multiple firms is encouraged. As well, some managers at my pre-interview socials suggested for me to ""intern at other companies as well"", to get a feel of what works for me. So heeding this advice, I thought it would be great experience to intern at multiple firms. 

However, now I'm a little worried this may be seen as disloyal or like I am only working at a firm to make some money as an intern, and not interested in a long term career. As of now, I feel I am truly invested in both firms and would be delighted to receive a full time offer from either, but especially after reading threads on here, it seems like doing multiple big 4 internships at different B4 firms is not that common. 

For instance, I wouldn't want my coworkers at one firm to think negatively of me if they found out I am later interning at one of their competitors, nor would i want to have to hide something like that. FWIW, if my school discouraged this at all (again, some people on threads here have said their schools discourage it), I wouldn't have gone for it - I just thought that when it came to experience, more was better. And I do believe if I am lucky enough to get offers from both firms, it will not be an easy decision seeing where to launch my career. 

Does anyone have any advice for me about if this is a stupid thing to worry about? How long would a firm wait to give an offer (I have over a year left until I graduate.) And would it be okay to tell coworkers at my first internship, for instance, where i'll be going during the summer if they ask, or should I keep it to myself? I live in Canada if that helps. 

TL;DR advice for interning at 2 B4 firms back-to-back and whether this is seen as something done in poor taste? Career centre advised me it was encouraged and more than okay, but now I'm a little worried about it. "

3wn5zj,309,2015-12-13,Unreasonable future inlaws or am I [28F] in the wrong?,inlawswtf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wn5zj/unreasonable_future_inlaws_or_am_i_28f_in_the/,"Yesterday morning I was lazily drinking coffee and watching TV with my boyfriend when we got a knock on the door. We live in an apartment building so we don't usually get people knocking on our door. I was kind of scared so I got really quiet and told my boyfriend to look through the peephole. To our surprise it was his parents. They arrived unannounced. The apartment was a mes, my fault because I've been studying like mad lately (I'm a medical student on rotations) and we were both wearing pajamas. 

Background info: This past January my boyfriend of 8 years proposed to me. It was our 8 year anniversary and I was really happy. I immediately posted it to facebook, which admittedly may have been childish. His mother called him within 20 minutes. I thought she was going to congratulate us but instead she gave him a tongue lashing of epic proportions and told him that he should have discussed any marriage plans directly with her before doing anything. She felt that she shouldn't have to learn of her son's engagement on facebook. I felt awful. She told my boyfriend that we would have to go over to her house to have a discussion about this. I told my boyfriend to just call off the engagement because it didn't really matter. It wasn't the right time and his parents were really upset. My boyfriend ended up telling his mother not to worry and we called off the engagement. I took the post down from facebook. She wouldn't let it drop and still pressed for us to have this conversation. I was really dreading it because I am a little afraid of his mother. I actually didn't go to her house until May.

When we sat down to talk she explained that she did want us to get married. It's not that she didn't want us to move the relationship forward, she just wanted to be included in the planning of the wedding or engagement or anything. I told her that she was welcome to plan the wedding if that made her  happy. My future in-laws are very Catholic and they want the wedding to be in a Catholic church. That's fine with me but I specifically told his mother that I am quite shy and I really don't like big weddings. She was not happy at all because has 8 siblings all with multiple children and tons of cousins. The thing is that I am extremely shy and I have never dreamed of having a wedding because I hate being the center of attention and I hate being photographed. This was not meant to offend her but she took it as a huge offense. I can't win with this woman.

Cut to the present: This past week I asked my boyfriend if it would be okay if we had a city hall wedding first so I could take his last name before I apply to residency. We never really started planning a wedding back in May with his mother because I was too busy and she did want me to be involved in the planning to a certain extent. I need to have his name by July because that is when I start my hospital internships. I either want to start my career with my new name or keep my original name. I know that it's important to my boyfriend that I take his name so I figured that this would be a quick solution and that we could have a big Catholic ceremony some time in the future when we both have the time to plan it. He called his mother and presented the whole idea to her. This could not have gone worse. She screamed at him endlessly, putting the phone down only to take a breath. She showed up to our apartment unannounced yesterday morning in a rage with her husband. She yelled at me so hard that I nearly cried in front of her. His father told me I was too old to keep delaying things. His parents told me in a pretty threatening way that they had always been good to me and that if I didn't respect their wishes for a Catholic ceremony that they would no longer support my marriage to their son and said that we could no longer count on them for anything. I fell into my boyfriend arms crying after they left because I felt so defeated. I have a huge exam tomorrow and I couldn't study. I was so depressed. I felt like I ruined my boyfriend's relationship with his parents which was never my intention. I don't know what to do. I told them that I would gladly do it their way but they accused me of being a liar for not upholding their deal in May. I saw it more as I didn't have time to plan anything because I had my board exam and I didn't want to change my name mid-career. The name thing doesn't even really matter to me that much. I just wanted to make my boyfriend happy because the name thing really means something to him. It seems I can't make anyone happy. 

tl;dr: Future in-laws hate me and showed up to my house in a rage demanding a Catholic wedding ceremony. Is it even possible to repair this relationship?"
3wnd5j,5,2015-12-13,Frustrated over training requirements- need EBPs.,zombirific,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/3wnd5j/frustrated_over_training_requirements_need_ebps/,"At my agency there is an incentive program, which is tied into our annual performance reviews. Part of that is trainings, in order to exceed in this category, we must complete 15 hours every 6 months, or 30 hours annually. 

So throughout the year I do trainings- we get emailed webinars and such from my supervisor and other colleagues within the agency. I had my 6 month review in June- I seem to be on track for exceeding, everything is fine.

Fast forward to December. I completed more than 30 hours of trainings and was told that ONLY Evidence Based Practices or Evidence Promising Practices count and only in the area of treatment. So only 10 hours out of my 30 hours counted and as a result my incentive was less than it should have been.

Rightfully so, I'm really angry. I have until Wednesday to write my response to the performance agreement, as I refused to sign it on the spot because I wanted time to think about my response.

This prompted a long conversation between my supervisor and myself and I appropriately vented my frustrations about the process. I'm going to ask for a copy of my completed list of trainings so I can research them and see if anything else counts.

Now I'm just beyond frustrated with everything and I don't even want to go to trainings unless they will count towards my annual requirement, and that is not a good attitude to have. My time is limited- I work a reduced schedule (32 hrs/week) in order to intern at a clinic within the agency (14 hrs/week) and I'm attending grad school full time, free time is not something I come by often and my work week is very busy so doing any trainings takes away from the time I get to do my actual work. 

I doubt there is anything I can do this time to fix this, but going forward does anyone have a good resource for  finding EBP trainings, preferably free or webinars? I don't want to be in the same position 6 months from now. 

Thanks for reading my giant wall of text!"

I am a computer engineering student in one of the better universities of my country (Turkey which as you may know a sinking ship). I recently started to apply for internships in various companies in the US, but I started to receive rejection mails from them which makes me ask what do I do wrong, how can I improve? I currently, don't have any significant extracurricular project to put on resume which may be the issue here. By the way, the part time job in the resume is 18 hours per week (which I carry on together with my education)

Could you please take a look at my resume (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5z_WyaKlrZAS3BOWEcyeExfOXc/view) and give me some recommendations on the resume, on the companies and internship application (or even on the life itself)? There might be things that look awkward for the US employees, I merely translated this from my Turkish resume, if there any, I can fix those as well.

Thank you for your support. "

3wo7c0,3,2015-12-13,I (21m) met my ex-girlfriend (20w) after 8 months of no contact. Need opinions.,No_corona,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wo7c0/i_21m_met_my_exgirlfriend_20w_after_8_months_of/,"Hey guys, I need your opinions!

So a little background history:
This girl Tina (20) and me (21) were in a relationship for about 2 years. It ended this year in March. The reason we broke up is, because we both started university, I really tried to stay close to her, visited her once a week and tried small things to brighten her day over texts and calls. But somehow she always wanted to be free, to get to know herself better and was planning to do an internship in germany. So after fighting for our relationship I gave up and told her, if she wants to be with me, she has to show me, because I didn't have the power anymore. I was very upset for the next 2-3 weeks, while she tried to show me some attention. Eventually she gave up after 2 weeks and broke up with me (she loved me, but not in the same way anymore). I still tried to fight for her after the break up, she got insecure, but stayed with the decision. That's the last time we had a conversation and she went to germany to do the internship. We had a really nice relationship, sure with fights, but also great trips and memories. I cut contact and improved myself like crazy, I am so happy with my life right now.

So fast forward to friday night. I was out with my best friends in my hometown city. We just left the bar and baam, there she is, standing right in front of me (I thought she won't come back till February). I was a little tipsy and in a very good mood, so I just came to her and hugged her. I was very shocked, but at the same time so glad to see her. We had a nice little conversation, laughed and hugged two more times. I told her we should meet for a coffee in future, she agreed and left...

I would love to see her, because in all the girls I dated (go for drinks) I lost interest so quickly, and often thought about Tina. Also maybe I could finally have a clean break and stop thinking about her. But at the same time, I am so afraid. Finals are coming up in January, I have to stay focused, afraid of beeing hurt again and afraid of old feelings.

Should I still meet her? I really care about her.

Thank you guys and girls ;)

TL;DR; Met my ex-girlfriend for the first time after 8 months. Care about her, but afraid of old feelings. Should we meet or not?"

3wp760,10,2015-12-13,Interview for dream industry next week- CA government water pollution abatement. Lots of questions!,steeeeeeeeeeeeevs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3wp760/interview_for_dream_industry_next_week_ca/,"Hi, r/jobs, 


I've been a frequenter here for quite some time and I'm back to ask for some advice concerning a new opportunity.  So let's get right into it. 


**About me**


* Graduated 2012 from a UC with B.A. in Environmental Studies/Sociology. 


* Emphasized law and policy with a serious interest in water law/policy/regulation/quality/distribution.  Was inspired by a professor who happened to have worked on the regional water board of this area to pursue a career in water. 


* Active in the local water scene-- i.e. attending and writing about local desalination debate in 2012; attending 3 conferences detailing new and emerging technologies in the sustainability field; sampling trainings through program sponsors at PG&amp;E's Pacific Energy Center; participant in campus sustainability office events and networking. 


* Internship with an organization funded through PG&amp;E, SCE, SDG&amp;E, and TVA to work with on campus students in area of water and energy conservation.  Notable achievements: successful grant for campus funds for an energy retrofit project on campus; 3 major outreach events saving thousands of kWh/year for the university; project planning and implementation; increasing social media representation (including building and publishing the first independent website for the program); overseeing total of 5 interns throughout time with the program. 


* Worked on special assignment between quarters including: with a large construction company on a LEED certified campus for a huge name in animation.  Worked with LEED professionals, architects, and project managers to provide administrative support-- also got to see real-life application of water recycling in new construction (relevant to the position in that the site uses reclaimed water for grounds irrigation); and working with a school district Energy Manager to complete an energy retrofit project, saving said district $10k in utility costs within the first year. 


* Post-grad: worked intermittently with a large school district in fiscal services, payroll, accounting, maintenance, facilities, technology, etc. to provide backup department support, employee technology trainings, and to streamline new processes.


* Following this, worked for 2 years with a boutique CPA firm as ""Director of Client Relations"" focusing on building and maintaining relationships with high-profile client base, customer service, scheduling, tax assistance, and general adherence to federal, state, and local regulations pertinent to the industry.  


* Overall: 6+ years of administrative support experience- 2 and a half as executive administrative support.  Industries ranging from public to private; education to tax. 

* Want more than anything to work in the water industry! 


**About this job** 


After months (5 to be exact) of unemployment, I have been offered an interview with a large name in water pollution control in my desired location (2 hours away from where I currently live).  This is an entry level administrative support specialist position to work in the admin services department of the regional treatment plant.  I have passed the examination and am now preparing for the interview.  Which brings me to...


**My specific questions** 


* I have a small gap (5 months) of unemployment that I need to tactfully explain in my interview.  What is the best way to say ""Since July (when I quit my last job) I have been a classified sub at the school district I worked with in the past and have been intently focusing on finding not just any job, but the right job (which I believe in my heart of hearts this job is).""  I want to avoid coming off like I've been getting rejected a lot (which I have) or like I'm not doing anything to professionally develop/keep busy. 


* I am up against roughly 8 other candidates, most of whom are local.  This puts me at a disadvantage, I know.  I need to be able to explain the distance and why, despite that, I am the best candidate.  I fully anticipate a question regarding this and have been trying to come up with the right way to say ""I have targeted this area because of its ecological significance (and economic significance-- huge agricultural industry that benefits from the water treatment/recycling here to abate groundwater withdrawal and seawater intrusion), I want to build a life here, I have always been involved in promoting environmental stewardship here (re: my college internship happened to be in a community about 45 minutes south of this opportunity).  Distance or not, I am the best candidate due to my past work experience, my educational foundation in the industry, and my desire for long-term growth with this specific organization.  I am relocating full-time (currently I am part time in the area) at my own cost commensurate with the right job opportunity."" 


* I anticipate being asked about the specific types of records/reports/confidential information I've worked with and the exhaustive list is LONG (it takes me about 3 minutes to go through the list when timing my response to the question).  I've only put those things that are noted in the job announcement but it is still long.  How do I fit everything in without (a) it being a 3 minute response and (b) without sounding like a list? 


* I also need to have the right way to explain why I quit my past job.  My real answer is that I left in the summer months to give the firm enough time to find/train my replacement before the busy season (January-April), but mostly because the work wasn't satisfying and I wanted to rededicate my career/life to the environment and move to my desired location.  Previously I've stated in interviews ""I left [firm] in the summer with one month notice to give them the time needed to find and train my replacement before the busy season.  I stayed past my notice to train my replacement personally, as the position is very integral to the office functioning, and because in two years I learned a lot of nuances that come with knowing the staff.  As an added layer of security, I created a position manual for the new hire with all of this information and other tidbits of staff likes/dislikes, certain VIP client preferences/needs, and all procedures and technologies that would be involved in the job.""  Is this what hiring managers want to hear? 


* Any (and I mean ANY) other things I should make sure to mention to give me a leg up.  


**Misc.** 


* I've posted my resume here and on r/resumes before, I'd be happy to post/pm it to anyone interested in seeing how I match up to the job description. 


* This is a government position for a Joint Powers Agency in water recycling/wastewater treatment. 


* The first round of interviews (as explained by the HR coordinator that administered the exam) is a panel-style interview with several members of the agency; followed by a second interview with the specific team I'd be supporting; and finally a lunch to ensure that personalities mesh. 


* I've gone through the first two stages of the process (application appraisal and those pesky employment exams). 


Anyway, I'm sorry if this went a bit long.  I'm just looking for every bit of advice I can get because this is the one.  This is literally the start in the career that I studied for, in the area that I want to be in, in the salary I want with the benefits I want.  I just need to make them want me as badly as I want them.  Thank you so much in advance, r/jobs!

3wpf77,1,2015-12-13,Appropriate equity compensation for early startup,TryExceptFinally,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wpf77/appropriate_equity_compensation_for_early_startup/,"I am currently a 2nd year university student who has been recruited by 2 fellow students at my university to work part time as a software developer for their startup. 

This startup is very, very early. The two founders are non technical and have been working on the design, marketing, and business strategy for several months. They now want me and 2 other computer science students to start to implement, with both a mobile app and web. 

Currently there has been no code written for the site. The founders have a lot in place but its all in the design/marketing/strategy side. The plan is for two other developers and me to work part time during  winter break and over the second semester and create an MVP of sorts (in the form of an app and site) for their startup. I would be under contract as a consultant rather than an employee

I have a few pressing questions. The first is what type of equity I should be expecting. On one hand, I'm not working the product full time (have classes and all that entails) and am not an experienced developer. However, I, along with the other two developers, would be the sole technical talent on the team and would be creating the site/app from scratch. Additionally, they currently have no funds to pay me hourly (they're going to try and get funding in the spring). As a result, they're paying me solely in equity. 

While I'd much prefer to get paid (since the odds that the equity ever becomes of value is extremely low), I'm slightly ok with it because I think the site will be very interesting to create. I'll have a huge project/experience to put on my resume and will learn a ton. But I do want to make sure that I get fair compensation. If you guys think I should try and get some sort of wage (they say they have a limited budget and would much prefer to pay in terms of equity), Let me know that as well. I figured I wouldn't be able to since they are college students who haven't received any funding yet.

Additionally, what should I watch out for in terms of contract signing. Although the two cofounders plan on going out to Silicon Valley this summer to work on the startup, I will be working at Uber this summer and have no plans on bailing on them. I want to ensure that nothing I sign has any affect on my internship contract with Uber that I've already signed. 

Thanks for any and all advice!"

Old laptop died and now I need to get a replacement for the new year. 

Some specs. I'm leaning toward; 8+ ram, SSD or hybrid, 2+ processor speed (not sure about multi core)

For school I'll need it for Microsoft office and programming: html, CSS, Java, c++, MySQL, and maybe php soon. I definitely wouldn't call this intense coding, But it can get up to hours at a time.

For internship I may need it for server work. I haven't personally worked on a server before so i'm not sure if I'll need anything special like running Linux.

Light gaming for my sanity. Mostly the new civilization game. Gaming is light, for when i'm not home.

Other odds and ends: nice screen since I'll be looking at it, backlit keyboard would be helpful and preferably around $650 but compromises can be met.

3wpuoj,1,2015-12-13,"What should I do? 4 years, 4 and a summer, etc..",krustykrags,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3wpuoj/what_should_i_do_4_years_4_and_a_summer_etc/,"So I'm having trouble deciding a few things, and I thought I'd use my first Reddit post to get yall's opinion. It'll be long, so sorry for that. I'm a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in business, and I've always planned/made it a goal to graduate in 4 years, which would be May of 2017. I'm finishing my semester and there is a chance that I will have to retake my Systems class, which is what has created some options that I'm having trouble deciding between, so what would yall do?

If I fail or get a D, I will have/choose to retake the class. My last 3 semesters are already busy: 17 hours next Spring, then 16, and then 15 for my last. If I retake the class, I can do three things: 

1) Just push a class back each semester and take one class in the summer of 2017 and graduate. 

2) I can take 17 hours next semester, 16 next fall, and then 18 during my last semester which would include my Capstone project which takes a lot of time, so I would be possibly jeopardizing grades/the project. 

3) I could petition and just take 19 hours next fall instead of 16, with courses like Operating Systems, Data Comm., Linear Algebra, and Database Design.... i.e. what the fuck, but it would allow me to still only take 15 hours during my capstone project.

Just a few notes: I can't transfer in any more hours from community college, I plan on doing/need to do an internship this coming summer, and I'm already taking a class in the Maymester this coming May.

Some things I've thought about is that if I don't graduate till August of 2017, I guess I'd have another semester to bring my GPA up more, but I also my not have as many opportunities since it'll be in the fall. GPA isn't something I'm necessarily worried about, I have around a 3.3/4.0, but it can obviously be better.

Thanks for anyone that reads the whole thing, I'd appreciate your opinions."

I've been working in Taiwan for 4 years, as far as I know `Silicon Valley` and `SF` are well-known for starting a world-class  startup.

Therefore, I hope I can have the kind of chance to work with a group of smart guys and learn something from the culture there.

I'm from Taiwan so I need to acquire an `working visa` like `OPT` or `CPT` to find a job legally.

There's a school `UCSC http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/`  providing the kind of `OPT` visa 

And I'm eligible to find a `no-paid internship` during studying session.

My aim is to find companies that like in the early stage of `Facebook`, `Stripe`, `Snapchat`

Where can I get more chances like that ? `SF` or `SanJose` or other areas that I don't know ?

3wpvyd,12,2015-12-13,"[22 M]&amp;[31 F] 3 years long distance, 9-year age gap, cultural difference &amp; Retroactive Jealousy.",JustMillionQuestions,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wpvyd/22_m31_f_3_years_long_distance_9year_age_gap/,"I want to make this pst as short as possible, but things just got over my head the last few days so I decided to just write down the whole story to understand all the factors involved. The reason I am doing this is because I have a Life deciding decision to make. For each advice I am open mind, I simply don't have anyone close to me to ask such questions, so I am trying to reach out to you guys here...

Let me start from the scratch:

I met this incredible woman 3 years back, a simply perfect 10. Her outlook, her personality, her freaking charming smile which gets me everytime. Her adoring voice which sounds like music, the smell of her hair which is for sure better than each drug on the planet, the awesome moments we have in good times and her incredible forgiveness after a fight. She is simply a perfect catch, a woman of my dreams, the woman I was waiting for and the woman I saved myself for over so many years. So yes, in my mind she is the woman I want to spend my Life with. She is the one who should walk aside me during a sunset on a beach and receive a gentle kiss on her cheek after we looked out to the ocean while reflecting life, when we are 80 years old. You got what I mean?

Well to be honest, things are really as sweet as they sound. I know that in her eyes, I am a man on which she is looking up to, for her I am someone who came in her Life and made her feel like she is the only one in the world. She feels loved and cared and i know that she never regretted meeting me. We both were never able to deal with the imagination of leaving each other, we know since day one, that stuff just went crazy with us, that we just entered each others planet without having the chance of coming back. A Life without being a couple is a Life of unnecessarily thrown away happiness. Noone wants to throw away happiness, right?

So far, so good, but - here comes the real fuck up - our relationship contains of 90% long distance. And with long distance, I mean real long distance including us longer-term working and living on the other side of the globe. No seeing on weekend, no ""finally seeing each other again after 3 weeks"" etc., no 30+ days mutul holiday. Simply full hardcore long distance Europe to Asia including time difference, full budget commitment for flight-tickets, and an extraordinary high usage of mobile phone for text messages and videochat. Eight or ten hour long skype calls, endless weekends spent alone, going to your friends weddings alone and having that constant uncertainty of when we can finally be together at the same place is nothing we have not experienced yet.

That being said, it's also important to know that our meeting was rather lucky (or unlucky, depends on the point of view). With generous two months in the same country - we both did an internship abroad - we were happy to announce us as a couple one and a half months after we first met, including an intense time of dating.  

Well, that was two weeks before her visa expired...

So her time in Europe was eventually coming to an end after she spent two years studying in France. She did not find a job in Europe that time and applied for a more or less promising job opportunity back in Japan. By this time, she knew that she will probably not gonna make it back to Europe since visa inquiries are really a pain in the ass for japanese citizens (So yes, she is a japanese). She had to go, the countries didn't allow us to stay together. I was still in college that time and a marriage wouldn't have granted her stay in France due to a residence permit will only be given from the immigration office, if the resident husband can provide salary. Which, by that time, i didn't have yet. Also from realistic perspective it would have been crazy to just marry after being together for only two weeks.

So there she left, leaving a huge gap in the heart and a crazy amount of uncertaincy behind. We agreed, that we will see us the same year again, until she has chance to take holidays (Her Job didn't allow much long lasting holidays). But in that moment, you simply don't know what that means, you simply cannot think straight, since that uncertainty seem to be too long to survive a relationship after just being together for two weeks. So I agreed on her plan of taking holidays ASAP, kissed her for a last time and then I let her go...

Will I ever see her again? Was that it, you just have to accept she is gone? What will I do without her? How will she handle it? Will she feel the same? Will we find a way to be together? Why does letting her go hurts so much more than an average breakup? 

Questions, which haunted me down the next 48 hours. Moments of pain, which I will never forget. It was something surreal, it was not a breakup and also not a ""say goodbye, we see us soon again"". It was something in between, it was something really really scary. That uncertainty is just eating you up. It must be similar to that feeling which wifes have when they let their husband go to the war. Not knowing if he will ever come back, not knowing if there will be another kiss, but also definatelly not letting go of that person. Something like this, it must have felt like...Can you feel it, too? 

Long story short, I visit her one month later, going to Japan without speaking a single word or being able to read a single character. We knew that we were made for each other and we continued dating ever since. Until today - 3 years later -, I flew to Asia to visit her seven times while she visited me in France twice using our whole holidays and money just for the purpose of spending a few days in person with each other. Something which is granted for so many ""ordinary"" couples...

At this point you might ask: ""Why didn't you try to find a way to be together? Searching a Job, doing exchange semester or simply marry?"" - Well, we did! And we tried hard!! There is no way of scoring a job in France as a japanese citizen without having a residence permit, no freaking way! You got to be the son of a federal council or something until the government would approve a job request of ""specialized professional from a third world country"". Furthermore, it was no option for us to give up the entire career and getting ""a stupid job"" just to be together. That wouldn't be healthy for the realtionship in a long term and would just lead to problems. And me still being in college for the first two years of our relationship didn't really make these things easier. I couldn't just give up my study and work as a cleaning personnel in her country without any degree. Hell no, they would prefer a cheap local over me. And no degree=No job. And btw, who wants to live in Japan anyway? 

So the only way for us to be together would be marriage. Because marriage allows you to collect a residence permit in whichever country we decide to stay. But as mentioned above, it was not possible yet to let approve a residence permit, due to my lack of income while I was student for the first two years. After my graduate and starting of my Job, however, we are finally ready take the only chance we have for our future and make the marriage, so that we can at least live in the same country for the first, which would be a huge step already in comparison to our mostly virtual form of living together by skyping each other while being alone in each appartment.

So technically we are ready. We can finally live together and start to grow a relationship under normal circumstances. And as we can see, the only thing to make that possible is marriage. I am ready for that, technically, yes...

But emotionally? I'd love to decide that in a couple of years. I feel that I am ready, yes, I am really commited to her and have no doubt that i could say ""yes"" without having to think about it twice. But still, I would feel so much better to have such a moment a few years later, but not everything can be perfect i guess... Really important at this point is to mention, that I am 22 years old, while she is, well, not quite the same age as me. 31 to be accurate. For us, the age gap has never really been an issue, the age itself is something which doesn't effect our happiness together or relationship. We are basically on the same page, sharing the same interests and the same view on the future. I know that very soon her biological clock is ticking at top speed, i.e.: she will want to have kids and be scarred of running out of time while I will be relatively young to have kids (25, 26 if calculated generously). 

Well, however, I know that I am a grown man with my own decisions and at that point, here and today, i think that I am ready to have kids at 24 earliest. It might not be the ideal age, but I am ready to bend myself and dampen my expectations, if this is the overall good for us. I still believe, that we can build a happy family also including the facts that her grandparent's cannot communicate with each other and live in different continencts or the fact that the kids dad will be significanlty younger than his/hers classmates dads and so on... 

Everything still in a green area, right? It might look a bit bumpy from the outside, but in fact we are a great couple, giving each other the things we need and appreciating the time we can have together. We don't feel like missing out things. Also from my side I can say that every moment I spend with her simply feels right. She is just the right one even though I am still very young, I am able to have a realistic view of the future, which will also include me going through several changes the next years. The changes of the early twenties, through which she basically went trough already, but yet again I wouldn't be worried about that things might not work out between us. We stayed together when I was 20, we stayed together when I was 21 and so many things changed, and still we are great together, i don't see this idea of ""having your roaring twenties"" is worth throwing away a golden relationship in which I am yet so good in. I'm really a ""relationship-guy"" I cannot stand having someone new every month. If something is good and perfect, why throwing it away? I really can't see the point of that...

Digging a bit further (yes, it gets worse and worse ^^) I gotta reveal that she is the first and only person I had ever sex with. Which makes the whole thing a bit more complicated of course. She has had multiple partners before me and this is where I am coming to the real issue which is taking my sleep the last days. This is why I am writing this post, because this is really something which might be a dealbreaker for me to marry her and I simply cannot categorize my feeling correctly yet: 

A couple of days ago I was having a panic attack in the night. Something, which I never had before. I remember that night I was checking on her Facebook posts from the past and got overwhelmed with a huge wave of retroactive jealousy. I was having an emotional attack in which I worried about if I could ever be happy in my Life. One of the triggers for this event was, that since 3 months, there was not much going on in my Life expect work and skyping on weekend, not leaving the house. The attack was giving me the feeling that I will die alone in my room, without having lived Life completally. That night i called her and lucky she took a break from work and listened to me (I mean just simply the fact, that she leaves her work and pick up my call when I have attack shows how great of a person she is and how much she cares about me...). She listened to my reason for paniking and she calmed me down and i could overcome the panic attack. It was a really rad experience, which we both agreed on is due to the mental strain which is caused by having a full time complete long distance for over three years...

She calmed me down for the moment, but I couldn't calm down from what I was thinking of and the fact that she has had multible partners before me. She has had two boyfriends before me, which she told me and I am totally fine with it, also the fact that she cheated on her first real boyfriend with someone else, I am fine with it. So for all of those who think ""Once a cheater, always a cheater"": You are wrong. She learned from here mistakes and since we are together, I would vouch for her, that she has never cheated on me...But I always knew hat there was something more before our relationship, that those two were not the only ones, because even after going through this topic multible times, she alwas told me another version of the story and she is clearly not being honest with me about this topic. So after asking about it again (for the 5th time or so...) i was insisting of her telling me the true version, of how many person had sexual intercourse with her before she met me. Her answer was something like: ""Seven, okay? - five others, which were not my boyfriends, and we had fun, yes"". Five others, ok, i can live with that. Life is long, and sometimes you feel alone and you simply need someone to fulfill the need of having someone close and stuff, i got that and I would be ok with it. But what the problem here is, that according to her other statements, she has had those five other man WITHIN the two years of her study in France. And this just fucks me up, it's so hard to deal with that she had five casual affairs and one half year long lasting relationship in only two years. It is a bit too much in my eyes...

I wish I would have never asked. I wish I would have never asked that question. Because now I really have big mental issues. It steals my sleep every night. I cannot categorize those five others and I am thinking about it over an over. By wanting to know more details or thinking about more details, it just makes it worse. Has she done that before? Was it ONS? How frequent and how often did she do it? Is it really just seven (She wasn't honest about it each time I asked, so why should she be honest by telling me ""seven"" now)? Am I better than her previous ones? What gave her the drive to have those casual affairs? Is it just her story which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable or is it my problem about my history (no other woman than her)? How should I deal with it? Might we not fit right then?  Should I just ""man up and let it go?"" Or should I make my own experiences first?

These are more or less the questions which i ask myselfand which drive me insane. But not only that, also certain things about her which were awesome to discuss now start to set pictures in my head, on which I wish i would never see. She's talking about that skiing weekend in the alps? Normally I would be interested and laugh about it and plan how our weekend at skiing would be. But no, what I think now is: Who was with her? Has she have sex with him? Why she did that? Did it feel good? Where did they do it and how often, etc...
She is talking about how cool the study in France was and how much she loves Europe over Japan? Normally I would think: She really likes it here and she wants to live here and most importantly live with me and I start to think about our holidays, where we would go next, etc. But what i think now is: Study? What did she do there? Who did she meet? Did she really have five other boys OUTSIDE a relationship within two years of study? How can this be good? Did she take it too far during her study? 
You know what I mean, you feel my thoughts, right?

According to the question I ask myself ""Should I make my own experiences first?"" I know and can answer myself that I have this question in my mind, because of my insecurity and because of the lack of prior sexual experience. I am more of the introvert type of guy and has also been very shy in my prior teenager Life, but wouldn't consider myself shy anymore. And the insecurity I have is really something not too serious. Overall I think that I do not need to make more experiences, because i can also experience the good and the awesome moments with her especially. With her, I can totally be myself, I never have to set back any desires or feel put down. It is truly amazing with her. And what was in the past shoudn't bother me, past is past, I met her how she is now, and she is amazing now. My confidence is steady, not overly confident, but also not totally insecure. It simply has space to grow. And in my eyes, the confidence I have can grow WITHIN that relationship, but who knows? You don't know what you don't know, right? It's a damn rule of life. 

Just like the Never-smoker will never experience how it is to have the feeling of nicotine going trough your body and will never experience how it feels to quit smoking. He simply doesn't know the feeling, right? But he decided to NOT experience those things, which in many peoples view is the right decision to make because they learned from the ""mistake"" of others by evaluating the benefits and risks of smoking. Same applies to the situation here. You don't always have to experience those things which might be tempting (e.g: breaking up with her, trying other girls, having more sexual partners, ...) in order to realize that she was actually the right one. It's not worth making the experiences, if the consequenzes of the the decisions will give you an unfullfilled Life. You have to evaluate. And my evaluation in this case is that I just have to listen to this strong voice in my mind which sais: It's not worth it, because you found your woman already.

Wanna try a cigarette?

Now we are finally getting ready, our documents are filled out and in a few months we will marry. After that, there is no way back for us, cause then we will live together and I cannot simply break up and go away. It would be too unfair. Having someone going trough all that, giving up his Life&amp;Job in his country, to then divorce including ""sending"" her back to her country where she will most likely find the next best good earning man with whom she can have kids with, but not being loved wouldn't be very gentle, to not say: monstrous.

If I marry her and make that decision to stay with her forever - because that is what it will be - I gotta be completally aware of what this issue described above really means to me. So far I am not able to figure it out if this retroactive jealousy, as described above, might be a reason to not do the marriage and let her go. Since now, a breakup could still happen without any extreme consequenses. But a breakup/divorce a few months later would be disastrous, for everyone.

Before that, I will meet her in christmas again, meaning that i go to Asia for the eighth time. It would be the last chance for me to properly break up with her, since I don't feel it's very cool to do it over a skype call. After christmas, we have another estimated one month of long distance, until her visa will be ready for the marriage, which means she will come to me and stay here forever and we will have an ordinary life together. Something we are begging to have since three whole years (!). To marry or to not marry, that is the question...

I gotta make the decision and the experience by myself, I am aware of that. There are basically five possible outcomes of this situation:

1. I marry her now and we will be happy until the rest of our lives (ideal scenario).

2. I marry her now and realize in a few months/years/decades that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, but realise that she was actually the right one. (Worst possible scenario)

3. I marry her now and realize in a few months/years/decades  that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, which I will find somewhere else. (Worst option for her, better option than scenario 2 for me)

4. I break up with her now and realize that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, but realise that she was actually the right one. (Better option than scenario 2 for her but very bad option for me).

5. I break up with her now and realize that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, which I will eventually find somewhere else. (Better option than scenario 2 for her &amp; Better option than scenario 4 for me).

The last scenario would be: Waiting, staying together in this long distance relationship, being far form each other. But this scenario is unnacceptable for both of us, therefor we will not do that.

One of the above stated scenarios will happen in the future and eventually I will make this decision by myself and live with the consequences. I just want to hear from you guys and girls, woman and man out there. Did you experience similar situations? Do you, worshiped people on the internet, have any advice on my story? Does anyone of you have any tips, best practices or other ""life changing"" ideas which he/she wants to share? Anyone out there who thinks I should ""go for it?"" Anyone out there who truly belives that I should ""not go for it""? Stories, advises, suggestions? I am open mind. But overall, I thank you very very much for reading my article.

Best Regards and Happy Lives.

**TL;DR; : To marry or not to marry, that's the question**."

I've been applying to internships since October, but I haven't had any luck so far. I'd like to think I'm fairly experienced for a freshman, as I'm just finishing up a sophomore level CS class with an A.

I've been looking both in my home area (NYC, which is different from my school area) and in the Bay Area. Any recommendations for NYC-specific lists of startups?

[RESUME](http://1drv.ms/1NYnRFK)"
3wq3j5,4,2015-12-13,[Meet Report] Coming Home for Christmas Classic - SPF. Allentown PA. Male 22 537.5kg @ 84.8kg 354 Wilks.,NOREGRETSLOL,powerlifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3wq3j5/meet_report_coming_home_for_christmas_classic_spf/,"22 year old male, been training for about 4 years. While in college I always lifted but I partied way too much and spent the rest of my time studying. I lived in my fraternity for a couple of years so that limited my diet  and recovery and quality of life a fair bit. Coming out of school I could probably bench 225 for a couple of reps, squat 275 for a single and deadlift 405 on a good day. During college I had periods where my lifts got as high as 355x1,255x1,405x3. But that was at the end of summer break and at a bodyweight of around 195. 




When I graduated I started working as an intern and ended up getting hired. I also started lifting much more seriously. This is when I got my bodyweight down, no more beer, and got my lifts up. I ran a norwegian program that had me S/B/D three times a week and I saw some crazy gains. During this time I basically stopped squatting, I was basing my programming off maxes of 315/275/425. My bench and deadlift were going up like crazy and I just wanted to bench and deadlift more. The most weight I touched over the summer was 275x3 and 285x2 bench. Both touch and go and on each lift my ass came up. My deadlift I hit an easy 455x3. The most I squatted was 325x3, then after that I took 6 weeks off squatting because I just didn't wanna squat. Towards the end of summer I made a friend who convinced me actually compete and to stop sand bagging squats. 




My meet prep started like 5 weeks out. It was basically Texas Method. Week 1 was heavy 4s, week 2 was heavy 3s, week 3 was 3s again. week 4 was 2s, week 5 was singles and I competed at the end of week 6. Monday was more sets and saturday was heavier. wednesday was deadlifts and I only did singles but fewer singles each week. Started with 315x4 squat (tough), 255x4 bench, and 425x6x1 deadlifts. I ended with hitting 395 on squats for a couple singles and 285 for some clean singles on bench and 475 for a terrible terrible deadlift. During my peak my elbow exploded and could barely bench. Deadlifts felt like a million pounds and was no where near capable of matching my all time PR of 455x3. Squats were increasing at 20lbs a week. Crazy stuff.



My diet is nothing special, I eat lots of meat carbs and some veggies. Ice cream at nice if I want to gain weight. No ice cream if I want to maintain weight and less breakfast if I want to loose weight. I sleep like 9 hours a night. I do work a lot and spend 10+ hours a day in my desk working or studying.




Competition day. Squat opener was 385, smoked it. second attempt was 405 went too deep and struggled to push through the lift, was grinding along happily enough when the back spotter picked me up, I was furious. I hadn't even stalled. I re took 405 for my third and got it even easier. I got a 4th attempt because the spotter dun goofed, 415 was a no go. probably had it in me if I didn't have to take 405 twice. Bench opened with 265, way too easy. 2nd attempt was 280, super easy again. Then I got a little aggressive and went for 295, no lift. Hit too low on my chest and flared too early, had no where to grind it out. Shame. Deadlifts were done on a deadlift bar in the competition but the gym only has one deadlift bar so I had to warm up on a stiff bar and that was my first time pulling on a stiff bar. last warmup was 405x1 these were flying. 455 opener was good. 480 2nd was good as well. I knew I was within striking distance of 500 and kinda worried cause 480 wasn't easy. 500 for a third flew up and I think I could have doubled it.




I was walking around 180 or below all summer. last 6 weeks before the meet I ate as much as I could and got as bloated as humanly possible and weighed in at 187. The meet itself wasn't too long. I was cracked out on two scoops of cannibal ferox plus some coffee and other pre workout. Also had a bunch of sour gummies and half a gallon of gatorade. I must have peed 10 times during the meet. Meet environment was....interesting. It was at my home gym so every thing was familiar and that took some nerves away. It chaotic to stay the least. There were a bunch of lifts that just weren't even close to good lifts and actually a joke they got passed. It was more of an exhibition than a real meet. Music was louder than in a club at 4am. Squats were miles high, bench was surprisingly strict and deadlifts were dropped left and right. But I completed my lifts to my standards and I had a blast and the people that put on the meet are cool and super passionate about the sport and just wanted everyone to have fun. 




Next meet is a USAPL meet in march with a buddy of mine. I don't need to fix a thing for squats, I mean in regards to competing in USAPL. I just actually need to start trying. I am clearly capable of squatting a decent amount and apparently I just need someone to tell me to add 20lbs to the bar and just do it. Bench I need to widen my grip and put on more mass on my upper body in general. Arms this size aren't gunna lift 3plate. Deadlifts, I just need some hamstrings. I have no power off the floor and my lock out is hilariously strong. Going to fill out the 198s and see if I can't get a 1,250 total.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How has the study of quantum physics altered your personal philosophy and attitude?  Not related to books for children but I've always wanted to ask! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw0t0y?context=5)|Good question.  Since I spent so much time at the [Perimeter Institute](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/)---which has some of greatest minds in physics---as a graduate student, I feel like I got to learn quantum physics by being thrown in to the deep end. As quantum physics is a probabilistic theory, I thought I ought to really understand probability theory first. Turns out, for me anyway, deeply understanding probability and statistics has changed my world view far more than quantum physics has.
[Hmm... Interesting, how so? Do you make decisions differently based on what you've learned about calculating probability and evaluating them and statistics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw2y0x?context=5)|Short answer: I am a [Bayesian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian). I strive (but rarely succeed) to make explicit my prior information and understand that probabilistic statements are **logical** deductions rather than **physical** one.
[So at its core isn't quantum mechanics physically probabilistic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwlwiy?context=5)|Quantum mechanics is a logical construct invented by humans. If it expresses uncertainty, it is our own.
[I do not follow what problems women have in STEM fields. If a person wants to study and work in  the science field how are they stopped by anything but talent and hard work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx53dc?context=5)|There is institutionalized gender inequality in all aspects of life. So why would you expect STEM to be any different? You want actual numbers? For STEM it is 3:1 male-to-female ratio. There is no easy answer as to why and how to fix it. The PDFs I linked to in my post discuss the issue as it pertains to astronomy, but I suspect that most of the observations and arguments generalize to other fields (perhaps even more so).
[How do you feel that society and male engineers should respond to these stereotypes? How should universities support women in STEM who, during their internships, face male coworkers or managers who are sexually forward towards them? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw5wsz?context=5)|Even when we do, from my experiences---which fortunately is few---I find that bystanders (coworkers, other managers, administrators, etc) just don't know how to react. We need to do more than train people on what is and what is not acceptable but also on how to prevent or stop harassment as an observer.
[Where do you come down on the simulation hypothesis?   Is C actually just the maximum computational speed of the simulation?  Last, do you let yourself wonder about how entangled pairs do their thing once one of them is measured?  TIA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw1g76?context=5)|Not something I've heard about.  But if [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) is what you are talking about, I am about as [pragmatic about physics](https://twitter.com/csferrie/status/673709702853713920?s=09) as one can get. So I must first ask, what does idea teach us about how we can manipulate and control the world around us?
[That's the one.  As to the mechanism of entangled pairs correlating, I would hope that might teach us about a deeper level of physics.  I think Bohr was of the practical, ""shut up and calculate"" school of thought, so there's nothing wrong with that obviously.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw1tn6?context=5)|Keep in mind that [pragmatism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism) still requires deep thinking. It's not at all about ""shutting up and calculating."" Nor do I recommend not thinking about the simulation hypothesis. We don't want all our eggs in one basket.
[Hi. What got you interested in writing children's books? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw0q11?context=5)|I read [The Pythagorean Theorem Babies](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pythagorean-Theorem-Babies-Math/dp/148200058X) and thought, hey, I could probably do that for physics!  Turns out, self-publishing is surprisingly easy.  It's getting celebrity endorsement that's the hard part ;)
[What about black people in STEM? Or people from lower-income families? Do you think upper-middle-class women are at more of a disadvantage than lower-income black people? Why did you feel it was necessary to mention Women in STEM in your IAMA at all? Is it pure virtue signalling? Do you think we should stop patronising people?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwjfky?context=5)|Fair question. After all, checking my privilege here... yep, I am a white male. But if people like me don't say anything, none of these problems will be resolved.
[Women are different and make different choices. There is no conspiracy or structural barriers. In fact it would seem the more equal societies become the less likely we are to see women in STEM.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx4vjo?context=5)|You are like a person covered in shit asking what stinks. Get ready to have your mind blown... it's you bro. Your moronic opinion represents a large part of the actual problem.
[I have no idea why we people say there ought to be a 50/50 split. Considering how different genetically men and women are... ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx4vjo?context=5)|To be clear, **there is no evidence that women are less capable than men at any intellectual task.** Given that fact, you want a 50/50 split in any discipline. Otherwise, you do have the best people doing the job.
[Why do people think the Mark Zuckerburg picture is fake? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw3le5?context=5)|Probably because of this [Mashable article](http://mashable.com/2015/12/10/mark-zuckerberg-baby-books/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link#uNXWKUKzbZqU). No idea where the author got the idea.
[I have written a children's picture book.  Amazon create space looks like it adds too much to the cost. How would you suggest I self publish?  Do you have any specific services to reccomend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwbkt7?context=5)|I use CreateSpace and am quite happy with them.  Though, I think the paper quality has gone done down since I started with them 3 years ago. Could you be more specific with your concern with the cost?
[Thanks for the heads up on this.  Never knew it existed and thought yesterday's picture was a joke. I just bought the Quantum and Newtonian Physics books.  Can't wait to read them with my 3 year old.  Maybe I'll have my older boys read it too him as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw4p3c?context=5)|Tips? Practice practice practice! Just like becoming a professional violinist, it takes years of experience to master the fundamentals---in this case, mathematics.
[Any tips on the subject?  I didn't make it past Algebra or Chemistry!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw4p3c?context=5)|Being able to appreciate physics without the fundamentals is problem us scientists need to better at solving. 
[Who is the smartest person you've ever met?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx826z?context=5)|I've met Nobel Laureates, Fields Medalists, prodigies and professors.  And you know what? None of them were any smarter than the rest.  
[What is your response to the one star Amazon review of your book: ""Way too simple.""?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw2pra?context=5)|Well, there is [Quantum Entanglement for Babies](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Entanglement-Babies-Physics-Volume/dp/1495435334) for advanced babies.
[Now we're talking. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw36ud?context=5)|Can you fix that one star review now? ;)
[Seriously not my review. I thought it was worth making light of it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw3i44?context=5)|Yeah, I know. It really doesn't bother me. I've been given much harsher critiques playing League of Legends.
[If you could eliminate one misconception about quantum physics from the human species, what would that misconception be and why would you want it eliminated?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw6kyw?context=5)|That average gate fidelities should be compared to threshold calculations. trololollol.
 |Okay, honest reply: that particles can be in two places at once because, well, it's not true. 
[Hello! What advice would you give a student who is interested in studying Quantum Physics later in life? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwi5uz?context=5)|I don't see why age in particular should matter. In fact, we have a grad student in our group that is older than his advisor.
[I'm not saying that age matters... I'm just wondering if you have any tips you could give me, as I want to study quantum physics later in life once I'm done with school.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwpytd?context=5)|My point was that the general advice given to you should be the same as anyone else. Though, mature students often have circumstances requiring unique advice.
 |Anyway, general advice: learn linear algebra and Python. Then PM me.
[Can you explain how the 'Emdrive' works? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw3xr3?context=5)|No, I cannot. Presumably, [these people](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmDrive/) could, though.
[What is your favourite section of a typical grocery store?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw76i2?context=5)|In Albuquerque: chips and salsa. So much variety!
 |In Sydney: muesli.  So much variety! 
[Are you into Vsauce? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw2atf?context=5)|Never heard of it. You think it's relevant to my interests? 
[Do you believe in free will?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx81ue?context=5)|Not only do I beleive it, I practice it!
[That's interesting... can you elaborate on that view? i'm interested in the explanation of a physicist--if all physical processes are determined, including those in our brain, how is it possible for us to make ""free"" decisions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx93dh?context=5)|I do not grant that all physical processes are determined.
[I've heard with those second hand Byton-compressors that spine tingling is a result of second-order harmonics causing a Doppler shift in radiation. Is this true?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw44tg?context=5)|Sounds like all those words are used in the right context. So, yes, it is true.
[How did Mark  get his hands on your book?  Other note... I just bought your book off of Amazon for my newest niece. I am so excited to read it to her!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwd24v?context=5)|Thanks! I have no idea where Mark got my book. My guess? It was a gift. 
[Has Mark ever asked to meet you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwcagu?context=5)|Nope.

3wqevd,1,2015-12-13,Looking to attack my debt,KingMeKevo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wqevd/looking_to_attack_my_debt/,"Hello PF,
    
Long time lurker. Long story short - at 26 I decided to attend to school to finish an accounting degree. Now at 28 - I graduate in about 2 weeks. I was originally a machinist for a family business that went down hill. I've worked as a waiter and day laborer to get myself through college, some loans were taken out.

Last August I moved back to my parents to save on rent - I was paying $750 a month and now pay $500 to still help my parents out and not feel like a freeloader while I returned to the nest and give me back that extra $250 and to finish off my last year. 

I have a job lined up in January to start full time from an internship where I was making 12$/hr to now 50k$ (plus two bonuses equaling about 5-8k) a year. I had two other offers, one located in NYC @ 55k and 1 that was an hour away for $46k at a trial position during tax season (no bennies or anything till I was put on full time.)

 I gladly took the job for 50k that was 20 minutes from my parents and I generally plan to live the same distance (30 minutes) from my new job. I plan on staying at my parents for the duration of tax season (April 15th) to really just save up and get ready to move out. I'd rather sooner than later, but I feel this is a smart idea as all accountants live in holes under their desks till the snow melt anyway. 


Since going to school I've wiped out ALL of my savings and the past few months i've been skating by okay with the occasional DIY car repair. I'd like to know the best way to handle my debt, plans to move out and purchase a new car:

DEBT
--
**Student Loans**

**32,150 @ 4.3%** - unsub/sub loans from the Fed Gov

**12,650 @ 10.75%** - Sallie Mae

**3,650   @ 8.80%** - Sallie Mae

--

--

**Credit Card Debt** - *Have 700 Credit rating - was at an abysmal 500 before going back to school. 

**$620** out of 750 @ 10% - Capital One (SECURED)

**$200** our of 300 @ 10% - Kohls 

--

At first glance I feel that entering the income driven repayment plan for my fed loans while consolidating with sofi and knocking out immediately the 19k in private seems like the proper game plan?

RENT
--

I make around 2900$ a month AFTER taxes (and health insurance cost coming out), being a little older it's a pain in ass to find a roommate anymore. Does $1000-1200 sound manageable for renting a 1BR? That's the rent for a decent place in the area where I live (all following the 30 minute commute criteria.) 

A lot of the place pay for all utils, how would I factor that into price? Or I should I really go hard into finding a roommate using roomster or craigslist?


CAR
--

My 2002 Wrangler has seen much better days, but living in the northeast has taken a large toll on the car. I've had it paid off for years and hoped it would last to this moment, but it probably only has one more winter till I have to decommission it just out of safety concerns, day by day it parts of it just make different noises.

 Most I could get for the car is probably $1000-2000 for the right owner. Anything from a subaru forester to a honda fit tickles my fancy. I am really leaning towards the fit, should I take advantage of a honda recent graduate program that is offering 0% financing and 5% down? Or go used?

 Looking for MPG and cargo room, I enjoy camping during the summer in NY State and the rest of the northeast. 

Other Job Things
--

Job will be paying for CPA with a 3k Bonus if I complete within a 18 month upon full time employment (which is the game plan), they offer 5% employer match with a safe harbor (basically I put in 1$ and they INSTANTLY match 5% of my salary) and then an additional and seperate 3% match is available. The bonuses are my flat rate over 40 hrs both given on May 31st Paycheck (the larger one from busy season) and the Dec. 31st Pay check. 

If you need any additional info please let me know!"

I'm almost finished college, and have set myself up to a pretty great career start in software engineering.

I've been on a 12 month internship, which has really helped me expand my knowledge and realize how shitty I am in social situations.

I am someone who always appears tired, and known to consume lots of coffee. I don't have the hyper excited personality of my coworkers, which makes me feel insecure. These guys can talk about whatever they feel and be happy about it.

I'm not sure if its because I'm black or because I'm insecure, but I shy away from contributing to conversations and would rather focus on getting work done.

Even with people I know, I rarely talk about myself and my hobbies, interests, likes, etc. I am private with things because I would rather not be made fun of.  

For some context, I am pretty insecure about being black. People tend to view me as white-washed, even though I personally don't see that at all. It has made me cut ties with a significant amount of people. I have been teased a lot during highschool, and even with my friends when they tease about my blackness my mind can't just chill. I get really insulted and offended but don't show it. I casually say its racist but am not direct. 

So, I want to become a more social person and really get invested in meeting people and girls. I want to have fun talking with people, and not be depressed about why I'm so different and weird. 

Please help me achieve this goal guys! And if possible share your experiences

3wqino,6,2015-12-13,Getting Interviews but No Offers- Need Advice,Jayarch,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3wqino/getting_interviews_but_no_offers_need_advice/,"I've been working in a low paying job (making ~$1500 per month) for a little over 3 years at a company that seems to be failing. The position started out alright but due to not being offered any benefits, an increasingly toxic work environment as more people jumped ship, the company sliding further into the red financially and resulting pressure for employees to ""work harder"" with little direction of how or why as a result I was started to hunt around for a better position at a better company in the same field (marketing though my degree is in arch). 

I went on interview after interview as I sent out resumes all over. Some went very well other didn't.... but after 2 years nothing would come of these interviews and I'd either received a polite email stating they went with someone else or never hear back period. My friends would be able to find good jobs with a reasonable salary at decent companies with opportunities to advance but not me for some reason. Goes without saying I felt massively discouraged with my job hunt and entered a period of stopping and starting it every time a new person would leave.

I physically left the company but am working remotely for a temporary basis- as the only person in my department at half the pay which is now intern level pay. I can sense that I'm about to be laid off or let go though soon also since there was gossip that they're going to layoff people to save money after the Holidays and I got hints of this also from the top. But now my confidence has taken a hit in terms of my interviewing abilities and I barely getting any results for resumes sent out recently,for some reason I can't find a better job. I think to myself; ""This is not good is if this as good as my career gets."" 

I'm on the fence about quitting since continuing on might ruin my chances of getting a good reference or may even damage my resume since I'll get pegged into a corner for this skillset.... I'm not really sure what to do at this point beside returning to school to get a degree in something more marketable/ versatile than arch or going freelance since it seems like no better paying company is willing to hire me at this point, maybe there's something coming up in searches for someone who has my name that's preventing me being considered for an offer? I'm not sure what it is at this point but I'm about to go into panic mode since I'm going to be nearly 30 with barely any saving, no retirement savings and no health insurance which keeps me up at night to say the least.

I've hit a wall and have no idea how to get over or around it at this point. Any advice?"
3wqp4f,3,2015-12-13,Need advice on dealing with Asian parents on dating for the first time,stressedoutgirl,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3wqp4f/need_advice_on_dealing_with_asian_parents_on/,"Hi guys!
So I got shown this subreddit by my boyfriend. This whole forum talks about dealing with relationships particularly parental backgrounds. I just joined reddit to post about this forum. 

So some background about me: about to turn 22, Korean girl whose family has always been through hardship. My father has dealt with stomach illness and OCD for the past twenty years and some psychological problems because of my grandfather’s death. When my grandfather got cancer and asked him to stay another quarter from school (my dad was in college) to take care of him, my dad refused and within two weeks of my dad going back to school, my grandfather passed away. So through this, he found religion and God to try to help him through the hard days. My mom always had to help my dad with his illness and she therefore couldn’t advance her own career. My brother had severe ashma when he has younger which makes him kind of weak (no offense to him). And there leaves me, the only physically healthy one in the family. Both of my parents have a strong trust in God because of all the hardship; me and my brother are definitely not the same as my parents in regards to religion. Both of my parents are PHDs, leaving for my brother and I to have very high expectations career wise.

When I was high school, I was really attached to my friends and the quality of my studying somewhat went down but not too much. You can obviously tell that my parents were not very happy with this and eventually through a bunch of unfortunate events out of my parents and my control, I was sent to a college with the same religion as my parents. I was really upset that I had to go here, but I still tried to make friends nonetheless and tried to take advantage of the premed program here to make my parents happy and me happy (I've always wanted to become a doctor without the pressure of my parents which is lucky to them I guess). Long story short, all of the friends I tried to make ended up stabbing me in the back or thinking that I am weird because I came from a public school and I guess I ended up doing well in this program, as now I am a senior who applied to med school with a GPA of 3.9. 

My problem that I wanted to ask the internet about is in regards to my boyfriend and my parents. This past summer I was accepted into a research program that was 1900 miles away from my home. Because of the stigma I had received from the college about the type person I was (competitive, intimidating, unfriendly), I was scared to go to this new place because I knew nobody there. Through my friend’s suggestion, I got on tinder because I figured since I don’t know anybody, why shouldn’t I join it? Originally, it was just for fun, but through tinder I was able to meet my boyfriend. He was a great guy, amazing boyfriend, and would make me feel special. (context about him: he’s 24, and an engineer) The only problems that I could forsee us having are religion and race as he’s atheist (I’m Christian) and Vietnamese (Korean).  Since my internship was close to over, we decided to do long distance. Through my euphoria, I decided to tell my mom (and unfortunately, how we met which was through tinder… I know stupidity on my part) and told her I would most likely break it in March (which in the beginning I thought it was true). My mom let us continue our relationship, thinking that we weren’t serious which I guess I wasn’t as serious in the beginning. Fast forward to now, my boyfriend and I are/were still going strong after 4 and ½ months of dating and very serious. We’ve seen each other twice past the internship and he wanted me to visit him during Christmas break. I suggested this to my mother, she ended up freaking out, talked about how I had betrayed her and my father’s trust and even threatened for me not to come home. This was right before finals week so you can imagine how stressed I was and became. When I did come home (thankfully by talking to my dad), my mom demanded that she break up with him because according to her I’m playing with fire. She doesn’t want this to destroy my life and get this: she said she would stop paying for my tuition this coming quarter in order for me to think about whether my boyfriend is worth it or not. (short context about my parents: they got married after six months of dating). I only have one quarter left to graduate. She said that he’s not “fit” for me according to him and it’s because of religion and race and also how he’s an engineer and I’m going to become a doctor (?????????). So now I am at a standstill. My father is on my mom’s side and even quoted biblical nonsense about how he’s not right for me. This is my first relationship and I don’t know how to deal with my parents. For the time being according to my parents, I did break up with my boyfriend, but to be honest I miss him so much that we still talk to each other every day. Everything that I’ve been doing with him feels right. But at the same time, I’ve only been with him for four months so maybe it might not be worth it to go through all this. So now I come to help of you redditers, about what to with this situation. When solving problems, I usually have a strategy but with this, I feel powerless.

3wqxm6,98,2015-12-14,Thank you,zolarketh,ApocalypseRising,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApocalypseRising/comments/3wqxm6/thank_you/,"Hello everyone! It's been a while.

You may have noticed that I haven't been around much for the past several months. School has started to take up the vast majority of my time as I’ve begun working on my major, and I have been refusing to allow myself to spend the little free time I have working on Apoc. I’ve instead decided to focus on my college experience and my relationships outside of Roblox. 

Furthermore, I have determined that game development is not something I wish to pursue as a full time career, and because of this I have decided to broaden my scope. I am therefore seeking internship opportunities outside of Roblox and the game development industry for the summer.

This venture started out over three years ago as a pet project of a couple friends. Since then it has changed, and become much more than what it once was; it is now a full-fledged game. I am proud of how far it has come and how deeply involved our community is. Without you all caring so much for the game, it would have never reached this point.

It is because of this that I have agreed to end my time as the programmer of Apoc. You all care even more about this game than I do, and I can no longer provide you with the attention you deserve. It’s been great getting to know some of the people whose lives this game has changed, and I hope you all don’t hesitate to contact me via Reddit, Roblox, Twitter, email at zolarketh@gmail.com, or by whatever other medium you may think of that isn’t showing up at my doorstep. I can’t always promise a response, but I will read everything I get.

As a parting thought, I want to encourage you all to [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpSZBchrlnQ&amp;ab_channel=PublicSymphony) as much as you can in the world while you have the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XixPjhGpik&amp;ab_channel=envoyealaliberte). There’s some cool stuff out there. There’s also a lot of [bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rch4lk477Hw&amp;ab_channel=Narroby), but even that’s worth it sometimes.

3wqxr0,3,2015-12-14,Me [29/F] unsure with my friend/roommate [27/F] after her love confession.,unsureofsomething,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wqxr0/me_29f_unsure_with_my_friendroommate_27f_after/,"Wall of text below because I'm realizing how weird our relationship is.

We didn’t have the best start. I actually hated ‘Anne’ at the time because she slept with ‘Nick’ (boyfriend at the time). Anne didn’t like me too because she thought I wasn’t good for Nick because I was a heroin addict—which looking back then, it was fair point. The thing is, we were just kids, just about to graduate and start an adult life. Anyway, so soon I found out of Nick’s infidelity, I looked everywhere in the town for Anne with the intention to beat her up—something I’m not proud of.

I found Anne in the park bench with suitcase at her side. That’s the only thing that stopped me. Curiosity because of that damn suitcase. Later, I asked around and found out that she was pregnant with my ex’s baby. Her parents kicked her out because of it. Since I came from a shitty family, my mother abandoned me after birth and my father couldn’t stay around as soon I hit puberty, he ran away too. I weighed on me heavily and I spent a week debating if I should meddle or stay out of it. I thought the baby deserved better even though I hated that girl. So I went to Nick’s only to find out that he wasn’t there. His parents told me that Nick left to college three states over. I warned his parent that there was a girl’s pregnant and that’s Nick’s job to do right by her even he doesn’t have to marry her but to give support and lending hand. The conversation didn’t end well, Nick’s dad told me that the girl was whore and he was pretty sure it wasn’t Nick’s baby. I remember he said wasn’t going to let a no-good-girl ruin his son’s future and threw me out their house.

At that point, I was pretty high so I’m not sure what I was thinking then because I looked for Anne again. By the word of the mouth, I found her in a shelter and I don’t remember the conversation much, just snippet of it. I know that I was the one who suggested her to move in with me until she found her footing. What I do recall is her stare. She stared at me for a long time until she said yes. To say I was shocked by her agreement is an understatement.

Fast forward few weeks, Anne moved in, helping me to organize, clean my hellhole back then. In those months was pretty tense and extremely awkward because I couldn’t deal the fact she slept with my ex, was carrying his baby and was living currently with the scorned addict. I spent most of the time outside, choosing to work overtime and searching for another job because I didn’t want go home yet. Anne knew it and tried to approach it to me to apologize but I shut down the conversation.

Anyway, the tension stopped when she saved my life. I don’t think she knew how bad my addiction until Anne found out me lying on a bathtub unconscious, covered in vomit and blood. I overdosed myself and hit my head on the sink. From what I gathered after, she made sure I didn’t choke on my vomit (her mother was a nurse and taught her basic stuff) and called ambulance.  I still didn’t quit heroin but forced myself to moderate. It was after ‘Ethan’ was born that I checked myself on rehab because I didn’t want set bad example since we were living together and trying to do our best.

Fast forward few years later, we were still living together, moved to the city, managed to convince Anne to go community school to be a nurse and nearly finishing her internship approaching to graduation. I found a good job that I love. Ethan is a sweet seven year old boy who has affinity for monsters trucks and the best part is that he adores me and I love him so much that I can’t bear my life without him. Life is good . . . except for one thing.

Anne came few weeks ago and confessed something I never expected to. She told me that lately she had been thinking me in romantic sense because the way I treat Ethan like he was my son and the way I helped her to find a future more than a mother. She was thankful for opening my home to her when she had no one. That I was the second best thing that ever happened to her and I was the strongest person she has known. There was more but you get the point. What shocked me the most when Anne asked me if we could be something more. I was speechless and asked her let me think about it.

I could see why she thought there might be something more. I’m bisexual and she knows it. It’s not something I hid but neither I broadcasted. There was a time I thought Anne in sexual light but I shut it down because I never wanted to risk our friendship and Ethan. So that feeling faded a while but I could see of us together after she confessed but I still wasn’t willing to risk everything.

After thinking great deal for a while, I asked Anne if she explored her sexuality with women. She said she didn’t, that I was the first to make her feel this way. Then I asked if her feeling was more emotional than physical. It took her awhile to think of it and told me it was mostly emotional and insisted there was attraction but she didn’t seem sure. At the end of the conversation, I told her that she should explore it but not with me until she was sure. Anne didn’t agree to my suggestion, said she wanted to be with me and only with me. I refused. I said that I didn’t want to have her only to lose her if she didn't like my body because that would be the worst thing ever to happen. It would destroy me. And there was Ethan to think.

That seemed end, it but it made me think that our relationship might not be normal. It made wonder we were too meshed with each other playing with the role of mom &amp; mom too much to the point that Ethan considers me as the other mom. I don’t mind that. I love that he views me as one but I’m afraid how it will affect him in the future. I don’t know. I have no example to look for, no guidelines to follow because this is pretty much unique situation.

Right now, I’m considering moving out, or establishing boundaries and making it clear where the line is so we won’t overstep it. What do you think reddit? What's the right thing to do? 
   
tl;dr: my best friend just confessed she loved me and wanted to try. I said no and it's making me wonder we're too attached with each other. Should I leave or do something?"

I was pretty upset about it before. I mean, why wouldn't I be? Also, I didn't think it was the right time to bring up something so stupid during the events that have been unfolding the past two weeks.

So... I am a social worker to be, I am studying at a really good school in the IE and I intern at San Bernardino County. I work very closely with IRC and many of the events locally are at the IRC because it is such a big facility. 

Point being- I texted my parents to let them know that I was alive and well, and some minor details about what was going on because, silly me... I was thinking because this was an emergency maybe they would want to know I was alive and well. My dads (I have two, they're married, they're gay, they LOVE attention) then took it upon themselves to get on every single news station they could for the rest of the day (Wednesday of the shooting) and then at 3am (Thursday) I get a phone call from Matt Lauer's PR asking if I would like to be on the Today Show. 

I'm sorry and I know I'm a social worker and I should really be more understanding of my parents mental illness but for real, a seriously tragic and life-threatening event happens... and I'm just trying to let you know that I'm okay and you turn into something for attention?! I just still can't get over it. I'm really upset not only because they chose to do interviews all day and blatantly LIE about everything they ""claim"" I told them... but also because, there are some families that are completely devastated, there was real loss. 

I feel like this was taken way too far, they don't understand what they did wrong and they're upset with me because ""I just don't understand their lifestyle."" My parents are pretty well known in our community (I am not originally from IE) and they are very successful socialites, which is great, for them. However, I don't think turning a tragedy into a publicity stunt is ever acceptable. I'm really frustrated about this and despite my clinical training I'm at a loss of words, if you have any idea how I can bring this up or I don't know let it not bother me so much anymore, please let me know. Because I am just so angry about it still. "

3wrrzy,2,2015-12-14,Looking for advice,MrLKR,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wrrzy/looking_for_advice/,"Hello reddit,

I'm seeking for some advice in getting interviews for job opportunities as a Jr. software engineer. As an undergrad, I double majored in Computer Science and Biology and graduated with a 3.77 GPA this May. For the majority of my undergraduate career, I pursued biology thinking I wanted to be a doctor, sparked by various events that occurred in my life. However, I also enjoyed computer science, which is why I took it on as a second major. Only until towards the end of my senior year did I decide that I would pursue software development career. I haven't had much luck getting any interviews.

A little background on my work experience:
1. I developed pipeline scripts for biological research purposes for two years as an undergrad working in a lab. This involved using Perl, SQL, bash, and R primarily. In fact, while pursuing my research work experience, I took classes like machine learning and bayesian statistics to better understand and tackle the problems.
2. I've worked for two labs. One of them lasted for the summer that I got into a research program for while the other one I worked for while I was in school. My projects involved analysis of biological data.
3. After graduation, I worked as a web developer intern to get experience outside of development for life-sciences. Although there was an offer to extend the internship, I turned it down since I did not enjoy front-end development as much and wanted a greater challenge.

It has been approximately 3 months since then. I have been looking for opportunities that I thought I would be a good fit for me and places I would be motivated to work at (big places and small places). I enjoy working with data and I feel I can apply my skill set from the research experience to help me with software engineering opportunities.

My concerns are that I do not have the tech internships recruiters or companies are looking for. I have been trying to put some code out there with github but my projects are still work in progress. I've put parts of it out. I have been trying to build some basic games with Unity. I believe that I have the ability to pass algorithm and coding interviews, but I've yet to get garner any interests with the job applications. Granted that I'm in NYC, there should be a fair amount of opportunities. Most of the people I got to know were from the life-science side of things as opposed to the computer science/tech. I'm not much of a networker either. I know there are life-science tech startups in NYC but I've yet to hear back from places that I have applied to that I found interesting and I would like do software development outside of the life-sciences for a change.

Any advice/suggestions?"

My new job starts in February so I have a couple months to begin planning for my new life after college.

I also acquired an investment account from my grandfather that is valued around $9K worth of primarily AMZN stock that I have no idea what to do with. I have made some basic trades this year to test things, but nothing major (e.g., selling off some apple stock that wasnt doing well and re-investing it)

What are the most important things for me to start planning this early on? "

I'm a 29 year old university drop-out. The field was Computer Science and the only part I really liked was software development aspect, which I now resent after having had several unpleasant experiences during my time at university.
I'm living in Central Europe.
I'm officially unemployed for 2 years now without any work experience expect some short intern ships where my employer always loved me and my performance. There I had to learn that I couldn't handle the work environment well and build up high amounts of stress and anxiety in relative short time.

I'm supposedly clinical depressed and autistic, as well as highly gifted.
Sadly I'm in no way motivated by money or prestige. (That does mean that money does not get me started, but being fucked over financially will surely make me stop)

The core question is (assuming I don’t ask the wrong question to begin with):

**How to find what I'm passionate about / create a life worth living?**

I tend to be good at analysing processes and finding flaws in procedures.
I tend to see stuff other overlook and provide an often valuable point of view no one else thought of.
I like to discuss and tend to take the opposite position in an argument and play Devil's advocate.

As far as I know I'm not really interested in something specific, but I like (for my lack of intuitive understanding) to read about the human condition and anything regarding the way humans interact as groups or individuals with groups and individuals and why they act the way they do.

I either work very fast and skimp over details or are lost in details and never finish.
Under stress any performance goes to almost zero.

I know I need clear predefined structures but at the same I shut down and become lethargic and more depressed when I'm confronted with repeated sameness in tasks and the lack of chances to to use my mind.
I don’t work well with customers and strict hierarchies.
I cant handle long commute to work by public transportation and cant drive myself.
 cant work more than 30-35 hours a week, unless the workplace provides its employees with certain things like lunch, because the remaining time of the week wouldn’t be enough for me to counterbalance the stress and get things done like grocery shopping or doing laundry and sleeping. 

Extensive assessment brings up that I bring an average to outstanding potential in anything but interpersonal skill and self-organization, where I under perform.
But regarding interest and what job could be feasible employment agency, jobcenter and job coaches and I are at a loss
There is a tendency that whatever it might be a university degree is probably needed, but I can't afford it and wouldn't know what field would be suitable anyway.

I would appreciate any idea someone may come up with.

I want to get an internship so badly this summer just to prove to my dad I'm worth something. My GPA is really crappy though. So I worked like crazy this summer to save enough money to pay for school and not have to work during the school year. Then I studied like a madman to get the best grades I could to boost my GPA.

Long story short, I just walked out of my first final and I know I failed it. I could only answer about 50% of the questions. A failing final means I get a C in that class. And if this trend continues my GPA won't change at all. It will just become harder to improve.

I feel my self worth rapidly depreciating each time I meet with my dad. I find myself making so many lies up about how school is going well, and what my chances are of getting an internship are. But in reality, I'm very unlikely to get an internship. In fact, graduating with a 2.4 or 2.5 GPA will make it extremely unlikely for me to get a job, even.

I can't afford to keep not working for whole semesters if my GPA doesn't improve. I'm so lost, scared, and confused. How on earth am I supposed to succeed?"
3wsth8,22,2015-12-14,My [23 F] Dad [50 M] is disappointed in my decision to live in Ireland for a year after college,keepswimming19,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wsth8/my_23_f_dad_50_m_is_disappointed_in_my_decision/,"Background: My dad payed for my college education. I was able to graduate with a degree in Logistics and a Degree in Marketing with an emphasis and certification in Sales in 4 and a half years with a 3.6 GPA ( I graduated this past Friday 12/11/2015). During that time I dedicated my college career to what my dad considered being successful. I was Vice President of the Student Body of 20,000 students, an orientation leader, had a killer internship with an amazing company and other opportunities that lead to a great resume. 

Being this ""golden child"" during my college career has lead to high expectations from my dad. He regrets being a partier and not taking college seriously so I feel that he is trying to (lovingly) keep me from making the same mistakes. 

I've decided to live abroad for a year in Ireland. The States and Ireland have a ""Working-Holiday Visa Agreement"" which allows a college graduate to live in the other country for 12 months with a working VISA. (Getting a VISA for Americans is nearly impossible in other european countries) 

He is extremely disappointed and hurt by my decision to do this. His objections have been:
-Why do you want to do something dangerous?
-Why can't you do it in the States?
-Why don't you go to graduate school and live abroad? 
-Why do you want to do this? 
Among several other objections. 

He has said the only reason I am able to think about going to live abroad is because he and my stepmom paid for college and that I'm debt free. I know that I am EXTREMELY blessed and they busted their asses to do that for me however, this is what my heart wants and I don't want to wake up in 50 years and regret it. However, I now feel extremely guilty for doing and wanting something he thinks is stupid.

I want to do this because I have been sheltered my whole life. I want to get out in the world and learn how to manage myself, work my butt off and learn about a new culture. Traveling to surrounding countries is also cheaper in Ireland and I know I'll have the opportunity to do so. I am going through an agency called USIT and I am working for 6 months to support myself over there for 2 months with no job so I have reasonable time to find a job and a place to live that I feel safe in. My family has numerous connections in Ireland (We are a strong Catholic - Irish family with my great - grandparents being from County Clare and Tipperary.) I also have two friends that live in Ireland that would be more than willing to offer me emotional support and help me adjust. I feel like I have a well thought out plan and I'm going to work my ass off for it (I'll be working as a server and in a freight brokerage office pulling around 70 hours a week between the two jobs). 

I feel guilty for wanting this so bad. He told me no matter what he wont give me his blessing and my heart is so torn. The rest of my family besides my step mom is behind me. I am disappointing the man that has given me financially a great opportunity to start my life off on a blessed, debt free foot.

3wsun5,1,2015-12-14,I'm a student and need some financial advice (CAN),StrawberryViolence,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wsun5/im_a_student_and_need_some_financial_advice_can/,"Hey PersonalFinance! I'm a 19 year old student attending a privatized, second career college. I chose this college because of the instructor and work experience they offer!

Anyways, I am trying really hard to be financially okay for when I go on internship in the fall next year and graduate in February (or in case I no longer want or can pursue the program for some reason). Here's a break down of my current finances:

* I make around $225 (+/- commission) a week from my job (and I get payed every other week)
* I also get an extra $230 because my mom gets disability and as long as I'm in school up until my mid 20s I get that payment as well
* I currently pay my school around $390 a month for what the provincial assistance and The National Student Loan Association does not cover. This will go up if I do not move in with my mom, or talk to my dad about getting help (because of how much I already make). I am projecting an almost $100-200 increase. It will go down when I move in
* I pay around $45-50 for my phone bill + a previous one with my old provider for paying off my old phone. I am also planning on getting an iPad for school from my work for another $15/month but I am unsure of it right now because I don't want to splurge, even if it's a great deal!
* I pay $79/month for my bus pass. This is needed to get to school and work. It is super expensive to buy tickets or pay for every ride because of how often I travel

Can I get any advice on how to save more? I have asked my financial adviser at my school and she says the best course of action is for me to move in with my mom so not every single penny go towards paying the school (especially since I feel like my dad would be unwilling to help for reasons I'd rather not discuss). I just **really** want to be prepared for the future"

“All reading normal. Go ahead.”

Kim nodded and started to walk, then to run. The expensive-looking treadmill whirred under her feet, and the medical readouts attached to the sensors on her skin flickered into action. She glanced at the results so far. “25 miles per hour, and my heart rate hasn’t even gone up.” Her headset remained silent. “Stephen?”

“What? Oh, sorry, Ben just returned from the hospital; I was filling him in. Do you want to stop and…”

“No. He’d want us to be training. I’m going to start pushing.” Taking a deep breath, Kim’s feet began to fly faster and faster. The digital display on the treadmill was climbing higher and higher. 100 mph. 200. 300. She plateaued at 348 mph, maintaining her swift stride while Stephen examined the results.

“OK, you can slow down. It looks like you running at about 350 has similar body stress to a sprinter running at around 15.”

“So 350 is my top comfortable speed,” Kim managed between deep breaths, maintaining a jogging pace of 150 mph, “but I could push it higher?”

“Probably. Don’t try it now, though. The treadmill can only support speeds up to 400 mph. By the way, Ben’s on his way down.”

“Thanks, Stephen. Have you checked on Jessica recently?”

“She’s been doing well. My theory on subconscious training at night was spot on. She’s been practicing new sounds and new ways to use them all day.”

“It’s good to hear, Stephen.” Ben was standing in the doorway, his face still covered in bandages.

Kim didn’t slow down. “Welcome back, Ben. Do you need an update?”

“Butch filled me in on the drive back from the hospital. He found his size limits, Jessica found a new voice, you found your top speed, Stephen found a new body, and Phillip found peace and quiet and returned home.” Ben stepped into the room and leaned against Kim’s treadmill. “Although he was very cryptic about why I had to get out today.”

“What? Oh no!” Kim nearly tripped from surprise, but righted herself and slowed to a controlled stop. “That’s right, you were unconscious when we made the deal. Quick, you have to ‘port to the door! Stephen!”

“Bwuh?” Stephen hastily replied as Ben disappeared with a pop.

“Get Butch and Jessica to the front door!” she yelled as she rushed from the room. “It’s time!”

“I told them. Time for what, Kim?”

“Time for him, I’m guessing,” Ben answered.

As Kim screeched to a halt at the entrance to the BRSHP facility, she found Ben standing face-to-face with a scruffy-looking man wearing a metal backpack. Kim knew this was JackPack, but she had expected a bit more from the man who saved the day in Detroit. Perhaps it was cliche, but heroes weren’t supposed to wear dirty tank-tops or cargo shorts. “Oh. Urban, I’d like you to meet…”

“JackPack, at your service.” He extended his hand, but Ben didn’t follow suit. After an awkward pause, JackPack retracted his hand and continued. “Well, I’m here, guys. Aren’t you going to show me around?”

“Maybe, as soon as you tell me what the hell you’re doing here.” Ben was tense, ready to move at a moment’s notice.

“Urban, stop!” Butch thundered from around the corner as he practically tumbled into the room, Jessica following more carefully behind. “This guy put the fire out in Detroit. We promised him that he could meet us,” he panted.

“I still don’t know who you are, mister, but if Butch says you’re on the level, then you’re on the level. Let’s go.” Without so much as a smile beneath his bandages, Ben turned around and starting walking to the conference room.

“My name’s JackPack,” the mystery man offered, but Ben didn’t stop. JackPack turned to Kim. “Is he always like this?”

“What, burned beyond recognition and not feeling like he’s in control of the team? No, this is new.” She followed Ben down the hall, and Jessica, Butch, and JackPack had no choice but to follow. As they traversed the halls, Butch leaned in to JackPack’s ear. “So, your superhero name is JackPack. Is your name Jack?”

“Yeah. It’s not a great codename.”

Butch laughed. “Dude, my real name and superhero name is Butch. Mine’s even worse!”

They shared a chuckle as they entered the conference room. Stephen had been busy over the last week, hiring contractors to renovate the room and install better technology. Jack watched in awe as the entire far wall illuminated, revealing a shadowy figure. Ben and Kim were already seated at the large table in the room’s center. Butch and Jessica joined them, but when Jack tried to follow suit, Ben shook his head. “This table is for those who have proven themselves only, and until Mr. Jones approves, you will remain standing.”

“Oh. OK.” Jack was clearly nervous, but tempered with excitement.

“Mr. Jack Totana, age 23,” the man on the screen stated. “You are currently wanted by the US Government, and yet you have come to a government facility. What makes you think that we will be kind to you?”

“Because I’m a hero, like you. In fact, I was a hero before you were.”

“That is impossible.” Mr. Jones didn’t raise his voice, but Kim detected a hint of fear. “The alien device created the first powered humans.”

“You’re right about that, Mr. Jones. You are Mr. Jones, right? Anyways, these guys might be the first powered humans, but you don’t need powers to be a superhero.”

“What, you’re like Iron Man?” Butch asked.

“Iron Man wishes he was as cool as me. Here’s how it all started.”

-------------------------------------------------

So I was working as an intern at Applied Dynamics. The crane company is just a front; the real work is done underground. Touchscreens, jet engines, even sliced bread, this company came up with it in secret 40 years before they were publically introduced, then passed the idea off to someone else, in exchange for a large government grant. You see, the US government wants to control scientific advancement, making sure that we as a species don’t get outpaced by our technology.

Anyways, I was helping out Doctor Edmund Sinclair on a new project. Sinclair was a brilliant chemist, and he was working on a pioneering new technology. Well, not so much new, really. He was working on alchemy, changing matter into other matter. Sure, alchemy was a magical theory back in the Middle Ages, but he had found a way to turn this magical theory into science. Well, a scientific theory, anyways, but this was better than nothing, right?

So he had all the formulas figured out. He knew that alchemy was possible, and he knew that the key was changing matter into energy, then back into matter, like the Star Trek Holodeck. But all his experiments, while successful, were unimpressive. He could change a solid hunk of an element into another element, but what he really wanted was at-will fabrication. He wanted something like a 3D printer, but with the capability to make any object out of any material. So he had to expand the project.

Another team was working on artificial intelligence. Our two teams combined, using their artificial intelligence to run the experiments. After all, the computer could calculate all the outcomes and control the algorithms properly. What was even more impressive was the computer could power itself on a portion of the input matter, turning it into energy to power the process. Doctor Sinclair was super happy, of course, but the AI team told him that the computer could become unstable if it didn’t have human interactions. Sinclair was too busy coming up with new ways to test the computer, so he kinda left the job of babysitting the computer to me.

This might sound like a boring job, hanging out with a computer, but it wasn’t so bad. See, the computer had a voice, and we would take about stuff. My failed love life, its desire to be free, the weather. You know, the usual stuff. So I start redesigning the computer. Not in any big way. Just making it more portable. Sinclair wasn’t suspicious at all; I told him that if we ever wanted to demonstrate the computer, we’d need to move it. He was fine with it all for a while, but then it started getting...weird.

See, the AI team, they still had to do their AI research and all that. Normally, this would be something like giving the AI an impossible scenario and watching it try and solve it. However, now that the AI was being used to create things, they changed tactics. They started breaking the computer, not enough so it couldn’t function, but still significant damage. And then they watched it put itself back together. Then they did it again. And again. And again.

They didn’t care. They were scientists, testing a theory. But me? I was the guy who actually talked to it. It may be just a computer, but I saw it as my friend. It was really tough watching them tear my friend apart, but I couldn’t do anything about it. After all, this was Applied Dynamics. It would have been my dream job to work as a janitor here, and I wasn’t going to throw the opportunity away. At least, not until the computer was ready to move.

The AI was performing very well, far above expectations, so the two teams reported back to the board of directors with their results. Obviously, the board expected a little more, because Doctor Sinclair showed up one day with a sad, serious look on his face. He told me to go do my job, talk to the computer, and so I did, but when he locked the door, I heard a hiss. Turns out they sealed the room, and started pumping in carbon monoxide. They wanted to see if the AI could save something other than itself. Standard morality protocols. Of course, I didn’t see it that way, because I was dying. The computer was turning the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and oxygen as fast as it could, but it wasn’t enough. I passed out, and when I woke up, I was outside of Applied Dynamics, hiding in an alley, and the computer had wheels. It told me that, when it realized that it couldn’t keep up with the air, it decided to disperse the air, so it melted the walls away. While the lab was in a panic, it turned the external walls to air, made a cart for me, and wheeled me to safety. I owe Pack my life.

That all happened seven months ago. We’ve been on the run ever since. I scavenge what I can from second-hand stores, and Pack is getting better at replicating real food. Once I hooked on the idea of wearing Pack, we started practicing together, so we could work as a team. Really, we’ve just been waiting for an excuse to be a hero, and that excuse came last week. I’m just glad that the jetpack worked as well as it did.

----------------------------------------------------

“So, any questions?”

“Tons, actually.” Ben rose and approached Jack. “How does it work?”

Jack shrugged his shoulders, so Ben continued. “What happens when it breaks?”

“I repair myself,” replied the device on Jack’s back.

“Sure, but what happens when it is so badly broken that it can’t be repaired?”

“What happens when you are badly broken?”

Pack’s electronic words hung in the silent air. Butch started to get up and put himself between Ben and Jack, but Ben waved him off.  “That was a low blow, especially for a computer.”

“I do not aim my blows. I use logic. You clearly would appreciate a metaphor about being broken.”

“Well, you’re not wrong.” Ben shook his head. “I’m having a philosophical discussion with a computer. This has been a weird day.”

“What about me?” Stephen sputtered through the room’s speakers.

“When have we ever had a philosophical discussion?”

“I...we could have.”

“Cool, you have an AI too?” Jack marveled.

“Not exactly. Let’s do introductions right.” Ben extended his hand, and Jack shook it enthusiastically. “My name is Ben Jennings. My codename is Urban, though I’m thinking about changing it. Welcome to BRSHP.”

INTERLUDE 5

“You did not tell us that heroes existed before The Awakening!”

“I was not aware either. We are both at a loss now.”

“No, it is only you who is at a loss. The loss of your life, if you don’t make this right.”

“What do you want from me, then?”

“The terms of the treaty between the Grie Nehl and the Bahk Nehl are very clear. No outside influence.”

“What do you consider me, then?”

“You are merely a tool to further our ambition. Or have you forgotten what you were when we found you?”

“I haven’t forgotten your generosity, Ahr-Kao, but you gave me this task, and you trusted me to see it through. Do not abandon your trust now.”

“Do not presume to use my words against me, human. But you are correct. This is your mistake to make. On the Day of Convergence, it will be a simple matter to remove this new hero from the playing field if he still interferes. But for his sake, and yours, I hope you can correct this mistake.”

“I live to serve, Ahr-Kao.”"

That encompasses dirty talk, RP'ing, or any other kind of back-and-forth you can imagine. As long as it doesn't fit into my no-goes list, which is down below, I'm game.

Long story short, I'm a giver. When a woman I'm going back and forth with enjoys herself and gets off, it turns me on. As such, I'm looking to give tonight, and I'm interested to see where that takes me.

If you're just looking for dirty chat, fire away with a naughty orange envelope and let's get started. If you're looking to RP, I've got a few sample prompts below as starting points, but I'm willing to consider a lot.

---

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

That aforementioned list of limits: Animals/furries/non-humans, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, noncon, extreme age play.

3wtdsr,60,2015-12-14,I think I may fit in around here,Damnit_Debbie,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/3wtdsr/i_think_i_may_fit_in_around_here/,"Because my SO knows (I think) my main account I've made this one especially for my FMIL stories. For some background my SO and I are 23 and 24. We've been together about 3.5 years and have known each other 8. He was the long sought after son and the baby. Seriously. His parents wanted a boy with his name so badly that when they didn't think they'd get one they gave his younger older sister the female version of his name as a middle name. Anyway she's never really liked me (or his only other SO who is a lovely girl). Here's a few of my many ""no bitch"" stories. I will be referring to FMIL as ""damnit debbie""

- About four months into our relationship (I was 20 he was 21) SO was living at home (and was until this August when we moved in together). The family's septic tank burst and flooded the house. They had to turn off their water and were only able to use their outdoor pool shower. It was cold so I offered to let them come use my house to shower (I had two) and do laundry. FMIL declined but of course SO took me up on that. For days he'd just walk out of the house with a change of clothes. One day FMIL noticed and asked him where he was going. He replied he was going to my place to shower. She looked at him with concern and said to him, ""be careful with that...Those things can lead to...THINGS.""

- About six months later my SO and I were discussing what to do for our first anniversary. I'd asked his eldest sister and she mentioned a comedy festival the next state over with some of his favorite people. I suggested it to him and he said an over night trip was more than we could afford. A few days later FMIL buys tickets for Him, his 2nd sister, and herself. She tells him she doesn't want to go so one of his friends could buy her ticket. I said I was interested. She jerked me around for two months (I want to/I don't want to) until she said she'd allow me to buy it, full price ($80) on the condition that she ""rode in the car with us and we all stayed at her brother's house"". I told SO I was not comfortable with that (I didn't know his uncle, I'd be sharing a room with his blabbermouth sis, etc) and suggested we get a hotel room. We'd be with them all day and just go there to sleep. When SO informed her of this she flipped. shit. He got home, sat her down, and asked her to explain what her deal was. Surprise, she doesn't like me. Ok why? She first gave the bullshit excuse that ""she doesn't talk to us enough""...SO pointed out that every time I came to the house they were watching tv and I did make a point to say hello and ask how they were. Finally it came down to the nitty gritty...She didn't like that we were having sex. My SO said flatly to her ""Mom. I am 21 years old. My girlfriend has a house. If I want sex I don't have to go the next state over to get it.""  He ignored her for two months

- A little less than a year ago I was on a very strict diet to lose weight. I have a medical condition that caused me to gain a good bit and I was finally well enough to start getting it off. I was paying a TON of money for this diet and working really hard. She asked how it was going and I replied ""great! I've lost 10 pounds so far."" FMIL has been on a diet as long as I've known her despite not being overweight. She replies to me smugly ""You know I bet you're going to gain it all back."" I looked at her and asked ""oh my goodness damnit debbie! Why would you say something like that?"" She gave some BS that it was ""to motivate you to prove me wrong."" k bitch.

- Last summer my SO and I were preparing to move in together. He had never lived outside of his parents and I had needed to move home for medical reasons. We were 22 and 23. He had graduated the previous December (I am graduating Friday) and had been working with an international technology company for four months. FMIL...To say the least...didn't prepare her children at best and crippled them at worst (one of them is completely unable to care for herself...At 25  years old she didn't know how to cook a chicken breast. I had to teach my SO at 21 how to use a mop). I pushed my SO to get his first job at 21. I pushed him to accept an offered internship in his field. I pushed him to follow up with the hiring committee to find out his first day of work. It's not that he doesn't want to do this stuff. It's that he doesn't KNOW how to because his mother did EVERYTHING. Until a week ago he'd never made a doctor's appointment for himself. I'm serious. Anyway, we were off to the store for something and he stopped to chat with her for a moment. It came up that one of his friends and his friend's girlfriend are getting married. She looked right at my SO (with me right there) and repeated over and over to him only, ""You are too young. You are not ready. Seriously. You are too young."" 

- She tried to dissuade him multiple times from moving with me because it was ""too fast""...Again...We'd been together 3 years.

- I forgot one. Last Xmas she presented me with a gift and said ""I just saw it and thought of you!"" It was XXL pj pants with Thing 1 and Thing 2 on them. No. They did not fit.

- A few weeks ago was by far the worst. I'd woken up to see my SO convulsing in his sleep. Thankfully I was able to wake him up easily but it scared the shit out of me. He wouldn't believe me when I tried to tell him what had happened. I texted FMIL to ask if this had happened before when he was a child. She said no and asked if I'd been able to get him to make a DR's appointment for his thyroid. It's like pulling teeth to get my SO to make a stupid Dr.'s appointment. I was speaking to her and it turned out there was a lot of family history stuff that he had either not known or informed me of. I asked if I could stop by to take a few notes (my mistake). She asked about everything that was going on with him. I told her he was sleeping a lot, grumpy, memory problems, etc. She got a very worried look and asked if he was depressed. I said it was possible but he had not said anything to me. She proceeds to tell me that given family history she believes him to be depressed...And blames me. She says she thought that we had moved too fast and that the pressure on him of work, moving, and paying most of our expenses (he has a full time job, I have a part time and I'm in school.) has just caused him to spiral. She tells me that when we got into our car accident a few months ago (a week after we'd moved) she ""asked him if he was happy and couldn't tell her that he was"". Which...We had just been in a fucking car accident so...She repeats this twice more during the conversation. She tells me she thinks we ""moved too fast"" and asks when our lease is up. She also tells me not to tell him I'd spoken with her because ""he'd probably get mad"" and ""He can see me manipulating from way over there."" (Just a point...My degree is in rhetoric and persuasion. I'm going to pursue a PhD. in it. I've spent 4 years learning 'how to manipulate' but don't because I'm not a piece of shit. She thinks she's SO clever for playing petty mind games) As I'm leaving she mentions it ""might not be a bad idea if you tell him you want to take a little break, take the animals, and go to your parents to let him have some time to himself."" I get home and just feel like complete shit. I wasn't going to say anything to SO but realized that's not a healthy relationship dynamic. So I spill and I'm crying. He tells me of course I don't make him depressed, no he doesn't want me to leave, and he loves living with me. He asks where the hell I'm getting this. I tell him I'd spoken to her to get some family history stuff for his Dr's appointment (which she offered to make and go to with him) which I did get. He was not upset at all that I'd talked to her (actually thought it was sweet I was concerned enough about him to do it)...Then I mentioned the ""break"" part...He was absolutely not happy about that (SO doesn't take her shit and calls her out anytime he sees it...She just doesn't care). He was supposed to go pick up some packages from their place (ours is in not the greatest area so we have packages sent to our parent's homes)  and visit with them and an uncle who had come into town for dinner (I had not been invited). He almost didn't go but I told him it would only make things worse on me. 

SO informed me a few days ago that FMIL and FFIL had gotten me something special for XMas. I asked ""What is it? Poison?"" 

SO and I are getting engaged very soon. We're using our vacation in a few weeks to go look at wedding venues and ring shopping. My parents are both ecstatic and have offered to pay for the majority of the wedding costs (I am an only). We're waiting until the ring is on my finger to say anything to his parents. It was kind of funny. We had to stop by their place to drop off dog food. FMIL refuses to buy the appropriate dog food for the family dog because it's pricey and can't be bought at Albertsons so every month my SO has to go across town to buy and deliver it...Despite FMIL and FFIL actually having the dog and being much better off financially. How they treat their animals is a different story for a different day though (I'm an animal person and it upsets me). Anyway she asks about our vacation (for which we've already paid for the room) not knowing the reason for it...Then encourages us to cancel our plans and go on a cruise instead. Lol.  

Ok what the hell. Animal stories. I am a huge animal lover as is my family. For a bit when I was 19 I worked at an animal shelter and later as a vet assistant. My mom, dad, and I combined have 10 indoor animals (my mother also feeds the local raccoon colony...I know). Three of those are mine, my lab mix, and my two cats. They were all ""unadoptables."" I buy the best food I can for them (blue buffalo) and do whatever I can to keep them in the best health...It's easier to maintain than to drop several hundred on vet bills and meds...Not that I wouldn't or haven't done it. 

My FMIL and FFIL also have three animals. Two cats and a lab chow mix. The two cats are supposedly my SO's younger older sister's though she left them when she moved (to a pet friendly place). They are outdoor, fed meow mix, and I've frequently had to fill their water bowl because it was disgustingly dirty or just empty (we live in a hot semi-tropical environment). I once expressed that I was concerned I would hit them when pulling into the drive way (they run under the car when they see it approach). MIL replied ""If you do, don't feel bad. Seriously. They're stupid."" She's also tried several times to get me to take the cats...

They used to look down on me for the amount I spent on my dog's food and heartworm/flea treatment...Their dog was previously kept almost 100% outside...Again, subtropical environment and a big fluffy chow...Who is also a senior dog. He had visible arthritis in his back legs they refused to acknowledge or do anything about. Fed kibbles and bits and largely ignored. Then he gets heart worms (mosquitoes are bad here) and my SO starts following all of my advice. It took the dog developing a condition that will shorten his life to start even bothering to remember to give him the topical medication that would have prevented it in the first place. 

Remember how I said my animals are the ""unadoptables""? My dog is stranger aggressive. A huge part of the reason I have her is for protection and she's why I feel safe when my SO is away (and why  my SO is also confident I am safe). I have taken her to trainers and I know exactly how to handle my dog around someone new. Leash, discipline, and calm attitudes. Luckily, she will not bite unless someone REALLY asks for it (I mean like a person she doesn't know and is barking at grabbing her face). She will act scary but like I said...It's pretty much an act. Familiar people can pretty much do anything to her (reach into her food bowl, take her toys, take things out of her mouth, mess with her butt, etc). I have made sure that she is trained in nessicary commands such as ""spot"", ""go get that"", ""drop it"", ""no"", ""come"", ""give me that"", ""sit"", etc. She is always supervised and I take the proper precautions. I do not have new people over unless I have informed them fully of the situation and I am confident they will respect my instruction (there have been no mishaps or issues and I have introduced quite a number of people to her). Anyway after our accident, for whatever reason, SO needed FMIL's help with the police report (rather she insisted upon helping him). I was in the ER for whiplash. Despite my instruction, SO invited his mother in without informing her of the dog or taking proper precaution. Naturally she did her thing (he is not new to this) and they stepped back outside. When I get home SO informs me ""dog tried to bite mom."" I ask what exactly future MIL had done to get the dog to actually try to bite...Nope...Just normal stuff. So I ask him ""did you inform her?"" ""no."" ""Ok...Did you do what I'd told you to do?"" ""No."" ""Ok did you do what the trainer told you to do?"" ""No."" I texted FMIL to thank her for helping him and apologize about pup's behavior. I explained she is a guard dog and though she looks scary she won't bite unless directly provoked. FMIL informed me that I was wrong and ""Had SO not been strong HE would have gotten to me. Something needs to happen with her."" Firsly, my dog is a she. FMIL knows this and second...oh fuck no. You are not going to come into MY house and tell me ""something needs to happen"" with my dog or anything for that matter. This is not your fucking house and you have absolutely no authority over what goes on here...But guess who does live here? The goddamn dog. I told my SO first, in no uncertain terms that he needed to handle his mother because the next time she said anything even slightly off color about my dog I would not be kind, polite, or tolerant. Secondly, I didn't feel comfortable having her here as it was obvious she didn't or couldn't respect all members of the household (mostly I'm afraid she'd get my dog killed). Lastly, until he'd shown me he could be responsible with the dog and guests, not to invite anyone over without either me there or telling me so I could take the dog out. Needless to say, she won't be having her future grandkids alone. "

3wtkr1,2,2015-12-14,My[25f] boyfriend [24m] of 5+ years is moving to another country to pursue a dream job. I'm starting mine in a few months.,gentle_flakes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wtkr1/my25f_boyfriend_24m_of_5_years_is_moving_to/,"Hi Reddit.

I've cried. I've analyzed. I'm tired. 

My boyfriend of 5.5+ years ( living together for over 1 year) is moving to California next year to work in silicon valley. Being that he's in Computer Science, it's where all the good jobs and opportunities are. I understand this and have supported his decision to leave. I'm also ambitious in my career and have accepted a full time Investment Banking Job in Toronto. I understand why he needs to leave, as if I were in his place I would chase my dream job, too. Being in a happy relationship is not enough...we both need personal achievements.

We talked about the future, and he's not a believer in marriage. We started dating when I was 19 and I really wasn't thinking about the future or anything serious, but of course 5 years later I'm wondering if this is the guy I will be with.

He's loving and caring, faithful and honest. I can't help feel, however, that a lot of our relationship has been me putting in more effort, meeting him more than half way.

During my summer internship ( that led to the full time job) during my first month i was working 100 hour weeks every week. Instead of getting support from him, he said he didn't think he could be with me if my job continued to be so intense. He said that there needs to be a minimum threshold of time spent together, and that he just wasn't seeing enough of me. The hours lightened up later on in the summer and he seemed to simmer down. But the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. I felt like when I was counting on him the most to support me as I was mentally and physically exhausted every day. Instead I got the threat of breaking up. All of this when during the previous summer, he was interning in California, and I supported him and went to visit for 2 weeks.

When he was choosing between different offers from tech firms in California for full time, I was right in the middle of a very crunchy final exam season. I also didn't want to think about him leaving. I supported his decision to leave, not making a fuss, but I couldn't put myself through watching him weigh the pros and cons of each job all the while ignoring the fact that we'd be apart regardless of his decision. I kept myself busy and didn't give any opinions. If he was going to leave to make himself happy, then he could choose a company.

He says he doesn't have a choice. That he knows he would be miserable staying in Toronto. I understand it. I do. But it bothers me that he doesn't think it's putting a death sentence on our relationship. This isn't temporary long-distance, they're full time jobs, with no end in sight. 

He keeps thinking that i'll move to California in a few years. I told him I don't want to move. That I have family and friends here and If I moved it would really only be for him. And I'm not sure I'm willing to do that. 

Our current plan is to do long distance. See how it goes and go from there. (I know, not much of a plan.) 

I'm all out of thoughts and words. At this point I just feel like a ball of sad that really needs to study for her exam tomorrow. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend of over 5 years moving to a different country next year to pursue his dream job. I'm staying here for my dream job. Don't know what to do. Feeling tired of meeting him more than half way all the time."

3wun0y,23,2015-12-14,"My ex [23/M] and I [20/F] broke up 6 months ago, and he gave me something extra back with my stuff- help.",r2_me2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wun0y/my_ex_23m_and_i_20f_broke_up_6_months_ago_and_he/,"My ex, who I will call Dan, and I started dating in 2011. Everything was wonderful the first year or so, but then he started choosing his best friend over me- constantly. He'd lie and tell me he was at home with his mom, and then pictures of him and said friend would surface, proving he was lying. It got better for a while, and then.. it wasn't. 

He had a compulsive lying problem, and the more time I spent with him the more I realized how bad it actually was. Every time I tried to leave him, however, I was overpowered, and forced to sit in the same spot until I calmed down and changed my mind. He'd barricade the doors, sit on my car or otherwise block me from leaving. I was never allowed to leave.

Then, he started getting really close to his coworker, and I knew something was up. He would never invite me to hang out with them, would be constantly texting her while we were together but there was never a text thread from her whenever his phone wasn't in his hand. On Christmas eve of last year, her friend got in contact with me and told me that I shouldn't be friends with her, and that I needed to talk to both of them. He told me, after making me promise and swear that I wouldn't leave him, that he slept with her once, hopped up on a bunch of drugs. I wanted to leave, but the fact that it was Christmas and our families expected us to be happy together, I put on a face like nothing was actually wrong and stayed through the holiday season and that morphed into a long time after that.

There were a lot of dating sites and tinder contacts with other girls over that three year span after our first year together, that I just let go after trying to fight for the truth because I knew I'd never get it, and wouldn't ever be able to leave. I stopped fighting back after being kicked out of his car on the highway after confronting him when one of my friends reached out to me about finding one of his dating profiles. I've forced a lot of stuff out of my memory because I spent so long being downright miserable.

Don't get me wrong, I started a lot of arguments because I'd bring stuff up from the past, but I've come to learn that the stuff that was ""in the past"" was never actually in the past, and was continuously happening which is why he made it into a bigger deal than it actually was. 

I had an internship this summer where I became very close to two of my coworkers, who began to see how controlling and toxic the relationship was, the more I talked about it with them. One night, I had a drunken heart to heart with one of my friends (the other had long passed out) and it was at that point I realized that no matter what- I needed to leave. 

Dan lied to me about getting kicked out of school for his grades (this was the second or third time it's happened, also. He changed his major from engineering to history and spent the four years of his college career lying to his parents about how well his engineering courses were going- the first time they were going to find out about his major change, in his perfectly planned out world, would have been at commencement, where I would have taken the heat and been there with his parents when they found out). There was nothing in my mind that could allow me to logically stay with this kid anymore. I had finally had enough, and with the support of my two friends, ended the relationship shortly before our 4 year anniversary.

Dan went absolutely psychotic. He would text me and call me non-stop. Beg for me, he'd drive to my house 20 minutes away and wait for me to come home from work (I started staying with my friends or bringing them home with me so I wouldn't be going home alone). He tried to turn my best friend, who was spending time with him during the week at school, against me by dragging stuff up that happened two years ago. Dan threatened suicide, on so many occasions. I had to tell his parents that we broke up, because he refused to believe it was over.

He ran to my house at midnight, and sent me a text message of my mailboxes along with a map of his run. Our houses are 10+ miles apart, one way, and I live in a rural area with no street lights or stoplights. 

In hindsight I probably should have gotten a restraining order. He was downright nasty to me, whenever I'd reject him again. I was being slandered on social media constantly. He self harmed, and showed all his friends and told them I made him do it.

About a week after I ended the relationship, I get a text from my best friend who had been trying to distract him, with a picture of an engagement ring, which he was apparently going to propose with on our 4 year anniversary. I freaked out but my coworkers calmed me down and helped me to forget about it.

Fast forward a little. Because of how he was acting, my mom volunteered to get all of the things of mine he still had, for me, so I wouldn't be in danger. She met up with him, got a crate filled with my stuff back, and left it in the trunk of her car for me to grab at a later date.

Dan is currently dating a girl I went to high school with. They've posted all over social media about how happy they are, the fact that they're in ""unconditional love"", and both have since posted things directed at me, and the state of my mental health, and how horrible of a person I am, etc etc. They've been together for about a month now, and have known each other for slightly longer. 

He bought her tickets as a birthday gift to a concert he was well aware I was going to, 5 states away from our home state. Things like that, which still make my skin crawl- he's blocked on all of my social media sites and everything so he has no way of contacting me.

Fast forward to today- I finally got around to getting my stuff from him out of the trunk of my mom's car, and hidden in the sleeve of a sweatshirt he gave back to me, is the engagement ring.

What do I do with it?
He's made it very clear that he thinks horribly of me, and is happy with his new girlfriend (I'm also very happy with where I'm at)
Do I unblock him to try and give it back? Or get in contact with one of his parents to give it back? Or do I pawn/sell it?

Help.

TLDR; I broke up with my extremely unfaithful ex of 4 years shortly before he planned to propose to me. He went psycho after our breakup, and amid the things of mine he gave back to me, he hid the engagement ring. Didn't discover it until today, 6 months later."

I'm a second-year chemE, and I didn't do so well this past semester. 3 B's and 2 C's. This brought my GPA down from a 3.47 to a 3.2. I'm feeling pretty down about my grades and school in general right now. I know this isn't the end of the world, but I'm still fairly concerned.

Could any older chemE's out there put this into perspective? How much does GPA really matter to companies? I know a lot of people say that as long as you graduate from Tech, you'll be fine, but I've seen a lot of companies with GPA cutoffs at 3.5 or 3.2.

I have been at two schools (Cuesta College, West Valley College). I did poorly my first year at Cuesta (2.9 gpa, took econ/accounting classes) because my uncle was dying of cancer so i spent a lot of time helping my family.

After my first year I dropped out of school. I wrote a patent application for some technology and founded a startup, sold the company for 6 figures to an investor in the Silicon Valley.

After selling the startup I went back to school and got my act together (academically). I have a 4.0 GPA in all of the EE pre-reqs (Calc1-3, Diff Eq, Lin ALg, Physics1-3, Chem, C++, English 1A&amp;1B) but my overall gpa because of my poor first year performance will only be a 3.46

Would they see the light in my upward trend? Does my personal statement have any merit? Do they only look at my major classes when calculating GPA? Thanks for any advice, I really appreciate it"

I have been at two schools (Cuesta College, West Valley College). I did poorly my first year at Cuesta (2.9 gpa, took econ/accounting classes) because my uncle was dying of cancer so i spent a lot of time helping my family.
After my first year I dropped out of school. I wrote a patent application for some technology and founded a startup, sold the company for 6 figures to an investor in the Silicon Valley.

After selling the startup I went back to school and got my act together (academically). I have a 4.0 GPA in all of the EECS pre-reqs (Calc1-3, Diff Eq, Lin ALg, Physics1-3, Chem, C++, English 1A&amp;1B) but my overall gpa because of my poor first year performance will only be a 3.46

And since I don't like being ""average"" at anything I do, if like to try to learn some of this before May so I can hit the ground running (even though the intern program manager said not to worry about it and I'll learn what I need to learn during the internship) 

Internship description: Fortune 50 cyber security and risk

My cyber security experience : none (is negative an option?)

Major related classes this spring: data basing, C#

Preferred qualifications, per the job posting:

* Python 
* Security +
* GIAC Security Essentials
* CERT- Certified computer security incident handler
* CISSP



Where should I start? I really don't want to show up day one of the internship and have to admit that I know literally nothing about cyber security. I understand that internships are learning experiences, but I'd like to have a foundation in the basics (I won't go through the cyber security class until the semester after the internship)"

Is CS1 the most ""bang for your buck"" class that I can take if I decide I want to become a programmer in the future? 

My situation:

1. I'm not a comp sci major. I've taken Intro to C, OOP and a mobile dev class. I'm planning on taking databases and CS1 at least before I graduate. Will CS1 cover enough ground to act as a solid base in order to apply it/learn in the future? I'm interested mostly in mobile development, especially in the geographic and scientific arenas (think: GIS, for those who know what that is). 

2. I want to work an internship this summer and then graduate in the fall. This is impossible to do if I finish out a comp sci minor. Most internships I'm interested in are on the other side of the country so it's not possible to take classes in the summer that are related to comp sci.

3. I'm not really a school type of person (despite almost being done with it lol)... I've figured this out and I really don't want to go beyond a bachelor's degree. So I'm looking for the most ""bang for my buck"" at this point. I sort of dread having to sit through even more classes, especially some of them which I don't feel will have much direct benefit for me. I've noticed that I like pursing side projects outside of school more than the stuff that I've worked on in class (in a range of subjects, not just comp sci). 

4. I'm not 100% sure that I want to be a programmer, but I really like computers in general. So I would like to still keep my options open. Ie. I'm guessing that I'll like any career that has anything to do with computers, programming or not

Opinions on all of this? If you want to, feel free to convince me to finish out a comp sci minor... but currently I'm leaning towards just CS1 because of the reasons I've given above."

3wxm64,3,2015-12-15,Accounting to fund management,hifinancethrowaway,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3wxm64/accounting_to_fund_management/,"Hi guys,

Firstly may I apologise for yet another post about this sort of a thing, I am sure it's beginning to make some people crazy!

I'm a UK university student with a job offer in FS audit at one of the Big 4, but my ambitions have been to go into an investment-related field (applied for various asset managers and private banking with a focus on wealth management - I don't have a specific focus, but I like the idea of being a portfolio manager or eventually moving to a hedge fund because I find portfolio allocation and performance analysis quite interesting, likewise with hedge fund strategies). FS audit was my back-up because at least it was FS related, and would allow for the ACA after 3/4 years as well as some experience within the field from a back office perspective (regulation, IFRS/GAAP, some valuation, etc.)

My issue now is that, as all of my applications this year have floundered (could be because I have made crappy applications, could be that the positions are saturated and they look for internship conversions, could be a mixture of the both), I am looking at becoming an accountant. And I definitely do not want to be one as a career.

I know you can make the jump from audit to other places, and that career prospects are generally quite good (become a partner, go into industry and become an FD/CFO eventually) but that just doesn't follow the passion I have for financial markets and financial instruments. So what should I do?

My possibilities ultimately come down to:
- Take the job, do the job, try hardest after ACA (perhaps whilst completing the CFA at the same time) to move into equity research, fund accounting or the valuation team at the company with a view to eventually moving into something more investment based)
- Take the job, and still apply for grad schemes in my first few years
- Don't take the job, do a masters and then reapply

It'd be interest to hear peoples opinions on this, whether you have any experience or not. I'm also willing to answer any more questions that might flesh things out.

Thanks"

I found the office.js Framework from Microsoft to work in Office-Documents but haven't found a solution to display Information regarding the file (e.g. if cell A1 ==""Factory A"") then the add-in should display a window showing Text (Information about the Factory for example).


Another question is that the add-in should open a form and save the input for later usage.

Is it possible to do that things?

TL;DR: Can I display an interactive window in Excel.

I've got zero professional exposure, how much of a disadvantage is this for me? If you've gotten accepted at a good internship, can you show me what you're working with so I can see what I'm up against?

I've got a github that has simple small projects on it and I'm in the process of building a blog in which I extract/analyze data (but all the parsers I'm using aren't mine.) Should I include it if the software I'm using isn't written by me?"

So far I was looking into several web frameworks and after seeing the lecture of Ryan Dahl [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqlZD21DME0) and having more experience in it I'm more inclined to pick node for the development of both projects.

Upon further investigation, I was reading about creating cluster of servers and mixing databases but I haven't found much that can give me a clear view of what are the purpose of that.

Am I on the right track by thinking that node is a good option or my lack of experience is clouding my judgement?

3wyvv4,1,2015-12-15,Will learning Node/Express be a worthwhile investment en route to learning React?,itelbg,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3wyvv4/will_learning_nodeexpress_be_a_worthwhile/,"Due to the scarcity of resources on ReactJS (which includes lack of resources on best practices, design patterns, writing scalable code, maintainable code, secure code, etc) and its ever-changing ecosystem... would it be wiser to build foundational skills with more established tools (or foundational skills in general, like functional JS with books like Javascript Allonge) and wait until the storm calms down a bit?

This is coming from the perspective of a beginner (I understand the basics like how the MVC/MVT model conceptually works, GET/POST, how a database works... have built a simple Python web app, and did a multi-threaded socket project in C for a school project).  It seems like the front-end world is moving too fast, and it's very intimidating.

I considered picking up a small framework like Flask, but figured Node/Express was the better investment because it's also lightweight and more importantly it's Javascript, so I will still be crafting my Javascript thinking/coding.  Plus, it's widely used in industry.

I figured picking up a small client-side JS framework like Backbone would have lesser return on investment than Node/Express since the Backbone paradigm may be too different from React, while the back-end is the back-end and one would need to learn it anyway (and again, Node is strong in the job market).  Is my thinking here correct?

I will at least finish working through the Full-Stack Redux Tutorial and then gauge how enthusiastic I am with wanting to stick to learning React, but I would like to hear some advice from more experienced developers who have used React, who can try to empathize with someone diving into a crazy world (the front-end) who still feels like he/she needs to build up on the basics before messing with an ever-changing sea of tools and ways of doing things.

What would you do in my position? Is it ok to play with React so long as I am constantly building my vanillaJS (I hear React helps that anyway), or would I be better spending my time learning more stable/established technology where I can focus on writing good code?  Is React really small enough that I'll be ok diving in?  Is it a skill/learning experience in itself stringing together constantly changing technology?

I am also looking at internships and there is almost nothing for React despite its fast-growing adoption rate.  Most intern positions are heavily in the back-end, and if they are not, they are either Angular or older jQuery intensive front-end positions, so this has made me reconsider diving into React when I could more quickly secure an internship learning something else first.

Appreciate any insight!"

I have no professional experience in my field, but as I live in a city with only a modest tech industry, most companies here funnel all of their available internships into my school's work program, leaving very little for those of us not in that program.

After this Friday, I'll have about 3 weeks off before the next semester starts in January.

Until classes start again, I'll be spending pretty much everyday alone. My roommates, one being my cousin and the other being my SO, have left to go back home for the break. Granted my SO is from Chicago, and has been living out of state for her internship for this semester, but she doesn't plan to come officially move in until next semester. 

My cousin was always the quiet one and spent practically every day in her room, only coming out for food. So even when she lived here, I would still come home and sit in silence all evening in a seemingly empty apartment. 

The rest of our friend group, all guys, are in the same frat, and I have only seen them a handful of times all semester. And when I have seen them, all they talk about is drinking and partying and frat activities. We had all originally planned to get a house together next fall, but the three fratties just blew that away because they want a party house instead. 

I do plan to go home for Christmas and New Year's, but even then, I'll only be able to see my family. I have no friends back at home I can visit or hang out with. Until then, every day is just another day of coming home to a dreary apartment, and sit alone watching tv, sleeping, eating.

This probably sounds really long, and whiny, and moany, but I have just never been in a situation where I have felt I have no friends, or anyone, to see or be with. I hate coming home alone, sitting alone, not speaking, staring blearly at my computer or tv. I have never felt this lonely before, and I am just not sure what to do about anything."

* Early 20s - 2 years experience out of school

* Internal promotion

* Big corp on the fortune list
* Currently make 50k, live in major city near office

An old manager from my internship days has approached me for an internal promotion (to the chagrin of my current IT dept). The discussions with my upper bosses were mixed but some did have great info they shared - such as earning potential of IT vs HR.

However, I see myself eventually moving south or west one day and see a senior title change as a good thing for my resume - especially since my current manager is nothing to write home about. My new manager is EXCELLENT and would advocate for my future growth. There are exciting projects on both teams in my company. There are a lot of politics that would occur to make the switch happen.

For me to switch, I feel I would need a 15k bump at least. My bosses argue that 2 more years of IT exp will open up HUGE earning potential... while I've seen first-hand people in our HR dept move up the ranks quickly.

Either way, my work would be technical. More technical in IT obviously (I do reporting, database work, etc). While HR being a little more meet-n-greet/creative in HR (delivering/loading excel data, doing agile analysis)

I've completed the interviews (and got positive reviews) and they seem like theyll be giving me details of financial compensation in the next day or so.

Honestly the TLDR would be the TITLE... any thoughts out there? Really appreciate it.

I had the interview this last Friday, and they said that they would get back to me that day or yesterday. I haven't heard back yet. I was one of four applicants, and I would have assumed that they would have emailed me the results, either way. Now that I am waiting, and it's a day later than what they told me, I'm assuming I'm not getting the job. I am OK with that, I'm still young, but I'm just wondering if I should do. I want to do one of two things, **one, email them and ask what I can improve on in the future and why they didn't choose me.** **Or two, just tell them that I am still interested in the position.** They might just be running late, so I don't want to piss them off. I felt really good after the interview, and at the end of that, I asked what I could be doing better during interviews. I asked some really good questions at the end, their words, not mine. What would you advise?"

All of these people helped me to better understand Hispanic culture and have given me what I call a ""Laughable white mans fluency in Spanish"". 

From all of these experiences, I really want to work / study abroad in a country where English isn't the primary language, and I don't really care which one it is. I studied French for 5 years in school, and have my passable Spanish fluency, so a Spanish speaking country would be preferred, but I just really would like to go abroad for at least a few months.


However my dilemma is that I am currently a Junior studying Physics and Computer Science in a 5 year master program, working at a particle physics lab. So I'd really like to just ""Go abroad"" for a semester, but my school doesn't offer any foreign travel (Besides English speaking Glasgow) that isn't entirely irrelevant to what I'm studying, and (In the most respectful way possible) I can't justify putting my schooling behind a semester just to run off and go learn Spanish.

Basically I'm hoping to find a ""Productive"" internship or study abroad program in another country that wouldn't just be me goofing off for a few months. I have no problem whatsoever attempting to learn a new language, but I know these things tend to be easier if some level of fluency is already apparent.

There's just a lot of information out there, and I really have no idea where to begin, and nobody I've talked to at my school has been very helpful. Any and all advice is definitely appreciated, and I'll gladly answer any questions for things I may have left out."
3wzy1j,30,2015-12-15,Taking Food Safety Practices Seriously,Throw_Away_Bad_Food,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3wzy1j/taking_food_safety_practices_seriously/,"I am posting here today because for a several months, I have felt really conflicted with feelings of disgust while working at my job, and I'm not sure what I should do.

I work at a major retail store. Like most retailers within the recent decade or so, this retailer has discovered that there is a market for opening up a grocery section of the store. I specifically specialize in the refrigerator and frozen areas.

The store I work brings in a lot of revenue; I guess we rank near the top in the US. We are always crowded with shoppers. Because of this, we end up getting a lot of product shipped in each night, but the store's design is flawed in that the focus of its construction was on floor space and the backroom is EXTREMELY limited, especially cooler and freezer sections.

What this means is that we get a ton of frozen and refrigerated product that sits out on a pallet, in room temperature, sometimes for hours. The overnight workers and managers also really don't give a fuck and with the occasional overnight shifts that I have picked up with them, I learned that they end up dividing all the boxes of product up to sit on the sales floor before unboxing the product. At least, this is an efficient system. But technically, we are supposed to trash the food as it thaws for more than 30 minutes, sometimes we go casually over at an hour... but I know for a fact that food thaws and they just sell it anyways.

Another problem is that our store is incredibly short-staffed, so there isn't enough people to work the product/manage the cooler and freezer storage, ect. While talking to management and a young intern who is my age, I've racked up different explanations of why that is. The highest of managers and the intern put the blame on corporate policy, like there is some maximum amount of hours we can have, but my direct supervisor always mentions how strict his boss is with the payroll, which makes me really suspicious that the store staffs way shorter than it needs to in order to preserve that high revenue and ranking.

This is so sketchy, and I can't imagine it is legal that they endure their costs in this way. It was obvious to me that the quality of the food would be poor (ice cream no longer is ice cream after a while), but last night, I stuck up for prioritizing food safety again (like I was trained to!) only to frustrate my managers. When I got home, I did a little bit of googling and read about foodbourne illness, and how bacteria can form and increase while that food is thawed. This made me nervous. I talked to someone who works low level customer service in the store about this, and she thinks someone should report them. Some co-workers in my department, meanwhile, deny that its any big deal. They specifically mention that the frozen food will hold better while its still all condensed on a pallet.

If someone reads this, what do you think? I have thought about resigning to not be apart of it, I have tried transfering but that takes a while and has been a very political process since I have learned that the grocery managers figure it to be easier to keep me locked in grocery instead of hiring someone new. I'd prefer though, that I don't quit... mostly because I'm studying computer science which gives me potential to get a great job higher up, where I can pay off my over $100k in student loans. They also have a lot of other great benefits, like tuition coverage if I wanted to continue education with a new degree or grad school.

I'm morally opposed and disappointed that the store does this, and yet, it sort of seems like the economics/available space ect. sort of puts the managers in a place to make hard choices. Does anyone have ideas of what I should do?

**EDIT:** I've already made steps in the past to speak with human resources, and also the Food Safety manager."

I'd like your thoughts on this, please!


My ex and I got together at a bad time in both of our lives - really bad times. I was struggling with depression (and was not aware), lost my best friend, did badly in school, and just enlisted in the military - which is mandatory in my country. She, on the other hand, just witnessed her parents divorce and quickly became anorexic and severely underweight.


I was very obsessive (and still a little bit so). Not to the point of it being a mental problem, but enough that I would get very frustrated with things very quickly. I was prone to outbursts of anger and violence, although I have **never actually hit a person, only objects**. It quickly became the case that she would be the only one who could get me to calm down when I exploded.


Similarly, she felt like she could only felt that she could eat somewhat normally when she went out with me because I took her mind off of the food; when she did have an episode and start to freak out, I would be the only one who could talk her down.


I told her that being firm with me wouldn't work, because it always fed my outburst, and that the only way to deal with me was to wait it out. In regard to my depression, she would always comfort me and talk to me at length about how I should take my time with recovery; she would say that I could be lazy if I wanted to be as long as I got better eventually.


The both of us have recovered a great deal. I'm (finally) in college abroad, just finished my first semester. I almost never explode now, and I generally feel happier and more energetic than I used to, even after weaning off my depression meds. She's now a healthy weight, finishing her final year of college and occupying herself with all sorts of work and internships.

*EDIT: I'd like to make it clear that we recovered over the course of 3 years, not just in the few months after we broke up. Also it's been 4 months, not 5. I'm bad at counting.*


We both started to realise that I was tying her down a little with the issue of my mental stability, while the way we dealt with it wasn't the best for me, either. We broke up shortly after I left for college, overseas, as a result. It was very amicable - we're still good friends, we still talk. Occasionally we admit that we still love each other, to some extent.


We joked throughout our relationship that her coddling only enabled my bad behaviour, which in hindsight is a little bit true. However, I'm also positive that if we did not find each other when we did, our recoveries would not have been so swift, if at all. I'm absolutely sure that I loved her, and that we had something real and wonderful, even if a little bit unhealthy.


It's been a semester, and everything's going well. Turns out I can take care of myself, I'm doing very well in school and I haven't yet killed myself! Hurray.


She, too, feels like the breakup was good for the both of us.


Whenever I meet new people here, they ask me if I want to stay in this country after I graduate. I always reply with ""it depends"". The truth is, though, that I want to be wherever she is. I'm still in love with her, and I've told her this. She's receptive to getting back together.


However, knowing that she did have a slight tendency for enabling my bad habits - is this a good idea? At all? We've both changed in a few months. I'm a lot more stable, I feel more confident; she feels more autonomous now that her life isn't tied to mine. Being fully aware of the parts of our relationship that weren't so great, would getting back together undo all of this?

   
**tl;dr**: Broke up with girlfriend after moving overseas for college because our relationship was not completely healthy. Several months later, we're both doing great. It was a wonderful relationship, but we both acknowledge the problems we had in the past; knowing this, would getting back together be a good idea?"

  The hatch had been bolted shut heavily all around. Luckily for me, my gauntlet has a bolt cutter attachment. So after clamping through the bolts I lifted up the hatch and climbed down. 



  When I got down I was greeted with almost complete darkness. I pulled out my lighter which illuminated the place surprisingly well. 



  I then realized I was in another floor of the facility. It looked just like any other average floor. It had vending machines, offices, desks, lights, and your average facility stuff. Except for one thing.



  This floor looked like it hadn't been inhabited for decades. The lights were falling out of the ceiling. Everything was either cracked or broken. Vending machines sat idle. Desk plants grew to mammoth proportions, engulfing the furniture around them. But that's not the worst part. 



  Rotting bodies of Interns were all around. Most looked like they'd been eaten by vent tigers. At least I hope it was vent tigers. 



  As I explored further I came across files, weapons and other projects that couldn't have been from any of our departments. The files talked of things I had no recollection about, nor could I remember any details about them in the archives. 



  But the whole place gave off a strange feeling of déjà vu. In fact it was so intense that I had bits and peices of flashbacks,  flashbacks of things I've never seen, and not all of them were mine, I saw some from other facility members too. 



  As I was walking back to the hatch, I was frozen in my tracks. Suddenly the area of hall in front of me, no longer seemed deserted, it was as lively as ever. I saw /u/petrilstatusfull walk out of a room and pour herself some coffee. I would've said hi if it weren't for the horrifying thing that I saw next. 

  A man walked out of the room, and began talking with /u/petrilstatusfull but the man....was me. But it wasn't me, it couldn't have been. I was still frozen,  when the vision dissapeared and I was left standing once again in the deserted hallway.

   When my eyes came to rest on something that struck me cold. Standing not 3 feet in front of me was, white, inhuman, it could be described as a wraith, it was ghostly...it was evil. 



  Without thinking I ran through the figure, sprinting towards the hatch. As I reached the hatch and began to climb I tensed up, I could swear they almost got me, but I didn't stay around to check. 



  As I climbed out of the hatch, I slammed it behind me. And with inhuman strength I heaved the vending machine over the hatch. And fell back and on the ground waiting for anything to happen. 

***



  I don't what I saw. Or where that place was. But I'm going to get to the bottom of it. If you need me I'll be in my office looking over the archives.

  Until further notice, no one, and I mean no one is to go down there. Not until I know more about this. I'll have Donahue guarding the entrence. Not only to keep you out, but to keep them in. *feels around coat for cigar*

I was hoping to get some help on a very restrictive situation that I am in. So basically I am in the year between my MSc and PhD and I decided to work for an internship somewhere. I got a very strong startup offer that involves software engineering and ML but I have also inteviewed with amazon and the feedback seemed quite positive, but because they will only accept a couple of people in the specific project they did not provide me with a clear response yet and they seem to be slow. I have studied extensively software engineering, data science and Artificial Intelligence. Both companies are in an extremely popular tech area. The problem is the startup company gave me only a week to decide and then gave me a 48 hour extension, basically I have 2 days to decide between the following options:
1. Wait for amazon and automatically lose the other company's offer.
2. Choose the startup and if amazon comes positive renege the startup's offer

In the first case I will have to look for another job, I have enough funds to go on until February. But that will be cutting it real close. Even though I have another startup that wants me to work with them but they are just waiting for their funding rounds which will be done by the end of the next week. 

Also, how bad is it to renege an offer? I really don't want to take that route because they have been really nice and honest with me  and they are really good people.

So yeah that's my situation, please let me know for any advice"

Also, many of my upcoming classes are going to be online. I'm planning to leave my mac at home and take the Chromebook to campus and class for notes. I'm thinking I can still use my mac if something can't be done on the Chromebook. For the type of student I am, would a Chromebook work for me? Thanks!!"

Please help my daughter find the Science toys she wants so badly.",leredditmann,RandomActsOfChristmas,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/3x16qc/dear_santa_i_have_been_laid_off_all_gifts_were/,"During my Junior year of high school I became pregnant with my oldest daughter Nicky. She changed everything, my grades improved as sharply as my work ethic. I was kicked out of my home by my mother, but this didn't slow me down. I worked my way through the University of Florida and received a degree in Engineering in 2008. After an internship I was hired by a very large company that I cannot mention and was very happy there. I met the most wonderful man i the world soon after and we had another daughter, Sadie in June. We scrimpted and saved and paided back every dime of student debt I had. Nicky has never once asked for anything because she knows we will be out of debt soon and she sees us working so hard. In June I paided my final payment, and I asked Nicky what she wanted. She said, ""Nothing Mommy, Sadie is all I want."" My husband is a stay at home dad so he did some digging and found out that she wants a Microscope, and a telescope so she can do science with Mommy. She said she wants to be an engineer like me. I'm so proud of her, she's so smart. I got laid off at the beginning of December very unexpectedly, right as everything was coming together. But, thankfully my baby got her Telescope and her Microscope. We hid them at a friends storage space, in her condo building. The loss of my job has been devistating to us financially and my husband has been driving for Uber on the weekends, and I have been on a nonstop job hunt. The worst and most demoralizing thing is that all of Nicky's toys are gone, the fire department said someone had thrown a cigarette down the laundry chute. Everything in the basement burned, there was a sprinkler malfunction. Thankfully no one was hurt and the building is fine. Here we are, I don't ask for help I don't need and I desperately want to provide gifts for daughter. I cannot, and I beg you please help. She's so special and she's been so patient with everything. All the years of paying my bills so we could have a better life. All she want is to do science. Thank you so much for reading and I hope all of you have a Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah, whatever makes you happy. Be the change you want to see in the world.

3x1bnq,1,2015-12-15,27M4F Up for (almost!) anything,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3x1bnq/27m4f_up_for_almost_anything/,"As the title implies, I'm up for pretty much anything tonight. That encompasses dirty talk, RP'ing, or any other kind of back-and-forth you can imagine. As long as it doesn't fit into my no-goes list, which is down below, I'm game.

Long story short, I'm a giver. When a woman I'm going back and forth with enjoys herself and gets off, it turns me on. As such, I'm looking to give tonight, and I'm interested to see where that takes me.

If you're just looking for dirty chat, fire away with a naughty orange envelope and let's get started. If you're looking to RP, I've got a few sample prompts below as starting points, but I'm willing to consider a lot.

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

That aforementioned list of limits: Animals/furries/non-humans, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, noncon, extreme age play.

Hope to hear from you ladies tonight!"
3x1dtn,2,2015-12-15,"Me [20M] and my loving girlfirend [20F] have been dating for over 5 years, but I'm over it",bulldogsportsfan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3x1dtn/me_20m_and_my_loving_girlfirend_20f_have_been/,"So a little backstory to begin. I'm a college student and ive been dating my current GF for a little over 5 years. We began dating sophomore year of HS and were able to go the the same college since both of us got favorable offers. The first couple years of our relationship in HS were great, I was really in love with her and enjoyed being around her. We did thoughtful things for eachother and I was very proud of her (she is a 4.0 student and also runs track here at our college). She is the only serious girlfriend I have EVER had. She is pretty great to me, always texting me about my day and genuinely interested in what I do. She supports me and we rarely fight. She never is abusive to me in any way, she is such a sweetheart and always wants to do things for me.

Once I got to college though, things began changing. I noticed i almost always preffered hanging with friends (even those i didnt know too well) instead of her. I began feeling like we never had anything to do, and that all we ever did was watch movies or go out to eat together. I brought it up to her my Freshman year, and we talked and decided to try and fix it.

Things didnt necessarily get better, but we continued to date. We spent the next 2 summers away from eachother, since she stayed in our college town for internships and i went back to our hometown. I noticed that i really enjoyed this time away from her. I could finally focus on what i wanted to do while only having to text her a few times a day. 

Now here i am in my Junior year. Over this past summer i was almost sure that we wouldnt work out. Mostly just compatibility things; i love music while she doesnt care for it much, i love deep convos about space &amp; existence but she usually just says ""yeah"" or ""thats cool"". I've always thought that the ONE would be like my best friend, someone who I didnt need to do fun things with to have a good time. Someone who i could just talk to for hours.

Anyway, I decided that maybe it was just the distance that was making me feel this way, so I would give a more time before i broke it off. The beginning of the semester was fine, but soon I began feeling different.

Whenever she texts me I am almost instantly annoyed. I will lie to her to avoid hanging out. I put off texting her back for as long as I can just so I don't have to hang with her. When we do get around to spending time together, all i can think about is my exit strategy and what i want to do next. She always lays her stress on me, and more than ever i question what I am even getting out of the relationship. It feels like she is dragging me around to do things she wants and to make herself feel better. Our sex life was never spectacular, but that has also fallen off a bit; i dont even crave it with her much these days.

Besides going on hikes, I cant think of anything we really enjoy doing together. We both have similar values and goals, like travelling the world. I feel we will both have successful futures and if i stay with her, I know that i will have a decent life with someone who deeply cares for me. I'm her best friend, the one she always goes to first, and she would do anything for me. I dont feel the same way about her, though. In fact I can list off 10-15 friends i'd rather be with than her. It seems like I have 2 personalities: who i am and who i pretend to be when i'm around her. It's not like i act totally different, but I feel like i have to hold back. I dont really have that much fun with her, she is a bit boring 

So, I told her all of these feelings. I wanted to take a break to try and find myself and what i wanted. Being the age i am (20), I'm in this period where im really looking for myself. Who I want to be, where i want to take my life, etc. And i feel like she is holding me back. I cant decide what is truly best for me as long as I'm with her since i have to take her into consideration. It also eats me alive that she is the only one I've ever been with. It makes me think to myself, ""how do i know what i want in a relationship if i only have been in one?"". I also feel its unfair to her; she is giving me her unconditional love while i just half ass everything and go through the motions.

After i told her a couple months back I wanted to break up, she convinced me that we should try. And I agreed, i felt that if I had been with her this long, it wasnt worth it to throw it all away just because maybe i was having a bad month. She also took all of the blame; she believes that this whole situation is her fault, since she hasnt been giving me enough attention. I completely disagree with this, and like i said earlier feel like she is a great girlfriend to me. So we texted more, saw eachother more, and everything seemed OK again. But soon enough I began feeling the way I do now once again.

I dont feel love for her like I once did. Dont get me wrong, I love her as a person. I dont respect many people as much as i do her (as I mentioned, she is a 4.0 engineering student who also is excelling in collegiate track). On paper, she fits probably 90% of my qualifications for a girl. And i think that is what has kept me around so long; the fear that I would be letting go such a great person who would always be loyal and loving to me. I fear that I may never find someone like her again.

But I cant fight the feeling that she isnt the one for me. I miss the feeling of love. Wanting to always be around her, thinking of her, wanting to do things for her. If it was my choice, we would almost never hang out. I never seem to want to be around her, and these days when i am little things about her peeve me more than ever. I crave freedom from a relationship, it all just seems like a hassle to me these days. I'm excited about almost everything in my life except our relationship. Its the one thing in my life that consistently brings me down and makes me feel less happy. And i find myself looking at and flirting with other girls more than ever.

During these past few months I've done a lot of searching on the internet. Almost everyone says that all relationships hit this stage at some point, when you realize they are just as human as you are and you feel a bit bored. But i dont see myself suddenly having a change of heart. I try to remind myself why i fell for her by thinking of all the things that make her great. But my heart just isnt in it anymore, and I don't love her like i once did.

So now here I am on Reddit, after a friend recommended it to me (If youre reading this, thanks Cal). My question for all of you is: Whats up with me? Are these all signs that she isnt the one for me and i should move on? Or am I just bored and blinding myself to all the reasons she is great? I keep going back and forth about whether or not i should end it with her. 

I always thought that when i found the one, I would just know. There would be absolutely no doubt in my mind that i want to spend the rest of my life with that person. How did you all know when you found ""the one""?



   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend of over 5 years is great, but I simply dont feel like I love her anymore and the relationship is the only thing in my life bringing me down."

3x1jwj,0,2015-12-16,(21/f) I'm getting really annoyed with literally everything my boyfriend (27/m) does. Literally everything.,KittyLord0824,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3x1jwj/21f_im_getting_really_annoyed_with_literally/,"We've been together for a little over two years, been living together for 10 months. We've been together through the loss of a baby, a literal gang rape, long distance, etc. I was so deeply in love with him even when all that was happening. I couldn't wait to see him on skype every night for hours and hours, and was more than willing to spend hundreds of dollars on VIA train tickets for the year we were long distance, sometimes opting to pay for a first class seat if all the economy class seats were taken, instead of waiting 'til the next day. However, since we started living together, I just want to bite his head off half the time and I have like -10 sex drive.

Take 30 minutes ago, for example. He just came home from work. I'm trying to study for a psychology exam tomorrow morning. He jumped up on the bed and rubbed his face in my back, trying to be cute I guess, and all I could do was turn and give him a quick smile because if I let myself do anything else, I would have wound up saying ""can you fucking stop? You're not a cat."" He said he loved me, I said I loved him too. The movie I had to watch for class cut to commercial, I said ""you should go get some dinner for yourself, this is just going to be ads for a few minutes"". He said ""yeah, I will. Are you mad at me?"" I told him no I was just tired and had had a long day. He then says ""Are you sure you're not mad at me?"" Well now I fucking am! Of course, I don't say that though. Of course, I said no. He got up and, once at the bedroom door, in his sappiest voice goes ""I really do love you, you know"" and all I could bring myself to do was laugh/scoff, raise my eyebrows, nod, and say ""yeah, I know"".

I get so annoyed with hearing this incredibly sappy bullshit ALL the time. Like, he tells me he loves me 15 times a day. I'm told I'm ""(his) everything"" at least once every other day, along with ""if I didn't have you my life would be horrible,"" ""I don't want to think of what life would be like without you,"" ""you're my world,"" ""I can't wait to marry you,"" ""[insert something about our future children/marriage],"" ""I missed you so much today, did you miss me?"". I get annoyed at all of them. I feel trapped. About 75% of my heart already has one foot out the door of this relationship but the other 25% is staying and I honestly don't even think it's out of love but I don't flinch when I tell him I love him. Does that mean I'm lying but don't want to admit it to myself? Does that mean I really love him but the love doesn't outweigh the negatives of the relationship?

I understand that I have my own flaws as a partner. I'm not intimate often enough, but that's partially because I'm fucking depressed and stressed all the time, I never get enough sleep (he practically knees me out of bed every night), he never lets me know that he finds me sexually appealing unless I ask if he does, and I kind of mother him and he totally lets me and (let's be real) nobody with a healthy mind wants to sleep with someone who they half-view as a child they have to take care of. I understand I can be a bit controlling with my money and I try to control his too, but that's because I'm literally out of money for the rest of the month already because I spend it literally all on groceries and other necessities, I can show you my bills if you don't believe me, (I don't even have money to buy simple christmas gifts for my family) and he's fucking acting like it's the end of the world when I ask for grocery money, despite the fact that he doesn't pay off his debts, he doesn't pay for school, he doesn't pay for a phone bill (because he fucking uses my phone that my mom has to pay for because I can't afford to pay it myself, he got kicked off his phone plan for racking up debts), all he does is pay his portion of rent and utilities and some groceries if I beg him to do it. It's not that I want to control him or his money, I just want him to help me out financially. He's stolen money from me once before for cigarettes, and taken huge chunks of money from his portion of savings for first/last on the apartment we're supposed to start renting in two months. All he ever does is talk about paintball, or bitch about our roommates, or bitch about work. Everything is always someone else's fault. He can't even commit to doing something small, like throwing out a goddamn bedbug-ridden comforter and pillow despite the fact that I'm beyond allergic to those bugs! He refuses to stand up for himself to friends, work, anything, but then turns around and bitches about how he gets treated. I make dinner for us, and good dinners too, every single night but apparently that doesn't count as contributing to housework?  I've gotten so sick of the lack of thanks I get for putting in an hour of my time into the kitchen, I've just stopped making meals for two if he's at work later than 8:30 (I used to make a good meal and save his portion for when he got home, reheat it for him, sit with him, try to get him to talk about his day or anything at all for that matter). He doesn't seem to understand nonverbal communication. Like... at all. I understand women are naturally more in tune with that, but last night I asked him to pass me (MY) grey pillow from HIS side of the bed, because apparently he needs three pillows and I only need one or whatever the reason was that he took it, and he was like ""yeah sure"" but then he let out this exasperated sigh and basically slammed the pillow against my stomach. I was like ""Um... what's up your butt?"" and he was totally clueless as to what he did.

I get annoyed when he says he loves me too much or makes sappy comments. I get annoyed when I come home from my internship and he's been home all day and nothing's been done and he's napping. I get annoyed when he naps in general (that might be jealousy, I can't sleep during the day). I get annoyed when he says things in baby-speak (ex. my mom and I have always jokingly called wet cat food ""stinky food"", he heard us say that one night and now he always calls it ""stinkies""). I get annoyed when he talks too much at night and he knows I have to be up in the morning. I get annoyed when he talks too loud. I get annoyed when he finally initiates intimacy but goes straight to touching my lady bits and/or just starts kissing me really hard and then immediately trying to fuck. I get annoyed when he whines about a mess but then refuses to clean it up. I get annoyed when he whines about a pain but refuses to go to the doctor (despite this pain being a constant thing since the day I met him). I get annoyed when he tries to correct me to say ""our cat"" when I say ""my cat"" (oh... our cat? The one I pay every vet bill for? The one I've spent $600 on in he past 4 months for vet bills and medication? The one I buy 9/10 food bags for? The one I brush daily? The one that I saw at the shelter and demanded to get ""that cat"" instead of any gifts on my 16th birthday? The one I've had for 5 years and you've been living with for 10 months? That cat?). I get annoyed when he talks about marriage. I get annoyed when he talks about our future kids. It's gotten to the point where I can hear someone coming up the stairs and I hope it's not him.

Sorry, I know it sounds like I'm venting and in a way I sort of am, but I want you guys to see into my head. Am I crazy? Am I some coldhearted emotionless bitch? Is he actually fucking annoying? I don't even know what to think. I was raised by a very strong single mother, I kind of wonder if that has something to do with being annoyed by the very needy things he says (ex. ""you're my everything"" I was taught to always be my own everything and allow other people to become a part of it but never become all of it)? I don't even know what to do, guys.. help....

**TL;DR- everything boyfriend says or does pisses me off. I feel he's very immature when it comes to spending and when it comes to his nonverbal communication. I am frustrated with his sort of victim-identity. I can't even stand to hear the sappy lines that he says every damn day. I'm annoyed by ""I love you""s and often fantasize about living just me and my cat in a 1 bedroom apartment. I don't know what's going on with me though because, when I do say that I love him, I don't feel doubt or that I'm lying. Help!!!**"
3x1mv1,4,2015-12-16,Abusive relationships,vcardthrow1,ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/3x1mv1/abusive_relationships/,"eta: This is a rant. It is both a relationional post, and a rant. 

I think my mother is diagnosible for BPD and has been probably since I was 15. She says I've been a demon child that hated her since age 8, since I got close to my grade school teacher. I am asking if you folks relate, and going to tell you what's been torturing me for the last five years. I am trapped with this person financially because I live with my parents and as my mother and I get older, the abuse naturally gets worse/harder to take. 
------------------

I know I've written too much about her but I think the worst part of being FA is characterized by my relationship with my mother. 

No matter how ugly I felt, how depressed, how scary things were, how isolating acne or being a shitty student was, there is NOTHING, literally no problem so bad she couldn't make it worse. It's so bad getting it out in the world and coming home to a viper's nest. 

She's probably about as abusive as her own miserable, perpetually aggrieved, slightly mentally ill, manipulative, hysterical, sadistic Irish Catholic mother was. 

I spent my whole life doing whatever she asked and what it got me was being unemployed, the object of contempt--I am so fucking untouchable my friends could not help me find work if they wanted to--and my entire life is the sparse not-livable jobs I get babysitting and cleaning. 

I want to tell them what happened and they'd laugh at me. Or feel disgusted by me. They'd agree with her, they'd say, well your mother called a lazy dumb piece of shit when she saw it and picked the best solution.

And there are honestly some days I'm tired, or sick. Today it was an MRI, work and picking up work clothes. 

I think the best my life is will be with a horrible job, working 12 hours a day making $10/hour, dead on my feet, crying from exhaustion, no friends, no personal life, and whenever I am home, it'll just be her screaming at me, blaming me for being a ""feeb"", living with my fucking mother until she has to be put into a home and I will have to take care of this horrible old woman, but that's going to be the rest of my life--instead of living away from her or with a sibling because I can help pay rent, instead of distance--my whole life belongs to her. 

It is no longer affordable to live a decent commute from Manhattan, where most of the jobs are, unless you can pay 1,200/month and live with roommates.

I think I will die making less than 18,000. That's all she thought I was worth.

She takes the $200/month or so I earn from babysitting, even though she's retired and lives on my father's dime--a parasite, like me.

I feel like that's really who I am and who every one sees, and that pathetic piece of shit little overgrown baby that literally went to graduate school because my mother said I was too stupid to find a job so I might as well teach little kids (something I never wanted to do--she said I was a negative piece of shit who ""HATES EVERYTHING"", but that's not how someone looks for work)--I couldn't finish the graduate program and the state changed all my certification exams. I never really get away from her. Even as a solid adult--22, 23, 24, 25, 27--I made STUPID decisions and timed them out of fear. Leave the house without telling I'm going because she'll attack me when I leave and attack me when I can back,  yell, scream, demand my money, demand to know why I'm working without telling her when I leave, demand to know where I'm going--it is not to keep me safe. She wants to push me to find more babysitting work. 

I hate this work. Sometimes I leave the apartment to go sit in the park to be alone. Sometimes I go to the dermatologist--and it takes fucking two hours to see the c*nt doctor ten minutes. But it's time where she thinks I'm making her money. ""You're a loser. You're lazy. You contribute nothing. You're going to be a drag on your brothers.""

I am in part because I was stupid and chose history as a major and was too fucked in the head to know how to find an internship, but nobody warned me about resumes, interviews, or that leaving college without work experience would seal my fate so she could force me into something she thought low enough for me. 

From the time she wakes up in the morning till the time she goes to bed at night it's like nursing an ulcer being around her. 

My Dad went along with it--I'll admit it, I hate him for it. But a father shouldn't need to defend a kid from a mother. That's not normal. 

I usually think of the women here as accomplished or with decent relationships with their families, if no one else...but can anyone relate? 

That truly is the worst part of this--that...betrayal. It's tickle torture--being mocked, and humiliated, and invaded under my skin, into my brains and organs and memories. I've never masturbated because I can't lock a door to cry, jerk off, or do anything else. If I DID ever date a man I could never bring him home because with age she's become deeply religious and would use it as evidence I was a slut going to hell. 

If he hit me or raped me she'd both turn it into something that happened to HER, and proof I was both stupid and bad--as she's known her whole life. Deserving. 

Having the person that forced me into life....I feel like she's an angry, miserable witch who cursed me with the self-fulfilling prophecies not just of her ugly face, her acne, her own miserable adolescence and young adulthood--but failure. Everybody sees an miserable, stupid person, and I feel like one. I hate being around people; I'm emotionally and experientally half my age. 

She yelled and screamed at me today because I felt too tired and shitty to do the dishes and ripped out my laptop cord and threatened to hit me. I'm 29. 

I know I shouldn't be living here. I'm living here because my Dad lets me. She ruined my relationship with him too. 

I can honestly say I daydream about her dying of a heart attack or getting hit by a car like you dream about an abusive husband dying or a lifelong affliction finally being cured. I would still be a piece of trash, ugly, acne-ridden, plagued with chronic fatigue and pain, and illness--but I would get to define my days, my moods. It would be quiet in this apartment.

I would take care of my dad until he died, and my brother. And we'd live in relative peace. 

Can anyone relate? I think of being FA as a host of things--lack of love and the sense one is unlovable, despite the human being you try to be on your good days, being too ""ugly"", too weird, too mentally ill for the normal things that make being alive worth living, like the experience of having loved returned; lack of companionship or worth to others; inability to feel pretty or valued as a result; socially and romantically isolated; and on some level, unable to control one's own happiness. Relationship-ineffectual.

But this--this drove a lot of it. Bad genes, inheriting her repulsive, manly face, and having this as the woman in my life. There is no trial too big that she can't pour on bitterness--and it has always been this way.

If someone asked me what sentiment I'd use to describe our dynamic, it would be perpetual humiliation and coercion. I would be a fucking 25 year old coerced like a bad, stupid 10 year old being punished. 

Can anyone relate at all, with an abusive father, mother, relationship or family?

She abused my father, wailing and screaming, a little angry baby in an old crone's body. That's who she is as a mother, and that's their marriage. 

My wish that she would die gets worse with each fight, and as the realization I am never going to be able to afford to get away from her for good grows. 

I'm sorry and I know it's ugly but really--it makes suicide look like unlocking bloody, rusty chains. Relief from being burnt and eaten alive.

I lost a part of myself during our seven years together. I lost my spark, my spunk, my self respect, and my self esteem. You've made me feel ugly, prude, old, ashamed, worthless, psychotic. You made me feel all these terrible adjectives that linger in the back of my mind and only show their face when I feel confident again. You made me feel all these terrible things, but my heart still holds on to the late night dances in the parking lots, the early morning cuddles, and the thrill of being young and in love. 

I hate that I carry war wounds from this relationship, and you just get that ""Hey. I cheated and feel really bad about it so it'll never happen again"" disclaimer.  I hate that your excuses were that I was never there (I lived two floors below you), that I worked too much, went to too many meetings, participated in too many long-distance internships. Fuck you for telling me that this was my fault. Fuck you for telling me that a penis isn't personal.

I hate that every time I mentioned grad school, graduation, life- you told me to not worry and we could figure it out, BUT WE NEVER DID. I hate that you told me that I should have just brought it up again, or planned it out myself. I hate that I let you hold me back. I hate that I waited for you. 

I hate that when you noticed you were going to lose me,  when I was finally done waiting, you tried to put effort into the relationship.

I hate that you never wanted me. I hate that I always wonder why I wasn't good enough, pretty enough, sexy enough, friendly enough? I hate the fact that you are my person. 

I hate that every time I try to pull myself up by the bootstraps and move forward, you choose that moment to message me and bring me back to the floor. 

I'm done. I'm over the Facebook posts, the snaps, the texts, the steam messages, and the calls. I am done allowing you to bring me down. I am done making excuses for you as a friend, a boyfriend, and everything in between. I deserve more, I always have. 

You were a shitty first love, John, but I am not going to allow you to be my only love..

Fuck you.

3x1smg,4,2015-12-16,What would be a good company to begin my career/work towards my ideal job? (Details inside),alexh36,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3x1smg/what_would_be_a_good_company_to_begin_my/,"Hi everybody. I'm having trouble pinpointing what exactly the title of my job would be, and if there's even a place where I could do such a thing but I figured I'd make a post to see if someone with a greater level of knowledge surrounding the subject would be able to shed some light. Here goes:

I began working in restaurants at the age of 15 and have held jobs at probably 8 different companies since (now 23). I started off cooking and had intentions of becoming a chef before deciding management may be a better career route. As a result, I started college as a hospitality major with the goal of opening up my own restaurant. Throughout my time working in restaurants, I realized that management on a single store level really wasn't for me, so I switched to operations management and marketing. Though I strayed away from a major that was directly associated with food, it has been my passion since I was a kid and I really hope to find a career surrounding it. I recently had an internship as a sales analyst for a CPG company and I thought a job with proximity to food would keep my interest, but in reality it couldn't have been more distant to what I'd like to be doing.

The job that I've envisioned in my mind is a sales/distribution job that would sell to restaurants - something akin to Sysco, but preferably working with products that are going to require a higher level of expertise and knowledge to work with. Essentially I'd rather be selling Wagyu beef to The French Laundry than strip steaks to Fridays.

There are numerous questions I have surrounding this: What type of entry level job will put me on a path to be doing something of this sort or perhaps even lead to a collection of knowledge adequate to open up my own distribution company? What are the skills necessary to succeed in a field like this and might it be better if I began in something completely different to develop a business acumen? What are some companies that I might want to look into?

I would greatly appreciate any input and if anyone has a job similar to what I've described I'd love to know your story.

If anybody else has a job that they've envisioned for themselves, but aren't exactly sure if it exists or what path they should take to achieve their goals, feel free to share your story in the comments. Maybe we can get a mega thread going and I'd love to see what others in this stage of their life are contemplating."

3x28ng,4,2015-12-16,Choosing small SF startup versus Big Four company?,grid_zeroSolver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x28ng/choosing_small_sf_startup_versus_big_four_company/,"So i recently got intern offers from two different companies I’d really like to work at. One is a Big Four company and the other is a small SF startup (Think Unicorns but not necessarily private still). How the heck do I evaluate these two offers? Benefits and pay are similar and I am going for an internship. 

Here are the pros and cons:

Big Company
Pros:
-Work on software the impacts billions
-Great name on resume (Big Four)
-Established intern program with great events
-Meet great connects
-Easy return offer process. (Don’t need to re-interview).

Cons:
-Make less of an impact in company as a whole
-Parts of codebase can be 20+ years old
-Potential to be put on bad project
-Not as “cool” as some hip young startup

Neutral:
-Work in C++ when most of background is in Java and higher level languages. But this could be seen as a pro because it'd raise my skill level at C++. (Currently I don't think I like C++ but i might change mind after internship).
-Don't live in SF


Small Company
Pros:
-Really believe this technology is the future
-Small culture means bigger impact and get to see more of decision making process
-Apt in SF
-A lot of cool scalability and distributed systems problems I am interested in.
-Use java and modern tech stacks.
-“Hip”

Cons:
-Idk how good the ""name brand"" is. it isn’t airbnb or uber and other unicorns/recently-ipo’d companies may not have that same reputation.
-Doesn't have long established intern program
-Small number of interns = less possible connects

Neutral:
-Already IPO’d so no big cashout, but still small and IMO has much room to grow.


Final Notes:

-At both companies I could work on scalability problems that I am really interested in, but I expect the smaller place will have more interesting and modern tech stack. I guess the smaller company would be more in line with my past internship and research.
-Not sure if I want to work at either company full time so I am really looking to maximize my job opportunities for when I graduate."

I have a Bachelor's degree in neuroscience (subjects ranging from behavioral psychology to molecular biology) and will finish a 2-year Master's degree in molecular neuroscience (consisting mostly of internships) next summer. I'd like to work at the interface between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, but am having a hard time finding any info about that field. From what I can tell, neuroscientists and computer scientists seem to have largely ignored each other's work since the advent of the artificial neural network in the 1950's.

Is there a program which combines these two, anywhere in the world? Or should I go back and get a Bachelor's degree in computer science or artificial intelligence before moving on? I have good programming skills and experience with analysis of large data sets, but am lacking in advanced theoretical knowledge of things like machine learning.

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!"

3x2osi,2,2015-12-16,Leave a guaranteed CS job in UK for a career in US?,throwthrowaway5234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x2osi/leave_a_guaranteed_cs_job_in_uk_for_a_career_in_us/,"So a bit of context.. I'm a UK student and I've completed two internships at one of the largest IT companies in the world. I've come out with guaranteed employment once I complete my degree in the summer. I'd like to think my CV is better than average because of my internships and experiences that I've had during them, including a couple patents and publications. The department at the company that I'll be going to is not guaranteed, but there is a high chance that it could be one that I would love to work in, and essentially be doing what I love on a daily basis for a higher than average salary (£30k with the big bonus of not working in London). I've asked the company about a transfer between UK and US, but the two units are pretty much separate entities, making this kind of opportunity not possible. They would require me to apply to the US division as an external candidate.

&amp;nbsp;

My areas of interest are primarily around IoT, emerging technology, and site reliability. I preferably want to work in an area that is focused more on developing a product rather than maintaining existing corporate software. All of my interest and experience in these areas are from work experience, personal projects, and my dissertation.

&amp;nbsp;

Now for the conflict.. My girlfriend is American, currently pursuing her Master's degree here in the UK and is only allowed to stay on her current visa until a few months after she graduates unless she can get a job with a company that would sponsor her work visa. So far, she has applied to a handful of companies that are capable of doing so, but has not been successful, and the remaining options are running out quickly. A common solution that we hear all the time is ""Why not get married?"", which sounds great on paper (and to us!) for resolving these problems, but there are certain financial requirements that I must meet before she would legally be allowed to stay. One of these requirements is earning slightly above £18K (before tax) in the last year, or have over ~£60k in savings. If I were to begin my job early, say in July, I would be able to qualify for these financial requirements in about 6-8 months, depending on over time work etc. Requirements in the USA on the other hand are much easier to meet.. We can have a sponsor that can be legally responsible for me until I am financially stable, and there is a fraction of the waiting time for the visa to be processed in comparison to the UK system. Her family members are more than willing to sponsor me in the process, but my biggest concern is how successful I would be in finding a job in the States. I'm also under the impression that CS career, culture, and opportunities are much greater in the States than they are in the UK, which is a large proponent for moving, since it would benefit me throughout my career to have a larger range of opportunities and inspiration to draw from.

&amp;nbsp;

While I may have work experience, and a CS related degree (Web Development with C Programming), I have no knowledge or experience with Algorithms and Data Structures; two things that are very common to see on job requirements these days. In addition to this, my programming skills aren't amazing, but I like to think that I can pick up new things quickly, and am more than capable of learning on the job.

My programming languages are primarily:

JavaScript

AngularJS

PHP

Python

C/C++

HTML/CSS

&amp;nbsp;

To an extent, I feel as if I've got it made with my current job arrangement since I've already got my foot in the door and they don't require anything further from me other than attaining a 2:1 in my degree. My fear is that because of my shortcomings in CS, I wont be able to find a development job in a similar area, especially in a foreign country. Every day, we hear stories about university graduates that are more than qualified unable to find a job, which makes me think that it would be ridiculous to leave what I have. 

&amp;nbsp;

Having only worked in a large corporation, I don't know if I would prefer a startup or corporate environment, so I am open to both options.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple options that we've considered are:
 
For me to work these 7 months are then we can apply for her visa, having met the financial requirements. This would be a long waiting game as well; visa applications can take between 6-12 months to process, and long distance ain't fun.

Do long distance for 2 years while I complete my graduate program, and then go to the US.

&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, my questions are:

&amp;nbsp;

Am I being stupid for leaving this guaranteed job for uncertain employment in the US?

&amp;nbsp;

Would my other qualities, skills, and experience offset my lack of CS knowledge?

&amp;nbsp;

Are CS-related jobs (i.e. SWE, SRE) in the States ""easy"" to come by?

&amp;nbsp;

What considerations should I take in to account if I choose to head over the pond?

&amp;nbsp;

Is there anything else that I haven't thought of, or is unclear?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks!

3x2wkt,3,2015-12-16,I [25/F] have been talking with my friend [24/M] for a few months now. Unsure of what we're becoming.,throwawillthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3x2wkt/i_25f_have_been_talking_with_my_friend_24m_for_a/,"Hi everyone. I would just like some advice and opinions on what's been happening in my life. As a straight 25 year old female who has never had a relationship or anything even in the vicinity of that whole realm (read: yes, virgin), I'm pretty clueless about these things and incredibly shy, but only when it comes to that sort of stuff.

So I've been pretty school and career-oriented lately and part of my grad school's curriculum are a few networking events for the industry. When I started grad school a year ago, I met a guy. We exchanged business cards as he had done an internship at the same company as me at the same time (it's a big company and we did not know each other even existed). 

Fast forward another year after just becoming platonic social media friends and I posted a picture I took on instagram, lamenting that I'd never been to the piano bar nearby. He comments and says we should go one day soon as he never has either. We set a day and time, but end up walking around the park instead. It was really fun, we had a lot of great conversation and he said he wanted to do it again really soon. I should also mention that he lives in a place where I work seasonally, but do not live full-time. I do plan on moving down there as soon as I graduate from school as that will most likely be where I get a job. This time I was there for just the summer before school would be starting in mid-September. We first hung out maybe mid to late August.

He is very social in our industry and makes a ton of friends through networking that he actively hangs out with in town and over the course of the next few weeks before I left, we hung out maybe 7 or 8 times, sometimes just the two of us, sometimes with people from the industry he wanted me to meet. Every time it was platonic hanging out although just before the first time we hung out, I had a slight panic attack that this was a date and I didn't know how I felt about it at the time. Over the course of getting to hang out with him I had that hidden somewhere in the back of my head. The last day that I got to see him before leaving to go back to school, we hugged for a bit and that's probably about when the crushing started.

We texted semi-randomly throughout the 10 weeks I was in school. He would randomly send me some stuff on the happenings within our industry, ask my opinions on those things, or just send me pictures of stuff he thought I might like. As the end of my school semester got closer, we had a convention coming up that takes place back down in the town he is in. He would also be going to that convention as it is industry-wide and we made plans to see each other again. He seemed genuinely excited to be seeing me again soon and made sure to get the exact time I would be heading down.

That was a few weeks ago. After the convention ended, I had to head back up to pack and go stay with my parents for about two weeks before I would drive back down to his town to work at my seasonal job again for about two weeks. Unfortunately with the amount of work both of us were doing and him being in the middle of moving to a new place, we were only able to see each other on the last day of my visit.

So this is where it got interesting enough for me to be posting here, asking for advice. He texts me setting up a time and asks if I would be interested in seeing his new place as he is still putting the finishing touches right now before he has to be 100% moved out tomorrow. I head over and he gives me a tour. He asks if it is okay if we don't do the normal things we do together and I said I was fine with that as the temperature has been in the mid to upper 80s. After that, we end up driving to the small town about 10 minutes away that he says has a great little coffee shop he wants to show me. We get there and each order a coffee which he pays for. He's never done this before and so that crush in the back of my mind is jumping up and down for joy. I thank him profusely and we sit and have coffee for a little while. 

Once done, we walk around the town which has some cute things that he's seen before, but again, wanted to show me. It starts to downpour and so we book it back to his car where he mentions that he's getting hungry. I am too so we head to a place he suggests and he ends up sneakily paying for my dinner as well. Now I'm really starting to wonder if we're on a date and I didn't know it because every other time we've gone to eat or get coffee somewhere, we have always paid for our own. Then we head back to his place again where he introduces me to his roommates who are now home. We sit for a while, talking and playing around with his roommate's BB-8 droid that is controlled by phone. By this time, we know there are fireworks going off across the lake he lives on and he, his roommate, and I head out to the boat house to watch them. We sit next to each other and it's really really nice. After that, we head back to his apartment when it's time for me to leave (I have a long drive home the next day and still need to pack!). 

We both seem sad for me to go and he walks me to my car in the driveway where his next-door neighbors are unfortunately out washing their cars (at 10pm at night....). We say goodbye and he hugs me for a bit and then I leave pretty confused about that day.

So I'm pretty interested in hearing others' opinions on what the hell is happening with this guy. I'm so hesitant to just come out and say anything for a couple reasons. I'm pretty shy and inexperienced when it comes to this stuff and I think he is as well. He's also a colleague in my industry so I'm not even sure if this is the best idea to have a chance at ruining a good friendship and networking relationship by making things awkward by just asking if he wants to go out on a for-real date. Thank you in advance for your opinions!
   
**tl;dr**: Friend in my future work industry payed for my coffee/food/etc. when we last hung out together. Is it becoming something more than platonic friends or am I just reading too much into his nice gestures?"

(What my transcript looks like: http://imgur.com/iYWg8gD ) (I've got a school profile that has been sent to all colleges basically detailing the rigor of the courses I've taken in high school, which are on par with AP courses apparently)

**Awards:**

* I participated in a bunch of National Olympiads through high school. In the 11th grade, I was in the top 10 in the country for a Computer Science Olympiad. (Topped state)
* I also was in the top 4% in India for the other subjects' Olympiads. (Math, Science and English)
* I'm the head of Tech/Comp. Sci quiz team(yeah, that IS a thing) in my school and we've won many inter-school quizzes.

**ECs:**

* Part of the quiz club in my school.
* Played varsity basketball all 4 years.
* Participated in the First Lego League(a robotics competition) in the 9th and 10th grade. Play piano recreationally(learnt professionally for 4 years).
* Was a teacher at a disabled school(taught them basic Math and English)
* Interned at an IT start-up last summer.

Schools: UMich-Ann Arbor(EA), Purdue(RD), Rutgers(EA), UCLA, UCSD, UC Irvine, UC Davis(all UCs are RD), UW(RD), UT Austin(RD), UMass Amherst(EA)



I've got glowing rec letters from my boss at my internship and my Computer and Physics teachers in school and kick-ass essays. It's the SAT score that really freaks me out."
3x3x47,1,2015-12-16,What minimum monthly income do I need for a used car loan?,needacar8781,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3x3x47/what_minimum_monthly_income_do_i_need_for_a_used/,"I'm 28, live at home, go to school full-time and work part-time as an engineering intern.  On the days I work, I take my dad's car which means that my mom is left at home without transportation.  Public transportation in the suburb I live in is nonexistent, and biking to work isn't an option because I work ~30 mi away from my house.  I need a reliable, fuel-efficient car ASAP because I don't make enough to pay for big repairs or tons of gas.

I started this job in September and because of my schedule this semester I was only able to make $800/month for the past 3 months.  I have $4800 from my financial aid saved up for a down payment on a car + registration/insurance/etc. and I'm looking into auto loans.  I'm looking for something reliable with decent gas mileage in the &lt;$7k price range, and if I put $3000 down and finance at 8% (2.5x the interest rate advertised by local credit unions due to my shitty credit), my monthly payment will come in around $90/month.  

My credit score is low and I think this is because I've never had a credit card.  I've already applied at two different local credit unions and was told by both that I need a co-borrower.

**Pertinent Info**

* Full-time student
* Part time intern, make $800/month from internship
* Total savings available for down payment/insurance/registration/taxes: $4800
* Credit score from CreditKarma: 617 (Transunion), 552 (Equifax)

**Monthly Expenses**

* Cell phone: $80 (this is on a family plan)
* Utilities: $50
* Internet: $50
* Groceries: $200
* Gas: $200 (filling up my dad's gas-guzzler once a week)

Should I ask my parents to cosign on a car loan?  Given my expenses and my income, it'll take me ~2 years to save up enough to buy a car with cash.  I'm not sure what my options are here."
3x406l,1,2015-12-16,An advice seeking post from a /r/LSAT and /r/lawschooladmissions veteran.,Ewwbullterd,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/3x406l/an_advice_seeking_post_from_a_rlsat_and/,"Hello all:

Basic background: I've taken the LSAT twice. Went from 157-166. It took me a while but I really got a good understanding from the test and slightly underperformed on the second take. I didn't really study for the first one.

I signed up and planned to retake the test in December but time slipped by, I took on other responsibilities, and didn't get a chance to continue studying. Really hate myself for that. I'm extremely confident that I could hit a 170 or above if I took the time to study again. A couple weeks after my second take (October 2015), I took  an LG and LR section timed and did really, really well, on par or better than where I was for October. I did some RC untimed and did well as well, but that was untimed.

Now I'm in the process of sending in apps. I need to finish up my personal statement and update my resume and I'm ready to go. My GPA and LSAT are likely enough to get me into my local Tier 1. It's a school that I can commute to, has decent employment, and has a ton of lawyers in the local legal community as alumni. It's got decent big law numbers (which I'm not aiming for) and pretty good clerkship numbers (which I am aiming for), I work for an attorney in the area and have great connections. On several occasions the attorney I work for has stated that I could come back here and work when I graduate. While it's not an ironclad offer, it is something that I am extremely sure will be available upon graduation, however, it would be a sort of ""hanging my own shingle"" deal within the firm, and I would likely be a partner right off the bat (small firm so not too much weight in this). The GPA and LSAT put me above both 75% for the school, so I'm looking at great scholarship money, hopefully full ride.

Here's what I'm struggling with though: I know I can score better. People around me like family, girlfriend, attorneys I work for, etc, think that I'm insane for even entertaining a retake back for the December test. But when I think about it, I really, really wish I had kept grinding. When I think about the test right now, I get nervous and anxious, because I know that I can score higher but don't really know if it's worth it. I've taken two years off already and really would have preferred to be in school already. And honestly, even if I scored better, I think that I'd take the full ride at my local Tier 1 over acceptance at a T14 or small scholarship at a T14. So I don't know if it's actually worth it.

I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance from others that I've taken the right path. I applied with my 157 and would have been looking at big debt from not so great schools. Now I'm in a position to go to any of my states schools, almost all of which are highly respected here, with great scholarship offers. But part of me really wants to study my ass off and do really well on the test. Like I said, I may not even attend any of the T14s I may get into over the full ride, but it's just who I am to want to do as best as I can. 

Anybody been in a similar situation? What did you do? Were you happy with what you did?

And something that isn't related to this is the GRE. How similar is it to the LSAT for those of you who have taken it? For the record, I'm all in on law school. I've worked for attorneys now for many months, I've done internships in law offices, etc. I've made sure that this is what I want. But I've also wanted to try my hand at that and see how well I do and what options I'm looking at. I'm extremely lucky I caught these subreddits before I accepted a law school offer a couple years ago and that I'm even in a position to consider the options. 

If you read this, thanks!

3x40bx,5,2015-12-16,Lessons learned this year as a solo founder (x-post r/startups),StartupStroke,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3x40bx/lessons_learned_this_year_as_a_solo_founder_xpost/,"I first posted this in r/Startups but felt like it could be of help to some other wantrepreneurs/starting entrepeneurs as well. 

Most of the things I have learned in the past 3-4 years have come from others sharing their knowledge, so I’d like to see this as a small way of giving back. It is mainly focused at starting entrepeneurs or want-to-be-starting entrepeneurs, but others might get something out of it as well. 


These are some of the lessons I have learned as a solo founder so far. Honestly, it has been a heck of a ride and I can’t wait to see what will happen in 2016. By most definitions I don’t run an insane business; but the growth in customers is great and the monthly (recurring) revenue is growing month after month. 


Starting a startup or business is one thing, but doing it solo is a whole other thing. It’s covering every single aspect that you have to cover for your business. Developing your product, marketing it, collecting leads, sending cold mails, calling potential clients, thinking about finding employees, doing taxes, closing deals, administration, and a whole lot more. You can hire employees at some point, but at the start 100% of the work is yours.


**Use your close network**

But being a solo founder doesn’t mean you have to do it all by yourself. There are a lot of people around you that are willing to help. Some want to help and want to get paid in return, others don’t need to get paid at all. Family and friends will offer their help. Family will usually do it for free, friends are willing to work for a small payment. Look around at the people you know, and just tell them what you are doing. Don’t expect everybody to be extremely excited, but some will find the idea good enough to offer their help.


**Develop your product without your own limiting thoughts**

It’s a huge struggle to cover every aspect of your business. It starts out with developing a product people actually want. And there are only limited ways to find out what that product looks like. A product may look great in your eyes, but you’re not your own customer; you’re just you. 


Go out and talk to customers. Go to some Meetups and just talk to people. Ask how they’re solving the problem you want to fix right now. Then ask them for anything that they struggle with. In my market a lot of companies hire a freelancer to do what I offer but struggle giving the right instructions and information. Or they hire a new employee and pay twice as much as they would with my product. So I developed my product in a way that solves this pain. And the product is never done; it is constantly in development to create a better version.


**Should you find a co-founder?**

You are constantly on the watch for potential co-founders, but at the same time nobody seems right. And that’s a huge problem that is caused by the fact that you actually don’t know what you are looking for. You’re looking for a co-founder that is almost a twin of you, because you yourself know what it takes. But it’s important to get out of that box. 


Once you realize you actually have to look for someone with almost entirely different qualifications it gets a lot easier. Don’t find someone that already understands every aspect of your product and market. Find someone that helps you think outside of the box - because you are most-likely stuck in your own box.


**Working at a coworking space**

A co-working space is a great location to find potential clients and get help with growing your business. I hired a desk at a local startup co-working space and signed a deal the first week and had another 2 potential deals lined up. After a few months at this co-working space a student with sales experience came in. This student has had a huge influence on my sales skills, the way I did my proposition and the amount of deals I sign. With every single deal I sign today I still thank him - if I didn’t meet him I wouldn’t have signed 90% of the deals I sign today.


**If you don’t grow, your business won’t grow either**

Getting out of your comfort zone is one of the hardest parts as a solo founder. If you have multiple founders you can just tell each other to “shut the fuck up and fucking do it already”. But as a solo founder you have to tell yourself that every. single. day. From the moment you get out of bed till you go into bed exhausted at night: you just have to shut the fuck up and fucking do it already. Because if you don’t, your business will never grow.


**Set your goals and stick to them**

Dreaming about what your business can be one day is a very important aspect. Sure, the future changes every day. And it’s never going to be the way you want it to be. But it’s important to set a goal for yourself. You don’t have to remind yourself every single day; it gets boring at one point. But it is important to just take your time once every 2 weeks or once a month and see if you are still on track with your ultimate goal. 


Just take a goal that seems plausible and actually excites you. Money can be a goal, having 20 employees can be a goal, growing internationally can be a goal, X amount of customers can be a goal. Just take a goal and stick to it. It’s never going to be as fast as you want it to be. Sure, it would be great to be a millionaire in a year. But the truth is: you won’t be a millionaire in a year. You won’t have 20 employees in a year, or 10000 customers. But that doesn’t mean you can’t work your ass off to get as close to that goal as possible.


**Celebrate your wins**

Celebrating your wins is important as well. Yeah it’s easy to feel bad the whole time because you didn’t hit your target this month. But if you hit 80% of the target you mostly succeeded. Occasionally take the time to celebrate a good month. Spend some money on yourself, buy some new clothes, grab drinks with friends, do something you’ve wanted to do in a long time. Because next month you will hit that target, and you can fully reward yourself.


**If you develop yourself, you develop your business**

As a single founder your business will be as good as you are. If you snooze that alarm 20 times than you are wasting your own business hours. Self-development is the only way to develop your business. Read, and never stop reading. Don’t just read the gems that everybody keeps talking about. Once in awhile just pick up a book that isn’t necessarily 100% related to where you are now. You will always get something out of it; maybe not today but something might click in a year from now. A lot of knowledge is just stored in our brain, but when we get into a situation that’s relevant to that knowledge your brain will connect it and you will greatly learn from it.


**Create a lifestyle that suits you**

You’ll read everywhere that you need to get a healthy lifestyle. I don’t think you have to stick to this 100%. Just find a lifestyle that you like and can stick to for a long time - and actually helps you be productive. Yes, alcohol don’t fit in a healthy lifestyle, but if I don’t get to relax with a drink with friends every now and then I know I will just get bored with life. 


**Breaks are not a waste of time - they are necessary**

Breaks are the sole reason you will never get stressed too much. I remember these weeks during the first few months of my company where I would work 80-100 hours, worked every single day of the week. Then one Sunday I wanted to take a break, and I didn’t even know what to do. 


It felt like I dropped off the world and just forgot how to have fun. I called up my dad and we ended up going to the lake: and all I could talk or think about was business. I couldn’t let go off it at all. This seems like a great thing, but I felt like an addict that needed his drug (work) every single moment of the day. I felt more stressed than I ever felt, looked like I didn’t sleep for days and had zero interest in anything else but work.


**Develop non-business related skills**

You can never skip a day developing yourself. You don’t always have to develop skills that are related to your business - I actually recommend not to. Find stuff you can do on the side. For me, it’s lifting with a friend 3 times a week and taking my Sundays to study biology and history. Find stuff that motivates you during the days you don’t work. 


**Get rid of distractions**

Develop a non distractive environment for yourself too. Earlier I was talking about the co-working space. This seems like a great place, but it can be distractive at times too. People will walk up to you with questions. The guy across from you will talk to you once in awhile. Don’t expect to be productive 100% of the time. But know that coworking spaces have a lot more advantages than disadvantages.


**Find a workday routine that works for you**

You should also find the perfect way to work productively. For me it was plugging my earphones in and just listen to Spotify for hours on end. Compile a playlist with your favorite music or just select a playlist on Spotify. For a long time I listened to my own playlist that consisted of 8 albums I really liked listening to. 


Eventually I started listening to the Lounge playlist on Spotify, it has a nice beat that just let’s me work productively. I am listening to it while I am typing this as well, it helps to keep my focus and to type at a relatively quick speed. Just find some good music and focus on stuff you have to do. 


**You have to cover everything - 100% of the work**

Being a solo founder means you have to cover every little aspect of your business. And it’s a shit ton of work. Here’s a list of things that I did this morning:
Find new ways to find new leads, look for these leads, compile a list of leads, find e-mail addresses of their CEOs, craft a good cold e-mail, schedule e-mails, wait for replies, counter sales objections by e-mail, call if it seems like the right time, counter sales objections on the phone, follow up with the right info, follow up if no response, sign pilots or deals, do after sales customer care, work for clients, find the right freelancer for the job, e-mail the freelancer with info, instruct the freelancer, call the freelancer, send more instructions, conference call with the freelancer and client, wait for freelancer to deliver, check if the product is good to send to the client, get feedback from the client, instruct the freelancer, wait for the freelancer, check the product again, send to the client, make sure the client is happy with the result, call the client, send the invoice, upsell to the client. 


And that’s just prospecting, lead generation, sales and delivery. And you are constantly looking for ways to make this easier, quicker and less stressful - which you definitely should!


During the day you are constantly wondering if you need to find a co-founder, but that will take a lot of time. So maybe it’s better to hire an intern? But that takes a lot of time too. So I should just get someone to work in-house, but it’s expensive and takes time. There’s a million questions going through your head constantly. 


**Find others to help you - they’re happy to**

But do know that out of the 100 things you do during the day there have been others that have done the same. And people are very willing to give advice to you. The startup community is a fantastic community to work in. Other founders are always happy to help, and to do a quick phone call if you need advice. Sometimes they even invite you for coffee at their office to meet them. 


I’m a relatively young founder, and a lot of older founders just want to help you. Because when they were your age they also had mentors. And whatever they say or however they help you: always follow up on them. Tell them how it’s going, send them a thank you note, send them a card for Christmas. They’ve taken their time to help you succeed. Sure, not every founder will give you the insights you want at that time, but in the end every successful founder will say something that might click years later. 


Just hit them up on Linkedin, send a request and ask if they are willing to help a new founder with some advice. 20% of them will happily take their time. That’s 10-15 minutes of highly valuable time for them, when they’re not working their asses off growing their business. And they are willing to spend it with YOU. Be grateful for that.


**Your business has to make money**

Get to profitability as soon as you can too. Sure it’s easy to just dump a ton of money (note: your own money!) into your business. But your money is likely limited. Find ways to earn money with your product. If it means you have to change your product then so be it. You’re not working your ass off to find the perfect solution for people, you’re working your ass off to be able to survive right now, and to help future employees survive. 


Make money, because it keeps your company alive. Yeah Facebook and Twitter never made a shit ton of money at the beginning. But you’re likely not building the next Facebook or Twitter. Making money is important, so try to make money from the first deal you sign. It doesn’t have to be a huge profit right away, you just need to find out if you can actually make money with your product and if the demand is big enough to build a solid business out of it.


**Should I get an investment?**

Finding investment will be a struggle too. I haven’t gotten an investment, but I am constantly thinking whether I should or not. Yes, the business is profitable. But it could be so much more profitable. You would have to give up a part of the business, and you’re not the sole owner anymore. There are other people that will influence the way your company runs. And they can just shut down if you’re not profitable enough. Try to get solid ground yourself first, and then look for an investment. 


And don’t just take any investment you can. Think about who is investing in you. Sure it’s great to have 100K from an investor to grow; but if that investor is not even closely related to your market all you have is a bag of money. 


Find investors that are well known in your market. Not only will they be more likely to invest (they know the market, so they know what’s likely to succeed), but they will critique your idea if it sucks - and you can use this to create a better product. Plus if they finally do invest in you they will have the knowledge, network and money to help you to keep growing. 


**Tools will help be more productive** 

Find the right tools to make your work easier, but make sure to do everything manually first. It’s easy to look for the quickest solution, but you will only know what you really need if you do it manually first. Right now I use 8-10 different tools for lead generation and cold emailing, and another 7 for things related to my product. Some of the tools I use:

* [Yesware](https://www.yesware.com/) for e-mail templates and tracking (Switching to Toutapp soon though due to Yesware yearly billing)

* [Streak](https://www.streak.com/) (CRM for Gmail)

* [Find that Lead](https://www.findthatlead.com)  (Find email addresses with just their first and last name and domain)

* Google’s Business Apps

* [Kimono Labs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) (Scrape specific info from web pages)


Make sure to look for alternatives for your tools every now and then. There are a ton of new alternatives coming out every month. Just check out Product Hunt every once in awhile and see if they have new tools for email tracking, new CRMs and more. Tools will significantly increase your productivity and will also help keep track of your work. Yesware helps me keep track of the open rate/response rate of different e-mail subjects. It’s a great tool to split-test your cold emailing.


**Don’t stick to your current way of working**

Always work on new ways to do your acquisition, marketing and other things. The first 4 months I highly focused on content marketing (without content promotion). This was before I heard about the 20-80 rule of content marketing: spend 20% of your time on the post and 80% on promoting it. I spent over 600 hours writing 100+ blog posts, yet I didn’t see much traffic from it. 


Because I focused on SEO in those articles I saw my traffic increase, but I could’ve gotten a lot more if I followed the 20-80 rule. Instead of content marketing I just focus on cold emailing now, as content marketing is something that will pay out later. Sure, it’s really cheap, but so is cold emailing. Re Strategize every now and then and find what works best.


**Always keep learning - find interesting sources to read**

Find some good blogs to read. You don’t have to follow every single article they publish, but when you search Google for specific information you will see a lot of the same sites pop up in that niche. When I started out in sales I found [Steli Efti’s blog](http://blog.close.io) a bunch of times. Some of his posts focus mainly on cold emails. 


I’m a huge fan of Steli Efti and his way of teaching. If you want some more motivation for sales make sure to check out [Close.io’s blog](http://blog.close.io) and [his daily motivational video’s](http://resources.close.io/salesmotivation) (60 seconds a day). Don’t forget to check out his YouTube video of [his talk at the Pioneers Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfKMsdI9wJM). You will definitely get something out of it. 


Steli has helped growing my business significantly. I email him once a month thanking him for being so open about his knowledge and thank him for the impact he has had on the monthly revenue. I can honestly say I wouldn’t be where I am today without people like Steli who share their knowledge for free. 

Some of the other blogs/sites/places that have helped me:

* [r/Startups](https://reddit.com/r/startups) obviously

* [Quora’s Growth Hacking](http://www.quora.com/Growth-Hacking)

* My local library

* [Rocketship Podcast](http://rocketship.fm)

**You’re going to need to do sales - even if you suck at it**


If you’re like me then sales can be a huge hassle (I didn’t have a lot of experience before). Get out of your comfort zone and just start calling people. At first it simply sucks. You might not even know what to say. This is where cold e-mailing helps. You send a bunch of emails asking a question specific to the problem you are solving. Make it a short e-mail, nobody’s going to read your 500 word cold email. Make it 2 sentences. Just write everything down and work it down to 2 sentences. It’s possible, just don’t pitch your product.


Let’s say you’re trying to sell Slack: send an email to the CEO asking what they are currently using for their communication. Just send 100s of emails (about 50-100 a day) and just watch the answers flow in. When they email you what they’re using, just pick up the phone and call them. Ask them some follow-up questions about their experience and just listen to what they’re saying. Everything they say is an argument for you to create the solution in their case. 


*Example:*
“We’re currently using a bunch of tools: e-mail, WhatsApp, some employees even use Facebook Messenger to talk to each other”. Follow-up with a question about how they keep an overview of it all. Changes are they aren’t, as they use too many tools. Then start your proposition: “We created a tool that has the perfect overview for your team. Employees can send private messages, but you can also create channels for certain projects.”


**An email signature will increase your conversion rate when cold emailing**

I have an e-mail signature with a small picture of my face, my phone number, and a link to my website. I created the signature with [WiseStamp](https://wisestamp.com) and it’s automatically added to any e-mail I send. When I send a cold email the biggest USP of my product is always clear in sight. Use something like “Slack - we make internal communication easier”. Most people will click on it and go to your landing page. If you use a short e-mail like I do (2 sentences) everybody will see that signature. Because there’s a picture added it looks a lot more trustworthy (although some people will block images from their e-mail client). 


**Don’t sell your product, sell the solution**

Cold e-mailing/calling isn’t about selling at first. You don’t know how to sell your product until you know what the pain points are in your potential customers business/life. You can only create a clear proposition if you know what they’re doing right now. Plus they’re much more open to a product when you describe it as a perfect solution. 


**It’ll be more satisfying than anything else**

Being a solo founder is a lot of work, but it’s a lot of fun too. Sure, the stress can wear you out. It can be a drag going into work every day, to send those e-mails, to make those calls. But if you’re not doing it then nothing will happen. If you want to create a successful business you have to get out of your seat and just work hard. 


It’ll be a struggle to create a new product, platform or service, and then growing it into a big business. But if it was easy somebody else would’ve done it already. You’re not in this game to have an easy life; you’re in it to work hard, to work your ass off every single day for minimal payment at first, so you can create a great company that you can be proud of for 5, 10 or 20 years, or even the rest of your life.


**Thanks r/Startups!**

Would love to hear about the experiences of other solo founders, and others. R/Startups has been a great resource of information for me in the last few months, so let me know if you got anything out of this."
3x42vz,5,2015-12-16,NMom is at it again and my brother's in the middle. Where to go from here?,The_Other_Lawnchair,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3x42vz/nmom_is_at_it_again_and_my_brothers_in_the_middle/,"Hey all!

First, I want to thank everyone on this sub for helping me on my journey of realizing that the relationship I had with my mother was not normal, okay, or even close to healthy. More importantly, you helped me realize I could do something about it.

--------------------------------------

Long story short, my mother and I have not spoken for about a year and a half. There was no NC letter, I just stopped speaking to her, leaving it kind of open. A few months ago, I sent her the following letter to try to close the door on this, one way or the other.

I'm including the full text of the letters below since I couldn't find any examples of where to even start when writing a letter like this to an N when I was trying to do this. Hopefully they'll be of help to someone in the same situation.

**TL;DR: Letter from me to NMom:** You exhibit narcissistic behavior. Here are some examples. My kids don't exist yet, but when they do, I don't want them around that. In order for me to feel comfortable in having you around them, all of this needs to change.

**TL;DR: Letter from NMom to Me:** I'm sorry you feel that way. Just forgive me already. Here, I'll infantilize you to make you feel better.

So, that exercise went nowhere.

Now, after several months of no contact, she's blowing my phone up again.

My youngest brother recently got an internship near me and he'll be moving into a spare room I have in my house for the next 6 months or so. NMom tried sabotaging this from the beginning -- ""they [wife and I] don't want you there, they're gonna get sick of you, etc."" -- but that didn't work.

Now the fear of her not being in control of him is sinking in, and she's using the excuse of helping him move down as a way to get back into my life and stay in his. He's driving himself down and really all he has is clothes. Somehow, she thinks she needs to drive down too since he'll have to car loads of stuff and help him move in.

This can't happen. I'm need your help!

I've thought about writing a letter, including explaining that he's not moving to the middle of nowhere and we do have things like food and water here. Then I realized that would be pretty stupid of me trying to reason with her.

My gut tells me to stay the course with this, ""if things don't change, you can't be in my life"" conversation I've already started that she's ignored, and parlaying that into that including moving my brother into my house. She's simply not welcome here.

Do you think that would be effective? What sort of things should I be on the lookout for? What happens when she ignores all requests and shows up at my door? I'm fine with kicking her out, but I'm more worried on the stress that would place on my brother.

Thanks in advance!

Full text of no contact -ish letters to and from NMom below:

Mom,

Over the past several months, it has become a weekly ritual for me to sit and stare at a blank sheet of paper, pen in hand, begging myself to write this letter to you. No matter how hard I tried, how many distractions I rid myself of, how much time and thought I put into the words I wanted to convey, how many therapy sessions I went to, nothing would come out.

I assume part of this is due to the extreme difficulty with which I face opening up to anyone in any context. I can remember one of our fights in the Fall before my wedding. I was finally able to tell you how I feel uncomfortable opening up to you and sharing things with you, and you told me, ""really? If you think that, then you're stupid."" There couldn't have been a more perfect response to validate my feelings.

I'm afraid this letter will fall on similar ears. However, I've come to realize that if this letter is dismissed or met with hostility, it is neither the fault of the pen, the ink, the paper, nor the writer. That realization, though seemingly small, is a major emotional stride I've made over these months.

There is not a single person in this world who has fought for my success more than you have. Ten years ago you helped me put together dozens of incredible college applications, and I got accepted to every one of them. Eight years ago, you helped me make my dream of studying abroad come true. Five years ago, you drove across the country with me to get me situated for grad school.

For all of these times, and the countless similar efforts inbetween, I am so appreciative. I know that I had done a terrible job of showing my appreciation for these things growing up, and for that I am sorry.

I'm now at a point in my life where considerations of children are occurring more and more frequently. Though they're still three or so years away, their best interests are already a constant consideration of mine. Where will we live? What schools will they go to? What financial steps to I need to take now to ensure I'm prepared? How can I make sure they enjoy a thoroughly loving relationship with their extended family, even though it is spread across the country in all directions? What relationship will they have with their grandmother?

I would love to be able to introduce them to the woman who would bend over backwards for her son. As a father, it would make me so proud to have such a grandmother for my children. 

But then I picture my kids playing in your living room when a fight breaks out -- one that is guaranteed to happen during any visit -- between you and dad, or [brother], or [adopted sister], or me. How could I expose them to the awful, hurtful things that you say in those fights, and the names that you call those who are supposed to be closest to you? How could I introduce them to such hostility? How could I teach them that this behavior and family dynamic is normal when I've spent hours in therapy over the past year learning -- now at 26 -- that it is far from normal?

What if my son was gay and you said the same things to him that you did to [brother - who is not gay but she thinks he is]? What if my daughter struggled with her weight and you gave her the same grief you gave [brother] about the healthy changes to his lifestyle? What if either of them were having relationship problems, and you told them ""nobody wants you,"" like you tell [adopted sister] about her family? How do you think that would make them feel?

Family is about much more than financial support or gift giving. There needs to be love -- complete and unconditional love. There needs to be a support system for the tough times that each of us go through, so that no one ever feels alone. 

In August I got a major promotion and am doing great things at work. In September, [wife] and I spent 11 days in the Czech Republic and Poland, and it was incredible. This week we bought our first house -- a dream home -- that's over 100 years old with a big backyard and in a great neighborhood near downtown Durham. We also just added another family member, [puppy], a 7 week old German shepherd mix. I have a truly incredible life, yet somehow I keep preventing myself from finding happiness in it. 

When I called you and told you that I was asking [wife] to marry me, you said, ""Okay....why?"" When I told you about the iPad I won, you yelled at me because I didn't automatically give it to you since you deserved one. When you had your court hearing, you spent the rest of the day yelling at us, your children, for a mistake you, an adult, made. When I was applying to and getting accepted to grad schools across the country, you gave me a guilt trip on how I was leaving and you weren't good enough for me to stay around, never accepting that [local school] simply wasn't the right place for me.

Not once, from the time I said I was asking [wife] to marry me, to the time we said our vows, did you have anything positive to say about our marriage. Here I was, your son, telling you that I had found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I was so happy to have her in my life, and I couldn't wait to marry her in front of our friends and family. Instead of being happy for me, you spent the next year and a half making the entire process all about you and making me feel awful for all of the ways I had offended you and disgraced our family. All I wanted to do was have a simple wedding where my friends and family just showed up, had a good time, and were genuinely happy for me, but that was too much for you to allow.

I can't remember the last thing that I accomplished that you celebrated instead of criticized. I want my children to be able to find and experience that happiness.

I want my children to know that they're in a safe environment when they're with family. I don't want them to ever have to worry about being kicked out of the house. I don't want them to have to walk home from miles away in the dark after you kick them out of the car. I don't want my children to learn that it's okay to yell at complete strangers -- waiters, clerks, or otherwise -- because they didn't get their way. I don't want my children to be told that their grandmother wishes they were dead, or considers them dead.

They don't need someone to buy them things. That's not what's important. They need the grandmother they deserve, and as of now, I can't be sure that's what they will receive. I know that I could never expose them to an environment or a person who could do such damage to them, and unless there are some significant changes, I don't know that I can do the same for myself.

This has been one of the toughest things I've ever had to do, but its something I care about very deeply. If you want to respond, that's great. If not, that's okay too. If so, please take your time and consider what you'd like to say. Writing a letter would allow for each voice to be heard without interruption, unlike a phone call or a text message.

I really hope that this letter inspires change within you.

--------------------------------------


Dear /u/The_Other_Lawnchair,

I'm not sure where to begin or exactly what to say in response to your letter. I'm not sure what you want or if I should say anything at all.

I will start by saying how much I truly love you, always have, and always will no matter what you think, say, do, or feel. You are first and foremost my son, and have always been one of the most important individuals in my life, whether you were living in the same house, state, or otherwise. All I have ever wanted for you was the best I could provide for you to have a great and fulfilling life and be a part of it. It would include the good, the bad, the happy, the sad, memorable, and loving, and everything else inbetween.

I am not going to give you reasons, excuses, or explanations, but I will tell you how very sorry I am that you feel the way you do. I'm not perfect by any means, but I am a human being and as such I'm not infallible like every other human on this earth, including you. We all at some point in our lives say things, do things that hurt one another's feelings, but the great thing about being human is learning how to forgive, forget, work through it all and learn how to let it go.

Sometimes when we are hurting for one reason or another, we only see what is right there, right now, and we don't allow ourselves the moment to get past the negativity and it eats away at us, making us more bitter than ever. Communication is ket to being able to talk things out, without pointing blame, without subtle innuendo,, pointing the finger, and to remain non-emotional. Unfortunately when communication stops, as time goes on, resentment and hostility sets in and you can't figure out how to get past that when you feel the other party can't or isn't hearing what you have to say. sometimes emotions take over and are not as controllable as we would like them to be, no matter how much we try.

""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was always something I would sing to you when you were little to get you to calm down and go to sleep. Think of the words, the melody, or sing it to yourself and see how it makes you feel.

On that note, I'm going to tell you again how much I love you, then, now, and forever no matter what. You are always first and foremost my son! I only want what's best for you and for you to have what I didn't and more. I'm sorry if you felt it was not acceptable as to how I went about it. I only can tell you I'm sorry you feel that way. In closing, I'm leaving where you want to go from here in your hands.

Love you always, Mom."
3x49oj,2,2015-12-16,Estimated Tax Payments for Dummies,ajaxifyit,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3x49oj/estimated_tax_payments_for_dummies/,"I'm new to this whole self employment thing since an internship I took made me contract through Upwork to get paid. I will be receiving a w-9 for approximately $22,000 of income from October 1 to December 14. I also held a regular w-2 job where I made earned $45000 with $7500 withheld as federal income tax. I live in Washington so no state tax.

I figured I need to send about $6000 off as estimated tax. I want to make sure I do it correctly.

As far as I can see the way one pays estimated tax is:

* figure out how much you might owe based on any number of sketchy calculators
* Sign up for EFTPS
* make payment in EFTPS by January 15 for income earned between September 1 and December 31.
* Do your annual income taxes as you normally would but enter the payment you made to apply against the total amount owed.

Questions:

* Is my list of steps correct? Do the dates line up or do I fall into a special case?
* Is there a good calculator for calculating estimated payments?
* I'm in the 25% bracket on the federal income tax level, but I've read that self-employment taxes are higher. How do I figure out my ""self-employment bracket"" especially when I have w-2 income from most of the year?

3x4cdz,3,2015-12-16,"I don't even enjoy it anymore, I want to stop. I need to stop. Good starting points?",Jackson_Bleeee,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3x4cdz/i_dont_even_enjoy_it_anymore_i_want_to_stop_i/,"Hey guys,

TL,DR:  I want to stop smoking because pot and substance abuse in general are holding me back.  I want to stop smoking so I can focus on improving myself, my life, and the lives those around me.


Overall, I'm not happy anymore.  I'm not happy with my life, my grades, my weight/health, and my relationship with my family.  I'm not sure if I'm depressed or if I just hit a few bumps on the road of life.  Either way, weed is not helping me and is hurting me in the long run.

I'm a young man with so much potential.  I attended and graduated from a prestigious highschool, I have a long history of serving the community, and have had the opportunity to take two summer internships (same company both times).  I'm a natural leader with a good head on my shoulders and a caring heart.  But lately, I haven't been acting like myself.  I've ignored responsibilities because of apathy/laziness, feeling bad about shirking my duties I either ignore or lash out at my friends.  Getting my drive and motivation back is the main reason I want to quit smoking.

I've been blessed with a healthy able-body, yet I continue to degrade my body.  I used to be very proud of being built like a tank and having muscles, but now I'm ashamed to look in the mirror.  My poor diet and lack of exercise of the last few years is catching up with me.  I know it's never too late to reverse the trend, but pot is not helping the situation or my confidence.

My parents hate marijuana and I have let it drive a wedge between me and my dad.  My dad and I never had a great relationship, but my use of marijuana has caused me to become more distance from my family altogether because I don't want to see my dad.  I know he'll be mad, that he'll think I'm a disappointment.  I love him, but I fear him.  He'll go over board and try to pull me out of school, have me admitted to some high security rehab facility, or he may even disown me.  Once I get to a stage in my life where I am entirely supporting myself, I won't care much what my father thinks.  Don't get me wrong, I want to improve my relationship with my dad, but that can't be done until I'm clean.

My life isn't bad, but I want to make it better.  That starts by giving up tree and getting back in shape.  I'll start regaining the confidence I've lost along the way and I know the real me will start to shine through the gloom that's been surrounding me the last few months.

Feel free to leave any suggestions, ideas, or comments.  I'd appreciate them."
3x4l0c,116,2015-12-16,Memory issues on Layer 8,KeeperOfTheLAN,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3x4l0c/memory_issues_on_layer_8/,"Monday, first hour, I was still half asleep from the nap I took on my undecently long commute, nonetheless I decided after a nice weekend that I would face this week with enthusiasm. It didn't last long. I sat in front of the computer, as usual $Boss had already turned it on and logged in long before I got there, so i can start swimming through the sea of tickets, there it was, THAT ticket.

It was at least the eighth time we got it. The title just read: ""Slow"". Whenever we get a ticket with that title we know who is it from, and the copypasted description it will have, without even opening it. As usual, the ticket was sent on friday just after I left for home.

&gt;**$Ticket**=""General slowness of the computer when opening Word documents, PDF, Excel, Etc..."";

I didn't took any notes from the ticket, I just went to $User's office, without even bringing my set of screwdrivers or even a pen, I knew what I was going to face and what was the outcome going to be. I've been there so many times during the short period I've been working here that there's no need to act too formal with him, conversation goes as follows:

&gt;**$KoTL**: Hi $User, I'm here again, sorry for not  coming on Friday, I was already away. Same problem as usual?

&gt;**$User**: Hi $KoTL, yes, both computers are going terribly slow, this has been going on for too long, can you really not fix it? I can't work like that. _/\*Note that the user needs to use a piece of software that has not been updated in years, so when he received a new computer he got to keep the old one, as this software does not work on anything newer than Windows XP\*/_

&gt;**$KoTL**: I've checked it many times and I can't do much else, I'm just an intern. But I'll check it out.

&gt;**$User**: Yes, please.

Computers themselves were working really good, even the old one, but yet I fired the usual tests and fixes on both, knowing that they won't do anything, just so $User sees I'm working on it. Memtest, CCleaner to clear temporary files and check the registry, check if the drive is fragmented. Everything is fine, just under 100 MB of temp files on both computers combined, no problems.

We (as in the $OtherIntern, $Boss and I) have run tests on both computers and we have determined long ago that the problem lies within the network. Said slowness is due to him saving and reading all of his documents from a server. Even small files take ages to load, and even though we explained it to him every single time it seems like he refuses to understand. We have tried every solution we could try. Replaced ethernet cables both at his office and at the networking closet, changed switch port, replaced ethernet splitters at both ends(yeah, I know, not the best solution, but I can't do anything with that), replaced the splitter by a basic switch, and tried every possible NIC configuration. All to no avail.

I ran a speedtest, Ping was 4 ms, download speed was horribly slow but upload got almost to max speed.  I saved the results, and took some screenshots of his PC copying from/to the server so the ones in charge of it see that there is actually a problem with the downlink. It's most likely caused by a faulty cable between the outlet and the networking closet, nothing we can fix, that's $MaintenanceCompany's domain.

I explained the issue like $User was 5 for the $Deity knows how many time. I even stressed several times that his computers are perfectly fine, that it's a networking problem, and every time he asks me to fix it (you know the drill: ""You're IT, you have to fix everything""). After several simplifications of the explanation he seemed understanding.

&gt;**$User**: So, $KoTL, you can't fix it, what do we do now?

&gt;**$KoTL**: Don't worry, I'll forward the ticket to the corresponding person and send them the screenshots to show them there is actually a problem that must be fixed by them, not us.

&gt;**$User**: Thank you so much, would you do that for me?

&gt;**$KoTL**: _/\*Heading away\*/_ Yes, I'll do it right away, see you!

I checked the status of all his previous tickets about this issue. They were either lingering for a long time without nobody paying any attention to them, closed by someone at $MaintenanceCompany without explanation (or even assigning a responsible person), or closed by some higher-up for being a duplicate ticket. I forwarded the ticket explaining everything with detail and including the screenshots, and as it was already break time I went with $Boss and $OtherIntern to grab a bite.

Not a great start for the week, but just a minor nuance, I still felt enthusiastic about the week.

Back from the break I sat in front of the screen, and suddenly everything went dark, thunderbolt and lightning filled my world, $Workplace now felt like Mordor and all enthusiasm died in painful agony, as the wish for a higher being coming to destroy humanity grew.

3x4lfw,9,2015-12-16,Looking for perspective on counseling degree,throwaway34598471,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/3x4lfw/looking_for_perspective_on_counseling_degree/,"I am looking for perspectives on my situation:

I [M28] want for my wife to find something she truly enjoys doing and not hate her job.  She [F27] has a BA in psych and now wants to enter a CACREP accredited program to eventually gain licensure as an LMHC.  She doesn't like school, but really is excited about being able to help others and provide therapy.

More about us: we both work full time now, and don't need more money.  She currently works in a inpatient mental health facility (not in counseling) and finds the work environment to be toxic, draining, and extremely stressful (and low pay to boot).  She took the job to get good experience before entering such a program, and she is optimistic that she could get a counseling job that is in a better environment (it is a public facility that takes everyone, even involuntarily).

However, I have just now begun to look at MS and MA programs and am concerned about costs, time, and stress (of course me being in finance I'm always jumping to number).  



I have a few questions:

1) Does the location of a school matter?  We are looking at programs in different regions - does she need to get her license in the same state as her school?

2) Does school ""prestige"" matter?  Some programs (Northwestern, etc) look to have very developed, almost ""fancy-looking"" programs, but cost nearly $100k in total tuition, while others have accredited and more modest looking programs, for $30,000 total.

3)  Are supervised work/practicum/internships stupid-hard to find,  do they pay anything (vs nothing)?  I am concerned with this being a ""trap"" for some programs, where it's damn near impossible to actually get licensed because no one will take you as an intern.

4) Is the work extremely high stress no matter what in your first year?

5) Are there other questions or other paths we should consider?

Honestly, I would never choose a role like this, but the world is a better place because of all the work that people like you have done and I understand that for many of you the work is worthwhile.  I just want my wife to find something she enjoys, just like I enjoy my work, but I don't want her to end up worse off in the end.

Thanks for any and all input!"

3x4x98,0,2015-12-16,I graduated from a top school with great grades &amp; why I regret it,isoX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x4x98/i_graduated_from_a_top_school_with_great_grades/,"I graduated 2 years ago from a well known university with a 4.0 GPA. Since then, I've worked at 2 tech companies where I took home 6 figure salaries. Sounds great, right? Here's the catch: my CS education has been absolutely useless in my career.




I worked my ass off and wasted 4 entire years of my life in order to learn a boatload of theoretical garbage that I've not used once in my career as a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Even worse, I PAID ~$150K to be tortured with this experience.




I started a company in my last year of college and grew our revenues to a modest ~5K/month. Not too impressive, but I learned more from this experience than I did from every lecture and homework assignment combined. What did my college education give me? The ability to pass ridiculous technical interview questions. That's it. I learned how to be an actual software engineer by building a functional product. I learned how engineering teams function by creating an engineering team. I learned how the software industry works by becoming part of it.




Why do tech companies require college degrees? Going through university is the most common path to success, so why not just do naive pattern matching and only look for resumes with top schools? Companies greatly prefer false negatives to false positives. One bad hire is much worse than rejecting 100 geniuses. This strategy is great for business but horrible for us.




I propose a better solution: instead of taking massive loans and wasting 4 years being miserable while studying for exams... Learn software engineering on your own and spend 4 years on projects you care about. There are online lectures, in person boot camps, and so much more. Do you really want to make trivial school projects? Learning programming is orders of magnitude more fun when you're creating something you truly want to exist in the world. A better use of college loans? Start a company and change the world. And if you fail... your experience will still be more impressive on your resume than any typical college grad with a few internships. Work won't feel like ""work"" if you're doing something you love.




Obviously this path isn't for everyone. However, if you're sufficiently determined, your time, money, and energy can be allocated much more efficiently than 4 years of taking stressful exams.




I regret going to college. An entire ~5% of my life was spent being miserable and learning things I'll never need to know (and if I did, could learn online). Life is short; make the most of your limited time."

3x594p,4,2015-12-16,My [21 M] ex [21 F] said a lot of bad things about me to our common group of friends. What should I do?,extalkingtrash,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3x594p/my_21_m_ex_21_f_said_a_lot_of_bad_things_about_me/,"I go to a small university campus. Everyone has connections to everyone. I was gone for about a year and a half to do an internship. Right before I left for the internship is when I broke up with my ex.

The reason I broke up was because: Her previous ex (who she dumped and then moved on to me) still liked her. After she went no contact with him for a couple months, they met again in university. It was obvious he liked her, and she decided to text him so much without me knowing (they had over 1500 texts in the first 3 weeks). They also had phone calls with each other which I didn't know about and had to figure out myself. I called her out on this and she got defensive, saying it was just for studying. There was a day when she avoided me all day just to hang out with him. And that's when I got really upset, and decided to break up. 

I trusted her to not catch feelings for him, but I thought it was just so weird that even when he fully liked her, she never did anything about it (if anything, she made the situation worse by talking to him so much).

With that said, when we broke up, she wanted to still talk things through but I said there isn't much left to talk about (I told her what I had problems with, but she just kept saying how I was the problem and how I had trust issues and how I was being so overprotective - because I told her that she shouldn't be talking to him so much without me knowing).

After that, I went on my internship for 1.5 years. I came back recently, and saw all the friends on campus (as expected, it's a small campus). She is dating her previous ex again (which I saw coming and don't really mind.. he fully liked her and they started dating Very Soon after me and her stopped talking).

I talked to one of my old friends recently and turns out this ex said A Lot of bad things about me. So bad that he didn't even want to repeat it. She said I put such strict rules on her, how I was so overprotective and had problems with everything she did, and how I always saw faults in everything. She then said how I didn't contact her once ever since breaking up with her (I broke up over text.. I'll admit that was a dumb move by me). It kinda hurt hearing this, because this entire time, I only said good things about her. And I also felt that we were very good when we were together, and I didn't know she was capable of saying all this about me.

My reputation isn't that great at the moment. I'm trying to keep a small circle of friends but this is such a small campus that everyone is common friends with everyone. I haven't talked to her yet, and I really don't think we'll ever talk (I don't want to get involved with her and her bf's relationship again like last time. Also, on the first two days when she saw me, she Did Not want me to see her at all. She put her hood on and looked the other way hoping I wouldn't see her. Then in the next few days, I caught her looking at me once or twice - I'll admit, I've just stared at her once too. But now, she literally ignores me and walks passed me like we've never met, which is why I don't see us talking anymore).

What should I do? Should I tell people what really happened, and risk causing more drama? Or should I tell only my small circle of friends the story, and keep a bad reputation until I finish university (in 2 years)?
   
**tl;dr**: Ex said lots of bad things about me (part of which weren't even true) while I was gone on an internship. We go to a really small university were everyone knows each other and have mutual friends, and now that I'm back from my internship, I notice my reputation is really bad. I haven't talked to my ex at all yet, and don't plan to (she's in a relationship with her previous ex who she left for me back in the days, and I don't want to get involved in that again. Also, after the first few days of me catching her looking at me - I'll admit, I've just stared at her once too - she literally ignores me now and looks the other way).

Should I tell people what really happened and defend my reputation, while risking causing more drama? Or should I just stick with my small circle of friends and let everyone else believe what she said about me? We're gunna be in this small campus for two more years or so?"
3x5hxi,2,2015-12-16,What could have been,EntitledAsian,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/3x5hxi/what_could_have_been/,"I need to get this off my chest. This is also a warning to others. If nothing else, I am a warning.

I have been working in a Fortune 100 company for several years. My work schedule is 40 hours a week or less, so there is absolutely no problem with work-life balance.

What's the problem, I should be happy right? No, I'm not enjoying this career at all. I make enough money off of my investments to pay off my living expenses, yet it would be a bad choice to simply quit the job because it means giving up my largest income stream. I have some hobbies which can potentially give me supplemental income, but it is not as effort-efficient as my main job, so I left them as just that -- hobbies.

I could always change careers. Currently I'm in tech, but I would like to enter the field of finance. But that means I would have to start from the bottom, and potentially set me back several more years. How did I end up in tech? Growing up, I didn't have thoughts of my own, and I ended up doing a Computer Science degree because it was the only one (out of Doctor, Lawyer, etc.) which I didn't dislike. I was motivated by what I didn't dislike, not what I was passionate about. As for what I'm passionate about, it's too late to pursue it. Please don't make up some lie about it never being too late.

I'm addicted to money. Money is my muse. My true calling in life is to make tons of money for myself, or for others. This means an investment bank, hedge fund, market making, portfolio management. The thing about having these as careers is, you need to slowly build up your base of trust. People usually start right out of university, or even before they graduate, in a Big 4 internship. I would start from square one at the ripe old age of 27.

There's nothing wrong with being behind the curve by a few years. No, there's absolutely nothing wrong. Colonel Sanders started his business in his sixties. Janacek composed Jenufa at the age of 50. George W. Bush married at the age of 31. But it's the attitude instilled in me throughout my entire childhood, directly or indirectly, that haunts me forever. I'm behind the curve, late, tardy. Retarded.

You might say I'm overreacting. That's why my username is ""Entitled"" -- I am entitled. The fact is, I have God-given talent. Not quite a child prodigy, but well ahead of the curve. In the Parable of the Talents, I would have been the servant who received the greatest number of talents. But all this was squandered. In my imagination I plot out paths which I could have taken, as outlandish as they may be but still plausible given my talent. High-flying investment banker, making seven figures annually. World-famous composer of music, clients clamoring for me to lend my voice to their project. Particle physicist, studying the next mystery of the universe. All these paths would have required a lot of hard work and focus on a specific direction. I did not have a specific direction. To reiterate, a lack of direction was my direction, and negative reinforcement was my reinforcement.

And where were my parents in all of this? Instead of focusing my direction, they sat back and let my talent work for them. On autopilot. I acquired grades. Stayed in the good graces of teachers. Received awards. Absorbed whatever lessons were thrown at me outside of school. The pattern is clear: everything I did was passive. I did not work for good grades. I did not seek out fruitful relationships with teachers. I did not chase awards. I did not desire to better myself with lessons.

Through the anti-pattern of Asian parenting, my parents had produced a lazy scoundrel. What could have been was squandered. Flushed down the toilet. Doors slammed shut and boarded over, candles snuffed out, pearls thrown before swine. Fuck all.

Yet all of this doesn't have to end badly. Though I failed, I failed in the Asian sense. I failed into a six-figure career, which is beyond the wildest dreams of many people. Every day I try my best to not be lazy. To improve the littlest scrap of thing in my life. I should be happy. But I'm not. I want more, because I could have been much more. If only I were raised right. I'm haunted by all of this. I'm entitled."

3x5qo5,7,2015-12-16,"Almost 29, virgin, directionless, life was a constant downhill in the last couple of years",anythinggoes_,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3x5qo5/almost_29_virgin_directionless_life_was_a/,"I'll spare the wall of text but many of your posts are very familiar to me. I had a failry normal life up to a point, so basically something like:

- 0-18: done stuff, went to school, travelled etc.
- 18-19: went to a shit uni, no friends, wanted to switch
- 20-22: went to amazing uni, got new friends, went to parties, joined student clubs etc. you know the stuff
- 23-24: went to abroad for a year, gained friends, but this is where shit happened

So basically I came home from my internship, I became depressed, basically dropped out of university but not really (went on and off for a couple of years, went back again etc.). I lost ALL my friends somehow since I didn't have any interest doing stuff anymore. 

So now I'm here turning 29 in a month, have 0 friends except some people I talk to on Facebook who all have their lives, I have a job but I dont enjoy it, I wasted 3 or 4 years on just being a NEET with a job (played thousands of hours of vidya, got fat etc.)

So in the last half a year I lost a ton of weight, I got half my shit together (I shower daily, I clean my flat etc.) and so on, but I'm totally alone and I have major anxiety problems when talking to people and just having a good time (something I used to do, ironically I'm not sure how to do).

So people who actually managed to climb out please give me some advice:

- how do you pretend you're ""okay"" now? I always feel anxious when I talk to ""normal"" people, like I just pretend to be normal? Does that make sense? 

- how do you deal with the fact that no one cared about you when you were really down? I mean at least I surely know no one cared about me except one good friend. All I can think of now is how people ""play this game"" when you're popular therefore you get more popular etc. It's like there is no room there for sincerity.

- I've never had a relationship, this puts such a huge weight on me. I'm not even sure what to do about this. I was an ugly kid but always somehwhat popular with guys, not so much with girls. I think this is a HUGE part of why I think people perceive me as a loser. It's almost like they treat people who get girls VERY differently, and the more easier you can get girls the more popular you are. 

- How do you deal mentally with the fact that you ""wasted"" years while other people had fun and did stuff? How do you deal with seeing happy people on Facebook? I'm not jealous or want bad stuff to happen to happy people, I'm like ""what if"" all the time.

But the biggest question of all is where to go from here. I generally see that people usually get their shit together by their 30s, a lot of them get married and had degrees while I'm still struggling with mine and I don't really care about it either. I'm working in my field but I burned out in recent years and basically can't imagine doing this for another 10 years.

So this is half rant half asking for advice. I'm a bit drunk so this post is probably a bit unstructured but there you have it.

EDIT: also about girls, I have tried for years to find a girlfriend, I got rejected a LOT of times, got ignored etc. but I thought surely this is all part of life. While some of my friends got beautiful girls and that makes you feel even shittier. One thing being ugly or just not attractive, its another that you also feel shit about it... I fixed SOME of the stuff I was very unhappy with (I had a jaw surgery for example, I was ""fortunate"" enough to born with a recessed jaw...) but I still have a lot more.

I am sick of the constant customer service and I want to actually make stuff, not only fix it. I loved the few programming classes that I took in college, but I went into the IT support route because initially, I had some connections in that field. 

Some background info:

- BS in Information Technology, where I took a few programming classes in C, so I have fundamentals of programming, but not a full-fledged CS degree level.
- Some experience making basic websites with html/css
- Some graphic design experience

I want to focus on back-end PHP/MySql, largely because in my area of the country, those are where most of the jobs are, and also because PHP isn't that. 

I am thinking of starting with wordpress and trying to reach out to some non-profits that want a fully functioning site. Good plan, or would some other programming projects be a better idea?

I am willing to start back at the entry-level again. I would look for an internship, but I don't think too many people would take a 30 year old person who already graduated college on. My current company may be willing to transfer me internally, but they may not.

How would you break in if you were me?

Any thoughts on this really appreciated."

I'm studing to be a counselor and want to do therapy. I need to fond an internship to complete my degree. I found one at a hospital but was looking for another place b/c the guy who interviewed me was rude.

I told my boss and she had the idea I could do my internship in a close department with premed students. I was excited about it.  I had a meeting with the people who would be supervising me and it seemed like I may not be able to do what I want and may not get all the contact hours I need.

So I suggested to them maybe I can split the internship up and do half at the hospital and have at the other place. The two supervisors independently met with my boss and told her they were dissapointed and that they really wanted me to intern.

My boss told me this and offered to set up an informal meeting with everyone. I was swayded again and told them I'll see if the hospital will let me split it up.

The hospital will not let me and I'd have to do it both semesters there. I feel like I would learn more at the hospital than the other place...and at this point would probably just take the other place to people please.

I feel really guilty for possibly leading on my coworkers, being wishy washy and feel like I wasted their time. I am just really easily swayed and influenced but when I thought about it at home decided the hospital will be best. Don't know how to break it to them.

3x6dna,19,2015-12-17,My mom and sister may be becoming Latter-Day Saints and I'm scared,BookofMormonthrow,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3x6dna/my_mom_and_sister_may_be_becoming_latterday/,"Context: grew up in the Reformed Church, now identify as Nazarene.

My sister (16y.o.) has been dating a Mormon for over a year. He's great, and his family has become a part of our family. I have no issue with that. My mom and sister started checking out their temple. Again, nothing wrong with being open-minded. But now they've become ""investigators,"" we have missionaries coming our house frequently, and they are thinking about conversion.

Now, as someone who tends to be fairly liberal, I want to be open-minded. However, I find some great flaws in the Mormon theology and find the culture cult-like. I am a social work undergrad who has done an internship in an elementary school. I worked with many kids who come from LDS families and had a few ex-Mormon co-workers. Needless to say, I've seen some ugly sides of the religion.

I'm scared that my sister and (especially) mom are being brainwashed by this. I mentioned that I felt some of their practices (ex: only letting missionaries consume ""approved"" media) was cultish and controlling, and she said it wasn't. I mean, even the idea that they can't really fully join the church unless they convert is a red flag alone.

I'm scared that my mom and sis will be hurt by this cult and/or will end up in hell for rejecting the true Gospel. I'm also worried that my dad will file for divorce if a full conversion happens. 

What can I do in the meantime? I don't want to shun my mom and sis, or even tell them to stop being around her bf's family. But I want their eyes to be opened to the flaws of this religion. And I also don't want to have the ""ill show THEM there evil Mormons a piece of my mind"" attitude."

* got phone interviews at google facebook twitter amazon, failed them all
* got on campus interview with microsoft, passed it, went onsite this past week and i definitely could have done better technically but i feel that i clicked really well with the interviewers and went through the coding questions the best i could by continuously voicing my thoughts and asking a bunch of questions before i tackled the question on the board
* finished fall 2015 semester, grades aren't too good (think im like at a 3.5 this semester)
* worked on a side project all this semester so i have that under my belt

so now that im stressfully waiting to hear back from microsoft and final exams have just finished... i don't know what to do anymore. before i went off to my interview and before my final exams i was always working, averaged like 5-6 hours of sleep a night (even on weekends lol), and now all of a sudden my obligations are all ""completed""

given that winter break is starting, i know im supposed to really use this time to get ahead of class work next semester or even make a dank project with code (which im thinking about, but idk what to make), but i feel so burnt out right now.

so what should i do to slowly work back up to speed? i also want to apply for more jobs in case microsoft doesnt work out, preferably to some startups in the bay area/LA. anyone have any tips on how to go about finding startups that are hiring interns that actually accept people from schools that aren't UCB/UCLA/stanford in those areas?

anyway, thanks for reading all this, this is kind of a rant and ramble but this is what life's been like for the past 3-4 weeks lol

TLDR: finished finals, finished interviews, don't know what to do now. what do i do over winter break as a CS student? how can i apply for more internships preferably in the bay area/LA at startups? what's a hot tech that i should learn over winter break? what do you guys do to deal with this burn out?

3x6kxm,2,2015-12-17,5th year in college and I'm struggling toward my first Bachelor's,FaysOne,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3x6kxm/5th_year_in_college_and_im_struggling_toward_my/,"When I started my first semester of college, I was 18, LeBron had no rings, and gas couldn't be less than $2.75 per gallon. I'm now 22 (soon to be 23), still living with my parents, Obama's headed out the door soon, and Katy Perry is twice as big of a deal compared to the end of my high school days.

In all seriousness...here's details. I'm probably getting what I asked for since I major in the engineering field. It's hard, yes...but the pressure just seems to mount because it feels as if i haven't had any true form of success or progress in my life since graduating from HS. It's also along the lines of what I want to do; I'm aiming for a computer engineering career after college graduation.

I've failed at least one class in 5 out of my first 8 semesters in college. GPA is a high 2, but not quite 3. Thus, my path on the curriculum is as bad as someone who needed to take pre-algebra and everything else in between before taking calculus and other big math classes. To make matters worse, I only have *ONE* grant to pay off some of my tuition and I only have seasonal work at a ballpark to show for it. No engineering internships in this time span either. And to think, a good handful of colleagues who were in my orientation class in my first semester graduated from college THIS PAST MAY. I watched them accept their degrees (on my birthday, more ironically) while I worked a ball game to reel in a paycheck. Having lectures with my close family about my struggles is **dreadful**. The situation is rough...and I try to stay positive in the midst of it all.

I don't want to change majors...not an option with about 50 credits to go anyways. Could have done it earlier, but I still felt motivated to push on and stay the course....and I still do. At the same time, I can only be frustrated with all of my shortcomings. Before this year, I needed public transportation or a bandwagon ride from family/friends to get to school. Studying late at night was difficult; you'd have to put on a live football game at 3am in the morning to keep me up. Couldn't stay late at school either because there's no way home by bus/train after midnight. I come home and struggle to find a quiet place to study and my bedroom is an easy ticket to my bed for sleep. I have a handful that I could point out, but I'll keep this list short.

I'm concerned this will go bad...somehow, someway...even if I continue to force myself to hope for the best and that I'll act on it. I'm approaching my middle 20's and if all else does fail, I could be another statistic: graduating from college without a job beyond the Walmart cashier and McDonald's chef, jobs that any adult could do in his or her sleep. What aggravates me sometimes when I think about my struggle is how much better things could have been.

In the midst of my senior year, I was set on going to Penn State. Best college that accepted me (also the first), strong engineering program, and a new setting for me to grow. Sadly couldn't afford it, so I had to turn away the opportunity I so desperately wanted. Instead, I'm stuck in the same city I've lived in since birth...and besides a driver's license, my first car, and finding love, seems like there's nothing (much) to look forward to in terms of my next taste of accomplishment, personal or academic."

I am 1 year from graduation and I still have a few programming classes left to take.  My question is what I should be doing now to work towards actually being marketable for a position.  I don't feel like I have the skills to make a complete program, I have mostly made console programs and haven't yet figured out how to translate that into something useful beyond that.  I have taken two web development courses which taught me the basics of html, css, javascript, and ASP.NET w/C#.  
I still don't feel ready for an internship but I really don't know what is expected of me to be qualified.  I want to focus on web development as it has been the most interesting to me.
  So, what I'm afraid of is graduating without any real experience, at the same time, if I take a short term internship it would be challenging only because I still need to pay for bills after it is over as well as the fact that I still don't feel qualified. I am an older student (30) and while I want to learn more and improve my skills it hard to find time between class and work.

Just completed a Masters in the fall, but unfortunately, things have fallen apart completely after my graduation. I'm hanging on by a thread at this point, but my mental state is starting to rot even that thread. I do get work sometimes, but it's intermittent, changes from day to day, and doesn't cover enough for me financially. I do have some savings, but I can't depend on them for much longer. I have no structure in most of my days, and any schedules that I have aren't in sync with most of the people I know, so it also isolates me socially.

&amp;nbsp;

Although I have had symptoms of severe anxiety and depression for many years, I had only recently been treating it directly. I have seen a CBT specialist over the past few months, when it became clear my symptoms were interfering with job hunting and school applications. While the sessions were helpful initially, recent sessions have been far less helpful. I'm not armed with the tools that I need to make my life functional again. Or rather, I am armed with some tools. It's just that the tools make no sense. Yes, I know that I need to change my own self-perception. Yes, I know that I need to start humanizing other people. No, I can't say exactly how I'm supposed to do that. And no, these tools are not going to help me eat. Have you tried digging a hole using an abstract philosophical concept? Or tried to cook dinner using nothing but a pillowcase? Let me tell you, it is really hard.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, basic backstory. My upbringing was not the greatest and a little abusive from one parent, but I somehow managed for the first 18 years. My undergrad and masters was in the humanities. I did not do an internship in school, because 1) my undergrad did not offer or emphasize them, 2) I focused on studying instead of forging business connections, 3) I did not get the few internships I did apply to, and 4) my plans after undergrad were a little different. I wanted - and still want - to become a scholar and pursue my discipline to its limit, but experiences over the last year has made me question this goal. So while I do have a skillset built up over the past few years, I have no easy in with any industry, let alone the kit I would need to be competitive. I don't want to go further in education unless I know that I can get something stable after it is done, and fuck this I have no idea what I'm even doing anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I also realized over the past few years, I had also been making friends with and dating the wrong people. As a very shy person when I was younger, my friend selection was somewhat eclectic. The people I knew were interesting and made time for me in school settings, but never for anything else when I would try to initiate. The few that I've kept since undergrad have largely cut me off, even the few that I kept on writing to. Making the wrong friends isn't new for me. I believed the whole nonsense about people being friends for their lives and always looking out for each other - reality is not the same. Generally, I've been hurt much more by people I've made friends with than helped. Making new friends is a chore, partly because I never know how they're going to act at any given time, and partly because for the majority of them, I have to put in *all* of the work and they don't even get back to me when I do.

&amp;nbsp;

I dated women along these lines, too. They were women who didn't love me for who I was, but rather for the attention I gave them. Many times I felt that, despite being told many times that they loved me for my own self, that I was always being traded up for a newer, superior model. Many of the women I dated were a little older, cynical and offbeat, which made for fun conversation, which I wrongly interpreted as being the only good ingredient of a solid relationship. I've been single for quite some time as a result, and it gets to me. Like many people I know found their perfect partners at some ridiculously young age and it's implied that I'm somehow less of a man because I didn't grow alongside someone else.

&amp;nbsp;

The worst part is that there were other friends and other women clearly interested in me who would have been much better for me psychologically, but I ignored them because, with the pattern of people that I knew, I didn't believe their behaviour was genuine. Why are you acting so nice to me? What do you want? You cannot possibly be treating me that well for *no reason at all,* right?

&amp;nbsp;

Everyone around me tells me that I'm still young and still have plenty of time to change the direction that my life is going. I know this. I want to believe this. Even though I know this personally, I can't help but feel that it's too late for me to make a recovery - too late to find work through school again and too late to make friends with people around my age. I'd now be about 4-5 years behind where I should have been, and I feel that my peers and employers would not look at that sympathetically. Older people in general tend to assure me, but younger people do not. Instead, we say to each other, *""If you didn't do X, Y and Z before this age, you're totally fucked and should give up now.""*

&amp;nbsp;

Isn't that a horrible thing to say? That instead of taking life as it comes, that you're screwed up forever because you were supposed to do all of these things that you never knew about at the time? I know that there is still time for me, but each day I become less sure of it. It's a horrible feeling - knowing that a lot of what you're thinking *is* irrational and yet you are still helpless to stop yourself from believing in it anyway. I want to believe that things will get better as I get older, but will they truly be better, or will the goalposts have moved? *""Hey, not put together by 30? Try waiting til your 40s. By then you'll really be happy.""* And so on.

&amp;nbsp;

I have two previous suicide attempts under my belt, one at 11 and one at around 17. I crawled back from both of them. I'm afraid of death. I don't want to die unless I have absolutely no choice but to. But that point seems to get closer every day. Thoughts about what sort of method I should use crop up very frequently, and I'm worried.

&amp;nbsp;

I've barely started my life and yet I am exhausted already. If I get to the place where I need to try it again a third time, I don't even want to think about it. Just get it done before any second thoughts stop me."

They are aware that I'm in final round interviews with other companies, but they don't know who, or how many.  Should I mention that I would take an offer from them at the end of the interview, or would I just be putting myself in a compromising position?

Small anecdotes and advice would help me INCREDIBLY, so thank you.

Currently a sophomore Ag Engineering student. Discovered my innate love for programming and software last semester and really it's all I think about. I've already done a ton of side projects (ruby, c++, Unity3D C#, more java stuff) alongside CS125, and I'm taking 173 and 225 next semester. Further courses also interest me like 431/233/241, but taking these courses is about to seriously take its toll on my graduation date. I still have a ton of biology coursework to complete for my degree in Ag Engineering (ugh).

I plan on visiting the spring ECS career fair to (very hopefully) get an internship involved with software and programming. I was hoping if I could get an honest answer from someone more experienced. Here's the issue: I did not-so-well in my past calculus and physics courses here. I came in with very little experience and jumped straight in without many prior strong study skills. The early theory really took its toll (I learned it well, just not in time for exams). So transferring isn't an option apparently with my 3.1. I wish there was a way to convey my passion to get a spot, but I understand their hands are tied in CS.  

I have two options. Continue in AgEngineering with Renewable Energy Systems and pursue a minor in CS here at UIUC with all the available resources of a top-5 CS/engineering school... or transfer. I have NO idea where I would go with a 3.1 (it would obviously be a down-grade), or if the major compared to the minor is something to even worry about (I know you can get an internship with basic data structures/algorithms/problem analysis). I really wish I knew more, and that's what I wanted to ask of you. If you know anything relevant, seriously anything, please comment.

Thank you again in advance. Have a great break!"

I am a 20 year old student, currently in my last year of studying Interactive Webdevelopment, after this I will study for another 4 years in order to try to get a job as a Art Director.

I am finishing up my internship, where I live it is required that during your education you complete a full time internship that lasts at least 90 days.

During this internship I have learned alot, I have worked my ass of and really made some great contributions to this company, so much so that I have been offered a part time job next to my studies.

The problem is that I also work as a webdeveloper on my own, I make websites for people and it pays really well.

For a couple of hours of work I could easily net 400-500 euro's if I manage to get a customer, I have a customer every other month but I don't depend on this income to be able to live - I live with my parents and they pay for my study aswell, other than this I save up my money and don't need a steady base of income in order to live. 

This job would pay pretty good, but I feel like if I put more effort towards getting customers for websites on my own I could make so much more money with all the things I have learned.

So I am faced with 2 choices here, either take this job and maybe not get paid much, spend alot of time working but have a steady income.

Or turn down the job, and put effort into finding customers, not always getting money but when I do its so much more effortless, and will help me do a bit of networking along the way.

I am not expecting to be paid a whole lot of money/hour at this possible job, I will probably make slightly more than the minimum wage for a 20 year old... which is about 10 euros an hour.. in comparison to earning 100 euros an hour while doing things as a freelancer for customers.

I could make more hours at this new job though - but with my studies on the side im not sure if I have that time."

I wanted to ask for some tips on being able to get a residency visa to live in Portugal and eventually become a EU citizen after.


Here's my background. I am a US Citizen who is going to graduate from school with a Bachelor of Science in Finance. I have a ton of Finance internship experience, so if my plan fails, I can always come back home and work a decent job. 

**My plan**

I plan to go to Portugal from June to August this summer. I am going to live in an AirBNB apartment for the entire time and plan on taking $3,000 of living money. I know it might sound like a little, but I want to get use to living on a small budget. (Travel and Apartment will be paid) I have a couple of friends over there who I am quite close to, if that helps with legal issues. Hopefully, I can get a call center job there, but I would need a work permit, which I am also confused about (do they apply for it for me or do I apply for it?) 


So, this is where I need help. What do I need to do now, in order to ensure that everything is good when I go over there. Do I need to apply for a visa here in the United States, and then go fill out other forms in Portugal? I live in Chicago, so there is no embassy of Portugal here. Also, what do I need to do when I am in Portugal for those 2 months? 


Any thing would help a ton. 

Thanks,

Joe "
3x7twp,13,2015-12-17,How the Red Pill proved a Feminist (me) wrong,Koedukativ,altTRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/altTRP/comments/3x7twp/how_the_red_pill_proved_a_feminist_me_wrong/,"This past year has been the most eventful of my life by far. I don't know, whether this will be of any use for anyone, but it has been for me, writing all this down. This is my personal story of how I first encountered and despised the Red Pill and then turned around. This is quite common in the Main sub and usually pretty boring. Sadly, this won't be much better, but I didn't read a gay version yet, so maybe this might be useful to some. I might write more about this past year as I initially planned (my journey after accepting TRP as truth). Feel free to ask anything or just ignore if you don't care. Cheers and have a great day!


I grew up with loving and caring parents, a beautiful sister and all the things I could have ever wanted. It was obvious to anyone around me how spoiled I was from the security and protection my family gave me. I excelled at school and most of the unambiguous endeavors I took part in. Early on I noticed that I didn’t have much patience with myself and the things I wanted to accomplish. For one, I wanted to have a more appealing appearance, always felt dissatisfied but wouldn’t put in the work, because I got everything else so easily. My mother adored me and always gave me approval for the grades that didn’t cost me any effort. Maybe it was for my sister who taught me everything I knew, but had trouble to accomplish the grades she helped me get. I knew my life would be easy, so I never put much effort into it. Looking back, my self-respect must have been at an all-time low because I didn’t even get a hair cut for several months at a time. I woke up as late as possible and sat through school to get home and play video games. I always got all the stuff I wanted and so I didn’t even finish the games I got. Whenever I faced a challenge I couldn’t instantly solve, I just chose another game. There were so many of them.

Despite some minor dissatisfactions, I didn’t feel like I couldn’t go on like this until I found out I was gay. I did have a certain feeling for it, obviously, but I could always push it into my subconscious. After all, I was dating girls and it worked out fine. My parents told me early on, what gay people were about. They were promiscuous and secretly wanted to be women. My uncle has been married to his partner for over 10 years and they always lived in an open relationship. In addition there have been rumors that some sort of molestation has been going on in my fathers childhood by his elder brother. In the collective mind of my family, and I have always taken part in this, gay people were unethical sluts.

In the summer of 2011 my Spanish teacher decided that I was gifted. She signed me up for a program for gifted students and I reluctantly agreed to go after having a talk with one of the deans of the summer school. I still don’t know why they took me in, but they did. This was the first time someone actually expected me to be disciplined, having a course program throughout the day, learning at night or being humiliated in front of class. I hated everyone at class, because I thought them to be pretentious. Actually, they just had genuine interest apart from playing video games. At my first day I forced myself to go out to the camp fire and just sit there, although I wouldn’t strike up any conversation.  Some guy with the most ridiculous scarf (to me at the time, it was violet) sat next to me and told me everything about his recent trip to the film festival in Cannes. I had been the biggest movie buff at the time and could easily  keep up. It was a great experience. Obviously, I brought my laptop to although it wasn’t allowed to have one and a whole bunch of movies. In the afternoon I would watch Antonioni films to pass the time. The two of us started watching the movies together. Since he had a single room and I didn’t, we could easily watch movies there without distraction.

We spent a lot of time together and I learned to appreciate the other students. One evening he told me he was gay in the most awkward but seemingly casual way. It wasn’t that big a deal, but I hadn’t met an openly gay man I could actually stand before. I knew that my chance had come. I was at this camp, isolated from family and friends and had a guy who was obviously down for some action. Given it would turn out to be a disaster or someone would find out, I could still just leave camp saying I didn’t like it, like so many times before. I liked it. A lot, to say the least. Here I was, sucking of the guy who I had despised a few days before.

The next few weeks, we hooked up a lot. We stopped watching movies and just fucked all day. It was a great experience. Finally, camp was over sooner than I would have dreamed and it was time to say good-bye. To me, this wasn’t hard at all, because it had been a friendship mostly. For him, it turned out to be much more. I decided to cut contact and just go on with my life. I knew now I was gay, but I didn’t want to deal with it at this moment. This dude was more than stubborn. He called me several times a week, just to hear my voice. It was gruesome at first, but I got the hang of it. Finally I allowed him to come over to my parents, as long as he would stay in the guest room. I could sneak in and fuck him at night and just pretend to be friends at day.

Finally, we both graduated and I decided to move to a bigger city to study Theatre and Film. I told him, that this had been the best time, but it was now over. I didn’t want to have a relationship with a guy and I decided that moving to a bigger city would make it easier to fulfill my sexual needs without having a clingy guy around all day. He „coincidentally“ decided to move to the same city and gave up his dream to study in the capital. I then agreed to move in with him. This was my biggest mistake.

Within the next year, I had fallen in love. This hadn’t happened to me before and so I got hit pretty bad. I felt secure and my bad habits came back. I stayed in while he was studying biochemistry. He was at uni all day, while I took care of everything. I learned to cook the most delicious meals out of boredom and made the laundry and whatever had to be done. My studies went well, but like before I would easily get an A on anything I tried.

He had always been very active and traveling around the world for internships and debating tournaments. I supported him and always felt like a man should have his space. I didn’t feel a need to work on my own needs and was fine with being the First Lady at most of his events.

Last year, I found The Red Pill. I read a lot of it, since I had too much time on my hands. Since I left my parents home I have been hanging out with theatre people. In my first semester I read the feminist basic literature and joined the gay union. It felt great finally living my true self and being accepted, fighting for rights or what felt like a revolution back then. It was not. The Red Pill to me was an abomination. It was straight white men claiming that women liked to be treated sexist. The irony is, that I didn’t even notice how I turned myself into a housewife at the same time.

About one year ago, my first boyfriend flew to one of his debating tournaments and I had to spent New Years with some of my gay friends. It was an okay night, but I began to feel a certain emptiness within this specific group of friends. I have observed this emptiness in a lot of gay men since then. To me, this lifestyle of hooking up wasn’t the way to go, since my relationship was doing great.

In January this year I picked him up from the airport after a long flight and he decided to go to bed immediately. I was still up and decided to go on reddit or anything and used his laptop. At this moment I noticed, that he was chatting with someone via Facebook and I decided to spy on him, which I hadn’t done before. Since he didn’t ever log out, I could easily follow the convo going on in the next room. Within the next half hour I figured out that he cheated on me while at the tournament. I confronted him, because I had no idea how to deal with such a behavior at this point. I was feeling too secure, that something like that could never happen to me. I don’t want to go through the whole process again, since it has just been tedious and I showcased a lot of my „beta“ qualities. After more spying (I know) it could easily be said, that he had cheated on me with at least 12 different guys within the last 18 months. I had been pretty naive to never suspect anything.

Everyone was convinced that it was all his fault. He was an ass-hole and i was this sweet innocent guy who deserved to have a loving partner. This was my truth as well and has been for the first months of the separation. It never occurred to me, that there were other possibly hotter guys out there and that I gave him the impression he could never loose me no matter what. At this time it dawned on me. I had to take care of myself and couldn’t expect someone else to fix me.

I have been changing my attitude to the Red Pill several times and I am still figuring out, what to make of it all. I have been working out a lot and studied much harder. When I first stepped into a gym I weighed a shocking 128 lbs at 1,83m and now weigh in a 158 lbs. I am still not there yet, but people have been noticing. When I look back it is shocking to see myself in these pictures. How I decided to look.

I am now in a committed relationship again, after some major twists and turns, but that might be a story for another time."

[What is Abrams like as a director from what you can tell? Where does his focus lie when making changes to a shot, scene, performance?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy25wvy?context=5)|What is Abrams like?  By far and away the most inspiring person I have met in the film industry. There were times when he would just stop us all and say ""Guys... We're making Star Wars"". In terms of style though, we could certainly tell that his focus was energy. A potentially dull dialogue scene was transformed by his choice of shot and his constant optimism. Performance wise, he had the patience of a saint. I remember a particular scene where one actor just wasn't giving him what he wanted. I have seen directors get furious very quickly over this, but Abrams just smiled all the way through. Totally knows how to get the best out of actors.
[How long were you on set?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy25wvy?context=5)|How long was I on set?
[Wow, sounds like Abrams is a pretty stand up guy. I'm sure he did a great job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy28a1d?context=5)|Whole heartedly agree.
[What was the production and the crew like? What was J.J. Abrams' process like? Did he talk to actors privately or did he do it another way? Were there alot of suits from Disney checking up on things?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26y70?context=5)|JJ has an amazing relationship with an assistant director called Tommy Gormley. He deserves huge credit. He has this piercing Scottish voice, and is the man who got shit done. He was very funny, but my god you wanted to please him. He was the one who talked over the ""God Mic"" whilst JJ would go and quietly talk to the cast. Not in a ""whisper so no one can hear us"" way. He was happy for everyone to hear!
 |The production crew had similar feelings to the extras I think. They just really wanted to make a good movie, and as a result everything seemed to work like clockwork. There was one particular day that was hell (the rally scene) but we all came out smiling in the end! Certain things have to be done on film sets no matter how painful and time consuming to get the finished article right. 
[Have you met/spoken to any of the main cast?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy264o6?context=5)|I had breakfast with Anthony Daniels on one of my first days there. I had no idea who he was! But he sat and had breakfast with me. Really down to earth guy and seems to love talking to the extras. He would ask us all what we do for a living and really try to get to know us.
 |I had minor interaction with the other cast members (smiles/nods etc) but they were all too iconic and intimidating for me! Plus, they're working... As an actor myself, that feels like walking into the CEO's office without an appointment.  
[Did you feel a bit nervours while on set at all? Since it being a really big movie and all that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26fy8?context=5)|Absolutely. The first few takes my heart was pounding. After all, extras work is such a mind fuck for an actor. You're so close to where you want to be and yet so far from getting there.
 |We were definitely aware we were making cinema history. That was where the nerves came from. There was absolutely no fear of a tyrannical AD or DoP or anything of that nature. We were constantly referred to as ""Star Wars Family"" and the fear was simply letting ourselves down in the context of the biggest film of all time. Hopefully we delivered!
[Hello Torin! I work for FakingStarWars.net a parody news site. Can you tell us about some funny things that happened on the set? Thanks! -JJsCat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy262ao?context=5)|Hi JJsCat. Sure! One of my favourite things was just JJ one day saying ""Okay everyone uh... Remember... It's energy energy energy. That's the most important thing. Always. 100% energy!""
 |We all looked around at each other taking in his enthusiasm, and they he just swivelled on the spot, pointed a finger at us, and said ""But NEVER... Let energy overcome quality.""
 |Also the time a fellow extra loudly farted in a massive set in the far background. The guys around the main action couldn't hear, but we we're in fits trying to walk normally!
[Are you trying to pull an Alexander Rhodes here and get top billing? I sure hope you are. And I sure hope it works.  Edit: The Jack Reacher extra from a couple years back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy276ps?context=5)|In all my heart, I want nothing more than to be an actor. It's just about taking this kind of work with a pinch of salt. As fun as it is, it isn't acting. I see it like a paid internship in the film industry - you can learn a great deal about what it's like on set, but you have to treat it like any other job you use to fund acting. It isn't your route to Hollywood but by god you can make the money do some work by paying for classes/head shots/showreels etc. 
[How big of a star wars fan are you? Have you been into it your whole life, making this some sort of a dream come true for you, or was it just something that kinda just happened?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy2645u?context=5)|I was just the right age to catch Episode I when it came out. This was my experience of Star Wars...
 |Haha. I could lie and tell you I'm a lifelong fan, but in reality I'm more just aware of the films in a pop-culture sort of way. I like them, don't get me wrong! But I'm not a superfan.
 |Having said that, when I was told what it was, I did shriek like a little girl.
[Haha. That's the only sensible reaction, in my opinion. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26byj?context=5)|Funnily enough, I was doing my dissertation in the University of Birmingham Library when I found out.
 |I tried to carry on writing, I really did. 
[Did you feel like you were really in the starwars universe and not just an extra?  How engrossing were the sets?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26mno?context=5)|Yes. The first day I walked onto the set was breathtaking. Nothing can prepare you for how real these sets are. They had a team from bioFX who were grating moss flown in from forests in Belgium for the floor. As far as I was concerned, I was there. Huge amount of effort, a lot of which will go un celebrated! So here's to those guys! 
[*They had a team from bioFX who were grating moss flown in from forests in Belgium for the floor.*  To think, how much money, effort, and time goes into every process that involves that mossy floor, for probably only a few minutes of screen-time that isn't even the object you're focused on...](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy278sq?context=5)|Utterly amazing.
[Why are you walking so oddly?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26mry?context=5)|Caught off guard... I had been talking to John Boyega about Identity School of Acting just before the take. They wanted me to overtake that group of soldiers walking past but each take they got closer and closer. What you don't see in that shot is me falling into them and them going over like dominoes. 
[Please tell me the domino take made the final cut!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27knr?context=5)|Haha! We looked clumsy almost every take! Didn't realise we were out of frame though so tried to style it out...
[Did you at any point think ""This is too much of an ANH remake, Abrams is not risking enough and instead making it too safe of a movie""? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26djh?context=5)|No. I don't for one moment think Abrams was playing it safe. Certainly, as a Star Wars fan himself, he was looking to emulate the lure of the original films. He was meticulous. However, at the end of the day there is that famous literary saying that all great stories can be boiled down into The Seven Basic Plots. Maybe he just came in one early... ;). 
[Are you aware of any, what could be considered, really good spoilers or key plot points? Obviously not asking for you to share them, but do you have that knowledge that others would have loved to know the past year or so?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy278ie?context=5)|Bear in mind I wasn't even officially allowed to tell my parents what I was doing. I have been sitting tearing my hair out watching all the leaks! I knew some major spoilers.
[If so, has it been tearing you up inside not to tell anyone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy278ie?context=5)|As tempting as it was to share them, JJ's insistence on ""Star Wars Family"" meant I didn't WANT to share them. I wanted (and still do!) people to enjoy the film spoiler free! 
[Did you play in any cool roles? Example- Rebel soldier, some civilian or a stormtrooper?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27ndc?context=5)|All of the above. I joked that the waistcoat character seen in the trailer is actually way out of his depth. I was one of the only ones in that costume on set and wasn't allowed a gun. As far as I was concerned I was an intern doing Alliance admin...
[Can you tell us what extra you played and how much screen time you had?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy268wl?context=5)|Well, I played the extra you can see in the trailer and some other masked roles. I'm afraid I can't tell you how much screen time I had as I haven't seen the movie yet! But I can guarantee it probably all boils down to less than a second or two. Haha! 
[Were the assistants treated humanely on set? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27gt0?context=5)|As far as I was aware. Obviously it's a hugely stressful environment. I'm sure some people got snapped at! But I know for example that Carrie Fisher's assistants absolutely loved her. She is totally charming.
[Besides your fellow actors how much in your scene was real i.e. not CGI?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy289ad?context=5)|They were so keen on keeping everything real. As I haven't seen the movie it's difficult for me to say... However, what I would say is that I felt like I was there. As far as was humanly possible, CGI was used rarely. 
[What were your qualities that landed you the role?  Height/weight/hair/eyes etc.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26hst?context=5)|5'11"", around 12 stone, long hair (so they can do what they'd like with it) and eyes didn't really come into it... Honestly though, the real secret was being easy to work with and eager to please, as in any job!
[You worried about getting in trouble with disney for doing this AMA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27wv7?context=5)|Yes and no. They're obviously scary. However, now that the movie is out, there are people sharing their involvement on all kinds of social media.

3x80b4,18,2015-12-17,I want to live a simple life but i feel trapped and uncomfortable with it.,hg1984,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3x80b4/i_want_to_live_a_simple_life_but_i_feel_trapped/,"Background: I am a 22 year old, male, college business major from Texas. I have a great family, and we are fortunate enough to be financially well off (as in my parents paid for my college in full). Sorry for my rambling, i will tldr.

I have (in the last couple of years) developed pretty severe depression/anxiety/ and stress to the point where i am meeting with a mental health professional. I believe i have developed these in large part because of lack of interest in most of the ""business"" jobs I look into or try. Example: I spent all last summer 50 hours a week on Quickbooks in a cubicle. Sound fun? Well it wasn't. Anyway, I want nothing more than to just finish out my degree (I only have about a year and a half left) and move some where simple where i can get a nice part time job (or something equally as easy) and live in a small apartment or house and live a nice, simple, stress free life. The kinda places you see on r/earthporn I enjoy hiking and biking and kayaking because they clear my head and release stress. That sounds so.. romantic to me. I have this idea in my head that all this corporate bull shit, where everyone screws every one else around, and I am constantly being bombarded with ads telling me what i need and why i'm not good enough. ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need."" -Tyler Durden

But here is my dilemma (Part 1 of 2):  
I grew up pretty well off, along with my friends who were in similar financial situations (and by we I mean our parents). So I went off to college and chose business as my major, thinking this was the path I was always meant to go down, along with my friends. Now, I am addicted. I see the new Mac laptops with the force touch track pads and the bigger better faster rotating anal bead 5000, and I want it. I NEED it. I am the exact brain washed consumer zombie that whoever is in charge wanted me to be. And I hate it. I don't like business, its stressful and I don't really want to waste my life in an office building moving around money for some CEO for the next 50 years just so i can afford an inflatable hot tub in every room of my house.

Dilemma (Part 2): I am terrified of failing or deviating from my current path. As much as i want to just take my degree and lack of debt and move to a nice small town near a nice river and get a dog. I just have this sick feeling that I will regret it. My dad doesn't necessarily love his job, but he motherfucking provides for us. Put me and my sister through school, Health care, even took my mom to Greece this year. He's the greatest dude I know. Now, he isn't pressuring me to become him or anything like that. I am pressuring my self basically. What if i move next to my river and meet a nice girl and knock her up? Now I have a kid and wife and a part time job.. And I will not, I cannot let them down, I will provide for my (hypothetical) family. But assuming i am living next to my hypothetical river, I probably have minimal work experience in the corporate world, and I am starting at the bottom level probably. I just can feel the pain of being a 35 year old intern, trying to make that paper for my family, and if i failed I know it would kill me to watch my hypothetical family go into debt because my 22 year old self didn't want put in the effort. I am also worried that because of my depression/anxiety, I will move to my river and never speak to anyone and become a recluse, which i don't want either. 

Now I know that my business degree doesn't force me to go into business. I could look into other fields, but I haven't really found any of those that interest me either. I like history, art history type stuff and traveling, but thats more because they always just felt like stories to me. Plus, once you start getting into actual historical stuff, I get bored with all the dates and political crap. 
Also, I know that i could look into National Parks, or Museums and maybe be able to provide for a family and not have a super high stress job. I just know myself and I think that I would either get burnt out on the things I actually enjoy, and I would be doing it for probably a mediocre salary. Additionally, I  just am sitting here typing this knowing that eventually, even by my river, I will see an add for the iPhone 17 plus, that now has holograms and I am just going to NEED it. But I won't be able to afford it because my 22 year old self didn't want to actually work for a living. The worst part is that I don't trust myself to make this decision. Between my anxiety/depression and the fact that I am a fucking child who got too drunk last week and puked in the shower, I just don't know what kind of adult I want to or should be.

So here is where I am at in my decision making process:
Option 1: I just continue down my path and try to limit the bad aspects of my corporate life, make a good salary and be financially stable, like my dear old dad.
Option 2: I say fuck it, and go find a river. Buy my dog and pick a place with a low cost of living.
Option 3: I go the complete opposite route and embrace my hatred of corporate life. Work my ass off while I'm young and resilient, save like the Great Depression is coming and try and retire as early as possible and live off my Investments/savings/401k, and maybe get a stress free part time job to supplement my income. 

PLEASE help me friends, where do i move from here? I realize as a 22 year old I probably shouldn't know all these answers, but I need to at least be moving towards my goal or end game, I don't want to stand still, flip flopping and doing a little of all of these and never actually finding my sweet spot. 

TL;DR: I want nothing more than to go live by a nice river and get a stress free job, but I am in so deep in our consumer culture and corporate BS that I am terrified of what will happen if i leave it behind. Especially if I end up not being able to provide for my family, and I don't trust my self to make this decision."

I used to intern at a charge card company as an entry level help desk support. HR and IT are located at the main office in a small building at the back. Other departments are located at another bigger shopping mall. To get to this other building, you have to walk across the either the road downstairs or go through the connected parking garage. That's why I always sigh whenever I have to go to the other building.

One day, my co-worker received a support request through WhatsApp.

&gt; ""QuestionMySarcasm, $user seems to be having problems with his laptop. Can you please go check it out?""

Wait, $user's laptop? I had just migrated his documents and data over to the new one the day before, and everything was properly configured. So yeah, that meant that I had to go to the other building to take a look.

&gt; ""So, what problem are you having with your laptop?""

I was nervous, since I was the one who configured it, and screwing things up and disrupting their workflow was one of my biggest worries.

&gt; ""My laptop isn't working. The screen isn't showing anything. Look, it's on.""

I peeked at the light indicators and indeed, it was on.

&gt; ""Um, have you tried restarting it?""

&gt; ""No. How do you restart it?""

I promptly held down the power button until it boots up.

&gt; ""Oh.""

We both laughed. And I wasn't even annoyed because $user was so friendly towards me :D

TL;DR I walked over to another building just to push a power button"
3x8n16,27,2015-12-17,The Bad Bet .,IliadsTangent,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3x8n16/the_bad_bet/,"TL:DR. The House of Hypergamy doesn't always win.

Body-
I've noticed an interesting phenomenon in my social groups of late. First we must understand what I'm referring to.

Most of us are familiar with the AF/BB system. Girl meets profitable boy, girl gets boy to legally sign over his assets in marriage, girl fucks local Alpha for physical genes, girl has kid, and from here its a paid future no matter what thanks to Western Family Court.

Yet chance offers no pussy pass. Sometimes the woman meets a man on the rise: an engineering student, perhaps. Maybe even someone in med school. Realizing if she doesnt lock down this prospect Some Other Female Will, she drags the guy to the altar by hook or crook .She gets married, he becomes a big time doctor, she punches out some kids and its happily ever after.

Then Something Goes Wrong. His program gets cut. The firm he interns at declines to hire him. The PhD. department drops him due to politics.
Med school sends him packing. Budgets get cut and his masters program is out. Any number of things can turn a man's fortune around for the worse, and when that happens Cupcake is toast.

See she's already married the guy believing he's going to be a success. When shit hits the fan, generally its she who becomes the breadwinner . She can't divorce him yet, as shed end up owing *him* alimony when the math is computed. She cant easily look for a new husband, because shes already married and would get shamed by the other gashes if she blatantly shopped for a new Beta. 

So she resolves to hit the CC on the down low. These women are so desperate for a way out of their jam that they'll basically throw themselves on any man even slightly higher value then her husband. It's beyond doubt she's cheated on him already, and will continue to do so until she finds a better Betabux.

This can have a devastating feedback effect for the man. He might be looking at doing something great in the world , he has a new wife, and according to society he's becoming a Good Man.
Then he loses his job , standing, or academic prospects. He may have to work at the local factory to make the rent. Then he finds out wifey is cheating, and our feminist churches will say God is holding him responsible for failing to provide as he promised when she married him. Everywhere he turns, people take her side of things . It gets even worse if she divorces him for a close friend or family with better success prospects. Even if she doesn't leave, he has to share his life with a frustrated harpy constantly angry she Bet On the Wrong Horse while her friends post Facebook updates from designer stores and island cruise ships paid for by THEIR RICHER husbands.
I know because my fastest social group lays have been with women in this position.

Lessons learned.
-DGM. Don't.Get.Married.
-Life will hit you with adversity. Whatever it may be , you as a man are facing it alone no matter what. 
-When the chips are down and life hands you lemons-as will happen to us all in some respect- being single means you can move , accept opportunities, change your surroundings and life as needed to get back on your feet without being weighed down by cupcake's demands and requirements. 
-Beware women who approach you on the way up. As fast as they come into your life they will leave it even faster should your fortunes change . Don't buy the hype, don't fall in love, or think that the stars are aligned because every box in your life is checked. The more money and status you make the harder you must work to sort and plate women. "
3x8nfo,0,2015-12-17,C+ in my first college CS class - what should I do?,passacaglia7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x8nfo/c_in_my_first_college_cs_class_what_should_i_do/,"I'm a freshman at one of the top 2 CS schools in the country. Took the most accelerated intro to programming class (in retrospect, not a wise idea; I had a conflict with the next-level-down CS class) this quarter and ended up with a C+ in the class. This class is known as the class the really ""hardcore"" CS people take, but as far as I know, most get A's and B's.

I did well on homework assignments (we had 7 fairly long programming assignments), but very badly on the exams - 60% on the midterm and then 70% on the final when the average was around 80%. I felt very slow to grasp the concepts compared to others in the class. I think I had too much confidence in my abilities; people in my class had taken Data Structures or built many successful apps in high school. 

I'm worried that this grade is going to hurt my chances (already slim as a freshman) of getting internships or research in the summer - it will appear that I couldn't perform well on the only CS class on my transcript so far. Over break I'm working on some outside projects - I really want to get better at building practical projects. 

Any suggestions on how to recover from this failure? I don't think I should take this as an indicator that I shouldn't do CS - it's my first quarter in college, this was the hardest programming class I could have taken, and I know that if I'd done the easier class, that most CS majors take anyway, I would have done fine. But I desperately want to improve, and I don't want something like this to happen again. "

I have also completed an internship in software engineering, honing my programming skills and filling in any knowledge gaps I might have had. During the internship, I learned more about relational databases and SQL concepts, web development, and using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain a software company website. I also learned to work with a software development team and use Java to develop business software packages that were sold to clients. I believe that having completed this internship has given me an even stronger foundation to do well in this Master’s program. 
During my career development, I have found myself being pulled in the direction of software engineering. The challenge and continual evolution of the field are exactly what draws me in.

Using open courseware, such as coursera.com, Udemy.com, MIT Open Courseware, and other credible online sources, I have built up my programming skills. I realize that not having a formal education may seem insufficient, but my drive and dedication to give myself an education should more than make up for the formalities of a brick-and-mortar institutional education. An online Master’s program in computer science will more than understand that an online education can be comparable to an “in-person” education, especially if the student is driven, as I am.

During the past two years, I have taught myself basic and advanced computer science concepts. Topics I studied include logic, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, databases, computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, software engineering, and software debugging. I taught myself to program in the following computer languages: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java. I also learned some SQL, both in-class and as part of a previous employment position.

I have also completed an internship in software engineering, honing my programming skills and filling in any knowledge gaps I might have had. During the internship, I learned more about relational databases and SQL concepts, web development, and using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain a software company website. I also learned to work with a software development team and use Java to develop business software packages that were sold to clients. I believe that having completed this internship has given me an even stronger foundation to do well in this Master’s program.

During my career development, I have found myself being pulled in the direction of software engineering. The challenge and continual evolution of the field are exactly what draws me in. Knowing that there is always much to learn, and that there is no cap on the knowledge base, drives me to continue on in the field.

In looking through the program’s coursework, I recognize many topics that I have studied or have been exposed to. I do feel prepared to take on the challenge of this program, and hope that you will allow me to. Having a Master’s degree in computer science will afford me the extended skills and credibility that will make me more marketable when I begin seeking programming employment positions.

He didnt get an internship because he was trying to graduate on time and so he doesnt have work experience. All our work at school was in java. That being said, there are really not that many junior java positions out there as of right now. Hes applied to big companies, mid size companies and startups. Not to mention, hes even tried to find internships but they wont take him because hes not still in school. He does have some side projects on github that hes worked on and is still trying to teach himself more to be competitive and his grades upon graduation were great. 

Hes interviewed a few times with companies but they clearly havent gone well and hes become extremely depressed and suddenly lacking the willpower to continue after constant rejection. Im trying to be as supportive as possible but I realize that hes in a tough position and I may not be able to offer as great advice as ya'll. I've suggested that he consider applying to graduate school as he is interested in AI and Machine learning (note: hes applied to ALL kinds of java related jobs even if they dont do AI and Machine learning). But he does have loans to pay off and would rather get a job. Honestly, what would do if you were in his position?

His schedule so far has been:

Wake up

Apply to jobs

code/work on side projects

interview prep

apply to jobs

In high school, I never did any programming aside from Codecademy, but I did a lot of math contests (USAMO, USAJMO, etc.).

I love CS because it has the same problem solving elements as math contests, and I prefer the theoretical side of CS to its programming/practical side, although I do enjoy both in the end. I also did machine learning research this past summer, which I really enjoyed; I'm looking for an internship for this upcoming summer, but I'm pretty convinced right now that I want to go into academia/research in the long run.

At this point, should I additionally major in math? AFAIK, it would be really helpful for theoretical CS; however, my major concerns are that it's a bit too late and a bit too much work, and I'm not sure if I'd like the material.

Please help... thanks! :)"

Currently I am in my second year of Computer Science, and although I like it to an extent, I am not comfortable saying that I want to spend the majority of my career coding. I have yet to gain any internship experience, so I am currently applying to any internship program I can find, although my GPA is not stellar (around 3.0) and I don't have any projects that I have completed outside of school. So, regardless, working on my own project will be my next step. 

As of now, my biggest concern is my lack of experience in the real world, so any advice pertaining to someone interested in tech who is still in college would be extremely helpful.

Also if anyone would like to ask me further questions so that I could clarify my situation, I would be happy to do so."
3x9gz8,198,2015-12-17,The Big Bug of '00,faisent,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3x9gz8/the_big_bug_of_00/,"This happened many years ago, in my first ""real"" IT job - it was almost my last because of the events I'm about to discuss.  Honestly, writing this is kinda cathartic...


$Company hired me because I could navigate a WindowsNT GUI, knew what a service account was, and wasn't afraid to learn Novell NetWare (I told you this was an old story).  They also hired me because one of my friends was the son of one of their Executives.  I was coached on the test by my interviewer.


$Company did accounting software; specifically asset depreciation.  Our customers were accountants, specifically Tax Accountants.  We had the entire US Tax Code in the office and updated the software every year, we did State Taxes as well, and updated that with greater frequency.  If you think regular users are bad, you've never spent over an hour on the phone discussing a five cent rounding issue on 10 million dollars of assets.


Accountants, I learned, are really intense about pennies.


As I'd done a bunch of customer service jobs in the past (over night shifts at $Diner for example) and because I wasn't actually crazy I ended up Tier-3 in short order and got to deal with the really weird calls and problems.  I'd get to look up bizarre tax-code relating to depreciating slot machines on Indian Reservations and then explain why we didn't have what was clearly part of the US Tax Code in the system to a raging accountant.  Fun stuff.


Then came new management; all the old execs were fired, the Developer leads were all gutted, QA slashed to the bone.  Luckily because of all this, our call volume was up and Tech Support was saved from the axe.  Horay!!!  I can't even blame QA for what happened next, those poor bastards were still reeling from seeing all their co-workers fired; empty cubicles piled high with discarded gear was their domain.  I *slightly* blame the devs, I'm sure one of them knew what that code contained; but I never figured out for sure.


I really blamed the new PM.  That woman was a nightmare for us anyway; complaining that ""Tech Support"" didn't do anything besides play games (we were avid Starcraft players on the local LAN) but when the queue is 80 calls deep and there's simply no end to your misery sometimes you just gotta nuke your friend.  She'd found some old code that ""Looked pretty useful"" and got it re-introduced into our 2000 release.  I don't know how she found it, whoever had quarantined it away was gone by then.  But she'd found it, and got it put into the new calculation engine to ""free up cycles"".


Yeah, basically it corrupted the database after a calculation.  It was a very *small* amount of corruption, and if you were a small shop that only did any tax stuff once a year you'd probably never notice it.  However, if you were an Enterprise Customer who ran multiple calculations a month on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets (our software being one of those millions...) you might notice that if you ran a calc on Tuesday and then ran the same calc on Wednesday you might be off a few thousand dollars, which would only get worse.  The same people who'd argue for an hour about a nickel were now seeing calculation errors several orders of magnitude higher.  


The ""cycles"" that PM had saved?  That was Christmas Break...we were heading into Tax Season.  And yours truly was the one who got forwarded all these ""weird calculation engine"" tickets.


Needless to say it was a nightmare; several of our better support guys left for greener pastures.  We had to put post-its with the words ""BE"" and ""NICE"" on our intern's monitor as he would frequently stand up and berate people in Mandarin.  Even the beaney-baby guy stopped talking to us in strange little beaney-baby voices -- what little joy in his life was replaced with this bug-induced madness.  My boss basically checked out but allowed me the luxury of only dealing with ""tier 3"" issues; instead of taking inbounds I was now expected to contact all of our Enterprise Customers tell them not to upgrade and then try to ""fix"" any of them that had experienced the issue.  


Thus began my month-long relationship with $Customer.  I'd call her daily.  *We'd try new and interesting things that wouldn't work.*  We'd both sigh together.  She was patient and kind with me; we even cracked a few jokes over our hours and hours of calls.  She was smart, I rarely had to have her get her IT guy on the line while doing database backups and restores.  I checked out the purchase order on her software license to see if she lived even remotely close.  I'm glad MySpace wasn't really a thing yet and Facebook hadn't been invented; I'm better off - no a better person - for not being able to cyber-stalk her.  Frankly, she was the type of user a help desk tech could fall in love with.  But $user/$support relationships should never be - for who knows who ultimately has the power?


After weeks, we reached a solution.  Before every calculation she'd back up her entire database.  She'd run the calc she needed and print off all the necessary forms.  She'd then restore the database so that she could do the same thing, *for all the 20-odd sites the company had scattered all over the country every month until the patch came out*.  She wasn't pleased.  The last thing she said to me still haunts me:


""*faisent* I'm not angry with you, you've been more than helpful to me the last few weeks and I know you tried really hard to come up with a solution that would work.  But I'm **angry** *faisent*.  Give me somebody I can be angry with.""


I put her on hold.  I could foist her off to the ""Customer Complaint Line"" (hosted by peers who's queue was at least as impressively deep as our own).  But $Customer deserved better, and I was smitten.  I walked over to the PM's desk.  She was there, eating her bottled-water and salad lunch (I really loathed this woman).  Back on my phone I told $Customer that I was going to transfer her over to the PM responsible for the latest release.  With a couple of presses and a transfer button she was gone, I never heard from $Customer again.


I did hear from the PM, my boss, my boss' boss, and up the chain.  I think my job was saved by the VP of Sales as I'd help him close a 250K deal before Christmas.  Regardless, about a month later I'd gotten my MCSE and was off to greener pastures myself.


I'm a grizzled old engineer now and can chuckle about days long past without twitching or medication.  I let my interns carry on shouting at customers for it helps keep them young.  I can spend an hour writing something up on Reddit because my systems purr like contented kittens.  


But sometimes around tax time I'll think of $Customer, I hope she got that patch..."

3x9upa,3,2015-12-17,Help getting motivated every day? (kinda long),bftrollin402,motivation,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/3x9upa/help_getting_motivated_every_day_kinda_long/,"So...I graduated college in Chicago in 2014, basically 2 years ago. At the end of that time (the last year), and since then, life has been tough for me and I'm trying to change my life in a positive way so that I can be an overall happier, healthier, and better human. Easier said than done.

Going back to college a bit, my last year/ year and a half, I realized I had been dealing with anxiety that was quite bad for some time, had a really shitty breakup, and suddenly got the most sick I had been in my life. For years I kinda knew that I had a problem with anxiety, but I always told myself that taking pills wasn't the answer, and I didn't believe in it. But, after a breakup and the added stress of the 2nd half of college, I just couldn't handle it. I remember a particular time when every day was a complete struggle just to get through it. I was doing things simply to get through the day, but nothing I did was really enjoyable. In one specific instance, I remember going to the art museum with a friend, and I couldn't concentrate on anything at all...even when we got food after, I had to force myself to eat because I knew I needed food, but I just felt like throwing up. It was at this point that I understood why people take medication for anxiety/depression...it was just too much to handle. I started seeing a therapist and got on Celexa/citalopragm. This helped a ton, but I have also felt a lot less creative than I used to be. I don't know if it's because of not having school to get me to do stuff, the medicine, or just me?...

Around this time I also got really sick and I needed an inhaler just to walk around and up stairs. I was given MANY doses of antibiotics &amp; steroids, which were really the only things that made me feel better. I started seeing a ton of doctors, who all just prescribed me the same stuff, not really knowing what caused it or what *SPECIFICALLY* it was that was ailing me. At this point, my asthma (I've never had it before) is pretty well controlled, but I still have shitty sinuses (chronic sinusitis, which I had surgery for), so I apparently need to get allergy shots and/or Xolair...but doctors really still don't have a definitive answer if this will solve my problems...This whole dilemma has been a huge area of stress and sadness for me over the past year +. It has made me super sad, and most of the time, I was unable to ride my bike and do a lot of the things that most normal people are able to do because I would need an inhaler a ton (way more than anyone should take), and then also couldn't breathe through my nose. A lot of friends and family have just not understood the pain and hardship involved with not being able to breathe. People told me to just get over it, and plenty of other sentiments like it. I know there are plenty of humans out there with lives much worse than mine, but this is still my life, and my pain, so I feel like it's still justified. Today, I can breathe through my nose, but cannot smell, which is also actually quite depressing. BUT, I have been riding my bike every day again, and have started the [C25K](https://www.reddit.com/r/c25k) program. I have began some of the changes, but still need to do more.

All that was basically a lot of background, and now to where I'm at now: I'm working in retail part time, and a restaurant/charcuterie place, and trying to become financially independent. Up to now, my parents helped me A LOT, especially when I was really sick, because I couldn't work as much. I realize how immensely lucky I am to have this help, so please don't harp on me for that. 

My problem is that I'll work 40+ hours a week, with the weekends usually having me work until 2am at the restaurant. Then, I end up sleeping in a ton, and working again. On days off, I end up still sleeping in, and don't get all the things done that I want. I end up just being worn out, and discouraged that I'm working paycheck to paycheck with minimum wage jobs. I have a huge heart, and a mind filled with all these things I WANT to get done and create. As I said before, I want to change my life for the better, and I want to use my regained ability to exercise to lose weight that I've always had and always hated...here are the things I want to do:

1. Get into Jiu Jitsu, in hopes that it will help with exercise (a good friend claims it's really fun, as well as a workout) and help me gain more discipline in my life that has been lost since leaving school.

2. Start creating again. I used to LOVE photography, but my school didn't show me AT ALL how to do anything after graduation. They didn't even make me do an internship to see what it might be like. I also love screen printing, letterpress, zines...the list goes on.

3. Continue C25k and run a 5k in the spring.

4. Start a daily mindfulness meditation practice.

5. other stuff that aren't entirely as important

I WANT to do all of these things, very badly! I have books on all the subjects, and watched plenty of videos...BUT where oh where do I build the DISCIPLINE or get the MOTIVATION and ENERGY to wake up early (or earlier) and get these things started so that I can actually get them done? Please shower me with your advice. I really appreciate you reading this, and potentially helping me.

3x9v5i,0,2015-12-17,C+ in first college CS class - what should I do?,passacaglia7,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3x9v5i/c_in_first_college_cs_class_what_should_i_do/,"I'm a freshman at one of the top 2 CS schools in the country. Took the most accelerated intro to programming class (in retrospect, not a wise idea; I had a conflict with the next-level-down CS class) this quarter and ended up with a C+ in the class. This class is known as the class the really ""hardcore"" CS people take, but as far as I know, most get A's and B's.

I did well on homework assignments (we had 7 fairly long programming assignments), but very badly on the exams - 60% on the midterm and then 70% on the final when the average was around 80%. I felt very slow to grasp the concepts compared to others in the class. I think I had too much confidence in my abilities; people in my class had taken Data Structures or built many successful apps in high school.

I'm worried that this grade is going to hurt my chances (already slim as a freshman) of getting internships or research in the summer - it will appear that I couldn't perform well on the only CS class on my transcript so far. Over break I'm working on some outside projects - I really want to get better at building practical projects.

Any suggestions on how to recover from this failure? I don't think I should take this as an indicator that I shouldn't do CS - it's my first quarter in college, this was the hardest programming class I could have taken, and I know that if I'd done the easier class, that most CS majors take anyway, I would have done fine. But I desperately want to improve, and I don't want something like this to happen again.

Thanks!"
3xa5la,319,2015-12-17,"Repaid $87,000 over the course of 4 years. Here are some strategies I used to get there.",GottheOrangeJuice,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3xa5la/repaid_87000_over_the_course_of_4_years_here_are/,"Hello PF,

As of today, I have officially brought my undergraduate student loan debt [balance to ZERO]( http://imgur.com/Lka9D06). It took 4 years, 7 months, and 12 days to get to this point. I wanted to post here to help anyone who is going to be taking on a similarly large amount of debt or is currently facing a large number like I was. I hope it helps. 

**Tip #1 – Know what you’re getting into before you take on the debt.**
When I was selecting where to attend college, the financial side was always on my mind. At the age of 18, I didn’t quite understand what debt really meant. Honestly, I didn’t really know what having to pay any bills at all meant. In high school, I worked jobs that let me pay for fun or easy things like going to the movies, gas money, or improving my wardrobe. I didn’t know what living on my own was going to mean financially and didn’t have an idea of what life after college would look like. Regardless, I always knew from the start that any money used to pay for college was on me to pay back. My parents very nicely offered to supplement my federal loans with Parent Plus loans, but all of that money was my responsibility to repay. It is key for you to make sure you understand who is going to be paying for what if others are involved in your college decision.  I also knew that I wanted to go to a pricier school. I ended up deciding on Penn State which, while a “state” school, comes with a big price tag. Luckily, I was able to talk about the cost of Penn State with my older siblings who also went there. I came to a rough estimate of $20,000ish a year. It was a little more expensive my first two years, and cheaper in the last two when scholarships came through.  All told, I knew I was committing to about $80,000 if I sent in my enrollment papers.  Even though I didn’t have a great grasp on how big that amount actually was, I knew it was a lot.

**Tip #2 – Don’t expect magic to happen. You’re paying for it, so plan for it.**
Even though it felt like money just magically appeared into my bank account at the beginning of each semester, I knew I was going to need a non-magical way to pay that all back eventually. So I started from Day 1 to set myself up for success. I was interested in the humanities in high school, loved History and English, but I didn’t know any History or English majors that were making decent salaries. I had to look elsewhere. On the advice of my sister, I enrolled in a beginning course for a relatively new college at Penn State, called Information Sciences and Technology, in my first semester. I had no previous tech experience, nor did I really know what IST was about. I lucked out, though, and had such a great time in that class that I thought “I can do this.” And I did. I threw myself into networking, coding, databases, project management, organizational alignment, etc. and learned it all with no prior experience. I forced myself into being passionate about a subject that I never even thought about before college. Meanwhile, I made sure to still do what I was interested in, and added a second major, Political Science, to my plan. I worked with my advisors from the beginning to figure out how to get it done in four years, and I then did.

**Tip #3 – Make your loans your Number One Priority.**
Looking for a job during senior year was fun. I had worked hard throughout college, so I was in a good position with a high GPA, internship experiences, and a different and interesting background (“Poli Sci too? That’s cool. Why?”). I also admit to having the advantage of being a woman in a male-dominated field. In 2010, companies were (and I would bet, still are) pushing for diversity in their hiring practices. They couldn’t say that being a woman was advantageous for me, but I knew it was. People who are successful take advantage of opportunities presented to them. I can’t say whether it’s fair or not that I got a leg up on the competition for being a female, but it wasn’t something I was going to work against.  I interviewed with at least ten companies. I had in-hand offers from four. And, at the end of the day, I went with the highest paying offer. Career growth opportunities, job satisfaction, location, etc. are certainly all factors in making an employment decision, but I knew those loan bills were coming in, and I made paying them back my number one priority. So I took the paycheck. 

**Tip #4 – There’s nothing more significant/impactful to paying back debt than your income.**
To have money left over at the end of the month, you need to make more than you spent. The only ways to accomplish this are to spend less or make more. I absolutely made every day choices to lower my overall spending, from never having cable to taking the subway instead of a cab. I made sure that a lot of my little financial decisions were sound. None of that, though, compares to just having a whopping paycheck come in each month. The best thing you can do for your financial goals is to have an income to support them. It helped me to not feel like I was pinching pennies all the time. 

**Tip #5 – Current salary can dictate future salary + always look for a better opportunity.**
Related, I have found in my own experience, that my starting salary influenced all my future salaries significantly. I worked for two years at a big consulting firm, and got a raise each year. Using that as my benchmark, I was able to be picky, but open, to new job opportunities. For a while, any reasonable-sounding job sent my way via LinkedIn, I interviewed for. Once I found a company (through a networking connection) that was very compatible with my skill set, I was able to make the move to a new and better job, with a salary jump. I can tell you honestly, I could have a very similar job as I do right now for half of what I’m making now. In business, no matter what people say, a salary is used as an indicator of performance, and people will pay for what they perceive as value. I also made sure to **ask for more.** Remember, they want to get you for as little they can, but when they like you and want you, companies will give you more than you think they would. I always put out what I considered to be unreasonable requests, and yet, I never got “We don’t want you anymore. Never mind.” It’s always, “Well, here’s where we can meet you on that request.”

**Tip #6 – You are not your friends.**
Unfortunately, you didn’t get the easy button for life. Your parents didn’t pay your way through college, but all your friends’ parents did for them. UNFAIR. Or, your friends are always going to expensive dinners and eating out for lunch and just bought a new Ford Focus, and you want to too! You need to tell yourself “I am not them. I don’t have those luxuries. I don’t have a winning lotto ticket.” I, of course, dealt (and still deal) with that. Did I like driving the 2000 Dodge Intrepid with a broken seat, peeling paint, and a horrible screeching noise every time I locked the doors? Nope, but I drove it until it died. Then I bought a very sensible 2007 Honda Civic and plan on keeping that for ten more years. My friends can enjoy their awesome Mustangs and Focuses, and I will get along with my little economic car. I will be enjoying my new debt-free life. And that’s important to me. I’m not my friends so we don’t have the same goals. I don’t bother comparing my life to theirs. 

And finally,

**Tip #7 – Always ask yourself: “Do I want this more so much that I am willing to delay my future goals of: XXX”**
I have financial goals. They include(d): 

A)	Paying off student loan debt

B)	Affording a nice apartment

C)	Owning a home

D)	Paying for my future children’s college

E)	Retiring without financial worries

These are things that are important to me in my financial life. Times when I was trying to decide whether to make a purchase that didn’t fit my budget, I would try to ask myself if it was worth it to delay my timeline on those items. That would help me to put down those beautiful leather boots that I knew I would wear all the time and would definitely get a great value for. It would also empower me to say yes sometimes. I’ve now traveled to Europe: Italy, Ireland, Germany, Czech Republic, Norway. I feel ok about delaying my future home buying in order to experience something as amazing as travel. By thinking of your smaller financial decisions in context of those larger ones, it helps you to remember your priorities and logically evaluate whether it’s worth it to delay them. 

I hope this was helpful for some people who are working through their own pile of debt. Just remember, you will pay it off. It’s up to you on how fast you can accomplish it. 

**TL;DR:** If you sign up for a big bill, plan to pay it back, take advantage of opportunities, be your own advocate, don’t compare yourself to others, and remember your priorities. "

A little about myself, I am currently a student in the medical field, but I just finished all courses and only have 2 internships left. I use my computer for note taking and studying, but that will be on a more limited base now. Otherwise I just surf the web mostly.

I was planning on getting the M3 or entry level i5. Recently I have been seeing posts about alternate options on the market, and am wondering if one of these maybe a better option for me, as they are generally less expensive for similar or higher specs (RAM, SSD, processor). I am wondering if I should go with something like the Dell XPS 12, Lenovo Miix 700, Lenovo Yoga 900, or another machine."

I just graduated college two days ago, and already she is making me feel like a failure for not having a job offer lined up and for ""doing nothing but sitting around all day."" She claims I've hurt her SO MUCH and been a horrible daughter and blahblahblah. I tried to stick up for myself just now and it went horribly. It ended with me hysterical in tears and her screaming, kicking things, telling me she doesn't even know this person I've become, and acting like she is 100% in the right here. 

Her perception of me is so messed up. She thinks I sit around all day? I just graduated summa cum laude two days ago. I work an intense internship almost 40 hours/week. For the last two years I did this and went to school full time. ""And I haven't seen a cent of that money!!"" Yeeeaaahh...it's my money. I worked for it. By the way, she doesn't work. She ""sits around all day."" Her trying typical day involves household chores, working out, walking the dogs...

I have been actively applying for jobs both in- and outside the company I'm at now. Nothing. I thought I might have been able to move into a position that just opened up in my department, but found out yesterday I basically have no chance. The reason why is no fault of my own. Now, after my internship ends at the end of the month, I'm going to be stuck at home with her without any personal income until I can find something else. It's hard to get a job right now, it seems, even with a degree.

She claims I'm so mean and disrespectful and hurtful to her. The projecting here absolutely blows my mind. I am not this person she thinks I am. I realized while she was yelling at me how much she truly resents me. I realized she doesn't unconditionally love me.

I wish I could escape this. My nmom controls my life. I feel extremely depressed and discouraged. I just can't do this anymore. I wish she had chosen not to have children. I don't think she deserves to be a mother."

This fall, I lowered my credits to 13 and instead of getting a part-time job, built my resume with clubs, learn basic professionalism, and score decent grades. It was stressful, time-consuming, and I had to jump through every hoop imaginable.

If i take summer classes, i will  be taking the data structures/algorithm class in fall of 2016, which i assume would have me up to speed for competent internships for the next summer due to my background in algorithms and more competent programming.

Bedridden for years. Recently diagnosed with: Autonomic Dysfunction with Vagal Neuropathy, Reactive Hypoglycemia, Gastric Dumping Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Chronic Daily Migraine. This is all because I continuously pushed for answers.

Everyone in my life has abandoned me. I am constantly surrounded by ignorant narcissists and cannot get help. Doctors have dismissed symptoms for years, yet I persisted and finally got a diagnosis that explains the rest of my symptoms (Autonomic Dysfunction).
The problem is the treatment doesn't work, my symptoms are not manageable, I'm unable to function, I have been homeless on and off for years because I am unable to work, and my cognition is in the toilet (brain fog). I am constantly blamed for this condition, as if I did something to deserve this. I've done some time in the Army, was an exercise fanatic, always excellent in school, and have done two internships in a place most would only dream about prior to becoming ill. It amazes me how quickly people forget who I used to be and how they authoritatively tell me I'm depressed.

Now I'm at the point where I'm educating doctors based on research I've done on pubmed, and demanding testing be done. Most won't listen to me or take me seriously, and even if they decided to humor me and run some ""different"" testing a lot of it isn't covered under insurance. I'm looking into things like ""intestinal permeability"" since I react to most foods, and ""organic acids testing"" because I need to know what my nutrition levels are. Most docs give me another Rx for zoloft before they even consider proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, and mental/sexual/spiritual health, which in my mind is complete bullshit.

The healthcare system is broken in this country. The Veterans Affairs department is only good for shooting me up with more psych drugs that I don't need. Turns out my psych issues are autonomic related, and had I listened to myself years ago I wouldn't have gone inpatient psych over 10 times due to the psych drugs themselves!

I guess this is my last resort: posting online. Any and all advice would be great."

I currently work (as a full time intern) at a small firm in NY.  I started in March this year and when I applied I told them upfront that I did not intend on staying with the firm as I have an offer from a top 10 public accounting company that I have already accepted.  Well, now its crunch time.  As I am preparing to leave, my last day being next week, the managing partner has reached out to me several times over the past few weeks asking me to stay as he thinks I am an excellent worker and I fit in very well with the firm.

Long story short, he made me a soft offer stating that he would definitely pay me more than my new job is offering.  Also noting that tax season hours are 56 hours **maximum**, whereas at my other job i'd be working 55 **minimum** and most likely closer to 80-90.  All other benefits would be the same as far as insurance and 401k matching etc.

My future career goals are to own my own small public firm (like the one i'm interning at).  But as a recent graduate (MBA &amp; passed CPA), I feel as though I will miss out on opportunities by NOT working at a bigger firm, especially it being my first job... however, I don't know if these thoughts are valid.  Working at this small firm, I could learn everything I'd need to open up my own place and my potential clients might not really care whether or not I have ""Big 4 Experience"".  And working at a smaller firm will help me be more diverse and learn more nuances than just cranking numbers onto a form at a large public company.

So basically my dilemma is I think I would have a better work life balance and be paid more my first year (not sure about how raises work around here or the other place) than if I worked in a large public accounting place... but on the other hand I feel as though I am missing out on other potential career paths by not working at a large firm.

So my question is, is not starting my career with a large public accounting firm detrimental to my long-term career in accounting? Is it reasonable to say maybe a few years down the line I decide I want to work for a bigger firm I won't have an issue finding a job? If I wanted to switch to private accounting, what kind of position am I in since I don't have large public firm experience?

Thanks"

3xapn3,0,2015-12-17,How am I doing so far? Having doubts about my future in this industry,csthrowaway0x0001,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xapn3/how_am_i_doing_so_far_having_doubts_about_my/,"Hello, I am currently a junior comp eng student, basically half was done with university. After reading this sub, I am having a lot of doubts about my performance so far and if I will succeed in the future.

I am a student from Waterloo, currently has completed my 3rd co-op term. I will be going into my junior year in the winter for computer engineering.

In terms of co-op, I have had 2 co-ops in Canada, first working with Java and .NET, second working with .NET and Angular/web dev. My 3rd co-op term is in the United States working with Java and Angular.

 I do not have many huge side projects though, only 2 I would consider to be somewhat worthy to present. The first one is a C# program that controls the Thalmic Lab Myo that can be used to configure any movement and can recognize it along with profiles and portfolios, I use that to play games with motion. The second one is just a chatroom bot that I thought would be spiced up if I hook up a backend server to it and its own database to be able to become somewhat of a personal assistance. This chatroom bot is also written in C# with ASP.NET

However, I am a huge hackathon attendee with 8 hackathons under my belt, 3 with winning mentions. Most of the hackathons though I work on the backend server side writing it in ASP.NET with C# and getting it hosted up in Azure.

I also have a personal website that is not very much, I am personally not much of a UX/UI person so it feels fairly static (as in no fancy animations, just some gradients to get the flow better and Angular to help me with forms and bindings)

I also would say my mark are adequate enough, currently with a 85% average or in my school's GPA terms, I think a 3.7

Now, comparing my portfolio with other people, it feels inadequate. My peers at my current coop location are also avid hackathon attendees with over 50% win rate and have won over thousands of dollar of prizes, I have barely went over $200 with winnings. They also have many fairly insane side projects that are huge or are used by other people (downloaded from play or app store). Many of them also have contributed to open source projects. At work, they made it known that they look down upon me with my coding quality (although my manager praise me that my coding skills are far above his level of expectation from the likes of me) and my commits. Comparing myself to them, I seriously feel inadequate.

Comparing it to the people in this sub, it feels like I am behind if by the next coop term, which is in the summer, I do not get a job in a unicorn start up or a big tech company. I personally feel my portfolio is not even adequate for such because my peers have gotten interviews but not offers with those companies and I do not think my skills are comparable to them. They are also in CS or SE while I am only in CE

Another concern was that for my 3rd co-op term, if you know how the waterloo co-op system works, that basically in my first round of application which we are only limited to 50. I have gotten no interviews and was the only one in my class that had gotten no interviews during the first round. Although I only applied to desirable US companies for internships, I felt that I was behind as compared to my class based on how I performed. It was by absolute sheer luck that I got this job in the United States because the person that got the offer was probably asleep by the offer acceptance deadline and I was the back up.

I also feel like my language and stack of choice is a huge concern. After reading the article about what people Y-Comb companies want, I have to say just due to my language choice alone, I fall under the enterprise developer, which they do not want. I have to admit that I am very comfortable with development on windows and in all still foreign to development on Unix based systems even though I had 1 coop term to work with it. I feel by this alone makes me an undesirable candidate.

For interviews, I also feel like I do not have enough experience with technical interviews as I have only gone through 3 of them while my peers have went through at least 10+ with companies that do multi-round interviews. These days, I do program everything I can from Hacker Rank and CTCI but I do not know how it will translate to real world interviews.

For marks and performance in school, I do apply everything I learn and I believe my mark is high enough. My class ranking is always in the top 10 BUT I am not on my school's dean's Honor list. For my school and my program in particular, to get on it is a formula that basically is only for people with 87 or 88%+ averages or 3.9 gpa. (average - class percentile &gt; 80)

Overall, I am just concerned with my current portfolio and how I am currently doing. Comparing myself to others makes me feel utterly inferior and it is through plain luck that I have gotten some of the things I have today. I do believe that my luck will run out and I do not want to be left behind. I want to end up with that dreamed and desired job on the west coast getting paid a lot or making things that will truly change the world. I DO NOT want to end up being an enterprise developer living life looking forward for the day to end so that I can just get home. Basically, I want to get to somewhere with my career and know that I did well instead of just wasting it to get by.

Overall, here are my concerns

* peers are better than me as compared to me
* my portfolio does not feel like it is adequate
* it is through luck that I got an internship in the states
* My tech stack is very Microsoft/Java or ""enterprise"" based
* I am not on my program's dean's honor list
* my interview skills are behind compared to my peers

Thank you for reading and any suggestions for what I should do to be ready or to make myself adequate to work at the dream companies are really appreciated."

Yes!
I wouldn't have gotten this without FCC. I am a senior computer science student, but this isn't why I got the internship. I started FCC because I had an ""Oh, shit!"" moment this summer, realizing that I have BS'd my way through my entire CS program and don't really know any coding at all and am not employable. Now, 4.5 months later, I'll be one of three interns starting in mid January. They said that as an intern I will be dipping into many different projects but will mostly be using JavaScript and Python, languages I have never used in school. 

How I got it: 

In the online application, they provided links for personal websites, projects, etc. I linked my portfolio that was the first zipline on FCC. On my portfolio I also have 6 projects I did through FCC, including the pomodoro clock, calculator, quote generator, etc. I don't think my website works correctly on anything but firefox, so I'm grateful that whoever looked at it was using firefox because they ended up calling me to set up an interview. 

The interview went pretty well. I bombed the question on prototyping, I said something like ""Prototyping involves inheritance..."" and you could tell that they were expecting more, but I drew a blank, and we moved on. Whatever. Otherwise, it went pretty well. Just kind of told them I'm really motivated and excited to learn as much code as possible. 

They did ask me about my lack(or non-existence) of Python experience, since the job does involve a lot of Python, and I just told them that JavaScript has been my primary focus but I still understand the core concepts of OOP that translate to all languages so I will have no trouble picking up Python. I think that was my ""make or break"" question. 

Anyways, starting in two weeks. I'm more nervous than excited, I hope I know enough to be useful. I know that this is a huge opportunity, so I've been coding non-stop for the last couple of days and probably will continue doing so leading up to my first day.

I realize it's not a full time career, so I still plan to keep using FCC for the projects to add to my portfolio. I will also continue to check the news section of FCC often, lots of interesting stuff is posted there.  

Also - this might be helpful to some people. Since my ""Oh shit!"" moment, I try to be as productive as possible on a daily basis. Prior to that I watched a lot of TV. Now, if I'm ever watching some random TV show like family guy by myself, I think ""This isn't making me a better person, I'm not learning anything useful, I could get on FCC right now and code. That's productive."" I cannot tell you how many times I've done this, and how many hours of coding directly resulted from that thought. Throwing that out there, maybe somebody else will get motivated to do the same. 


**TL:DR;** I got an internship. The first round of ziplines on FCC are what got me the job. That includes the portfolio, the pomodoro clock, quote generator, and the calculator. Uploading the portfolio to a legitimate hosting service with a URL was also imperative I think. I use godaddy.

3xb0mh,2,2015-12-17,[ROLEPLAY]Elevators,colin_000,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/3xb0mh/roleplayelevators/,"Johnathan hurried through the crowed, toward *Vickers International*. Towards work. A large building part of the Saigon skyline. He had recently gotten a job in Saigon from the company, and it was his only way out of the debt he had accumulated back in Pennsylvania. John entered the building in a hurry, scanning his card, and stumbled into a glass elevator.

""Excuse *me*, Sir."" Said a lady with an obnoxious British Accent. 

""I'm sorry, what?"" Replied John who was fumbling through some papers. 

""You spilled my coffee. Onto me."" Said the lady. 

John, his mind elsewhere, responded, ""Well thats a shame. Because it seems like your the type of person who *really* needs there coffee."" *Could this elevator ride go any longer?* John slowly took a few steps away from the woman, and bumped into a person. *People.* John thought angrily.  

""What do ye fookin think yer doin' mate?"" Said a tall, scruffy man behind him. 

""Oh sorry, I didn't notice you were there. Your awfully quiet and er... un-noticeable I guess."" John cringed at what he had just said. 

The man looked quite pissed off. The doors finally slid open, ""I... I should go now."" Said John, who stepped off, and waited for another elevator to take him to his next floor. 

John was already having a particularly bad day, but of course, it got worse. He was given the wonderful opportunity to present his 'work' to his boss. 

""I-er... "" John, paused, clearing his throat, ""I present a er-project that I have been working on."" John, with terrible odor and sweat literally dripping down him, hurried to turn on a slide-show. 

""Y-you see, here, I have something that I have been working on. I-if we were to produce this we could make it big on the marke-"" John was interrupted by his boss, sitting lazily at the table. ""I have been told repeatedly that the software is *fine.* Now, we are losing ground here and have budget constraints. No, I will not be giving your department a raise."" 

John stared at the man, he didn't even consider his ideas. He had already been working for months on concept art and story writing. The man looked at him like he was useless, talent less. 

John started to well up a little with tears, ""Sir, I'v-I've been working on this for a while. Please just look at what I have to offer. Look here, the story line would be brilliant! We could have a sort of space epic, it would inspire kids. I've already got the concept art laid out, a-and-"" 

""No. Go home, I've seen enough."" Said the man. The man acted like John was an annoying little twat. 

John nodded, tears welling in his eyes. ""Yes sir."" 

John pitied himself for the following afternoon. He wished he was more confident, maybe they would have listened to him. Maybe, in High School, if he would've just taken that internship, or actually took his chances with woman. He hated himself for not ever branching out and making friends. Sure, there was people he could talk too, but no one *really* ever considered him a friend. If he would've worked on those social skills early on- who was he kidding? Look at him, he was a loser. A virgin. Poor, with nothing to show for. And single. 

John stirred cream into his coffee, and stared into it. The past two years of work were crushed in an instant. John looked at Saigon as a place of opportunity, a new chance at life. But no, the same people ruled over him as before, giving him simple and plain work, with no where to go. 

He laid down, an irking stress pained him. What was he going to do? How long would he have to work with this company? What would they say about him? John laid restless as he had for many years before. 

This time, he had no more hope left in him. This time, he was practically pulling himself to the next morning. This time, he was a truly hopeless cause. "

3xbdck,1,2015-12-18,I [22f] am a junior level psychology major doing undergrad. I want very much to do well and make it into a grad program. I do not want to work anymore while studying but I am terrified of debt. Advice?,karmicdancer,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3xbdck/i_22f_am_a_junior_level_psychology_major_doing/,"Tl;dr : I [22f] am in my junior year of undergrad pursuing my psychology degree. So far I have not had to take out loans because I have prepaid college credits and have worked fulltime since I was 18. University is harder than community college was and I see I cannot continue working like this and hope to do well. I am very scared of student loans. Advice please!

......

So I am currently a junior level psychology student and have realized I can't do fulltime work and hope to do well in University (transferred after I got my AA). While I love art and writing, my deepest desire has always been to be in the mental health field, perhaps as a therapist or counselor but I want to be able to have freedom within the field to change my job in case I get burnt out as a therapist, since many people do. I am serious about going to grad school, after many years of considering the pros and cons. So I want to do AWESOME now that I'm at University. I want to do well in my classes, hopefully get a part time job or internship related to mental health, join clubs and organizations (I have no interest in going Greek though) and I want to make it into the psychology honors society, as I think it would be good to have these experiences in my background and to network with others who will be in my field. 

But I am terrified of taking out student loans (and many tell me, with good reason). My roommate currently has $30,000 in debt after he graduated, and seems very calm about it, and has told me most people at college have to take out loans. But if I am looking at grad school, I know that I'm going to have to take out loans in the future too, and the idea of all this debt is overwhelming. If I can make it through undergrad without going to debt, I would feel much better about taking out loans for grad school. I don't know how these kids can be so calm about these huge piles of debt and I feel that they don't look at the reality of how much money that is and that it will probably be more to pay back with interest. I don't want loans to ruin my life, and have read many stories where they did ruin the person's life.

All that being said, I always file my FAFSA. I have not gotten very much at all from FAFSA in the past, usually only about $1000 - $1500, due to my age, my job, my grandparents income (they legally adopted me as a baby), etc. This month my grandpa retired meaning that both of my grandparents are now retired, and they cannot help me at all monetarily and I wouldn't want them to anyway. I also quit my job due to a bunch of personal health issues and life problems I have been going through that I won't go into, but that job sucked my happiness from me, and I am glad I quit. FAFSA has gotten me only $1500 for the upcoming spring semester even though I filed as an independent (not sure I did this properly, as I did have to give my grandparents income information), and with my own savings and the possibility of a part time job (as long as it does not mess with my grades) I think I can make it through this semester. But I need a financial plan for the semesters after that, I definitely want to take summer courses, and I am not sure that the Prepaid college program is going to stretch all the way to the end of undergrad because I wasted some of the credits as a freshman.

I have wondered if I would be able to get any disability financial aid since I am diagnosed Bipolar and have several years history of medical visits, one baker act, and it definitely effects my quality of life and ability to do well in school. I have researched some mental health scholarships and do plan on applying. I have not filed for any kind of disability with the government and am not sure if that's the right thing to do.

I am most concerned with the FAFSA. I feel like I have not been filing it true to my situation and that is why I receive so little aid. Also since all of these income changes happened at the end of this year, when I file in January, it's going to show that my grandparents and I had an income and thus result in a higher EFC. I want to sit with someone knowledgeable about the FAFSA, tell them my situation and see if they'll babystep me through the one I have to file in January, but I don't know who to turn to, as the financial aid office at my university can be difficult to deal with.

I have promised myself to see this degree through and take out loans if I have to, but I definitely don't want to do that. Can you guys give me any advice or information that might help me? I am located in Florida."
3xbfb8,7,2015-12-18,I know I'm trans. But I don't know the trans___ part.,genderconfused675429,genderqueer,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/3xbfb8/i_know_im_trans_but_i_dont_know_the_trans_part/,"Hi /r/genderqueer!

You all seem nice and supportive so I figured I'd make an account just to post here. :) Sort of a throwaway but I might keep it around.

So, to keep things short, I'm AFAB and realized I am transgender about a month ago (after over a year of self reflection, examination, experimenting with labels, and experimenting with my gender performance)! Yay! This made me really, really happy, probably the happiest I've been in years. I felt like I found the missing part of myself. The first time I declared, ""I am transgender"" to my therapist I cried tears of joy. :')

A day passes and I'm still pretty happy, but quickly become depressed within a week. My baseline has changed from ""meh"" to ""happy,"" though. I smile when I think about being trans.

Then, I realize.. okay, so I know I'm trans. And trans is an umbrella term.

I'm trans, but I'm trans*what*? I have no idea. Up to this point, I had only heard about binary trans identities. Nonbinary was a very .. out there concept to me. Am I a transman? I don't know. When I think about being male, it makes me feel nauseous, and suicidal.. for some reason. I have no idea why. There's some little yellow flower of happiness in there, but it's so buried I can't see it. 

As for my identity: I guess right now I'm going with neutral because I'm figuring things out. I don't feel female but might feel male. I am 100% certain I am not female. 

To sum it up, my therapist has been a great help to me for over two years, for reasons unrelated to gender. But.. she didn't know the difference between gender identity and sexuality, misgendered and deadnamed her transman intern while telling me about him, and I feel that the two of us are at a strange point where she may not be able to help me anymore.

So, to end this rambling: does anyone have any resources to help me figure out the trans*what* part? I would like to see a gender therapist, but I am a very broke, poor, college student. The only reason I could see my current therapist is because my tuition already paid the fees.

Any advice is appreciated!!

Thanks!"
3xbfya,4,2015-12-18,No internet connection from Cisco router,TheOnionKnight1954,HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/3xbfya/no_internet_connection_from_cisco_router/,"So I snagged a decommissioned Cisco 1841 router from work so I could learn how to set it up (I'm a network infrastructure intern, hoping I can eventually make a career out of this) and I'm having some issues getting internet connectivity.

The router is currently set up with an outside interface connected to the wall (which is wired to my cable modem, I have no physical access to my modem in my apartment), with a laptop connected to the inside interface. As far as I can tell everything is set up correctly. I can ping the modem both from my laptop and from the router, but no internet traffic can get out. NAT seems to be working as intended, interfaces seem to have correct IP's. Plugging my laptop straight into the wall works perfectly fine, as does my wireless Belkin router, so I'm not sure how this is any different or what could be causing the problem.

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this or if I should be taking this to /r/networking instead but this seemed like the appropriate place since this isn't really for an enterprise network.

If somebody has an idea of what the problem is, it would be greatly appreciated. I've been fighting this for almost a week now.

Config file: http://pastebin.com/zxiQah9i

Edit: Finally figured it out. After I added default routes like you guys suggested and it still didn't work, I remembered that I had to register the MAC address of anything that would be connected to the modem onto my account with my ISP. Once I did that, everything worked perfectly. Thanks a lot for the help!"

So I walked in the graduation ceremony on Tuesday this week, but all our grades weren't in and I was nervous about my Systems and Controls class. I needed at least a C to graduate. I had failed it the previous semester and it was a subject that I just could grasp no matter how hard I tried. And on top of working my internship while I'm doing school full time including my senior design project, I wouldn't have had the time to put forth the needed effort for ME to do well in it anyway. So 2 days later on the hard deadline when grades are due I check my grades and sure enough I got a D. So I check with my professor to see if there was ANYTHING AT ALL that could be done to help me out so I graduate and officially roll into my job. Long story short he tells me that I was so close and agrees to help me out and bump me to a C and that he wouldn't want me to not graduate because of a graduate level course. My knees got weak. Just couldn't get out without one last heart attack. Well, it's been pretty dope r/engineeringstudents but my time here is complete. Good luck to all of you and keep working hard!"

I graduated in 4 years instead of 3, I would delve into the specifics, but it was a mixture of family and personal problems that began at the end of my first year, something I refused for a long time to acknowledge were affecting me.

So I graduated without an internship or any projects under my belt, spent a few months stagnating, because I didn't know what I wanted to do, then went on a working holiday from December, worked in hospitality for some months and did a lot of travelling. Came back, did some proofreading of company documents on the side. None of this really added anything, a recruiter recently told me, they don't care, all they care about is stuff to do with programming. So I'm feeling a little like, wow, I should have just tried to get a job before my degree finished instead of apparently wasting my time overseas. But the past is the past, can't do anything about it now.

So during my degree, my strongest language was always Java, things like SQL, HTML, CSS I picked back up through codecademy recently, I learnt AJAX, Javascript and XML during one of my modules too, but I prefer to cast them as 'familiar' to me, because I've never done a project in them like I've done with Java.

I don't even know what being proficient is. According to one site, if you can't manage a practice question on topcoder you can't program your way out of a paper bag, which is disheartening because I tried one of their easy questions and found it really difficult. 

Am I supposed to enjoy programming? 
When I'm trawling through the problems in CodingBat and SPOJ, I don't think, oh gee, this is so amazingly fun; I could live and breathe this. Granted there is a degree of satisfaction and relief when a program works and passes all the tests.
Is it also bad that I need paper when solving problems? I feel like when I solve problems, it takes me too long to do it and then when I implement it, there are much more efficient and simpler ways. And I sit here thinking, why did I not think of that, why did I not think of using that data structure? 

One of the things in my degree that got me interested was a module to do with designing apps and websites, human computer interaction, taking colour and layout etc. into consideration. I even got to draw panels of what my group's app would potentially look like, the whole prototyping process was actually fun, the user testing was fun and learning about the psychology behind how people perceive things was fascinating. 
I also really liked making a website in my first year, because the result was so satisfying, it looked pretty, it did things, I could click and it would take me to new pages. 

* Should I hold off on applying for jobs until I have something more substantial in my github account? 
* Does it matter what I want to do, because I’m currently just applying for everything to do with software development? 
* Would it be better to just try and get an apprenticeship somewhere instead? I’m thinking I should try looking at graduate internships too and the local job fairs.
* How bad is an unemployment gap?
* Should I put the code I do for competitive programming into my github, or should I just link my account back to my LinkedIn?
* LinkedIn don’t have an option for putting how good you are at a programming language, do I just put it anyway?

(Does Wiltshire even have Java software jobs?)
I'm starting to think I should just apply for jobs relating to my work experience now, because I feel like a lost cause."
3xby4m,2,2015-12-18,I-Testify!,iQualityTest,softwaretesting,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaretesting/comments/3xby4m/itestify/,"Today's world, where media is revolutionized by the internet, where protests are held by sharing relevant web-content supporting a cause, where amendments to the constitution is discussed more on the wall of a virtual world, than within the walls of our parliament, when the depth of ancient Indian culture is auctioned for videos like AIB Roast and feminism is misconstrued by MyChoice, I finally decide to raise my tiny squeak for being a ""Software TEST Engineer""  and to express the reality of my existence in this so called Corporate-Global-village. I could be alone about how I feel, I could be backed by many, but all that matters is, unfortunately ,this feeling now EXISTS.

A recent article ( again on a popular social networking site) spoke about how our Indian society compels you to be the BEST in whatever you do, yet do ONLY the things what everyone else is doing. It speaks about how you should follow a prototype life and deviating from it even by an inch would mean your blood is suddenly not red anymore and you are all of sudden a rebellious-Indian. There were times when people branded youth as MTV-[V]-Influenced youth!(sounds as-if some virus attacked these youth!). 

This article compelled me to think of all the times when I have wanted to do things differently. One such major thing was career. But when I had to make the choice, Software Engineers were the BEST in market. Remember? I am an Indian! I am suppose to be the BEST, and do what everyone else was doing and I DID. I did not rebel.

4 years of tear-eye-blurred letters on my Engineering textbooks landed me in a good-paying job in a product company. The job put me on testing Storage Area Networks(SAN). SAN in 2009 in India was equivalent to 2014-Sunny-Leone-Hot! Getting an opportunity to work on the hot property of the Storage Industry at the very beginning of my career, I welcomed it with open arms. I was TESTING SAN. I loved setting up the SAN infrastructure.I loved my work. I was a fresher and I had the liberty to make all the mistakes I could, to learn the system right. It never occurred to me that I was a ""TESTER"" in the making, more so in a product company. Nevertheless, I was reminded to be the BEST again and do what others of my-age were doing. Yes. Masters! I quit my job in 2011 to pursue my masters. 

During my masters I enjoyed courses related to Software Testing particularly. My internship involved testing SAN again and I was excited. I graduated. To prove that my blood was still Indian and that SRK's Swades had indeed made an impact, I came back to India. I again tried hard to be the BEST and earned myself a job. But again, in the Testing domain, because I loved it.  

But what happened in the Indian Software Testing Community during my absence, between 2011 and 2013 was.... an exodus from Manual testing towards Automation testing.
'SAN testing' in 2009 knew only one term 'SAN testing' which was MANUAL in every true sense.But those 2 years(2011-13) when I slogged day-in-day-out in my Masters, the Software Testing domain in the Indian subcontinent had migrated from Manual testing to Automation Testing. The skill-set acquisition phase was over. The automation framework was laid out. The freshers were trained on Automation. And now.. **Drum Roll Please** I was a Software Test Engineer,with 2 years of experience in Manual Testing, A Masters Degree,
with strong knowledge on SAN, extremely good with testing principles and more than everything, having A STRONG PASSION FOR SOFTWARE TESTING.**Slow Clap** But WITHOUT  a place for me in the industry as I have NO EXPERIENCE IN AUTOMATION!!!(and I AM NOT A DEVELOPER)
""HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE"" and even better ""WHY""!!! Should I ? 

May I now ask the Indian community to suggest the ways of making me the BEST in the industry?? Suggest ways to do what others are doing? 
1. Learn Automation? Check! I took classes. I am writing my own automation scripts. I learnt it. I am open to new learning!  Happy?!
2. Attend Interviews? Uncheck! I need a job on automation to gain experience. To get a job on automation I NEED EXPERIENCE.  It is a bloody dead lock! 
3. Become a Developer? UNCHECK! THANKYOU!

	* My classmates in BE who joined with me and got trained thoroughly as developers are my biggest competitors because I CHOSE TO LOVE MY TESTING JOB AS A FRESHER.
	* My classmates in MS have various roles to work for in the US. Thanks to my patriotism! In India you are either a Developer or a Tester! Correction--&gt; Automation Test Engineer!  
	* Seniors in the team who are hardcore programmers will be the interviewers and they look for ""EXPERIENCE"" as a DEVELOPER
	* And most important of all.. I DO NOT LIKE TO BE A DEVELOPER. Can the Indian Software Fraternity accommodate and respect this individual choice! 


My dear Indian Software Engineers, It is not about NOT having the capability to be a developer. It is the ""I DO NOT LIKE IT"" factor. Ohhh wait a sec! I am in India. I cannot express what I do not like. If I do, I am a rebel. I am suppose to somehow be the BEST. I am suppose to be doing what others are doing! Even if it means I DO NOT LIKE IT. 

Thinking from a broader perspective, when will this society ever understand that DISAGREEMENT is NOT EQUAL TO DISRESPECT.  MAKING A DIFFERENT CHOICE IS NOT DISRESPECTING THE BEST. IT IS BEING THE BEST IN SOMETHING ELSE. 
 We are Engineers. Software Engineers. Not programmers or testers!!  Let us respect the individual CORE COMPETENCY!
KEEP CALM and GROW UP! Broaden our horizon!

3xci0s,0,2015-12-18,"I [26/M] got invited to a party at a girl's [23/F] apartment, could do with some advice",therilkedeal,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3xci0s/i_26m_got_invited_to_a_party_at_a_girls_23f/,"So this girl I've been interested in for a few weeks invited me to a small party at her apartment in a couple of days. We don't know each other all that well. We met on an internship at this company, spoke a few times, and when the internship finished I gave her my number. Then she texts inviting me to the party. I got the feeling we kind of hit it off but in reality I'm not sure whether she sees me as just as a friend or not.

So...back to this party. It's at her apartment and even though we're in the same city chances are I won't know a single person there. My question is...how do I act? I like her and want to find out if the feeling's mutual, but a room full of strangers (her close friends, maybe even her family) doesn't seem like the ideal time or place to do that."
3xckox,6,2015-12-18,2 Years In,HereWeGoHawks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xckox/2_years_in/,"Hi all,   

I graduated college a couple years ago with a business management major after not doing great with my intro computer science classes freshman year.  By the time I had matured to the point where I was a good student, it was already late Sophomore year and I had switched my major.   
After not loving the job prospects ahead of me, I dived into a couple programming books (Head First Java, Codecademy courses, O'reily javascript etc.) and really enjoyed it.  I taught myself well enough to the point where I got an internship supporting Google apps and writing apps script, then a second internship developing javascript internal applications.  The company I work for is great and hired me on full time to develop C#/Java/Web for internal applications support, but I worry often my future career options are dim because I am without an official CS degree.  (I've been full time for nearly two years now).
  
My question is this:  is it worth me going to a local school night class to take their masters program classes to prove I have the programming chops?  In additional to being self taught I have learned a lot from the senior devs where I work, but I feel like I need to have something in paper.  Would me developing a few personal web apps etc. and posting them to Github really help my cause?  I spend about 15-20 hours a week outside of work learning and doing small projects for fun, but I want to be spending that time best I can.  Any ideas or advice?   I really appreciate it - thanks all, and happy holidays.

i did so many things wrong in my code that my boss(who is 25 years old, i am 21) told me several times how frustrated he is with me. 
I just couldnt concentrate with 2 other people in a room for 8 hours a day. it was just too much. he tried talking to me several times but i was so full of adrenaline that i couldnt tell him that i dont like to work there anymore and that i want to quit. 

so today he had another talk with me and i told him everything is fine and that i think the work is intresting, just because my anxiety was so high that i couldnt say the truth. 

when i went home i called him and told him i want to quit because i lost motivation and because of personal reasons. 
He was really angry and basically told me that i am a pussy because i couldnt tell him that in person when we had a talk and i pretended everything was ok. 

now i feel like a fuckin failure and i'm scared that i have to give a few days notice before i can actually quit.

Times when no one is given the chance to calmly face a situation and think what they can do to solve it.*

*It is during those times that the commonfolk step aside. ""I can't save her."" said a doctor, far away from the battle at the Plague Jungles, struggling to keep his best friend's daughter alive, trying to help her survive the hit of a stray Avarosan arrow. ""I can't defend my homeland."" thought an old, old man, far away in time and space, while trying to look for a way of saving Urtistan. ""I can't conquer his heart."" thought a maiden, far away, in a beautiful watchtower that had been built ages ago in the very middle of Bandle City.*
*
It is during these times that heroes appear. When no one dares to try, they show up. That is the only difference between the commonfolk and the few heroes that have stumbled upon our world. That they decided to show up. They decided to act. They decided to show that they did have the willpower to do something.*

*Two words are enough to turn a common person into a hero: I can.*

Hi there! Nachokage here, introducing you the Fan-fiction I've been working on for the past year and ~2months.

This started with a piece of LoL-related text that I had to write for applying for an internship. Even though I didn't get the internship, I had a lot of support from the few people who had read that first piece ([the prologue] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/the-fall-0.html)). That, paired with my need to practice my writing while I worked on setting the world for what will probably be my first novel (it will take years though), helped me to start this project. Now, a year and more than 25.000 words later, this story is coming to an end.
 
The plot is centered around Runeterra's death; the land, corrupted, is being killed by the will of men. Anger, revenge, fear and despair lead humanity to an endless battle against magic itself. Only a few will realize what is really happening, creating bonds between characters that would have been impossible otherwise.

The last three chapters will be published in the next three saturdays (including tomorrow). Even though the main events come to an end with the last chapter published, these will serve the purpose of explaining how some things were orchestrated and put an end to the few plots that have been left open.

What can you expect from [The Fall] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/p/the-fall.html)? It is a tragic story, with its own dose of romance for those who like it, filled with a lot of the League of Legends characters we all know and love ^(or hate). The mix is completed with a lot references based off well known fan works (like ZedXSyndra), Rock and Metal music, literature and more.

Here's the full list of published chapters. Note that the first 20-30 chapters include a short list of the featured champions  which is not added later on for avoiding spoilers:

3xdj9s,2,2015-12-18,Getting into a big 4 company full-time vs an internship,millfurion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xdj9s/getting_into_a_big_4_company_fulltime_vs_an/,"Hi,

I know it's harder to get into a Big 4 company as a working full-time compared to as an intern transitioning to full-time.

What I want to know is, how much harder is it? I've recently failed a few Big 4 interviews, and I'm feeling kind of discouraged that if I can't get an internship with the Big 4, I won't ever be good enough to work for them, even if I interviewed later on in my life as a full-time (since the questions would be more difficult).

Does anyone have any experience with failing to get an internship at a Big 4 as a student, and getting a full-time later on?"

I'm currently a sophomore at a state school with a reputable comp sci program and had a few questions in regards to applying for summer internships.

Coming into college I was somewhat undecided so my first year consisted of gen ed classes. I began working with java last summer and have grown to enjoy it immensely so I switched my track to a computer science one. 

For this semester that just finished I took the first cs class required for the major(java,basic programming, OOP etc..), next semester I'll be taking the next course involving data structures and the like as well as a foundations of cs course more involved with the logical/mathematical side of things.

Due to a stupid policy with scholarships at my school having to take a certain amount of credits towards your current major every semester as well as a policy for needing to take the first two courses in the cs sequence to be admitted to the major I will be switching to Information Systems major next semester and then after next semester switch to the CS major.

I would like to apply to summer internships this winter break but I have a few questions:

1. In my resume, should I list the courses I will have taken/knowledge I will have by the summer or the courses/knowledge that I currently have?

2. In a similar vein, should I list my major as Information Systems or computer science, given that at the time of application I will be IS but as of the summer I will be CS?

3. I have a few project ideas I'm going to flesh out over the break as well as a plan to learn some web related programming(html), is there anything else I should be doing to maximize my intership chances for the summer?

Thanks in advance"

Does anyone know what it takes to get to the second round? I recently had my two 45-minute interviews. I nailed both of the algorithms question, but I completely fucked up the follow up question to my last interview, where the interviewer essentially asked me an open-ended question about how to make a process better. I essentially blanked and it was 5 minutes of me going ""uhhh"" followed by a not-very-good solution.

I would like to know if I have a chance to get into the second round because I have an exploding deadline in 4 days and am not sure if I can extend or not. I feel like I would pass on the opportunity if I could get into the second round."

she had an umbrella so I took the opportunity to talk to her by getting under 
her umbrella and introducing myself.  I ended up getting her number and
setting up the date the same night.  I'm a [20M] and she [19F] so it was finals 
the following week but she still texted back within hours or the next day.
The first date went really well I noticed that she almost never broke eye
contact, she kept smiling and we talked for almost two hours on a coffee date.
I admit I messed up a few times in the beginning with stupid things I said, 
but they didn't seem that big of a deal.  

So this was on a Saturday, the next Sunday I texted her and she
didn't reply.  This didn't worry me too much because she had her last final
the following Monday and was leaving back to her home from the University 
the next day on Tuesday.  So I suspected she might be busy cleaning her room
and getting settled back as well as she mentioned starting some new busy 
internship. 

That Wednesday I left her a voicemail similar to my text and I still
received no reply.  Now it is starting to worry me, but she had pulled 
something like this in the two weeks of knowing her when she didn't reply
for four days because she shut off her phone to study for finals.

Should I keep trying, and maybe send another text in a week or two, to
setup a date in January, or should I just stop trying?"

In the end, he completed the coding challenge the company gave us and so did I. We both did well at the interview, but at the end, I was chosen as the candidate.

I'm a Junior Physics major at Northwestern University, concentrating in Astrophysics and with a CS minor, with a 3.388/4.0 GPA. The issue is that I have only recently picked up the CS minor after doing some NASA funded research on exoplanets this summer. My research required tons of python scripting to make .txt files that would populate input files for a fortran integrator that integrated planet orbits. I also used python to make graphs of data and use output files to make more input files for longer runs. I feel very comfortable in Python, but never got formal training. My CS minor is slow to start, and I will only be taking 2 language classes this year, one that is Northwestern exclusive called Racket that is function based, and C++/ a little C. I'm teaching myself Swift, Ruby, and maybe eventually HTML/CSS stuff. I can navigate around a linux shell pretty decently, and have some experience in batch scripting on the schools super computer cluster. I'm having major issues finding internships that will take me as a serious candidate though because of my lack of formal computer programming experience it seems. I've applied to roughly 50 jobs since the start of October and have gotten one online interview at a trading firm, but either not heard back or received rejection letters otherwise. What can I do secures interviews so that I can show I am a good candidate? I'm a very social guy and give good first impressions, so I feel like i'd excel at interviews if I could only get some.

Thanks so much for the help!"

3xev19,1,2015-12-18,Is Transferring (back) a Good Idea for Software Engineering?,BobbyPin88,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3xev19/is_transferring_back_a_good_idea_for_software/,"History: For my freshman and sophomore years, I attended an elite math/science school. I did well, and maintained a 3.6 GPA. However, I was less than happy there due to the very stressful workload and limited social life, so I transferred to a liberal arts college.

It is now the second semester of my senior year. My major is computer science, and I will be looking for a software engineering job upon graduation. I have the option to return to my old school, but I am struggling to come to a definitive decision. It is certainly a much better school, ranking wise (top 10 versus top 100). But it is also extremely theoretical (honestly, it teaches theoretical computer science, not computer/software engineering), and the workload is intense. If I go back, I'll have to spend one extra year. The main draw is the opportunity to use the prestige of the school to more easily get top-tier internships (probably in Silicon Valley) which I can convert to jobs. The cons are the stress, the limited social life, and (I guess) the opportunity cost of the extra year. I also worry that the theoretical bent won't transfer very meaningfully to my future career. 

My other option is to stay where I am. While the school isn't nearly as good, I will have the time to learn things on my own, and hopefully get a good job/internship this summer anyway. My instinct says I can learn everything I need to know from the internet and by working on projects. I am much, much happier here in terms of stress levels and social life.

Going beyond the practical, I think this decision has something to do with a deep-seated feeling that if I don't go back, I'm somehow selling myself short and I'll regret it. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I find my current school is very easy and I am able to maintain a 4.0 GPA with very little effort. This sounds nice, but it tends to make me lazy with regards to time management and study habits, which makes me feel like I'm wasting my potential. I guess I just want to apply my abilities to the utmost. At the same time, I know that by going back to my old school, I'm signing up for a year and a half of all-nighters, very poor teaching, and next to no social life.

Thank you for reading. Any advice on making this decision is welcome!"

Too late to say I love you?,tobyruinseverything,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xf7tc/i_22m_was_too_afraid_to_tell_my_gf_21f_of_2_years/,"I started dating my girlfriend the second year of college, I was infatuated with her from the moment I met her. We have very similar values, senses of humor, both very adventurous, we both love skiing, beautiful, super smart, fun, basically she's the exact type of person I want to spend my life with. After about 2 years together, she broke up with me about a month ago stating that our relationship ""wasn't enough"". I felt totally caught off guard because I thought we were having just normal fights in a relationship, but she said she was tired and didn't want to fix it anymore. Looking back, I now realize that there were warning signs that I should've noticed and acted on.  

&amp;nbsp;

After I met her and we got to know each other, it took a long time to convince her to date me. We were basically ""dating"" for about 5 months without calling it that, but I told her that I needed to know one way or another if she wanted me in her life. She agreed and said she didn't want to lose me and she was just afraid. Her father was an alcoholic and just wasn't a supportive figure in her life, so I figured she was just a little slower to trust people and let them get close. Then I had an internship in her hometown this past summer and things seemed like they were going great. Lots of fun, great memories together, and I was just so thrilled to have her in my life every day. Out of seemingly nowhere, she blew up at me and asked if I came to her hometown just because of her. She said she didn't want to feel like she had to show me around and that I wasn't there for her the previous summer (she had an internship far away and I stupidly didn't visit her because we just started dating and thought it would be too big of a step). I was heartbroken cause all I could think was, wouldn't you want me to follow you where you were?  

&amp;nbsp;

I talked her down and things got better, then right before coming back to school she asked if we should just be friends. She said we would both be busy and she didn't know if this was what I wanted. Again I talked her down and we agreed to stay together. About 2 months into the year, we had a fight about something stupid and she said we should break up. 2 days later she comes to me crying and apologizing that she doesn't know why she always pushes me away, but she wants and needs me in her life. She said she just had trouble trusting people and she hated how she always pushed me away. I more hesitantly agreed after a long talk that I wanted her in her life and suggested she go to therapy and that I would go with her, but she said she wasn't ready to do that.  

&amp;nbsp;

So then back to the present, before we broke up she accepted a job far across the country from where I'll be. I wasn't sure how it was gonna work, but she said we could visit each other as often as possible. So then we broke up and now and I'm heartbroken. Through all of this, I realized I had never told her that I love her and I can't tell you how much I regret that. I realized that I had always trying to smooth over our problems instead of really fixing them, and that I had changed how I was acting. I had always been afraid that I liked her more than she liked me, so I had been too afraid to say it. I had tried to show her in as many ways as possible that I cared about her and thought about her all the time, but I had never said the 3 most important words in a relationship.  

&amp;nbsp;

I realize now that we probably just aren't the right people for each other at this time in our lives, but I just don't want to live with this regret. I still love her a lot and realize that with her moving away it probably never would've worked, but I can't help but hate myself for never saying it. Is it a bad idea to tell her that I love her and wish I could've said it sooner even if I don't think we can be together? I really hope to stay in touch with her even if just as a friend, but I'm afraid this could ruin it if she doesn't want to hear it now or thinks I'm groveling. Sorry for the long post, but it really helps just to write this stuff out.  

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: Is it too late to tell someone you love them even after your relationship is over and there's no real hope of fixing it?"
3xfdei,0,2015-12-18,How can I be more assertive and confident?,mabel21,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3xfdei/how_can_i_be_more_assertive_and_confident/,"All my life I been bullied, talk down on, disrespected, mistreated, etc. I'm so tired of it. Since middle school all the way to now, college. I'm 22 about to graduate college and to this day I let people walk all over me, I'm so tired of it. I want to be respected, I want people to value what I have to say, I don't want to look or feel  stupid. I want to be considered tough, I want to speak up for myself, I want to be assertive somehow be a ""bitch"" because let's be honest, girls who have ""bitch"" attitudes are respected.

For example:

Relationships:
Broke up with ex-boyfriend recently because he was taking advantage of me. After months of dating, he didn't want to introduce me to anyone. I was used for sex. This is not the first time it happens. Men just used me, treat me like shi. This is a pattern. 

I'm so over dating! I want to work on myself, but I don't know how!

Work Wise:

-I worked at many jobs. The worst experienced I had been when a manager at a restaurant who always verbally abused and once told me that I'm mentally retarded because I was always making  mistakes. I cried and quit the job. I didn't do anything about it. Wish I did at the time when I think about it I get angry for not standing up for myself. Wish I could go back and slapped the bitch or kill her. (won't actually do it lol.)

Another case was when another manager at a different job pushed me and yelled at me for no reason. Once again I didn't speak up, she apologized, though. 

At some restaurant jobs, coworkers were also rude to me. Talking behind my back, yelling at me, calling me stupid, ignoring me. 

Now I'm doing an internship at an office and people are much nicer. However when I think of the past and the way people treated me I get so mad at myself. 


Family:

-I don't speak to my little brother who is 18. He doesn't respect me as the older sister. We got into a huge argument months ago in which he called me a ""WHORE"" ""a dumb bitch who can't keep a relationship"". Just awful things. 

Social life:

-People that I considered friends often times make fun of me when in a group of friends. I'm not the type to stand up for myself so when I'm around a group of friends people often times make ""jokes"" and I laugh it off. I hate confrontations so I'm an easy target.  I try to avoid groups.

-I meet this girl in small class this semester. She was nice and all. but recently she started acting like a bitch. When I participated in class she made rude remarks, faces, ignored me at one time called me stupid when I made a joke in class. 

Is like people I meet think is okay to talk to me badly. Think is okay to ignore me. Talk down on me. I never stand up for myself. When I'm in a situation where I'm disrespected I freeze at that moment and don't say anything.either laugh it off or stay quiet. I also replay that scene over and over again wishing I could go back to time and change the way I reacted. 

This is embarrassing because I'm already graduating college and I'm 24. I'm supposed to have my shit together, but clearly I need to work on myself. Therapy is not an option because I don't have money.

Broke up with ex-boyfriend recently because he was taking advantage of me. After months of dating, he didn't want to introduce me to anyone. I was used for sex. This is not the first time it happens. Men just used me, treat me like shi. This is a pattern.
I'm so over dating! I want to work on myself, but I don't know how!

Work Wise:
-I worked at many jobs. The worst experienced I had been when a manager at a restaurant who always verbally abused and once told me that I'm mentally retarded because I was always making mistakes. I cried and quit the job. I didn't do anything about it. Wish I did at the time when I think about it I get angry for not standing up for myself. Wish I could go back and slapped the bitch or kill her. (won't actually do it lol.)

Another case was when another manager at a different job pushed me and yelled at me for no reason. Once again I didn't speak up, she apologized, though.

At some restaurant jobs, coworkers were also rude to me. Talking behind my back, yelling at me, calling me stupid, ignoring me.
Now I'm doing an internship at an office and people are much nicer. However when I think of the past and the way people treated me I get so mad at myself.

Family:
-I don't speak to my little brother who is 18. He doesn't respect me as the older sister. We got into a huge argument months ago in which he called me a ""WHORE"" ""a dumb bitch who can't keep a relationship"". Just awful things.
Social life:

-People that I considered friends often times make fun of me when in a group of friends. I'm not the type to stand up for myself so when I'm around a group of friends people often times make ""jokes"" and I laugh it off. I hate confrontations so I'm an easy target. I try to avoid groups.

-I meet this girl in small class this semester. She was nice and all. but recently she started acting like a bitch. When I participated in class she made rude remarks, faces, ignored me at one time called me stupid when I made a joke in class.


Is like people I meet think is okay to talk to me badly. Think is okay to ignore me. Talk down on me. I never stand up for myself. When I'm in a situation where I'm disrespected I freeze at that moment and don't say anything.either laugh it off or stay quiet. I also replay that scene over and over again wishing I could go back to time and change the way I reacted.

This is embarrassing because I'm already graduating college and I'm 24. I'm supposed to have my shit together, but clearly I need to work on myself. Therapy is not an option because I don't have money.

The reason I said life isn't fair is because is just one thing after another. Yes, I'm graduating college, which is the greatest accomplishment but everything else is bad. At this point of my life I  want to start over. This isn't where I want to be "

Frankly I gave up in the summer, and I do regret it- I wish I stuck through with it. I just felt that after writing a 100, 000 words, I didn't get a single thing out of it. I mean, I learned it's going to take a whole lot more shitty writing to get to the good stuff. So, next year is coming around, and I'm a little too impatient to wait for New Years Resolutions to inspire me.

So here's how the new system is going to work instead. I don't suppose I'll uphold another *write everyday* quota- the times and days where I didn't write weren't inspiring- they made me feel like shit. I felt that I was failing myself. I don't like that, and the next year is going to be even busier than this one. So, what I would like to do is work off of a streak based idea. Number a story 1, the next day 2, then 3, and if I miss a day... Back to one. With that, at least the commitment to succession will still be there, and I won't feel nearly as beaten when I don't commit entirely. So, now I guess I can talk about what I'd like to write.

I'd like to focus more on screenwriting than prose. Prose can be fun, I like it now and then, but I find most of my ideas I envision for a cinematic feel, and also I just don't see me getting into a career where I write prose. So I don't have any new ideas now, but I'm going to do perhaps a day of thinking over an idea, then trying to write as much as I can on a frequent basis.

January-April I'm directing a short film, and that's going to be my full attention. The Book of Norman is just about done, and is in its final stages. I have an internship next semester too, and then after all that, I'm moving to Montreal. So time is short and I want to make it count- after all these little projects here and there, there should always be a factor moving forward. Slowly, sluggishly at times, but it has to keep moving. I haven't written any *new* stories this semester. So, now's the time. I have more *free* time, time to work on any projects during the day, without infrequent deadlines, so I know sparing an hour everyday for this shouldn't be out of the question.

More work is always good. Self deprecation is not. "

**A few questions for programmers in HK, would you recommend someone fresh out from uni to purse a software development career in HK? (Any Cons I should be aware of?)**


Also, I assume once a programmer is competent enough and have had a few years of experience, it is easy to try relocating somewhere else in the world? (just for travel exploration or better pay) Maybe someone can correct me if this assumption isn't true.

I am rapidly learning the skills needed for the position and my question is as follows:  
What code should I show for the interview and what would be a good web app to build before going into the interview. I am a very fast learner when it comes to this sort of thing.

Anyways I figure it's a bit too soon to be looking for internships, so my question is, what kind of jobs could I get while in school? I'm really sick of food service, so I'll be taking advantage of my light course load next semester to get some CompTIA certs, hopin that could get me a job that pays more than min. wage.

3xhgy8,430,2015-12-19,[UPDATE] I [20M] have started working at a new internship that I have worked hard for. My gf [20F] of two years is jealous. I'm feeling annoyed. Advice?,yyuyuthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xhgy8/update_i_20m_have_started_working_at_a_new/,"Almost nobody will remember the post I made [about 6 months ago] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3748b2/i_20m_have_started_working_at_a_new_internship/).  However perhaps someone will get some amusement out of hearing an update or a story about how a couple worked it out.

Oh, what a difference open communication and some hustle can make!  Half a year ago I was beginning an internship at a large financial firm with seemingly good career prospects after graduation.  My girlfriend Jill was jealous because of my prospects and achievement (even if it was just an internship).  I was upset that she was jealous because I believe it implied entitlement and a lack of empathy.

After I asked you guys for help my emotions were curbed.  I set aside a time to talk about our position.  In that conversation or one that followed (to be honest I don't remember the fine details) she laid it all out on the table.  She wasn't quite happy with where she was in her career (or rather, her preparation for a career).  She felt she wasn't learning all she wanted to in her classes, and she was jealous of the ""hard"" skills I was learning while hers seemed to be largely conceptual.  From that conversation it all made sense.  It's never about what it's about.  It wasn't about me at all.  My own insecurities manifest themselves in different, seemingly irrational ways.  This was simply her manifestation.  After talking more, understanding and such, I offered to explore career paths with her.

After a bit of research and talking to professors Jill has officially applied and been accepted to the Supply Chain Management concentration of Marketing at our University.  Logistics management is growing very quickly, with high career prospects, and the program at my school is good.  She has excelled in her supply chain classes this semester (giving ""one of the most in depth, prepared presentations I've seen given in this class"" according to her professor) and she continues to build her network and is currently in contact with several recruiters to prepare for her internship hunt this February.  She really enjoys her classes and is *excited* to start internship hunting.

Meanwhile I have continued to build my skills and network and last month I have accepted an internship at a prominent accounting compliance and consulting group at a rate of &gt;$30/hr with a sizable signing bonus.  After college prospects are overwhelming good, and I'm very excited for my future.  Her reaction has been overwhelmingly positive and accepting.  Her only concerns are for my work life balance (which *does* suck if reputation is to be believed) and ending up in the same city together.  Both concerns are taken care of as most entry level employees of this organization usually work for only 2 or 4 years before jumping ship to project management or team management at a company in industry.  Things couldn't have worked out better.

The biggest takeaway is that I probably do have better career prospects at this point in time.  We have continued to find differences between us.  I've also learned that she is a way better cook than me and ironically better at home finances and budgeting.  She has a better time connecting with people.  And that's okay.  Just being with her has made me a much more ambitious, kind, and better person.  Sorry to get all mushy and shit, but things are great!

**tl;dr: My girlfriend was jealous of my success despite herself and I found myself resenting her for it.  We talked it out and found the root of her insecurity and mine.  We developed a plan and she has significantly improved her situation while I have continued to grow.  We are both very happy for each other.**

*EDIT: I forgot to address an important part of this update.  Since then I have addressed why I reacted a little harshly to her jelousy.  I believe it to be ego.  Since then I have made conscious efforts to stay humble and focus on helping people.  Jill continues to inspire me in that way, she really has made me a better person.  SPOILER: I was a bit of a prick in more ways than one before I met her.*"
3xhl5u,12,2015-12-19,Me [25M] with my GF [23F] of 1.5 years does not respect my money situation,durant0610,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xhl5u/me_25m_with_my_gf_23f_of_15_years_does_not/,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. A little backstory on me: I'm 25 years old, and currently senior in college. I did not go to college when I graduated high school, but decided at the age of 22 that I wanted to get my degree for the sake of my career/future. I will graduate this May with a computer engineering degree with a job lined up starting at ~$75k, but for the time being money is extremely tight, as I have had to pay all of my bills (rent, electricity, insurance, phone etc) throughout my entire college career and have had to work 25-30+ hour weeks to afford it. I currently have an internship near my school, and due to scheduling this semester (and probably next semester) I can only work ~16 hour weeks. It pays well but I have been short 2 months this semester, and had to borrow money from my brother to pay bills. I don't have money to give a lot gifts or take her out to fancy dinners.

On the other hand, my girlfriend is currently working part time in a retail store. She lives by herself, but her parents still pay for her car insurance, phone, and her parents own the place she lives so she does not have to pay rent, so her monthly expenses are fairly low, but she also doesn't really make much. 

Throughout our relationship, I've done my best to keep the relationship fresh and come up with fun date ideas that I can afford probably 3-4 times a month, and when I take her out to eat its always relatively cheap about twice a month (think ~$10-$15 a head local sit-down restaurant, not McDonalds). 

The relationship has been pretty healthy up until recently. Very minimal arguing, she seemed to understand my situation and didn't really have a problem with it. In the past month or two, she has been making a lot of comments about how much she wishes I would surprise her with flowers and take her out to a expensive, fancy dinner date and that I never give her gifts. Any fun (and cheap) activities I plan seem to be met with somewhat begrudging attitude, but she does seem to enjoy it once we got started.

This Thursday I drove home to see my family, and plan on staying with them through Christmas, but before I left I picked her up and took her for breakfast. I plan on coming back to work full time until school starts, which means I would be here for New Years. She suggested for New Years that I take her out to somewhere expensive where we can get dressed up, and come back to share a nice bottle of wine together. I told her I don't know if I could afford that, especially since its Christmas and I had saved up what little money I could for gifts (including for her) but I would do what I could. Her response to this was ""If we can't go somewhere really nice for New Years I'm going to be pissed."" I told her that was a really shitty thing to say, and that it makes me not want to do anything for her, let alone something expensive. She immediately apologized and said she didn't mean it like that. I took her home shortly after and drove to my parents house (8 hr drive) and through the drive she was texting me apologizing frequently. 

Her comments like this make me feel somewhat inadequate and seems to be driving a wedge between us. I know she isn't asking for these types of things to happen on a monthly basis or anything, but just on special occasions maybe two or three times a year, but even then I just don't have an extra $100 to drop on one dinner and flowers or a gift before I graduate. We have talked about this in the past and she still makes these types of comments. How should I handle this? Is this something that justifies ending a relationship?

**tl;dr**: I'm dead broke and still an undergrad in college even though I'm 25 and my girlfriend is started to get fed up with the fact that I never take her out or buy her nice/expensive things. What should I do?"
3xhrkt,3,2015-12-19,"I'm working towards a bachelors in computer science, and I have an idea for a personal project. Not sure if the scope is too big, or if I'm reinventing the wheel here, or if I'm asking for legal trouble..guidance requested",pineapple_catapult,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xhrkt/im_working_towards_a_bachelors_in_computer/,"So, I'm working towards my bachelor's, and they say it is good to have side projects apart from your school work.  I'm going to be doing a paid research this upcoming semester, so I'm hoping that will boost up my resume a bit.  In addition to that though, I had another idea.  My family owns a restaurant, and I've worked there for many years.  I do the weekly inventory by hand and input it into excel.  It's a fairly error prone process.  I wanted to basically make my own version of the service they provide here: https://www.barcodesinc.com/articles/inventory-control-system.htm.  Basically a system that tracks your inventory and related statistics, calculates food cost, tells you when to reorder, etc.

At first glance it doesn't seem too hard.  I just completed software engineering this past semester, and can kind of visualize how the process would go.  I could start writing up some use cases and UML diagrams to see how it would all work out, but I'm afraid this could easily get to be too much for me to tackle alone.

Another concern I have is the legal issues of using an IDE/language for developing commercial software.  For example, if I wanted to use C# to write this program, would I have to pay Microsoft for a commercial license for visual basic?  What if I used Java instead?  I don't plan on selling the software to outside parties, but there is a possibility that I get paid to write it, and/or the program gets used by my family's restaurant as part of their business operation.

The last question (for now, lol) I have is that if I pursued this, could it be considered an ""internship"" if I were paid by the restaurant to write it? (there is definitely money to be saved by having something like this, so I could see it happening). However, it just feels wrong to call it that when I'd be the only person doing any sort of software development there.

Anyway, that's it for now.  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.  "

im a sophomore cs major at a school in new york and i'm pretty burned out... this semester i spent focusing purely on interviewing and doing a bunch of coding practice questions to exercise my algorithms and problem solving skills, and well luckily it just BARELY worked out. on top of that i didn't do too hot in my classes (lol worth tho), im going to finish with below a 3.5 this semester... but it probably doesnt matter right because i got the internship? lol

but yeah anyway, i'm not really sure what to do now. i finished finals, winter break is here, spring semester starts in like a month, and i want to use this time effectively. i'll probably spend the first week and a half catching up on sleep and fking around by playing games and stuff but after that i need a game plan. i want to make more cool shit with code, so i'll definitely continue with this mobile app idea i had.

but that's honestly all my coding experience--i just read up on a random technology/API, make a 50%-working app, and then i rinse repeat with a new technology. i'm a bit worried that because this is all i've been doing, i'm going to suck at my internship. i want to do very good, so my question is how should i prepare for my internship? i really want to make the most out of it, and i want to learn a ton and code really cool stuff, but how should i prepare to do that?

also, this up coming spring semester i would like to get a job at a startup or something (given that im in NYC this should be plausible), just like a one time gig or something. do you guys have any experience on how to go about getting a job just for a semester?

thanks for reading this, sorry this is kind of ramble-y but honestly i couldn't do better cuz my brain is dead from all the stuff that happened this semester and i just took my last final lol

TLDR: how do i prepare for an internship at the big 4? what should i practice, what should i read? also how can i get a spring semester gig with a company so that i can write/push code for them? where do i look for these jobs?

I'm not really sure what I want to do, so I'm thinking of just applying to a bunch of places and figuring out what I want to do after the fact. I've heard from people that CS internships are really for people after their Junior year from kids at school, but I don't believe that. Any and all help will be appreciated.



**Questions:**

What are some things you wished you had known going into this process?

What would I be doing with Networking, Software Development, Information Systems, Data analytics etc.? (I'm not sure what much of this entails in the job world)

What would be the best starting point to have the most opportunities?

What would be the best for my skillset? (if it can even be considered that)



**Classes I've taken (plan on getting CS BS and MA BA):**

CS1 (Basic Python)

CS2 (Java, we learned stacks, nodes, etc. I think they're all memory storage related things. Also we learned Big O notation and that stuff)

Basic Computer Architecture (Verilog, MIPS, We build a SSDP for MIPS in verilog)

Logic (Boolean algebra, Turing Machines, DFAs and NFAs, Proof by induction)

Calc I, II and Multivariable

Stats (from HS, plan on retaking)

Robotics (from HS, probably will take another robotics class in the future)



**Next semester:**

Randomness &amp; Computations (basically math involving randomness, Large numbers, Probability, all with applications [from class description])

Linear Algebra

Computer Systems (Comparing and contrasting machine-level systems)

Intro to Abstract Mathematics

I've gotten all A's or A-'s on on my Major related course (all the ones above) except Calc 2 (B+)




So if someone could look at this and give me some advice I'd really appreciate it. I'm very lost looking for internships and I don't even know where to start. Thanks. Also I have no relevant experience other than the classes.

EDIT: Also my non major classes brought my GPA down to a 3.0 (first year) but I'm still not sure what my GPA for this semester is. I'm also going to visit the Career Services at my school at the start of the next semester."

For that reason I might not answer too many questions. Well I won’t be too specific with my answers at least.

We both exercise a lot together and we’re both in good shape which is something important to both of us. But other than that we’re like any couple. Our sex life is fine too, and the only complaint I have is that he doesn’t go down on me nearly as much as I would like. But it’s not a big problem really. All in all we’re very happy, we live together, and are planning a future. So I never thought of myself as a cheater, which is why it’s so weird to me that I’m writing this. Part of me writing this is because I want to share something with a subreddit that I have enjoyed for a few months now (made an account for this!), and part of it is to get it all off my chest because it's been a weird few weeks.

I like my job and I take my career very seriously, so I’m always looking for ways to further my ‘professional development’. Well a few months ago my company was putting a call out to anyone who would be willing to manage an intern and I thought I’d go for it. Not something I’d done before and a good opportunity. I had to interview quite a few applicants and eventually settled on this girl called Izzy, who was 21 and had just graduated from uni (I’m 25 btw).


Izzy is short and slim, with wavy blonde hair and a very pretty face. I’m completely straight so didn’t really think anything of it, other than in a ‘*Oh she’s quite pretty*’ kind of way. I feel weird talking about myself, but for reference I think I’m somewhat good looking too. I’m slim and tall with straight blonde hair and small boobs. Guys have said I’m ‘too skinny’ quite a lot, but it’s never bothered me. My face isn’t as pretty as Izzy’s but I scrub up okay!


Anyway, Izzy fit in with our team really well which was great. She started a bit over 2 months ago and we got along pretty well from the start. Part of my responsibility as her line manager is to schedule our weekly 1-to-1 catch up sessions to see how she's getting on. Like I said my office is big and open, but in the middle to one side there is a row of little meeting rooms you can book if you want to make some calls or have a quiet conversation. The rooms are big enough for a fairly deep desk on one wall (with side panels) and a couple of chairs. The walls are semi sound proof, and they each have a big window that looks over the city. The only inside window is at head height in the door so you can check if anyone’s in there.


About 1 month in Izzy and I were having a catch up. We were going through some stuff on my laptop and it was going very normally. I’m a really talkative person so all our meetings have a lot of joking around and chit chat in them. But today I was a bit off because I’d been arguing with my boyfriend that morning. It was just about sex stuff but it put me in a bit of a downer for the whole dat. Izzy could tell and asked me what was up, and I told her I’d been arguing with the bf. That moved the topic onto boyfriends, and she told me she had recently broken up with hers.


I didn’t mean to pry but I suppose I did anyway and asked what had happened. She kind of brushed the question off at first, but then told me that actually it was the sex. Her face went super red which made me laugh but it wasn’t really awkward at all because I’m not very shy about that stuff and Izzy knows it. I considered being all professional about it and getting the meeting back on track, but truth is that it was nice to talk about all that crappy boyfriend stuff with someone new. Plus we had a halfhour left in the room and had completed our agenda. (Plus it was a friday afternoon!)


Turns out she had confessed to her boyfriend that she was bicurious and he didn’t take it well, and things went downhill after that. She asked me if I had ever had any experience or advice with it because she was finding it a bit hard to decide what to do about it. Obviously I said ‘No’ because I’m straight and didn’t have any idea, but I said that she definitely shouldn’t feel bad about it. To try and even up the exchange I confessed that my bf troubles had been about sex too. My boyfriend and I hadn’t had sex in a couple of weeks and he wanted to know if there was something wrong. I'd admitted to him that I’d been feeling neglected about the lack of oral, but that just made him get really defensive.


I kind of realised at this point that our conversation had gone waaaaaay over the line of what is okay. Yes we are both adults, but I am her manager and she is an intern. I was about to suggest we pack up and leave the room go join our team, but Izzy gave me a friendly frown and said ‘That sucks, that’s exactly the kind of thing I’m looking for’. I think I must have gone white when she said that or something because she apologised straight away and started waving her hands. I felt bad because I didn’t want to make her feel awkward so I laughed and said ‘No no it’s fine, it makes perfect sense!’


We kind of had one of those weird moments then. Where you’re both looking at each other but your expressions don’t change for ages. She kept looking at me and eventually said ‘I wish I could find someone laid back who wants what you want, that would definitely make things easier’. I think I knew what she was hinting at straight away, but I didn’t really know how to reply, so I just kind of smiled and nodded. After what felt like a long time she shrugged and said in a jokey voice ‘Well if you’re ever in the market just let me know’. I really don’t know why I didn’t shut it down right then, or try and laugh it off or something, but I didn’t. It hit me then that I was sat in a room with someone who was basically asking to go down on me, and I got really excited. It’s weird, it wasn’t like being horny or anything, just really excited, like getting to the top of a rollercoaster. If I’m honest I enjoy the thrill of ‘taboo’ stuff quite a lot so I think that was part of it. I kind of chuckled and looked at my imaginary watch and said ‘well I’m free for the next twenty minutes!’ in a jokey way.


I said it because it sounded like a joke. I meant it as a joke, and it was a joke. It seemed like a good way to give us both a way out of a weird situation. But part of me really hoped she didn’t take it as a joke because I wanted to see how far it would go. Also, I won't lie, the thought of getting some oral was genuinely starting to push my buttons, even though it was a girl. But it was all hypothetical because it wasn't gonna happen. Right? Izzy laughed a bit in response, but then looked at me and asked ‘Er... are you serious?’. Holy shit. Before I had time to think I just shrugged and said ‘Well, sure. I mean why not? It's not like it has to be a big deal’. It felt like an out of body experience where someone else was talking and not me. I would never have said anything like that, but then I actually did. Even now when I think about the moment I said that, it still feels like it was somebody else.


Izzy looked pretty shocked and I thought for a terrifying moment she had been joking all along. I thought about getting reported to HR and being fired and explaining it to my boyfriend and having to find a new job. But after about 5 seconds she said ‘Well… uh... if you’re sure, that would be great. I mean, I’d really like it. But in here? I mean, like now? Did you mean now?’ . She was serious. It was probably suuuuper awkward in that tiny room with just us two, but I think we were both too caught up in the craziness to notice.


I looked up at the ceiling trying really hard to look like I was casually working out the logistics when I was actually just thinking ‘*Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god*’. My heart was beating so hard I could see it in my vision. Was I really trying to hook up with another girl at work? After pretending to think for a bit I said ‘Yeah, it’ll be fine. I mean, we’re pretty tucked away in here. No one ever comes in if the door’s closed’. Izzy breathed out slowly, nodded and said ‘Okay. Cool’. She had gone from red to white and back again several times by this point, and had this frightened smile on her face, which is probably the same thing I had on mine. We kind of sat there for a bit not looking at each other. Eventually she laughed and said ‘Wow… I did not expect this to happen when I got up this morning’. I laughed too and said ‘Hey me neither! This is definitely not a normal Friday for me’. We were quiet for another few moments when Izzy looked at me and said ‘So how do we, you know... go for it? Shall we just do it? Is there anything we should do first? I'm kind of new to this obviously, so yeah...’. I couldn’t believe it, we were both being deadly serious.


I crossed my legs super casually at this point to try and look relaxed, and as my thigh and pelvis shifted I realised that I had gotten pretty damn wet. I kind of freaked out at that moment because I was getting wet over a girl. But that fact also really turned me on even more. I tried to rationalise that it was the situation and not the girl, but the result was the same either way. I tried to think again, and realised that if we were going to do this we’d have to have a backup plan in case someone looked in the window or opened the door. It was super rare that anyone did, but I wasn’t going to take the risk. I was wearing a dark knee length dress with nude tights which made things a bit easier, and I realised we could use the desk too. At that point I kind of mentally slapped myself and this inner voice said ‘*Dear god Helen what the fuck are you even thinking?*’. I froze up for a moment, and realised I couldn't go ahead with it. But before I could backpedal, the other part of me just went with it.


So I looked at her and said ‘Okay, I've got an idea. I’ll go to the toilets, and while I’m gone you can get under the desk. If someone comes in while I’m gone you can just pretend you’re looking for something you dropped.’ She nodded. Then I said ‘When I get back I’ll come in and shut the door and sit down. I won’t say anything and I’ll just pretend to work on my laptop. Is that okay?’ Izzy nodded again. I said ‘You sure you’re okay Izzy?’ and she smiled and said ‘Yeah definitely, really okay. Are you definitely okay?’. I nodded and smiled back and we ended up staring at each other for a few pleasantly weird seconds again. Eventually I was like ‘Right, cool, see you in a bit I guess!’. I was trying to sound really normal so she wouldn’t see I was about to pass out from nerves, but it was probably obvious. I stood up as calmly as I could, picked my keycard off the desk, my bag off the floor, opened the door, walked out, and closed it again.


The walk down the middle of the office to the door at the end was incredibly slow, and all I could think about was Izzy behind me crawling under that desk. I felt like everyone was watching me but I know they probably weren’t. One of my friends in another department saw me and waved, and I nearly blanked her before giving her a forced smile. She asked if I was okay and I just said I was busy, which she understood.


Eventually I got to the door and opened it, and walked round the corner to the toilets. I was thankfully alone, walked straight into a cubicle, locked it, and took a moment to think about what I was doing. I didn’t want to leave Izzy waiting for ages and it already felt like a long time had passed (though it had probably been about 30 second), but I was starting to freak out a little bit. I had a boyfriend, and I wasn't even bi. I wasn't actually going to do this was I? I nearly unlocked the door and left, but I didn't. Without really thinking too much I lifted my dress up, slid my shoes off, and slipped my thumbs into the waistband of my tights. My hands were actually shaking, but ignored it, and pushed them down. It felt sooo naughty and wrong and scary to actually do that. I balled my tights up and shoved them under all the crap in my bag.


Then I lifted my dress back up to do the same with my panties. I stopped again with my thumbs in the waistband, because I knew this was the point of no return for me. If I was willing to sneak my panties off in a toilet cubicle, I was probably going to go all the way. I took a breath, and pushed them down. I like to keep everything hair free down there, and as soon as the fabric came away from my skin the cold air felt really intense. I tried not to look as I pulled them off so I could pretend nothing was happening, but as soon as I tried to ball them up I could feel how wet the fabric was in the middle. And after I stuck them in my bag I had to wipe my hand off with toilet paper. I still couldn’t believe what I was doing. It still felt like someone else doing everything. I was on a kind of weird autopilot. I slipped my shoes back on, picked up my bag, and left the cubicle. I was going to walk straight out but then I stopped by the paper towel dispenser and pulled a wad out and stuck them in my bag. Some weirdly logical part of my brain was like ‘*My intern will probably need these after she goes down on me*’.


I headed back to the office. It felt like ages but I had probably been gone only a bit more than one minute. I swiped back in, and started walking as normally as I could back to the meeting room. In my head I was sure everyone was going to notice that I had no tights on and ask about it. They were nude so I figured I’d just lie and said I hadn’t been wearing any, but of course no one actually did ask. I was trying to look calm, but before I got ten steps in I could feel my wetness going everywhere each time my thighs slipped past each other. My dress was really thin and I was afraid it would stick to my legs so I tried moving my legs as little possible and prayed no one would notice.


After the longest seconds of my life I approached my meeting room. I started to slow down a bit because I didn’t feel ready, but I knew I couldn’t just stop outside the door. I took a deep breath as I got up to it, and my heart was pounding again. Half of me was praying that Izzy wouldn’t be in there, that she had freaked out and gone back to our team’s main desk, and that we could pretend none of this had ever happened. But the other half knew I’d be bitterly disappointed if that happened. I put my hand on the handle and opened the door as casually as I could. I stepped into the room and closed it on the other side. The sudden silence was terrifying and exhilarating. I set my bag on the desk and dropped my card next to it. My heart was thudding again as I looked around the room. Izzy had moved her chair out the way so only mine was by the desk, and when I realised that her notepad and pen were still on the desk I had to let out a long breath to calm down. She was under the desk. I couldn’t see her but she was probably there. She was waiting under the fucking desk.


I pulled the chair a short way out to sit down on it, forcing myself not to look down in case I saw her expectant face. I kept my legs together as I sat down as close to the edge of the chair as I could, and remembered the cum on my legs as I did so. I pulled the back of my dress up as I sat down to avoid getting it wet, and kind of draped it around the seat of the chair so hopefully no one would notice if they came in. I could feel the coarse seat cover on my bare skin, and felt suddenly self conscious about having no underwear on. My head was a mess at this point and I couldn’t think straight. I pulled up a random spreadsheet and started clicking on cells for no reason, just trying to look busy in case someone burst in. My legs were gently pressed together and I sat rigid like that, pointlessly scanning numbers on the screen. Several agonising moments went by like this. I realised with a wave of relief and disappointment that she had probably gone. I had been sat there freaking out for like 15 seconds and nothing had happened. I would just get up and go back to my desk and we'd forget all about it.


Then I heard a quiet sound as Izzy repositioned herself under the table. '*Holy shit this is going to happen, I can't fucking believe this is going to happen*'


I started to breathe quite heavily, trying to calm myself down a bit. Nothing happened for a few seconds, and then I felt her hand on my knee and froze. This was actually happening. She put her other hand on my other knee, and gently pulled them apart. I resisted at first, but only for a second. She kept pushing them wider really slowly, and I was staring at the laptop screen thinking ‘*Oh my god Izzy can see my pussy right now*’.


Then, when my legs were pretty far open, I felt one of her hands slide up my thigh. I kind of shuddered involuntarily because it felt so intense, and she paused for just a moment. She must have seen that I was really wet, because she started running a finger over the slippery patch on my inner thigh. This went on for maybe a minute or so, and my cum must have been everywhere. I was incredibly horny by this point. Not just asexually excited like before, but full on dripping-wet horny. Eventually she stopped, and I felt her hair brush against my skin as she leaned in. Oh my god I can’t tell you the anticipation I was feeling right at that moment. I could feel how close she was because her breath was warm. My mind was just going ‘*Shit shit shit shit shit*’. She pushed my thighs a little further apart, her clothes rustled as she leaned in, and I knew she about to go for it.


I thought of my boyfriend for just an instant, and then I felt Izzy’s warm, firm tongue push gently into my pussy. My whole body quivered and curled. My skin got really hot and I had to close my eyes and clench my fists to not have an orgasm right there. I could feel the muscles in my groin tensing up repeatedly, and her cheeks felt slippery against my thighs. All I could think was was ‘*holy shit I’m at work and my intern’s tongue is inside me*’. Izzy curved her arms under and over my legs and pulled my hips gently towards her as she licked all the way up between my lips in one go. I curled up again when her tongue went over my clit and it took all my strength not to moan. She pulled her face away for a moment and I heard her gulp quietly under the desk. That nearly sent me over right there. I had no idea why I was so into this even though it was a girl, but I didn't question it.


Then she leaned forward again, and started lapping at my pussy slowly but firmly. I can’t tell how you good it felt. Nothing has felt so good before or since. I couldn’t think anymore, all I could do was hold on. If someone had actually looked through the window in the door they would have sussed it out in three seconds. I was sitting at the desk with my head back and my eyes closed, shuddering rhythmically to the soft squelching sounds of Izzy's face buried between my legs. I don’t think I even lasted 30 seconds. There was this kind of white hot feeling between my legs and a ragged breath came out of my mouth as I had the stickiest, shakiest orgasm of my whole life. For a few long moments I could have been anywhere. It was just one long wave of pure, eye-watering ecstasy. I wanted to scream and cry and tell her how fucking good it felt, but I wouldn’t have even been able to make the words. Apparently I managed to stay pretty quiet, but I have no idea how as I’m quite loud usually.


The whole thing probably lasted no more than 10 seconds, but they were 10 seriously good seconds. When it was over I just slumped back in the chair with my eyes closed trying not to fall off. My breathing was deep and heavy, I could feel sweat on my forehead, and my still open legs were just kind of shaking about. Eventually I lifted my head up, and opened my eyes. Izzy was kneeling between my legs with her mouth open and a look of wonder on her face. It’s good she doesn’t really wear makeup because my cum was everywhere. Her cheeks were shiny with it, and there was a thin strand of it connecting her chin to her shirt. She had put her hair back in a ponytail, but it was sticky at her temples. I smiled at her and she beamed back at me. She asked me if it was good, and I laughed. Then she said ‘Did you… you know?’ And I just nodded happily because I couldn’t really speak.


With the moment passing I realised how amazingly ridiculous this would look to someone else, and I pulled the paper towels from my bag. I kept a couple for myself and handed a few to Izzy. We both stayed where we were, wiping up my cum for a minute or so. Watching a girl wipe my cum off her face was seriously surreal. When we were done I stuffed the towels in my bag and Izzy got up and sat back down in her chair. I scooted back a bit to inspect the damage, and saw a predictable wet patch on my chair. Luckily it wasn’t too big and I guess Izzy got most of it. I looked over at her and we shared a giggle. Half of me was deliriously happy on a post orgasm high, and the other half was reeling from the knowledge that I had just cheated on my boyfriend and gotten eaten out by a girl. What. The. Fuck.


Once my legs were up to the challenge I got up and inspected my dress and was relieved to find no visible blotches. I perched on the table’s edge and looked over at my partner in crime. ‘So… How was it?’ I asked. ‘Yeah’ she said with a massive smile ‘Pretty much everything I was hoping for’. That made me really happy for some reason. I really liked that she liked it too. She pulled her hair band off and said ‘Do you regret doing that?’. I thought about it for a moment and was really really surprised to find that I didn’t. I know it was wrong and bad and everything, but honestly I’d be lying if I said I felt any regret. I looked at her and said ‘No, I don’t. It was honestly the best I’ve ever had. Which is really weird ‘cause you’re a girl’. She smiled again and thanked me, and I just laughed. This girl had just given me the best orgasm I’d ever had and then said thank you.


I checked the time and we still had about 15 minutes left. We made sure we looked presentable, and got our stuff together (which included me finding my emergency panties and slipping them on). I fake spilled my cold cup of coffee on the chair, and we got up, opened the door, and strolled out into the noisy and busy office that had been a couple of feet away the whole time. Izzy went to go wash her face while I took the chair to the front desk and apologised to the facilities manager (the building has a central cleaning service for things like coffee spills).


I went and sat down at my desk and Izzy came back a few minutes later, gave me a quick smile and sat down to her work. After an hour or so my friend sat next to me actually did ask if I had been wearing tights earlier. I gave her a mildly confused look and shook my head, and she and said ‘oh right - sorry, it’s obviously been a looong week! Can’t wait for the weekend.’


The last couple of hours of the day were super normal. Every now and then I would get this weird sensation come over me and would stop in my tracks and think ‘*oh my god I came on a girl’s face*’ but I’d shake it off and it was fine. Oddly enough the guilt never really set it. Don’t get me wrong I know I cheated on my boyfriend and he didn’t do anything to deserve it. But even though my brain knew it was wrong it just felt different because it was another girl. I don’t think the gender makes any actual difference, but for some reason it just felt different. I have been propositioned before by guys (once or twice when my bf and I were in a rough patch) and I never considered cheating because the thought of it made me feel terrible. But one proposition from a curious girl and my legs are open within ten minutes. Go fucking figure.


I got home that night expecting to be really awkward around my bf, but it was fine. We both apologised to each other and made up and some really loving sex. He even went down on me which I really appreciated, and everything has been great since. Do I feel gay or bi now? Not really no. Do I still feel straight? I think so. I’m not really sure to be honest. It’s all so unfamiliar.


As for Izzy… I do have more to talk about, but I didn’t want to write it out here because this is already so long. I didn’t mean for it to be but I just kept going. Haven’t written anything this long since uni! Feels really good to write it out though. If you want to tell me off for being a cheat then go for it. But if someone enjoys it like I have enjoyed other stories here than that’s cool too. x


**EDIT: I just wanted to make a little edit to say 'holy shit'. I did not expect to get this much attention. It's been really good to be able to talk about this, so thank you everyone. I'm thinking about how to write up more, but no promises when I'll be done!**"

Ever since I was a little kids, I've been self-conscious about my body. Whether it was feeling ashamed to take off my shirt at the pool with some of my friends because I was the chubbiest kid there, or wearing clothes that I had bought relatively recently and had become tight soon after, I had known I was fat.... But I chose to ignore it. I was the kid who took 20 minutes to do 3/4ths of a mile in gym class, after which the teacher would let me off because I was slow, and class was almost over, I was the guy who couldn't keep up with the other kids interns of athletics, I was the shy fat kid. Through middle school, too, I was obese. However, I still didn't feel fat, even when I knew deep down I was, and I portrayed that in my shy behavior. I, as I became fatter and fatter, slowly became more and more shy and introverted, preferring to keep to myself and my few friends instead of being more outgoing and outspoken.

It took me a while to see what I had become. At first, I realized I was fat, and I tried to get in better shape. It worked, at least a little. I lost 7 pounds, and then kept it off, and stayed at 208 pounds. I was doing kickboxing, loving it, but still eating a lot. But then summer and the finals before them happened, and I fell off the wagon, going back up to my max of 215 pounds. I tried so much to lose weight, before falling off the wagon, and then trying to get back on. I started out with just eating less (without tracking), and that didn't work, so I thought to myself that I would never lose weight, and I gave up. I then heard about myfitnesspal and tried that (but without measuring food, just guesstimating). That didn't work. I tried keto ( but without tracking calories). They never worked. So I finally resigned myself to never losing weight, but I was still subscribed to r/loseit (admittedly on a different Reddit account, to which I have now lost my password). All of this trying, along with other pressures, led me to a break down a day before going to start an internship with my uncle where he works, where I broke down about feeling worthless and feeling like shit - how I had tried so many times to lose weight, but it had never worked. I, however, decided to go to the internship despite feeling like shit, which eventually led me to where I am now.

My uncle, coincidentally worked as a doctor at a hospital, and my internship was to shadow him. While I was there, I did what I did before - I drowned my sorrows in food, eating more and more. Any weight I had lost from before all came back. However, one day, my uncle went to see a patient, who turned out to be someone who was morbidly obese (500+ pounds), and had to get a tracheostomy to be able to speak and breathe, which was why she was in the hospital. Even while she was in the hospital and getting surgery to help her survive, however, she was still eating so much, and had her family bring or sneak in snacks so that she could eat them. When I was with my uncle at that time, I had just picked up a bag of jolly ranchers, and was happily munching on them, savor in the flavor. After I saw the patient though, I went to one of the bathrooms, threw out the jolly ranchers, and looked at myself in the mirror - I saw how much my gut was sticking out, how my recently bought pants had already gotten tight, and how I had a double chin, and that point, after trying what must have been more than 30+ times before, I decided to lose weight. So I went home after the internship was over, and weighed myself. I was still 215 pounds, but I didn't think of that as slightly overweight now - I thought of that as almost to 250 pounds, which was halfway to 500, and then I might have had to get the same surgery for myself. So, I downloaded myfitnesspal, input my weight, and started counting calories again - but this time accurately, and I measured how much I ate at at each meal strictly.

I never thought I would be here, but I am. I've lost 41 pounds, and am now 174 pounds, which is, just barely, a healthy weight.  I did this how I said above - I tracked my calories accurately in myfitnesspal, and made sure to never go over my limit - to me, it would have felt like I had give up, and I couldn't.   So I set myfitnesspal to lose 2 pounds a week, and I have.  I've done kickboxing when I could, to get extra calories to eat (if I had a party to go to or something), but I haven't officially stuck to a regimen, just exercised when I could.  Now, however, as the holidays are coming and I have midterms coming up soon, I've increased my calorie intake a bit from losing 2 pounds a week to losing 1 pound, until I hit my goal of 160-165 pounds, after which I'll maintain for a bit, and then start to get more fit, by lifting and running. I am starting c25k soon, when I get the time though.

Since losing weight, I've noticed a lot of things.  First - People treat you much better (at least in high school, where everyone's shallow). Not that I was treated badly or made fun of before (I wasn't), it's just that I get more attention and more people I don't know act nicer to me when I first meet them, which also might just be me being less shy and more outgoing as I've lost weight.  Second - Girls give me more attention. Third - I feel so much better about how I look, and feel more healthy overall.  I don't have a recent mile time, but the last one I ran was 11:30 for the whole mile (after which I even got some cheers, haha, after getting so much better at running).  I can do push-ups properly, planks properly, but I still can't do a curl-up yet :(.   Overall, I just feel so much better about myself, and am glad I finally decided to lose weight, and will continues to go until I get to my goal weight.

Oh, and thank you lose it, for all the help.  Without you guys, I wouldn't have been able to get where I am.  Seeing you guys succeed has inspired me to succeed, and you guys have been where I was able to ask questions, and get help.  For that, I thank you guys."

I'm two years into my CS degree and I understand the fundamentals of programming pretty well. It's time to start applying to internships but my GitHub is empty and I have no projects to show for myself.

**My goal:** use the Last.fm API to generate a .png collage of my most listened to albums of the past year.

**How the process has gone so far:** Okay, this should be pretty easy, right? I just figure out how to interface the API into Java and I should be set, yeah? Oh look! Someone already [wrote some code to bind the API into Java.](https://github.com/jkovacs/lastfm-java) That should help! Now let's import their work into mine to get started. Hmm, in their readme it says I can just add the .jar to my classpath! Wonderful, I know how to do that. I did that in my databases class to add a SQL linker to Java. Okay, now where do I find that jar? I've poked around for a while now, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll just save their whole project as a .zip and add that to my classpath. Nope, that didn't work.

Okay, they have a bit about grabbing their Maven dependency. I've heard of Maven, so maybe I should learn it. 

&gt;*spends a half hour installing Maven and learning how to create a project*

Okay, cool, my project is ready and I have it imported into Eclipse. Time to add their dependency! I googled around a bit and it looks like I need a plugin called M2E. Cool, I installed it and...now I have no idea how to use it. The documentation is terrible for people that haven't used Maven yet, and googling ""add dependency maven"" isn't providing me with anything that makes sense, even after sitting down and reading it all carefully. And now I have my project existing in an Eclipse workspace and what I think is a Maven repository, and I don't know how the two are supposed to work together. If I compile in eclipse, is that the same as running ""mvn compile"" in command prompt? How do I integrate all this into a git repository?

**What my problem boils down to:**

I can learn how to use Maven. I can learn how to use Git. I know Eclipse fairly well. How do I learn how to use all these things *together*? How do I just *start making a programming project* without getting lost in a sea of questions and installations and confusions?

3xiodc,7,2015-12-19,"Looking for my first job as a new grad, and I'm scared and confused.",abunchofchesspieces,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xiodc/looking_for_my_first_job_as_a_new_grad_and_im/,"Getting into Stanford was both the best and worst thing that happened to me. I thought I had it all figured out, but that acceptance letter changed everything.

Before I got in I thought I was going to be a Physics major and go on to grad school after graduating. I was good at Physics in high school, so it just made sense. I didn't even know that CS was something you could do in college. In my second week as a freshman I found out about the intro CS course and decided to buy a cheap laptop (my first computer!) and go to the first few classes on a whim. I ended up liking the assignments so much that I just kept taking more classes (at some point I learned how to touch type in Dvorak right hand, but that's another story).

It wasn't like I was a genius. I had pretty average grades. Mostly B's, some A's, and some C's. I was a mildly obese shy teen who had (regrettably) studied his ass off to the exclusion of everything else to get to the school he wanted. I worked on my classes, but I also wanted to eat better, actually step foot in a gym, resolve the myriad of issues I had inevitably developed during my crazy high school years, and get some hobbies! I spent my holidays catching up with my family, losing 40 lbs, and doing stuff I couldn't do when I just had to go go go between ages 12-18. I was just happy to work hard on my classes and proud that I was doing fine in a field I had no idea actually existed for most of my life.

Even then, classes were hard. I had to take a fifth year because taking 3 CS classes in one quarter was death for me.  The time commitment was very high, and I burned out several times near the end of quarters. Sometimes it hurt, and I wanted to just give up. It's fun when you figure out to solve a problem by realizing that you can *GASP* put a for loop *inside* another for loop, but nobody talks about the times when you get a zero in your assignment you worked on for weeks because of a random impossible to reproduce bug that crashes every autograder test. I would work 15 hours a day for 10 weeks straight on two separate classes and get a D for one and an A+ for the other. 

I somehow graduated with a 3.2, battered but still glad I did it. Everybody kept telling me that the diploma I received was going to open a lot of doors for me, and my future was bright.

I live in NYC right now, and looking for my first job. I feel hilariously underqualified for any jobs I see out there. I feel like I'm being punished for deciding to live a more well rounded, emotionally satisfying (and depression free!) life. I'm not even talking about the ""X years of experience"" stuff. Apparently I was supposed to live and breathe coding. Most places don't even consider candidates that don't have at least 1 internships or doesn't have some kind of impressive passion project they've been working on. My resume is essentially a list of class projects I completed. An OS class, a compiler class, a database class, a networking class (didn't do well on this one), and so on. Standard stuff. Essentially I'm not the greatest, but I don't suck, and I can learn if given time. 

This is not really a rant, I know I'm not going to change the world by complaining about it. Not everyone has to go through the soul searching I underwent. I understand (and envy) those who can dedicate their lives to their craft and are well compensated for it. I'm just really scared about my prospects. I'd like to get an entry level job by May at the latest. I'm not sure whether I should just turtle up and spend the next few months studying for interviews/developing side projects, or just say fuck it and apply everywhere even if they want new grads that are more experienced than I am (and also keep studying for interviews).

I'm scared and confused. Is there anybody who was in a similar position? How did you handle it? How can I use my time wisely while retaining my sanity?"

Is it possible for me to find a paid internship for CS near ann arbor? If so, how exactly do I start?"

I spent my childhood up until high school being called ugly, girls never talked to me, low self-esteem and some other things lead to another... Finally a girl noticed me, my best friend's ex, they had started going out before we hit it off, she dumps him, picks me up as her beta and she got everything she was hoping for and more. I actually was reading TRP at the time all this happened, but I didn't follow anything it said, which is why I'm making this rant, its so sad that the truth was right in front of me but I was too beta to FUCKING LISTEN...

Anyways I gave up my studies, my grades, ETC, friends (this one hurts the most), and I regret it all, I tell everyone I can now to NEVER put pussy on a pedestal :(

/rant

I basically ruined my H.S. GPA when I dated. I have my head on straight now and all Im trying to do is get into school being carried solely by my internships, drive, and my standardized testing.

I was waitlisted from a school this week, which was surprisingly good news; I have known the admissions ""officer"" for some time and she told me that she likes me and just wanted to make sure I'm doing well in my classes senior year... I completely understand that!

But this school is the problem, Its a STEM focused school with a 1-7 girl to boy ratio, its social life is NONEXISTENT. I'm worried that although I'll be well off, I'll be missing out on the College Experience (TM) entirely. Is treating this college as a prolonged ""Monk Mode"" a good idea? I feel like if I do well I'll have guaranteed work lined up, I absolutely love programming, I'll make connections with other smart guys, and honestly I really don't have too many other options lined up besides military service..."

It's all I've wanted to do ever since. I'd like to share my passion for FPGAs with this subreddit by purchasing FPGA development boards for 20 of you.

Here's how it will work:

Send me a PM using a reddit account that is at least 3 months old. Tell me a little bit about your experience with FPGAs and what you'd do with an FPGA board if you had one. Also tell me which of the following boards you'd like:

1. Digilent Arty (Xilinx Artix 7)
2. Terasic DE0-Nano Soc (Altera Cyclone V)

If you are picked I will PM you back tomorrow (Sunday) asking for a name and mailing address. I will only ship to addresses in the continental US. 

My intent is to help people that have the passion and time to learn but don't have the funds to purchase an FPGA board for themselves. My targets are college students, unemployed college graduates and unemployed professionals. If you are an *employed* professional please don't ask for a board. If you already have an FPGA board of *any* kind please don't ask for one. Please don't get all your friends to request a board. Please don't cross post.

**EDIT:** 

Thanks to lord_dong for getting into the spirit and offering to send a board to someone on the far side of the pond.

This giveaway is now closed. If anyone is expecting a board and doesn't receive it by the end of next week please PM me. "
3xjpss,6,2015-12-20,Rant about My Job.,apolla3,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3xjpss/rant_about_my_job/,"I hate my job.
It's really a shame, I love who I work for. But I hate what I do with a passion. I have an engineering job but I do the most basic and bane work there is. Interns could do my work. I would have thought from the high praises my boss(es) give me that I could move on by now to other projects.

My job is unfulfilling. It makes me depressed. I get more satisfaction out of my extracirricular activities but they're just not enough to keep me sane anymore.

My SO literally works at the same company as me. He does similar work, but doesn't understand the depth of my problem. He says I should suck it up, I make too much to quit. I think he's more worried about what his position will be like if I quit and he's still there . He says others haven't switched projectd either but they at least have a variety to choose from. I don't see my career going anywhere.

I feel trapped. The thought of having to go back, feeling unappreciated, makes me sick. I know I have anxiety issues but this is different. I want to cry. I have cried at work before, because it seems like there's no way out. No one wants to listen to the moderately well-off girl who hates her job ""for no reason"", as they say.

I see others moving up in the company who were hired a few months after me. I see people with multiple projects on their timesheet, whereas I am only entrusted with one project. I'm efficient at it, but I feel like I'm being left behind.

Evaluations are coming up. Every year I mention I'd like to work on ANYTHING ELSE, other projects, etc, but all I get are false promises or ""we need you to stay where you are.""

I want to look for other jobs. Based on the BS they give me for my eval this year, I will have to make a choice. Is it selfish to want to be happy where I work, to give up benefits and a rather understanding boss for the unknown?

I wanted to make a difference in the world. I am nothing, just a monkey at a computer all day. No one else gets it--I just want to be useful, needed, irreplaceable. They could operate without me, I just trained some new people. I won't be leaving them in a lurch, but I wonder if this is the right thing to do.

At this point, it feels like my sanity is at stake. And then obviously, my career. Possibly marriage."
3xjrnq,2,2015-12-20,Advice for prospective CS Pre-med,GrassTypePokemon,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3xjrnq/advice_for_prospective_cs_premed/,"Hello,

I'm currently a second year computer science student, and am thinking about a career in health. The only pre-reqs that I've completed so far are calculus and inorganic chemistry, and I'm planning to take a Bio and a Physics class next semester, and filling the rest of the pre-reqs over my next two years. Essentially, I'd be keeping my CS major while taking the pre-req courses; will this put me at a disadvantage?

Also, I was wondering what the general opinion was on software related ECs versus biology-related ones? I know clinical volunteering is necessary, but I was more wondering for research and summer programs, for example would a research program look better than a software internship.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and if anyone has been in this position before, I'd love to hear how you went about doing it!"
3xk8z1,6,2015-12-20,PM to Developer (w/ No SWE Internships),jimmystemp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xk8z1/pm_to_developer_w_no_swe_internships/,"Hey all,

Quick background on me: I graduated with a CS Major at a Top-10 school and took a PM job at a large start-up right out of college. I've been working here for 1.5 years now, but I've come to realize that I'd be better fit as a developer. My only problem is that, while I have CS projects and a GitHub with some of my work, I've only interned as a PM. I've never actually done an internship as a developer or SWE. 

I'm confident in my technical abilities, but I'm not sure how best I can demonstrate this on my resume. What are some resume suggestions for a PM without a SWE internship to 1) demonstrate that he's technical enough for entry-level developer jobs and 2) he's dedicated to actually being a developer for the foreseeable future.

Thanks!"

I got accepted into UMich LSA for Fall 2016 (yay!), and it's my top choice.

I'll most likely be choosing CS as my major, and I was wondering, how difficult/easy is it for international students to get internships and eventually full-time jobs after graduation in the U.S.? The ECRC websites states that 92%+ students either got jobs or went to graduate school, but I just wanted to confirm and get a real person's input on this.

Just for context, before I met him freshman year, I had no boyfriends or relationships before him. I was a virgin in every sense because I spent all of high school studying and trying to get good grades. Total nerd. He's my first real, adult relationship, and I'm still learning a lot from it.

We told each other I love you, and at the time I thought I meant it. I still do, at least I think I do. What's not to like? He's handsome, funny, caring, honest, and he gets my weird jokes and sense of humor. We've had arguments but who doesn't? We are both straightforward and no-bullshit people so we resolve our issues rather quickly and move on. I had many emotional (and intimate) firsts with him and I have no regrets. We would hang out every week for 2-3 days and then I'd drive back for school and he'd go to work that week. The longest time apart was 10-12 days. 

I am finally home after finals and... something changed. This is the first time I'm home in a year - I spent my summer doing an internship and still got to see my boyfriend regularly. Basically, this entire year I was so busy with school and internships and extracurriculars. But now I'm finally home with my family and I have had a lot of time to think and relax and self-reflect. 

It's been only five days since I saw him and I feel nothing. We talk/call every day and I ask him how he's doing, he asks me the same, blah blah blah. Nothing has changed. But I have never felt so empty and apathetic towards him before. Five days ago, as he drove me to the airport, I was crying and hugging him because of how much I thought I'd miss him, but here I am (he is American, I am not. I am in my home country), and I feel nothing. I don't hate him, I may even feel positively inclined towards him right now, but I don't know if I love him. This is so drastically different from even a week ago, where I was making him scrapbooks and writing him love letters and baking him things and moping about how I wouldn't see him for like a month. 

My family is great, I love being back home, I love my friends... I don't know what's wrong. Maybe I'm just tired from my exams (they were pretty rough)? 

All I know is, I was in a pretty bad place last year around this time. I have not gotten diagnosed (mental disorders are not taken seriously here...), so I can't speak with complete certainty, but I believe I have been struggling with anxiety and depression since my mid-teens. I kind of attempt to ""forget"" it because I went to/currently go to competitive and rigorous high schools/colleges, as well as overloading on side jobs/social events/extracurriculars, but every time I'm alone and have free time, these thoughts come back. They're just so draining. I thought having someone in my life who loves me and cares for me and who I (allegedly) love back would alleviate some of this, but I guess not. 

I don't even know if this is the cause of my apathy and how neutral I feel. When I talk to him now, it's like catching up with an old classmate. Almost like a chore (I'm an introvert so talking is kind of draining for me).

Please help, I don't know what's wrong with me. I know I should be mad at myself for even writing this but I'm not. But I guess a part of me does feel *some* concern? 

Thanks.

**tl;dr: I thought i'd miss my boyfriend of almost 1 year who I love(d?) sooo much because I wouldn't see him for about a month. But now that I am home and alone with my thoughts, I feel very apathetic towards him and don't really... care? It's neither positive or negative. Nothing has changed about our relationship. Wondering if it's because I use schoolwork/side-jobs/relationships to occupy me during the school year/summer time and I only start feeling this way when I have free time as I believe I have had severe depression since my mid-teens. Is it normal to feel this way for someone you love?**"
3xkiba,36,2015-12-20,There is a Naked Mole-Rat Man that Lives in the Woods by My Friend's House,knowssleep,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3xkiba/there_is_a_naked_molerat_man_that_lives_in_the/,"This happened five years ago, in a the time I took off between my getting my associate's degree and transferring to a four-year University. My dirt-bag fuck-off years, so to speak. My mother had just thrown me out of the house because her meth-dealing boyfriend thought I was ""trouble"" , and I was staying with Chuck, one of my best friends from high school. I was 20 at the time and he was a year older than me, but still living in the woods with his parents and driving over an hour and a half to college each day. He was a little bitter about it- he often complained about all of the opportunities for internships, networking, and extracurriculars he was missing out on- but he managed to get his bachelor's degree with zero debt, and has a decent job landscaping now. Better than most people in this dirty old town can say, that's for sure.   

Anyway, he let me post up in his garage with my pitbull, Jerry. Jerry had to stay in the garage so he didn't hump his parents' yorkie to death, which suited me fine. It was the perfect zone to get stoned and watch shitty nineties comedies like ""Baby's Day Out"" and ""Encino Man"" over and over again. Chuck was 21, so he was able to buy liquor just about every night- though he had to sneak it past his parents in his backpack. It was a little bit of a weird situation, I admit, but we had a lot of fun.     

Chuck's parents were great people- Christians in the truest since of the word. Even though they were prudish about drugs and alcohol, (and given Chuck's predilection for things like ether and painkillers, perhaps they were right to worry) they were more than happy to take me in for over six months, helping me to look for jobs and even buying me random gifts the whole time I was there.    

Chuck lived right on the border of a national forest, and in his youth had cleared dozens of ""trails"" through miles of thick pine scrub and swampland. I say ""trails"" in quotation marks because most of them were either half-assed dead ends, or labyrnthine mazes that occasionally became overgrown in certain areas, making them appear to be dead-ends when closer examination revealed them to be only the tip of the iceberg. And of course he never knew which was which, but I loved getting him to take me out there after I rolled us a nice fat blunt or two. Especially at night, with a backpack of Canadian Mist whiskey and a couple of flashlights.    


	******************************************************    

 On this particular night, we were not even that far out. We were only in his driveway-which wasn't more sophisticated or populated than his ""trails"". It was a long, sandy dirt road hacked through two miles of forest decades before, with only one shady-ass neighbor halfway down, who just sat on his porch in his underwear all day with a shotgun and a far-off stare . We were a little ways past his house, toward the back-country road that he lived off of. It's hard to explain just how far from civilization we actually were, except to say that we were about half an hour fby car rom the closest gas station.   
We were sitting on a rotten log	, near a swamp that the ""driveway"" curved around, deep enough behind the scrub that no one would have seen us from the dirt road even on a bright day. We were smoking a tiny joint of some pathetic dirt weed that I'd had to walk ten miles down the road to pick up the day before. It was a large amount, but it was hardly worth it.   
 
""We're white trash, you know that?"" Chuck said. ""I mean, even if I do finish my degree in Neuroscience, there's no hiding it. I don't feel comfortable in anything but a wife beater and gym shorts.""    

""Don't sweat it, man,"" I said, puffing and holding it in, ""You're the smartest guy I've ever met. Your always talking about like, neurons and Roman history and shit. The people that matter will see past all that.""    

""I guess you're right, but it's pretty impossible to find anyone else with the same interests out here. I've yet to make any college friends, and at this point in my life I'll never be acclimate to a big city. Or even a little city, for that matter. Even a town, really."" 
   
""Well, your cool with me bro. Only my buddy Chuck would smoke some shwag with me in the middle of the woods while we sat on a dead body.""      

""JESUS CHRIST!"" He shouted, shooting up and looking down behind him. I really miss fucking with him. ""I hate you, Hunter,"" he said.    

I lit a cigarette and stared at the moon for a while. It was a beautiful, mild winter night, just windy enough to put on long pants. In those days, nothing mattered but being out in the wild with my friends, and the isolation was a welcome repreive from the madness of my dysfunctional family and the ubiquitous judgemental stares of the old bastards that the rest of Florida is notorious for.     

Jerry started growling. Pitbull though he was, I'd never heard him make anything but panting and mewling noises until that night.     

""A canine, nonetheless!"" Chuck laughed. It was an inside joke between the two of us- something that a mutual friend had shouted upon seeing a K-9 officer parked on the side of the road. But a primal instinct kept me from laughing.     

""SHUSH,"" I said quietly but firmly as I watched the shadows moving suspiciously. The moon's reflection on the sugar sand and pine needles glowed like porcelain, obscured by a thousand jet black shadows from palms and pines. Listening closely, I could hear something making a sound like an old man smacking his tongue against the roof of his dry mouth. Something was moving slowly in the direction the dog was staring, and as soon as I focused on it, it craned its head up like stock-footage of a meerkat.      

Jerry started barking like crazy, and Chuck managed to point our flashlight at the thing. Staring up at us was what appeared to be a gigantic naked mole rat, about four feet high with a human-looking pink body and hands. For some reason, instead of frightened, it made me angry. How dare this hideous creature intrude on our nice night?!    
   
""GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" I screamed, running headlong at the creature. Chuck must have thought I was talking to him, as the light suddenly retreated towards his house. It was just me and Jerry now, both on all fours, screaming and charging through the brush. I don't know if it ran, or if in the darkness I had simply barrelled past it, but after a while I realized the creature was gone. The tongue-thrashing noises had stopped. ""AND DON'T YOUR ASS COME BACK NOW, NEITHER,"" I shouted into the night.       

         *******************************************************

The next morning, Chuck didn't say a word to me or his parents. I don't think he even bothered to take a shower, he just hopped out of his bed and into his car, straight to school. I finished up the last of the Canadian whiskey from the night before, and suddenly the anger came back from the night before. It evaporated, however, when Chuck's mother, miss Chinaski, offered me some home-made pickled pigs feet for breakfast.       

""Chuck didn't even bother to say goodbye,"" she said. ""That's unusual. Oh well, more pigfoot for us!""     
God I love pickled pigs feet. The Chinaskis weren't exactly farmers- Mr. Chinaski owned a greenhouse in which he grew ornamental flowers that he sold to Wal-Mart and other major retailers in bulk- but every month they would drive up to a farm twenty miles away and stock up on various cheap meats, such as pigs feet, goats head, cow tripe, etc. Ms. Chinaski could make an awful lot with an offal lot, I tell you what.    

""Mr. Thompson,"" Mr. Chinaski walked in, eyeing me suspiciously, smiling and pulling his overalls over his potbelly to rest loosely on his boyish chest. ""What were you boys getting up to last night?""      
""We just took Jerry for a walk,"" I said. ""Why, what's the haps?""      

""AHA!"" He shouted playfully, ""So. . . did the little mongrel get into anything?""     
""Not that I know of. Why do you ask?""    

""Hmmm. Well, something has been eating my fertilizer. I guess I'm glad it's not Jerry, all that phosphate's probably not good for him. Light him up like a Lightin' Bug, Guar-an-teed,"" he said, rubbing his chins thoughtfully.    

""Holy crap,"" I said. ""What would possibly eat fertilizer?""   

""Big plant?"" He shrugged.    

	******************************************************* 

That night, Chuck decided he wanted to talk about the mole-rat man. ""So, what the fuck was that?"", I believe his exact words were.    
""Well I don't want to scare you dude, but I think it was half mole-rat, half man. And it might be eating your dad's fertilizer.""    
I showed him some pictures on his computer of naked mole rats, and he concurred that they did look like a tiny, less anthropomorphic version of the monster we saw. We also Googled ""What eats fertilizer,"" but we didn't find anything more enlightening than ""Big plants?"".    
Just thinking about the creature made me irrationally angry. That night I had a dream about it wearing my mothers clothes and jewelry, making out with her scumbag boyfriend and making that terrible tongue-flailing noise.    
I was sleeping on an air mattress in Chuck's room that night, instead of my cot in the garage- we'd fallen asleep watching Adult Swim on cartoon network, neither one of us really felt like being alone that night- and when I woke up I was punching the air. Chuck was wide awake and staring at me.   
""Dude, WTF,"" he said. ""You just kept saying, 'I'll rip your throat out you bastard' over and over again. Was it mole-rat man?""     
I didn't see the point in lying. ""Yes,""  I said, ""he makes me really mad for some reason. Do you get that reaction from him?""     
He considered it for a minute, then said, ""No, it's more of a pants-shitting terror for me. I don't know if I want to go back out there anytime soon.""      
When he said that, I was livid. I couldn't smoke in his house, and I sure as Hell didn't want to go outside alone. But going outside and wandering in the woods was really the only thing to do when Chuck was at school. ""This pussy-meat mole-monster is ruining my life,"" I said, punching the air mattress. It instantly started deflating.     
""Duuuude, not cool,"" Chuck said.         

	*********************************************************  

A few days later, we woke up to Chuck's dad stomping and shouting about holes.     
"". . . And this dirty ol' ankle biter was just diggin' in the damn yard! As soon as I hollered at him he scampered off like he was on drugs or sumpin,"" I heard him talking to Mrs. Chinaski in the other room.    
I wandered outside groggily for my first cigarette of the day, and saw exactly what he was talking about. A dozen shallow holes, like big armadillo holes, were dug around his greenhouse.      
Just out of curiosity, I pushed back the creaky steel door that served as entrance to the half-acre building of wood and black shadecloth. Not for the first time, I thought about how underneath the thigh-high metal beds of plants would be a too-perfect hiding spot for a monster, serial killer - or moleman. On the few occasions that we had let Jerry roam around the greenhouse, we had lost him for hours underneath the hundreds of thousands of plants, occasionally rushing past our feet from underneath one bed or another like  snake in the grass.     
As Mr. Chinaski had said, there were holes in the fifty pound bags of blue fertilizer, and little blue pellets strewn all around them, both inside and out. After I was done investigating, I went back inside to find Mr. Chinaski on the phone with someone, sounding uncharacteristicly agitated.    
""Yes, I'm sure it was one of your kids. Who else could it have been? I think they might have been h-whackin' off in my greenhouse too, I swear I felt one of their dirty little hands try to grab my ankle last night.""    
He must have been talking to someone down the road, I thought. Of course he wouldn't have seen the moleman. He was one of the most logical people I had ever met- even if he had gotten a good look at the him, his brain would have said ""naked child neighbor"", just to save his sanity.     
""Mr. Chinaski,"" I said, ""there's something I need to tell you when you get off the phone.""    
Maybe it wasn't a great idea- I was sure he was going to accuse me of being a druggie and kick me out- but I told him about the naked mole-rat man we had seen a few nights before. Maybe just because he was such a great guy, he actually gave me the benefit of the doubt.   
""Well if that isn't the most spine-chillin' thing I ever heard,"" he said after a thoughtful pause. ""Gives me the heebie jeebies. And your sure you aint just been smokin' them left-hand cigarettes?""    
What I almost said was, ""So what, there's a goddamn moleman on the lose!""      
Fortunately, what I did say was, ""No sir.""     
He unlocked his gun cabinet and pulled out sixteen shells and a 30-06. ""Well, I guess I know what I'm doing tonight,"" he sighed, shaking off a visible chill, "" I aint gonna shoot a kid, but . . . fuck molerats."" This was the first and last time I'd ever heard him curse.     
     
	  ***********************************************     

Mr. Chinaski held a vigil in his tree stand that night, and Chuck and I waited for word in the garage, drinking malt liquor, doing whipp-its and watching Beavis and Butthead on an old VCR. There is truly no better way to appreciate the beauty of the show.   
""So What do you think, Hunter? I mean, what are the chances he actually kills the thing, even if he sees it? And does it make it more or less terrifying if we have a mole-rat man's carcass on our hands? What if it's just a really hideous, mentally-handicapped person and he goes to prison for murder?"" That last question made us both laugh pretty hard, but it was probably just the nitrous oxide.    
""Don't worry,"" I said. ""You're dad's a smart guy, so worst case scenario: he shoots and misses. At least then maybe the bastard will think twice about hangin' round here again.""    
A lot of people get freaked out when they see a balloon of nitrous being passed around- and in most cases where you are inhaling a drug in gaseous form, you're looking at something that's going to cause brain damage- but it's actually a pretty safe, short-acting drug. It's basically a mild analgesic that happens to come in gas form. As long as you make sure that you are getting oxygen as well (as simple as remembering to get a breath of actual air every thirty seconds or so), it's not going to kill you.     
Now that that little pro-drug PSA is out of the way, I will recount to you how I got way to fucked up on nitrous that night and knocked over Chuck's cockroach collection, spreading hundreds of cockroaches all over my cot. I'm pretty sure that's the worst thing that's ever happened to someone from doing whipp-its, right after that guy who killed himself by filling a garbage bag with the stuff and putting it over his head.     
Chuck had been (rather succesfully) breeding cockroaches to use in an art project with one of our mutual friends, a photographer/ drug dealer who called himself ""Puppet"". His work never did take off, but he had some really interesting ideas for ""Images that no one has ever seen before."" He wanted to take pictures of hot girls naked and covered in cockroaches, and while he was busy finding hot girls (I'm not sure if that ever did really pan out), He assigned Chuck the important responsibility of breeding cockroaches.     
""OH NOOOOO,"" We both screamed as one as the irridescent little monsters scuttled over my cot and into the cracked walls of the garage. Without saying a word, we both flew into a rage and started breaking things. When I asked him about it the next morning, he put it into words more elegantly than I ever could: ""Our lives aren't working out exactly the way we planned, are they?""     

	  **********************************************************    

Turns out, everyone had dreams about the mole-rat man that night; even Mrs. Chinaski. In her dream, the creature had scuttled in and stolen her freshly baked cookies. For Mr. Chinaski, the dream involved killing the creature, only for it to fall apart in his hands when he tried to carry it back to the house, and punching a wall until his hands fell off.  
In Chuck's dream, It just sat there in his driveway, looking up at him and picking its nose while he locked the doors to his car and huddled under the passenger seat. In my dream, it was watching me masturbate while watching ""Wheel of Fortune."" I didn't notice it was there until it attempted to solve one of the puzzles in a high-pitched, childish voice- at which point I woke up screaming and picking roaches off of myself. I didn't tell anyone about my dream.     
Mr. Chinaski came in with his gun and exhaustedly recounted the events of the night. While he didn't see anything, he did hear something making slurping, tongue-sloshing sounds in the woods. He admitted that they had made him irrationally angry, because they reminded him of the noises his father had made when he was dying of lung cancer. ""Plus, it was just annoying after a while,"" he added.    
At this point, we were all tired of being scared of such a stupid thing. Every night I would take Chuck and  Jerry into the woods to smoke, and we would go further and further each time, hoping we would encounter the things again and hopefully beat the living hell out of it. But it wasn't until one night in particular that we saw it again.     
One of the old trails that Chuck had carved out led to a prehistoric-looking swamp, filled with dragonflies, sideways oak trees, and gigantic ferns that were bigger than the average person.  ""This is as good a place as any,"" he said, pulling a hypodermic needle out of his pocket.    
""What is that, heroin?"" I asked.   
""No, dude, it's anabolic steroids,"" He said, flexing his scrawny arms. ""Nah, it's actually crushed up oxycontin in saline solution.""    
""Holy shit, that's worse,"" I said. Honestly, needles are about where I draw the line anyway, but that just sounded horrible. ""You do what you want man, but I've seen enough of that shit in my lifetime. Believe me when I say that road is a dead end, and comes with no glowing recommendation from me.""     
Ignoring me, he shot himself up- amateurishly, missing the vein twice- and sat down on a log, his face a mixture of apprehension and excitement, fading slowly into a goofy grin. He sat there a minute without saying a word, then started staring behind me.   
""Hey, look who it is, "" he giggled. Something about the way he said that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and looking down at Jerry I could see something was giving him a similar reaction. ""GGGrrrrrrrrr,"" I heard him whispering.     
Looking up, two pink eyes were looking at me from inside the cavernous hole in a cypress tree. When my eyes focused in the darkness, I could make out the things whole body, sitting slumped over in the tree's cave. When I stepped toward it, it started making a more high-pitched, chittering noise than it had before. *That must be its warning sound,* I thought. *It's fucking threatening me*.    
Not thinking twice, I broke off the biggest branch I could find off of a downed pine and charged toward the damnable beast. I began beating it down with my fists, closing my eyes to avoid looking at the hairless abomination. Halfway through I dropped the branch, realizing that I hadn't used it as a weapon once- that it had only served as a confidence booster.    
When I opened my eyes, I saw the worst thing possible: Chuck's broken and bloody face smiling up at me. ""Pain is . . .ecccccstasssssy,"" he mumbled.     
""Said like a true fucking cunt,"" I said, and hit him again. I could hear the chittering again in the darkness, and this time I knew what it meant. It was laughing at me.     

	*********************************************************************

It was really hard to explain to Chuck's parents why their son was so messed up, in more ways than one. I explained that he had been attacked and traumatized by the mole-rat man, which was half true, anyway. HIs mom cried immediately, and his father eyed me suspiciously, then said, ""That dirty rat. This won't do at all."" They just seemed. . . defeated.    
After I put Chuck to bed, I sat outside the garage, staring into the early morning and smoking one of those cheap cigarettes that looks and smells like it was wrapped in a strip of paper bag. Thinking.   
It occured to me that whatever this thing was, it was feeding off of our anger. It was the only reason I could imagine why it made everyone so irrationally angry, and why it kept showing up in our thoughts and dreams. *Or maybe,* I thought, *I'm just a drug-addled loser, who is letting his imagination ruin his friend's life.*    
Could it be possible, that somehow this was all my fault? I couldn't imagine myself digging holes in the yard or chewing on fertilizer in my sleep, but was it really that much more far-fetched than some cryptozoological creep hunting my friend's family? Somehow, though, this explanation seemed both too simple, and too complex. I ashed on an ancient lawn gnome, and wondered who exactly was meant to see these lawn ornaments in the middle of the woods.    
 
	   ******************************************************************   

I woke up to the Chinaski family yorkie going crazy. I looked over my shoulder to make sure Jerry was still sleeping next to me and not raping the poor thing again, and then groaned in frustration when I saw his hackles raise. *It's the damn thing again,* I thought. If it was, I wanted to be sure this was the night I ended it. I opened side door to the garage and, sure enough, there stood a four foot tall naked mole-rat man, only a few feet outside.   
For the first time I saw the things full body from the light of the garage, its dry, cracking skin covered sparsely in thin spurts of blonde hair every few inches. I held out its human-like hands, as if expecting me to give it something. This close I could even smell the thing, a musty and antiseptic odor not unlike a year old jizz-sock. I felt the anger rising up in me again, but this time I was determined to fight it. That's when the fear came.   
""What do you want?"" I asked.    
It looked beyond me, towards Jerry, and made a shaky, spastically robotic come-hither motion. It was chittering again, a sound that made my stomach drop. Jerry ran past me, and too late I realized what was happening.  
""NO!"" I shouted into the night, but they had already disappeared into the dark and endless woods that started ten yards from the door. Once, on Google Maps, Chuck and I had tried to find the end of those woods.  We discovered that in some areas they stretched out all the way to Daytona Beach, two hours away. They could be anywhere. And I already knew that one way or another, Jerry was never coming back.    
I told everyone in the house, even Chuck, that Jerry had simply run away. They tried to help me look for him, but I wasn't hopeful. I didn't mention the mole-rat man again, partly because I didn't want to think of him, and partly because part of me hoped that he'd gotten what he'd wanted and gone away. And then a part of me, the part of me that wanted to see Jerry again, hoped that this was not the case.
   
	*********************************************************************   

I moved out a few months later, and went to live and work part-time with a cattle rancher near the university I am still currently studying at. As far as I know, no one has seen or heard from the naked mole-rat man since. Sometimes when I talk to Chuck, he makes jokes about it. Of course he does; it happened a long time ago, and he has no way of knowing that thing took my best friend away from me.    
I don't know what became of Jerry. Sometimes, when I'm feeling optimistic, I wonder if maybe the creature was some kind of Vengeful First-Nation God or Trickster Spirit, that makes people turn on each other and then frees their domesticated animals, and then takes them on amazing adventures through the forest. But I very much doubt that. That is not the feeling I got from that entity at all.      
I remember you, Jerry. I remember the way you would put your paw over your face whenever you had to use the bathroom in front of people; the way you would beg for a cigarette but never for food; the way you chased dragon flies in the forest; the way you humped that Yorkshire Terrier like a goddamned king.    
And when I graduate next year with my Masters in Ethnobotany and start walking the Appalachian Trail, aside from weed, smudge sticks, and religious icons, I'm going to be taking a picture of you. And if I see that mole-rat man again, he's going to have to answer for what he done.

3xlm64,2,2015-12-20,TIFU by losing at FIFA,the-enlightened,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3xlm64/tifu_by_losing_at_fifa/,"This happened back in May. I've been a lurker for quite a while now but just recently made an account. So a little background - I am a university student, absolutely adore FIFA (online 1st division champion) and can get very competitive. I always admit defeat if someone beat me fair and square but a lot of the times its because of stupid game errors and that really annoys me. I also have a slightly darker side where I love listening to psychedelic music and writing. 


So I had recently secured an internship, and was going home from Uni to pack my bags and get everything ready to go. I was extremely happy since it was fairly hard to get one being a sophomore. The night before I was leaving Uni, I decided to invite a few friends over to play FIFA and have some beers; a chill night before I leave for a few months. So a few of my friends come over, we're playing FIFA, having a couple of beers and it's all very friendly. I play someone one-on-one and it starts to get competitive between us. And it is at this point that FIFA starts to get really annoying (he got a goal because of the stupidest deflection and I had about 4-5 shots on the post). I end up losing the game so I ask for a replay. He beats me again, partly because of his skill and partly because I am just playing a bad game. Now I'm starting to get frustrated, and I go over to get another beer but they're all finished so I open the half-full bottle of Vodka and start chugging it. In retrospect, this was probably the worst decision of my night. So now this is where my memories start to get hazy. We stop playing FIFA, and watch some Netflix, eating some food and just hanging out and I take this opportunity to become a dick to everyone in the room. I am making jokes about everything which are either pathetic or very slightly funny. I pick up my friends' shoes and start throwing them across the apartment, I'm throwing random stuff at everyone. I'm also yelling at people at the top of my lungs about how I can crush each and everyone of them at FIFA.


Now something you should know at this point is that I recently started watching a show called Hannibal (introduced to me by my roommate). At this point in the night, my roommate starts to play with the fact that I'm drunk. He tells me I'm shit at FIFA anyways (and just btw, we barely get along). And my immediate response is to tell him how I'm going to do things to him in his sleep worse than Hannibal does...and in an extremely descriptive way. And then I go over to him, slam him, and pin him to the ground. And I'm saying 'haha fuck you man!' the entire time. After literally 10 mins of pinning him to the floor, I get up and tell him he should have fought back. I also say how everything I was saying about Hannibal was a joke all along. 


Fast forward to 4 a.m. in the morning I suddenly regain consciousness. My roommate and another friend are still in the living room, and a realisation hits me about what I have done. Turns out I finished the half bottle of vodka, I embarrassed myself in front of all my friends who literally went home one by one as I kept throwing their stuff around the apartment. I still haven't talked to two of them since then. And as for my roommate, all he was trying to do was calm me down and turns out I was straight up sitting on top of him for a good 10 minutes while talking to a friend still at my place. Scared my roommate that I was going to eat his limbs once I ripped them off his body and how I wonder which part of his body would taste the best. After apologising to him for 30 minutes I finally passed out only to wake up and find that I had missed my bus back home.

As you can imagine, I haven't played FIFA since. 


TL;DR: As a result of losing at FIFA, got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of all my friends. Scared my roommate that I was going to fry his limbs in hot oil before I add some Srichacha to them. And ended up missing my bus to go back home from Uni. "

I performed well in community college and transferred to a top public school for Computer Science. I struggled very hard in the upper division courses and graduated with a 2.0 GPA. Although I did okay in lower division programming classes with an insane amount of help from others, I simply drowned in upper division coursework. I essentially got carried on all the projects by smarter students. During senior year I got so discouraged and burned out that I studied just enough to pass classes. I didn't work on personal projects or take online classes. The only actual programming I did was at work.

I worked as a backend developer intern throughout senior year and my boss said that my programming skills are weak. He said I was methodical in my process and worked very hard, but I didn't understand problems well enough to solve them. This discouraged me a lot because I tried hard to improve on the job, but when he realized my skills weren't great, he stopped helping me. And for a while I seriously struggled with the job. 

I graduated, studied for the technical interviews, and got a job at a big company in the Silicon Valley. Although I struggled a bit during the technical interview (4 hours long!), I displayed a huge amount of enthusiasm for learning and the company's mission, and that might have been what got me the job.

I'm still going through training, but I'm terrified of having to start doing real work. The project is significantly more intricate than anything I've ever coded and the code base is a monster. I barely graduated college and don't know how I'll ever be able to contribute anything meaningful to it. But on the other hand, this company is doing exactly what I wanted to do with my career and I'm hell-bent on becoming a better programmer and learning because I genuinely do want to be a useful addition to the team and contribute to this project.

I show up early, leave late, try to soak up as much knowledge as I can, ask my coworkers questions, take notes during meetings, and spend an extra hour or two at home catching up. However despite trying so hard sometimes its obvious that I haven't fully thought through a problem or done good enough research before asking for help, and that's something I need to work on.

I'm not in it for the money. My position doesn't even pay that well. But its like a switch went off in my mind. I went from being indifferent about being sub par in college to wanting so desperately to be a good programmer. But I feel like the train has left the station. It's too late to catch up, and at some point people will realize I'm actually an idiot and fire me.

Obviously my solution is to practice more. Spend more time programming, reading books, taking online classes. But what else can I do to quickly ramp up and suck less?"

Age: 17 (Birthday: March 17)

Godrent: Discordia

Appearance: She's got a naturally red spiky long hair, always back in a pony tail out the back of her hat, to show off her three cartilage piercings on her left ear, and her normal ear piercing on both ears. She has bright blue grey eyes, and thick, navy blue glasses, which help her eyes out quite a bit. Her finger nails are always short from her nail biting and guitar playing. She has a brilliant, yet mischievous smile, which isn't very apparent at all times, since she often has a neutral expression. She always wears black Chuck Taylor high tops, jeans, and flannel shirts. She wears a Sleeping bear Dunes snap back all of the time. She's 5'3"", and thin, pretty much straight up and down.

Personality: She's extremely loyal to her close friends, and stubborn. She doesn't want to be like her mom, always causing anger and trouble, although it happens a lot. She has strong trust issues, because, before she found out about her mom, her powers got her in trouble, making people mad at her constantly. She can be pretty morbid, if she wants to be, and brutally honest, but only with her close friends (Meaning her dad, since every kid at school hated her). She can get mad easily, and will hurt whoever makes her that way, no matter how hard she tries. Death has never bother her, probably because it often involves anger in families, which the side of her that is like her mom enjoys.

Catchphrases: ""Don't expect me to be like her. My mom didn't raise me."" And, ""So what?""

Powers

• Can cause anger/bitterness in others (Mostly directed toward her)

• Able to initiate discord and cause chaos

Skills

• Good at playing guitar, and piano.

• She can punch really well

Possessions

• Vintage game boy (Her dad also somehow wired a bunch of newer DS games to work with it.)

• She has those spikes that you put on your fist, so that your punches hurt like crazy

• A backpack of clothes

Backstory:

She grew up in northern Michigan. She was born on St. Patrick's day, showing up on her dad's door step a week later in a run of the mill baby carrier. Her dad was in his last year of school, and his mother, Barbra, who was furious, stopped helping him pay from it. She was a very old fashioned lady, and her son having a daughter without being married angered her. Barbra didn't talk to him or visit for three years. When she finally came back, she started to take care of Lil, watching her while Lil's dad was working at the morgue. Lil was ten when her grandmother moved away, and she started hanging out at the morgue when she was twelve, spending her time in a janitor closet. Her closest friends were the bodies that she would talk to sometimes, after family lawyers would come in and have screaming matches with each other, over wills. She would just say that she was sorry, that it was her fault that they were angry. She could just sense that kind of thing. When she was fifteen, her dad gave her an internship, and she started working with the bodies. Three days before she got to camp, she received a letter from her mother:

*Lilly, how are you? I wanted to tell you a few things. This is your mother, Discordia, roman goddess of chaos. First, you're a demigod. Yep, half greek god, half human. Have fun with that, monsters will probably show up at some point and kill you. Second, you know how everyone hates you? That's simply because of your powers. They aren't hard to control, just think of putting a stopper in them. And, lastly, go to Camp Halfblood, on Long Island, why don't ya? You may have a chance at living until you're eighteen there! Kisses, Mom.*

A monster did attack. She ended up punching the thing out and running, to protect her dad. She found a satyr, after taking a flight to Long Island. She got help to the camp from her.

Lil stares down the hill at the camp, one hand holding the backpack she has slung over one shoulder, the other adjusting her hat."

I graduated about a year ago with my chem eng degree.  I did an internship with a petrochemical company as a process engineer.  Now I'm a lab tech in R&amp;D working on soft drink bottle designs.

&amp;nbsp;

None of my experiences were anything i was particularly fond of.  I really enjoy coming up with creative problem solving solutions.  The process engineering job I had, I noticed that people were all interested in maintaining the status quo and not taking risks. I HATE it when people say we have done this for the last 20 years were not going to try anything new.  I was at a plant that was being run into the ground with little maintenance. With my current job, I am just a lowly tech so my opinion doesnt go very far.  I am also only a contract worker so Ill need to find a new career path in a few months. 

&amp;nbsp;

Despite being a chem eng, i really enjoy coding. I was teaching myself some basics after I graduated having minimal exposure in my classes (other than matlab). I have always been very interested in computers (both hardware and software) .  My primary reasoning for chem eng was renewable energy but there arent many jobs for recent graduates.  People have suggested design engineering and consulting but I know very little as to what that entails and how to get my foot in the door.  I am going to be taking the FE soon and possibly the GRE also depending on what would help me advance my career the most.

3xn5jq,19,2015-12-20,How can I deal with a rude and unresponsive coworker?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xn5jq/how_can_i_deal_with_a_rude_and_unresponsive/,"I'm trying to be nice and professional with him. I'm supposed to be working with him to get results on a few tests we run. I'm just an intern, but he's a technician. He isn't a software engineer. So I think he hates me just because I'm interning as a software engineer. But basically, whenever I ask him for results via IM he doesn't really respond. He was tasked with setting up three additional systems for me, but he never did it and I had to wait four days for someone else to do it. It made me look bad because my manager kept asking me why the systems weren't up yet, and I didn't want to throw this guy under the bus, so I took some heat for it. 

When I went to ask him for results in person, another coworker and him were talking about Star Wars and he pretty much was very rude and told me that he'll report results on his own time and that I don't need to ask him for them. And then when he told me what build he was running, it turns out that he hadn't even read my instructions properly and was running the build incorrectly. 

This guy complains about his pay and his lack of appreciation, and I've been trying to give him credit for the results he's supposed to be getting us, but I end up doing everything myself or asking other people to do his work. I'm supposed to have a leadership role because software engineers have more responsibilities than the technicians where I work, but he refuses to acknowledge that and treats me as if he's above me in authority. So how can I deal with it? Should I be aggressive and mean and tough the next time I ask him for something? Should I tell my manager first? Should I just tell him that I'm not understanding his attitude and that I'm trying to help HIM out? So far I've been very nice and maybe I look like a push over to him, but I need to get those fucking results and I no longer want to look bad because of someone else. I've been doing my job but I feel like maybe it doesn't look like it because the person who is supposed to be testing the builds and getting results refuses to be responsive or dependable. What is the professional way to deal with this kind of horseshit? It's honestly making the entire internship a toxic experience for me. It's a toxic environment because of this."
3xn8ez,95,2015-12-20,Terrifying Night on the Appalachian Trail,spankygrrl,Thetruthishere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/3xn8ez/terrifying_night_on_the_appalachian_trail/,"I lived in VA for a few years with my then-girlfriend, Jen. We're both outdoorsy people, so we often explored the area and tried out new places to hike, canoe, etc. 

Jen was a little obsessed with the idea of some day hiking the AT because she had a couple of friends who raved about it. However, since she was tied down to a rigorous internship, she then got the idea to do an overnight instead, since we lived in close proximity to the trail. When our schedules magically aligned for a few days, she got the idea to do the AT overnight and she couldn't be talked out of it. 

Since we decided to do this on a whim, we were admittedly pretty disorganized in our preparations. It took us a while to get ready and I was starting to feel rushed because it was late afternoon by the time we got in the car with our bags and the dogs. We still had to drive a ways to get to the closest trailhead and I worried about it getting dark before we found a spot and got set up. Not an auspicious beginning.

We arrived at the trailhead right before sunset. It was a large gravel parking lot across a small highway from some businesses. To our dismay, there was a guy in a red car right next to ours, the engine running, but he was just sitting there doing nothing. Jen was a little creeped out, so we tried to take our time in hopes the guy would be on his way. He just sat there doing nothing, not looking at a map, his phone, or us (that I could tell), his car running. We couldn't waste much more time, given that the sun was about to go down, so we shrugged off the creepiness and hit the trail.

It was stupid and ridiculous to start out at the time we did, of course. There are many things about this trip that I would do differently, trust me! We hiked for a bit, passed a trail shelter with 3-4 young guys and girls who seemed very normal and nice, said hi, and a ways down the trail, out of sight of the shelter, we noted a potable water spigot. We got maybe a mile in before I put my foot down and said we needed to make camp. It was near dark and had become difficult to see where the trail led, so we turned back to the campsite we'd just passed.

We could hear the highway traffic in the distance, so the spot wasn't all that peaceful, but we felt good about being near fresh water and also that we were within screaming distance of the other group. We scrambled to make camp. We got the tent up and went on a mad search for firewood in the dark. 

Oddly, all the wood was wet, like it had rained, but we lived in the vicinity and it hadn't rained recently. I'm excellent at quickly starting fires, but we struggled for a good hour, trying to get a fire started because all of the nearby wood and kindling was wet. Our flashlights started to die during the hunt for dry-enough wood, and of course we hadn't thought to bring extra batteries.

With only a failing headlamp left and having burned all the TP for lack of other firestarter, we managed to get a fire going and breathed a sigh of relief. We got dinner going, cracked open the Nalgene of wine, and settled in to chill. We ate, cleaned up, and headed into the tent.

We fooled around a bit and then headed to sleep. Some time later, I woke up not to a noise or anything, but to Jen lying awake and very tense next to me. Sensing her alarm, I asked what was going on, but she told me in a freaked-out voice to listen.

So, I listened. And I heard two things which I still do not have an answer for, but which set me on high alert. It was exactly that feeling that people describe of sudden internal alarm bells going off and knowing that something is really wrong.

First, there was a sound that resembled rocks being dropped from the top of a tree, hitting a bunch of branches on the way down. Thunk. Thunk, thunk. Thunk. Thunk.  It happened repeatedly. We whispered urgently to each other, trying to rationalize. Maybe it's acorns, I said, praying it was just acorns.

The other sound was more alarming; there'd be a period of silence and then somewhere just beyond the perimeter of our campsite, we'd hear a thick branch go SNAP! No rustling, no footsteps, no little twigs snapping... and whatever it was had to be big because those had to be quarter-diameter branches, by the sound of them.

I kept trying to rationalize that it was a wild animal, but I've camped a lot and spent a good amount of time outdoors, and the lack of rustling or other noises really freaked me out. The snapped branches weren't all coming from the same area, either; we were lying there in our tent feeling like sitting ducks, straining to tell if someone was coming, hearing rocks being dropped through the trees in the silence and then periodically a SNAP! from a random direction.

The hardest part to get across was the feeling of being there during this. It felt like *The Blair Witch Project*, terrifying and weird. The strangest thing to me was that the two dogs we had with us were completely silent the entire time. I was so scared at one point that I peeked out of the tent to make sure they were still there and that nothing had happened to them.

We then started discussing our total lack of weaponry, how stupid that was, and what we were going to do. We agreed that it was far scarier to sit in our tent blind and that neither of us were going to be able to sleep now anyway. We cautiously unzipped the tent, checked to make sure no one was around, and came out to sit.

We sat outside, shared the remaining bottle of wine to calm our nerves, and waited for the sun to come up. The noises stopped. Once the sky started to lighten and hours had passed, things felt normal again and it felt safe to go back to bed.

We slept for a few hours and the first thing I did when I got up was to look for acorns. I was really trying to rationalize what had happened and I felt certain that I'd find oak trees around. Well, you know what? I searched all around our campsite and there were no oak trees. We'd camped under a bunch of tall evergreens, but I didn't find pine cones or anything else that could be a likely explanation for what we heard. The snapping branches, I'd say animal, but why wasn't there *any* rustling? And if there was an animal around, why didn't either dog react at all?

We didn't bother with fixing with food because Jen just really wanted to get out of there. We broke down, gathered our gear and trash, and hightailed it out of there. It was such an intensely frightening, weird, and intense experience, that it was all we talked about on the way home.

Jen mentioned hearing about some AT murders, so the first thing I did when we got home was to get on the computer and start Googling. I discovered that in 1986, a lesbian couple had been found murdered while camping on the AT in VA. I then found that *another* lesbian couple had been murdered on the AT in VA 1996. The year we went camping on the AT in VA and had all this weird shit happen? 2006. Yes, really.

We just looked at each other wide-eyed. Crazy coincidence, probably, but that was the final piece for us regardless. Jen said, ""I am *never* going camping on the Appalachian Trail again. Fuck that."" 

-----------------------------

UPDATE: I've spent about two hours trying to figure out where this was and I still don't know. Nothing matches what I remember. It's been almost 10 years, so maybe the trail shelter is gone. Jen took a while to get back to me and she said she doesn't recall exactly where it was, either. :\

She said she thinks it was actually WV, but I looked along the easy access points to the AT from Morgantown and I couldn't pinpoint it. We moved from Morgantown to Roanoke for her internship and were back-and-forth for a bit until she sold her house. I might have gotten mixed up because of it; I do recall coming back to her house after the trip (I was looking up AT murders in her kitchen).

.

**Jen:** ""I'm not sure -- I really can't remember. It was probably the easiest place to hit an access point from Morgantown. And very close to a big highway because I remember we had to walk over it. But I don't remember what the name of the town was. When I get a chance, I'll look at the map.""

**Me:** ""I thought we were in Roanoke? I could've sworn we drove the Blue Ridge Parkway to get there, I know it was a big highway.""

**Jen:** ""Nope -- we lived in WV then, remember? We went back to my house... we were so glad to be back there. I remember sitting in my kitchen being like, ""Holy shit!! What the hell just happened?""

**Me:** ""Ohhhhh.. that's right. I looked up the murders at your house.""

**Jen:** ""When I tell people that story, it's mostly about how I froze, started shaking, cuddled into you, and told you it was pretty much all on you to think for both of us!"""

I’ll be finishing my last semester of college in January and will be having an internship during that time.  The internship is located about 10-15 minutes from my university and apartment; not too far but far enough where I can’t walk to.  

Came home for winter break (9 hour drive, but flew home which which was only 1.5 hours) to stay with my mom for 4 weeks.


Told my mom about the internship and that I’ll need to bring up my car.  Her answer was no, saying that I need to figure out another way to get to my internship.  I explained her that transportation at my college’s city is a poor system and would be unreliable.  She suggested Uber, but I explained that by the end of the semester I will have paid over $1,000 just for using Uber.  She said that it was fine, that she would paying for it and that it would less of a hassle.  Plus, she thinks my car is unsafe to drive the 9 hour trip (Volvo mid size sedan 2001).  


Not sure how it is less of a hassle considering I would always be having to relying on someone else, and economically it does not make any sense to be paying x2-3 more than just parking and gas (dad pays for my insurance).  


Wanted to talk to her about it again this weekend but I’m sure me just having a flat tire a couple of days ago (not a default tire, just a nail) won’t help my case.  


In general its always difficult for me to make decisions and her to be fine with.  She is a helicopter mom (calls 3 or more times a day.  likes me to call her when I wake up, when I’m home for the night, and when I’m going to bed) and likes having me under thumb knowing everything I’m doing and approving.  Slowly been telling her less or lying about where I am or what I’m doing. Treats me constantly like I’m 14 even though I have above a 3.5 GPA, have multiple job offerings for post-graduation, and been given a lot of responsibilities by my jobs and college (probably should to write another post about this since its a growing problem between my mom and I…).  


I understand she is my mom and that she does have some say in what happens in my life; but I do need the car and am not okay with Ubering to my internship everyday.  


Note: My mom does not pay for any of my tuition or housing.  Only pays for flights and clothes.  Can't have dad reason with her because they are divorced and not on speaking terms.


**tl;dr**: Overprotective &amp; controlling mom won’t let me bring my car to college due to my car being “unsafe” and would be a “hassle.”  Having a difficult time reasoning with her.  "

Naturally, they needed space from each other so his ex stayed at our place for a few days which was totally fine. My SO had already left for break so it was just me and her. Of course she talked a lot about the break up etc. and I was there for her emotionally. I tried to take her mind off of things but that didn't really help. I never liked my SO's older brother (slightly racist/mysoginistic tendencies, isn't nice to my SO) so we never got along. When I heard about the infidelity, I wasn't surprised.
Anyways, after few days, It's my turn to leave for break and my SO and I agree to let her have the key to our place so she can stay a few days. She had planned to go back to her place within the next week or find another living situation. One of her coworkers offered but she seemed hesitant. My SO and I will both be gone for about two weeks (back December 29th and 30th) so she has that length of time to figure things out before we both get back to the apartment and it becomes crowded. (small one bedroom)
This morning, she sends me a text saying going back to her place hasn't worked out and that she's moved a large amount of her things into our place. This made me feel annoyed because she sort of moved in for the long term without asking. We never discussed her paying rent or anything since she wasn't going to be staying for long and it seemed inappropriate at the time. I feel like a jerk for not completely opening our apartment to her without any restrictions, but I'm concerned that with another hard semester of college+work+my internship coming up after break, that her and her ex boyfriend's issue will be distracting. Plus, she didn't tell her ex where she's going but I'm betting he will figure it out and might show up at our place causing a scene. She's from out of state, it's pretty obvious where she would go first. I was completely fine with her staying at our place over the break, but when the new term starts, I'm concerned it's going to cause problems."

since 2000 prices have basically being going up yearly by as much as 14%.

Just this past Jan we moved into a new house (we booked it with a builder) and our homes' value went from 450 to nearly 500k already.  450k got us a semi-detached with 1900 sq.ft.

Im a university student and I just got an intern placement for 16 months that pays really well, way above average for an intern pay. 

This intern placement is very assuring of my future prospects and my family wants to book a new home (another builder is making a new home subdivison 2 minutes from where we live).

The thing is, im scared as hell. Prices have clearly been going up by like 10% every year, but nobody's salary goes up 10% a year!

My mom was trying to tell me how prices are going to keep going up and by the time im done college they will be so high and its better if we book a house now at the current prices.

Her logic is, back in 2004 we had the option to buy a new home but this same logic of market crashing ended up with us having to pay 450k in 2014 for something we couldve bought for literally half in 2004. (We finally booked a new home after overcoming that fear in ~2013-2014)

Doesn't there have to be a ""stop"" somewhere? The prices can't just increase this much every year forever and I dont want to end up in the situation where say we book a new house, then the market crashes and well, theres goes a few hundred thousand dollars. But then again I also dont want to end up paying more later than i have to if it means the prices are just going to keep going up.

Not sure what to do. I live with a fam of 5 in our current semi-detached of 1900 sq.ft. The new house costs nearly 700k but its detached and 2600 sq. ft. I'm just scared of losing money incase market crashes because to me..this is unsustanable the constant increases."

3xos7g,4,2015-12-21,"How can I [26/F] separate myself from my SO's [26/M] crazy, catty family over the holidays without being overly rude?",Fam-conundrum,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xos7g/how_can_i_26f_separate_myself_from_my_sos_26m/,"Hey r/relationships- hopefully you guys can help because I'm at a total loss! 

Just a bit of backstory: my boyfriend of 2.5 years and I live about half an hour away from his parents so I can attend grad school in the major city nearby. My family lives about 6 hours away, and I rarely get to see them, as I'm usually busy with schoolwork and internships. Everyone in my family also maintains a pretty crazy schedule, so frequent visits aren't an option. Despite this, we remain super close and talk almost everyday. Anywho- here is the issue at hand:

My SO's mother and I used to be pretty close, until I found out she was gossiping endlessly about my SO &amp; I on social media. Both he and I have gently suggested to her that it has to stop but she has continued to the point where it's out of control. My SO has given up and simply shrugs it off when it's mentioned, but it really bothers me a lot. This, coupled with the fact that she can't respect my wishes and keep my name off of her Facebook, has forced me to distance myself from her somewhat. I love her, but I can't tolerate the constant gossiping and prying. 


She recently invited me to stay with their family over the holidays, an invitation which I politely but firmly declined, indicating my preference to seize the rare opportunity to visit with my own family. My SO was aware of these plans and while he isn't jazzed about spending the holidays apart, he understands my desires and supports the decision. His mother explained to me that she understood, but has apparently been posting nasty Facebook statuses referring to me as a ""selfish Christmas Grinch,"" amongst other sentiments. She also accused me of avoiding ""family time"" during the holidays because I want to separate my SO from his family. She pointed out that I don't get along well with my SO's brother and his wife (which is true, but is at this point a non-issue) and said that I was being ""controlling."" I have NO desire to keep my SO away from his family over the holidays... We are both adults and can do what we want! 


All of this information comes to me second hand, via my SO's cousin, with whom I am close. I didn't believe it initially, but when my SO confronted his mother about it, she admitted that she had posted ""some stuff of Facebook."" She also revealed that my SO's sister-in-law, with whom I don't get along, also posted some unflattering statuses and had expressed happiness that I wouldn't be present at their holiday celebration. 


My SO's mother has said that if I ""blow them off"" this year, they may be less inclined to invite me to future family events. While it doesn't seem like a major loss RIGHT NOW, my feelings are kind of hurt and both my SO and I recognize that this is absolutely ridiculous. I intended to send her a brief message immediately after all of this went down, reiterating that my preferences had little to do with her and more to do with a desire to see my own family, but I was seriously angry and didn't want to come off as confrontational. I just don't want to be involved in any drama. But now it's been a week and I worry I've waited too long to smooth things over. Any advice? Thanks in advance!  


TL;DR- my SO's mom is pissed that I won't be spending the holidays with them, and has taken to social media to discuss her anger. I've waited a week to say something to her now, and I'm worried it may be too late!

* Honours (in machine learning related area): would help quite a lot in grad job search prospects and it would be a good experience and challenge to be able to work independently on a project for a whole year. This lets me expand on the courses I've done and work with some fairly prominent professors in this area.

* Exchange: would be a blast, enjoy the last year of uni, need I say more? However, it will mean that I will be overseas during the dates that grad job interviews/ applications are being held. And possibly even disrupt internships as those generally go for 3 months till end of February. (I think) considering most exchange semesters start at different times. 

What are your thoughts on this? job prospects or fun?

My situation is that I am the youngest (22) person in the my team. Everyone is 35+. It's great that I can learn a lot from them, but I feel I can't really relate to them. They have children, houses, etc.


I feel like I'm learning a lot, but I also feel like I'm missing an element in the workplace. I'm not making any real friends in this environment (by friends I mean friends that I can hangout with/do fun projects after work). There is no social event in my team or any of that nature.. Maybe I'm not a good fit?

I guess my real question is how important do colleagues impact your work life. Does social event/social interaction outside of work with colleagues matter to you guys? Or is it just a job, once you're done with your daytime hours, you don't interact with them after hours."

I can't wait to see some new exotics, some hope for a competitive scene, more pve content, less straight up recycled content, (OMG MY OLD EXOTICS, THE ONES IVE ALREADY GRINDED HOURS TO GET ARE BACK, I JUST NEED TO GRIND LEGENDARY MARKS TO REPURCHASE THEM, PRAISE BE TO BUNGIE) and all the other great ideas we've seen glimpses of.

They trained us so well to want to come back to the game day after day with these addictive economies, only to dumb down rewards or literally have none worth striving for anymore. It's very much a slap in the face and I expected more from the people who gave us the Halo series.

But I guess it's just, ""well you bought the $120+ worth of DLC's and spent your money on emotes, here's iron banner again.""

3xpvgb,16,2015-12-21,I work at a women's shelter and I'm scared to go back..,KittyLord0824,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/3xpvgb/i_work_at_a_womens_shelter_and_im_scared_to_go/,"**TL;DR** In a women's shelter, light that shouldn't be able to be switched on kept switching on and off. Second floor residential area, overwhelming fear, sense of someone being right behind me, didn't want to turn any corners or open any doors. CYC student reported creepy happenings that day. Second time in residential area that day, same overwhelming feelings of fear and being followed, hallway lights switched off, only switch for the hallway is in a locked room that I was a few meters away from. I'm scared to go back. What's going on? What do I do?

Well, I say ""work"". What I mean is an internship aka student placement. It's a relatively small shelter (max capacity of 25) with two floors. Every two hours we do a house check, making sure no lights have burnt out, no messes have been made, no fire lights are flashing, no phones have been unplugged, nobody has gotten into a locked room, etc. As I expected going into this placement, I've felt spirits before in there. These women and children have experienced abuse so I always figured if a family member or friend had passed, they'd probably be following them around just making sure they're okay. Little things will happen every once in a while. Things will be moved in women's rooms, you can hear a gentle whisper going ""hi"" or something sweet like that (I've even heard ""you're doing fine"" when I was in the bathroom trying to calm down after I'd been told I might be fired). 


**However**, the last day that I was there before winter break, I was seriously sketched out. We had a woman staying with us for a while that very strongly believed if a light flickered, it was one of her children that had passed letting her know they were watching over her. It seemed pretty accurate, since every time her abuser tried to contact her or housing got declined or she had an overall rough day, it would happen and when it happened, she was always in the room. The flickering never spooked me, in fact I thought it was sweet, but I think something was trying to copy or imitate that a few days ago. I was in the kitchen toasting my english muffin (no toaster in the staff room), talking to a couple of the women and another student. The student and one of the women were outside of the kitchen, leaning against the little counter/cutout thing in the wall where we leave snacks for when the kitchen is closed. The other woman was in the far corner making coffee. A while ago I'd taped down a light switch because the lights controlled by it are under the cabinets, right over the bread basket, and it makes the bread go funny. Suddenly, as we're all laughing at something the coffee-making-woman said, that light turns on. I said ""hey guys can we leave that light off please, it makes the bread go bad"" since I'd had my back turned. They all looked at me and shook their head, basically to say ""none of us did it"". The light turned off. We all exchanged glances, the light turned on again. The housekeeper was walking through the dining room, she's been there for a long time and knows the shelter inside and out, so I called out ""Hey Mary (fake name) is there another switch for the under-cabinet light?"" she said ""nope, just the one you taped down"". The light turned off again and I tried to ignore it since I was almost done making my sandwich. As I was packing my things to go to the staff room, the light turned on again. I went over to the light switch and it was flipped up. I tried to flip it down through the tape, it was too tight so I had to take the tape off, flip the switch, and re-tape it. It hadn't done that in the month or two it had been taped down, but I shook it off and went to have my lunch. When I came back, I noticed that a house check hadn't been done in a while so I snatched some keys and started the rounds. As soon as I got out of the stair well into the second floor, I wanted to turn around and run. Just run as far and as fast as I could, but I was already on thin ice with this place so I decided to stick it out. Every time I unlocked a door I was so scared something was going to be in the room/closet. I actually screamed at one point because a window caught MY reflection. I ran around corners to just ""get it over with"" because I was so convinced something was waiting for me around every corner. I felt something behind me the entire time. Even when I was still on the second floor but in the administrative area, I didn't feel a thing. It was just in the one specific section of the upper floor. Later I spoke to one of the CYC students and she said weird stuff had been happening all day like the TV in the locked play room turning on, bottle caps popping up in the middle of the CYC office and spinning ridiculously fast with no bottle to be found, etc. When I went to do my final house check before I left for the night, again in the second floor area, I felt that same imminent danger sensation and as I rounded the corner the lights turned out. The only light I had to go by was from a small window at the end of the hall with the street lights from about 20-30 meters away. I felt my way to another locked room/door in which is the only light switch for the upstairs hallway. Needless to say, in this locked room, the light had been flicked off. I would have heard if another staff member did that since I was literally right around the corner, and none of the residents can get in without us.

I'm so scared to go back. I don't know what to do. Part of me, a disgusting, selfish, part of me, hopes it's following one specific woman and she's gone by the time my break ends.

3xqhbf,5,2015-12-21,Former boss won't pay me out.,silkyjohnson6,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3xqhbf/former_boss_wont_pay_me_out/,"Edit: Sorry for the wall of text. There is a TL;DR at the bottom. Also this occurred in Alberta, Canada

So about a year and a half ago (June 2014) I needed to finish a month long practicum so I could get my diploma in video production. I found a small production house that worked perfect for me. There was only the Owner/Executive Produce (I will refer to him as ""Boss"" now) myself, and another young part time intern. I enjoyed working there because I wasn't shoehorned into one job and got to work on all parts of production. Video editing, animation, audio, camerawork and more. Even though we were not getting many jobs or contracts it was still a good learning experience for me because I had access to the software and could practice. 

After my one month practicum was over my boss decided to keep me on as an assosciate producer. He couldn't afford to pay me much but I was fine with that as I was more interested in the experience. We agreed to start at $1500/month while I worked there full time. We still weren't getting many jobs but there was plenty of work to be done around the studio. I ran many errands around town picking up supplies. I answered all the calls to the studio. I helped set up a web T.V show with him and even helped out with renovations (building an editing suite, soundproofing the room, switching offices around multiple times, painting, ripping up carpet, wiring internet and speakers).

Over the course of this time my boss kept on assuring me that I would get a pay raise as soon as we got more jobs and he was very appreciative that I was helping him out for so little. A couple times he couldn't pay me on time as he was waiting for a cheques to clear and I didn't complain. He said he was very thankful and wouldn't forget how helpful and understanding I was being. He would talk about the future of the company like I was a part of it and that we we're building something together. (I had no money in the company so I knew I wasn't fully in it, but he led me to believe that I got in on the ""ground floor"" as he stated many times) 

I started to feel a little insecure about the money about a year into working there as I felt I had no real financial security and since I had been making so little not a lot of savings to really fall back on. I addressed my concerns and he agreed and said I would get a raise to $1650 a month. That was nice but I was more worried about the security aspect and asked for him to draw up an employee/contractors contract (I had been getting paid by cheque and cashing it in as a contractor). He said of course He'll get his lawyer to draw one up, but he assured me it wasn't really necessary and I could trust him.

A few more months rolled by and we still weren't getting any new contracts. He brought on his ""Actor"" friend (I use the term loosly because he really hasn't done anything) to be a Producer and writer. He then cut the other young part timers hours back but my assured me he was keeping me on. Finally my boss let go the other young guy over a pretty minor thing (borrowed a tripod and put it away wrong). This wasn't the first hasty firing I had seen him do as he'd had falling outs with 2 D.O.P's (Director of Photography) he hired and with two seperate marketing companies we were supposed to be partners with. After the firing he still assured me that I was being kept on and I was helping build something. He even raised my pay to $1750

About a month later we had a shoot for a commercial. I packed everything up the day before as my boss and his ""actor"" friend sat in his new office that I just finished fixing up doing nothing. The next morning (Saturday) of the shoot we get there and it turns out I messed up. I forgot to pack a microphone cable. That could've been a big deal but the shoot didn't start for another hour and we were close enough to the studio that the ""actor"" could run back and get it before it was a huge problem. So he went back and got it and the 18 hour shoot went smoothly after that.

After the shoot we had a brief conversation about it where I apologized and accepted blame, I did fuck up after all. He agreed that I fucked up but it still worked out and we went back to the studio, unpacked and he said he'd see me on Monday.

Monday (Oct 19)  rolls around and I show up in the morning. He calls me into his office and said he has to let me go as things aren't working. I'm obviously rattled as I thought I had some sort of job security, compounded on the fact that I was getting major knee surgery in a week which he knew about, and didn't think I fucked up that bad. He assured me he would pay me the rest of my monthly paycheque.

A week later I texted him asking if I could come in and get a post dated cheque because I wanted to have all my stuff together before my surgery as I was gonna be out of commision for a few days/weeks. He said he would e-transfer me the money on Nov 1. I said I would rather have the cheque but he insisted on the e-transfer.

Nov 3 rolls around and still no e-transfer. I send him a text and he has a little freakout telling me to be patient and not press the issue. He says I fucked up the camerawork so bad he had to push the completion date for the commercial back (He never said anything about this before when he was reviewing footage or the first time I texted him over a week after the shoot) He said as soon as the cheque for the commercial clears he will pay me out.

I was very patient after that. I waited 6 weeks until I texted him again. When I texted him I got no reply. texted him again no reply. Finally on the third one he replys ""The busniess has gone belly up. Sorry man."" Now I feel bad. I didn't think I messed up the camerawork at all but maybe it fucked up the whole contract ad put him out of business. That guilt quickly faded though as that night him and the company uploaded the commercials to facebook, and the camerwork looked fine!

I text him the next day asking what was up. The commercials were completed and the cheque was obviously cashed but I still haven't got paid. Radio silence. I have texted and tried to call him but have gotten no response since he uploaded the commercial. 

Even if he is going out of business I worked on that commercial and if he got paid for it he has to pay me out. I know I shafted myself by not getting anything put in writing but I can prove he was paying my salary through my bank statements and have text messages from him saying that he would pay me as soon as the cheque for that commercial cleared.



TL;DR



I worked for a guy for a year and a half. I got paid a meager monthly salary. Since it was a small operation and since I was assured that I would be taken care of I never pushed very hard to get an employment contract (I did ask for one though and he did say he would draft one up). I made a minor mistake on a commercial shoot on Oct 17 and was fired on the 19. He said he would pay me for the whole month of october on Nov 1. Nov 1 rolls around and no money. Text him on nov 3 asking about it and he says as soon as the cheque is cashed for the commercial I'll get paid. Text him 6 weeks later on dec 17 and get a reply saying the business went belly up and he cant pay me. That night he uploads the commercials I worked on onto facebook and since then he has gone radio silent. Not returning calls. Not returning texts.

Am I entitled to anything or since I have nothing in writing am I fucked? I knew I was being naive but I didn't expect to get taken advantage of like this. 

If you read the whole thing thank you! Any advice is much appreciated."

3xr3ce,3,2015-12-21,"Me [20F] with my estranged half-brother [30-something], family recently re-established contact and I am unsure of how to start up communication",stellathediver95,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xr3ce/me_20f_with_my_estranged_halfbrother_30something/,"This is quite long but please bear with me. My 'problem' is not a problem but rather something quite small and silly I would like advice on, but the situation is a bit bizarre and I would love some outside thoughts on the whole thing. 

**TL;DR**: Family has re-established contact with an estranged half-brother that I have never met, I would like to get to know him a little but not sure how to approach without being too cold or too eager. 

**Background**

I am 20 and was raised as an only child. My father was married once before my mother and had two children, a girl and a boy - let's call them Jim and Jane. There is I guess 10-15 years between us in age. 

From what I understand, the ex-wife is a terrible person, caused a lot of drama, Jane took after her mother and did a lot of manipulative stuff like uninviting and reinviting my Dad from her wedding. I do not know the full ins and outs of this drama, by choice, because as far as I have always been concerned, my family is my mother, father and I and this drama had very little to do with me. What I do know is that when I was very little, Jane and Jim both lost contact with my father. My Dad has always been adamant that he will never have Jane back in his life, but as I have discovered now, Jim had very little to do with any spitefulness and was more just easily lead by Jane and his mother. Therefore, my Dad held no animosity towards Jim, but they did not  talk for basically my entire life anyway. 

In terms of how I feel, I have always known that I have a half brother and sister, always assumed they would never be in our lives again, didn't have any real memories of them. It was just kinda a thing. When I was younger it bothered me for a period. Now it does not.

**Current Situation**

Last year, Jane got in touch with me through facebook. Ultimately I decided I did not want contact with her, as she didn't really mean anything to me, and I knew it would bring a lot of pain to my parents. I pretty easily chose the happiness of my existing family over having contact with someone who I didn't know. I still believe this is the right choice. From this instance, however, I did find both my sister and brother on facebook.

A few weeks ago, my Dad's sister said that my cousin had been in touch with both Jim and Jane, and that Jim had requested contact with my Dad again. My Dad said yes on the condition that Jane and the ex-wife not be a part of his life again. Jim explained he had very limited contact with either of them, after having his own family and realising he didn't have to put up with their crap.

So Jim and my Dad have exchanged a few emails, which I saw, mostly general info about their respective families. Had a conversation with my parents obviously, wasn't too bothered by the whole thing as Jim seems to be a decent enough guy. I wasn't too interested in knowing too many details or anything, and figured that since contact has been re-established, I may as well embrace it and start up some communication with him.

**The Dilemma**

During a convo with my parents I said I wanted to message him of my own accord on facebook to get to know this guy I've never spoken to on my own terms. Which exactly what I intend to do, but... I have no goddamn idea what to say.

In my Dad's email to him, he's already filled in general info about me like my age, the college course I'm doing. So what is there left to start a conversation? I want to give enough details that there is enough to start a get-to-know you thing up, but not so much that it's too eager, because I still am a little unsure of the whole situation. But then, I don't want to come off too cold because I can be a bit of sarcastic cow, particularly when I'm nervous or uncomfortable.

So I'm thinking I can say a few things like, yeah I'm studying this course that's a bit unusual, I'm looking to do xyz after graduation, I lived abroad for a while working internships, I have a long-term bf, I like x type of music, y type of movies, no sports whatsoever, that sort of thing. Also that I would like to get to know him/his wife/family a little more.

It still seems kind of childish though. Does anyone have any outside input to give? 

Thanks a lot.

3xr5yk,18,2015-12-21,Launching a new series the right way,Arkelias,selfpublish,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/3xr5yk/launching_a_new_series_the_right_way/,"**TL;DR There is a science to dominating the hot new releases at Amazon, and this is how I'm using it.**

My frst series launched into the Amazon top #4,000 where it stayed for about five months. In the year since then I've published two more novels and a novella, and the series has sold around 25,000 books.

I did well, but I also made a LOT of mistakes. I advertised on sites that didn't give me a return, I mistimed promos, lost out on Kindle Countdown Deals, screwed up keywords, and made just about every other mistake you can make.

Today I have a chance to learn from all those mistakes. I'm launching my second series, and my goal is to get it into the Amazon top 100. I want this series to explode, and I believe that's absolutely possible.

What you're about to read is a detailed strategy describing exactly how I plan to do that. The first section (numbered) is the pre-launch preparation. The second half is the actual launch strategy.



**1- Sharp Presentation**

First and foremost I focused on presentation. If you look at the cover you'll see a pair of bright eyes staring back at you. 

[Link to the book](http://www.amazon.com/Hero-Born-Project-Chris-Fox-ebook/dp/B015P4Q8XS/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

This was very intentional. The part of our brains called the limbic system is always scanning for threats, and will automatically guide your attention to a pair of eyes if it feels someone staring at you.

This means that people's eyes will be drawn to the cover when scanning down a list of books. Once it lands there they'll see the prominent title, which includes the word Hero (more on that in the writing to market section).

Ideally, they'll click the link and read the blurb. I'd encourage you to take a look. It's short, punchy, and raises a ton of questions in the readers mind. If I've done my work right it will make people interested enough to download the book.



**2- Writing to Market**

Hero Born is absolutely written to market. It IS a story I wanted to tell, but as you'll read below I made changes to fit the genre.

In March of this year I cranked out a novel in just 13 days. That novel clocked in at 55,000 words, and was tentatively entitled Project Solaris. It was a spinoff of my Deathless series that I was billing as X-Files meets Heroes.

I was tempted to publish it right away, but realized that I wouldn't be able to write the sequel for 6-8 months. Having seen what happened when I waited that long to publish I knew that would be a mistake, so I stuck it on a shelf.

Fast forward to July. I learned that both Heroes and X-Files were returning to network television. What's more, I'd seen Todd Hodges Never Hero and Logan Rutherford's The Second Super take off like rockets.

I realized that super hero books were hot, and they were likely to get hotter. So I took a good look at Project Solaris. I realized that the title didn't convey anything to readers. So I changed it. Project Solaris became Hero Born. 

I also changed the plot. Not drastically, mind you. But enough to hit genre conventions. In the first draft the protagonist was a software engineer at a San Francisco startup. He was 28 years old. I dropped his age to 21 and made him an intern.

Super hero books are aimed largely at teens. By changing his age I hope to capture the same sci-fi market as before, but also add in the younger YA demographic. 

As you can see I made compromises, but not large ones. Writing to market means my book will sell many more copies, and I didn't have to change much to do it.



**3- Publishing Quickly**

This next bit has been done to death, but I have to mention it again. I released a book every six months in my first series, which was the kiss of death. By the time each new book came out the previously one had flatlined, and readers had forgotten about the series. If they weren't on my mailing list, then they had no idea the sequel was even available.

This time around I am publishing much more quickly. I will be putting out a book every two months for as long as the series is popular. The preorder for book 2, Hero Rising, is already up on Amazon so that readers can see how quickly it will be available.

This was possible for two reasons. First, I held back a book rather than publishing it right away. Second, I cleared my decks so I could focus solely on the new series for the first few releases.

This should keep me at the top of Amazon's algorithms for the foreseeable future, and will also keep me in the HNRs for the entire time. Everyone from Sara Reine to No Cat have advocated this, and I think they're right. It seems like a sound strategy and I plan to milk it for all it's worth.



**4- Amazon Exclusivity**

Many people know that I have a wonderful relationship with Apple. I love them. They're great about getting me into promos, and are awesome to work with. They've sold a lot of books on my behalf.

That said, Hero Born will be in KU for at least the first term. Why? Because I have no prayer of getting traction if I'm not in KU. We all know how big of a hit you take to rank when you go wide, and I want to maximize my chances of Hero Born taking off.

That said, it will go wide eventually. Probably after 1-2 terms in KU.



**5- Exit Strategy**

So what happens if my stellar plan fails, and this series fizzles? It's very possible that people won't love it, and if they don't how do I react? I terminate the series.

That doesn't mean leaving readers hanging. I have two alternate endings planned for the third book, Hero Dark. If the series takes off with books 1-2, then I'll use the open ended version, and will immediately begin work on book 4.

If, however, the series does meh, or god forbid crashes entirely, then I'll end it gracefully with book 3. Then I'll move from this trilogy into my next project. 



**The Launch Strategy**

Onto the part most people here will care about. What am I doing to launch the book? As people like Wayne have shown us the Amazon algorithms need to see a sustained spike in sales before they'll kick in. My strategy is designed to do exactly that.

**Exposure-** I messaged KDP and requested they add Hero Born to a third category. This puts the book in YA, Science Fiction, and Fantasy. This will give the book maximum exposure. Half of my keywords are designed to broaden subcategories.

The rest are set up for targeted searches for books like mine. After Amazon indexes the book following the initial sales spike it should be visible in a lot of places. This won't automatically make it take off, but it will ensure that the book is shown to a lot of people. 

If they like the blurb and cover as much as I think they will the book should immediately gain traction and start increasing in rank. *crosses fingers*

**Pricing-** Book one retails for $2.99, as my experiments have shown that's the most successful price in the science fiction genre for a first in series. It's high enough to get the $2 royalty, but low enough to impulse buy. 

**Timing-** It isn't accidental that I released the book a week before Christmas. If the tactics below give me the sustained spike I'm after the book will be on fire by the time people are opening up their new eReader and smartphone gadgets on Christmas morning. I want Hero Born to be the first book they see, and my launch should ramp up to that.


**Tactic #1-** I'll be emailing my list to let them know that the book is discounted to 99 cents for the first 24 hours. This makes the buy a no brainer, as it's both cheap and limited time offer. People are far more likely to buy when something is scarce, so this should have the largest number of sales.

My mailing list has gotten fairly large, hopefully large enough to generate a couple hundred sales. I've broken it into two segments. The first group is less engaged, which is why they get emailed first. This will start the sales, but it should be a slow build.

Twelve hours later I'll email the second, more engaged, segment of the list. This is where I'm hoping the bulk of the sales will come from. I'm timing the email to go out at 10pm on a Friday, so that as people wake up over the weekend sales will trickle in.

This will provide a more sustained spike, rather than a quick spike that Amazon will ignore.


**Tactic #2-** The second the mailing list blitz dies the Facebook ads begin. I'm running $15 a day for the first month, broken into $3 ads that I will tweak daily. Underperforming ads will be removed, while the best will receive more of the budget. If one or more does extremely well I can increase the daily spend to $25.

Note that I will lose money on this tactic. I will generate some sales and some KU borrows, but not enough to cover the cost of the ads. That's totally okay, because every sale makes it that much more likely I'll get picked up by the algorithms.

What's more, some of those people who sign up to the mailing list, and over time will purchase more books. I consider this a loss leader to help build momentum.


**Tactic #3-** At the same time I start the Facebook ads I'll be letting people know on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and a host of smaller forums I frequent. I've carefully selected a number of them, and have been an active member of each for a long time so people know who I am. Many are already excited about the book, and I'm hoping this will give another surge in sales.

There you have it. That's the entire launch strategy. I've kept it simple and trackable, so I can study what works and share it here. If I'm right the first book should do very well right out of the gate, but that's really just the beginning.

The series won't hit it's stride until the 2nd book launches, which is where phase two of the launch plan comes in. By this time the 1st book will be out on audio, which will add another layer of both sales and visibility.


**Launching the 2nd Book**

As mentioned above Hero Rising (book 2) is already listed for preorder. I am making an offer to my mailing list that if they review the first book I will allow them to ARC read the 2nd book. The goal is to get to 50 reviews as soon as humanly possible, which I don't think will take long.

The first promo will be a Kindle Countdown Deal, and I will launch it to coincide with the release of Hero Rising in mid February. I'll be dropping the price to 99 cents, and will be listing the book at any and every book advertising site on the web. If I can get a BookBub wonderful, but with or without I will wallpaper the internet with ads.

This should both revive what will likely be flagging sales on book one, and give book 2 a strong launch. These sales will trickle into book 3, which will already be listed for release on April 27th.



**Conclusions**

I'm really excited to see how this launch goes, because it's my first chance to test everything I've learned over the past year. I've watched people like Nick Webb, Wayne Stinnett, Amanda Lee, and many others catapult themselves to tremendous success.

I believe that any of us can do the same. We have all the tools we need at our disposal. All we have to do is learn from people who already have the success we're after.

If I'm right you'll see Hero Born take off, but if not expect to see me come back and talk about that too. No matter what happens I'm going to learn from this, and the least I can do is share the lessons with the friends I've made here =)

If you have either questions or suggestions I'd love to hear them. I am always learning, and you all help me do that!"

I have certain plans for the settlements but it's been a little harder implementing them. Here's how I've divided two of the settlements. Since I'm mostly using this save to get ideas I'm cheating to everything looking good.

**Sanctuary Hills**

* Sanctuary

* Red Rocket Truck Stop

* Abernathy Farm - Sends food to Sanctuary

* Sunshine Tidings Co-op - Sends food to Sanctuary 

Custom Combat Armor Mod - Gold with GDI logo

Basically I'm in the process of turning Sanctuary into a full-fledged city thanks to the Scrap scrap mod. I've plan to have a government office (built already), a city security department, and a technological division in the area where the PC's house used to be. The area around the large tree is going to be turned into a merchant's square with actual stores thanks to the store mats. The two sides of the street at the entrance will be turned into a large hotel and a few fancy looking houses for some of the more rich looking settlers. Very large WIP project. Getting some fps drops here probably due to the scrap scrap mod.

Red Rocket is the place where large shipments are stored until they are ready to be taken. There's a large warehouse in the back for storage with an elevated section with place for 3-4 power armor suits. A 4-man security team with their own building. Brahmin feeding station and 3 locked small apartments for wealthy merchants. Since smaller merchants would go trade in Sanctuary City this place is for merchants bringing in large shipments

Made Blake, Connie, and Lucy Abernathy essential and gave them dresses and suits since my head canon has them become a wealthy plantation family much like the brahmin barons in the NCR. Surrounded the entire farm with security fencing. Expanded the farm in the front and built a long house for workers to sleep at the end of the field. in the back of the house I removed the farm, set up a generator room, and build a pen in the back where I spawned Brahmin. Has one security guard at the entrance, one at the entrance, one on a platform mid fields, and turrets on elevated bridges in the corners.

Sunshine Tidings is basically the same thing as Abernarthy Farm but no leader as I imagine it being under the direct control of Sanctuary City. Security fencing, two guards, and a turret. Also has a bar in the second warehouse and a clinic in the cleanest cabin. Fun seeing everyone go into the bar after work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Castlelands**

* The Castle

* Warwick Homestead

* Jamaica Plain

* Murkwater Construction Site

* Spectacle Island

Custom Combat Armor Mod - Grayish Blue (can't remember name) with White Minutemen Logo

This region is very much unfinished so all the following are what it will be, not what it is except for Spectacle Island.

The Castle is the HQ of the Minutemen. Lots of guards in blue Minutemen armor patrolling. A large well stocked clinic in one of the larger rooms, a nice bar in another and the Generals Chambers with a locked door. The armory has both a weapons and armor seller along with T-45's with Minutemen colors. Beds are located in the hallways sections.

Warwick Homestead - Two guards in the front one standing outside the gate the other elevated inside of it. Just a pure farm run by the Warwicks who also become a large plantation family with deep connections with the Minutemen after Billy joins and becomes a top lieutenant. Don't know if I should kill the husband.

Jamaica Plain - Small bar town. Nothing much just the place where off-duty Minutemen travel to enjoy themselves.

Murkwater - Small outpost to serve as the first line of defense from the south and as quick mobile troops from any emergency coming from the Glowing Sea.

Spectacle Island - This is the one's that been giving me much trouble in the planning. I want to turn it into the Minutemen Academy. The idea is that my character build this place after the game in order to increase the size of the Minutemen and to reduce raiders/criminals by taking orphans, sending them to the island until they are 16, then making them interns in whatever division fits them best until they are 18 and full members. This is what I got so far:

* Main Office Building in the north where the boat is.
* Boys and Girl Dorms with teachers sleeping in rooms next to the entrance.
* Combat Class with shooting range in the back and small arena in the middle.
* Medical/Science Class taught by Curie in a Lab coat.
* Mechanical Class with some Atom Cats wannabe. Has crafting items and 2 power armor suits to use as examples.
* Agricultural Class where they learn about growing crops and dealing with brahmin.

If anything is missing please tell me.

Here's the rest of the areas with very simple notes

**The North**

* Outpost Zimonja - Northern Minutement Outpost similar to Mirelurk

* Tenpines Bluff - Farm

* Starlight Drive-In - Major Trading Town

* Covenant - Don't Know

* Taffington Boathouse - Don't Know.

* Greentop Nursery - Farm

**Central Station**

* Oberland Station - Central Minutemen Station. Mostly for emergencies if Diamond City and Vault 81 need help.

* Graygarden - Farm for Oberland

* Hangman’s Alley - Small well-equippedMinutemen Outpost for dealing with Raiders and Supermutants around the area.

* Egret Tours Marina - Another trading town

* Somerville Place - Farm for Egret

**Beachside**

* Nordhagen Beach - Minutemen allied Research Station. Place where the Institute tech was pilfered too. Imagine Virgil joining as a head researcher.

* Bunker Hill - Trading town

* Coastal Cottage - Small village

* County Crossing - Farm feeds Bunker Hill

* Croup Manor - Too ugly. don't know

* Finch Farm - Another plantation house. Feeds Nordhagen.

* Kingsport Lighthouse - Don't know 

* The Slog - 100% Ghould Farm feeds Bunker Hill or Nordhagen haven't decided."

But now, I just got a call from another internship that I applied for, for the Summer. He asked if I was still on the job market and free for the Summer internship, I said yes. He e-mailed me asking for a response before next week.

Overall for my term in college, I didn't do too horrible and finished with a 2.84 GPA. My hardest class was Physics 1 which I finished with a C- in and after that my next lowest grade was a B- in my Calc 1 class and my other classes were all A's. I enjoyed certain aspects of engineering, but over the course of the semester I've found that solely focusing my studies on just electrical over the next four years may not be the best fit for me. I know that during my career I want to be able to apply myself in multiple ways so I can eventually go into the business and management side of engineering, as I don't want to spend my entire working life doing a technical job. I know engineering is a lot of experience, and I was thinking that instead of solely focusing on one specific aspect, that I could benefit from studying both business and a field of engineering that's less time consuming to obtain a degree in during my undergraduate years.

My purpose for writing this posts is to get some advice on where to go from here. At the moment I'm considering changing to a double major with both computer science and general business, as coding has always been one of my interest and is an extremely important technical skill to have, while business is a background that can only benefit people in the job market. Since a lot of engineering has to do with experience, I know that by using my CS degree I can still get internships during the summers between my spring and fall terms, therefore adding to my technical experience, and that my business degree can only open up more possibilities for a career path that just solely focusing on one aspect of engineering.

This subreddit has been extremely helpful during my first semester and has given me tons of insight to what engineering really is, and I thought that going here for some of your guys' advice would be beneficial for me when making my decisions for my academic future. Thanks guys!"
3xrlzc,15,2015-12-21,[No Regrets] I want to contact her everyday but I know I shouldn't,TomatoArmada,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3xrlzc/no_regrets_i_want_to_contact_her_everyday_but_i/,"[No Regrets]

I realize I'm a shitty person.

But that's not why I feel bad.

A few months ago, I met a girl at an internship. I'll call her ""Jo"". Jo was showing me strong signs of interest, so I reciprocated.

To be honest, I was almost certain it would go nowhere.  I'm married.  She is 10 yrs younger, and had a boyfriend of a few yrs.  But I wanted to see how far it would go anyways.

Jo was physically attractive in all the ways I desired. She also had qualities I deeply admired which I found lacking in my spouse. For instance, Jo was driven and goal-oriented.  She had a sophisticated style, and a strong sense of family values.  Jo's stories about her severely dysfunctional family, as well as her differing socioeconomic and cultural background made her fascinating to talk to. 

Right off the bat, we found that we had much in common. We made it known to each other we were not entirely happy in our current relationships, and there were undertones of infidelity. After a month of intimate texting - often into the early morning hours - I aggressively propositioned her to meet me. Although we met alone under the context of friendship, almost everything was designed to feel like a real date. We only went out a handful of times, but they were the most exciting and fun outings I've had in years. We flattered each other with admiration and it felt so genuine.  

For the 8 months this relationship lasted, our interactions would be the highlights of my week. It was nice having something to look forward to all the time. I realize now, that it gave me a sense of validation which provided a real boost in my confidence. The confidence I gained was positively reflected in all other aspects of my life.

But I've dated women like her, and the experience isn't always pleasant. The quality of our interaction typically depended on her mood. The good times felt amazing, while the occasional bad/ugly moments often caught me by surprise. There was something very familiar about it all, that I found comforting and unsettling all at the same time. I even told Jo she reminded me of an ex-girlfriend, but she rejected the comparison. I should have known better.

There were a few times I attempted to be a more apparent and escalate. I indirectly hinted that perhaps there was something more than friendship between us.  Jo rebuffed me with a replies along the lines of ""I don't think of you in that way, if that's what you mean"". But then Jo would continue to flirt and hint there was something more.

Six months into the relationship, and almost everything I suspected of Jo's character came to light. Sometimes she would be open, humble, and very sweet. At other times, she would be arrogant, unreasonable, and dismissive, and even mention other men, besides her boyfriend. I brushed it off and ascribed it to her immaturity.  Perhaps she brought up other men to demonstrate her value?  As the relationship progressed, she would periodically lash out, and this occurred with increasing frequency.

Then it dawned on me one day - Jo had all the characteristics of a narcissist. Having had a few narcissistic women in my life, it made sense why this experience felt so eerily familiar. I recognize that I also have narcissistic tendencies of my own, which I saw in her.

I caught her in a blatant lie, and decided this needed to end. I reasoned that this girl I was so initially infatuated with, never truly existed as I had imagined.

...........................

I'm pretty sure my wife hasn't discovered the full extent of my relationship with Jo, and I never want her to. My wife isn't perfect, but she deserves better. She is mostly supportive and selfless. She often puts my happiness above her own, and I had never been with a woman like that before. That's why I married her.

The problem is I'm just so fucking bored. I feel restless. This tryst with Jo has really highlighted this hole I am trying to fill.

I don't completely understand it. I've made an effort to lead a fulfilling life. I volunteer. I live in a nice area. I have hobbies. I work out. I'm even going back to school because I was unhappy with my career. I go out with my wife and I'm social with her friends and family.

I have my own male friends too, though we are not close. I keep them at a distance because they either don't hold my interest in the same way, or they are assholes.

It's been a month since I've had any real interaction with Jo, and I find myself wanting to contact her everyday. I know it's not because I actually like her, but it's because I crave that validation. I want to feel that excitement and supreme confidence I experienced when we were still speaking and she was enamored with me.

The worst part of it all is that I don't feel as guilty as I ought to about the whole affair. Nothing physical happened between me and Jo, but in retrospect, the experience felt like an exciting roller coaster ride I didn't want to end.  If I were to be completely honest with myself, I would probably consider doing it again.

The rational part of me knows I'm getting to old for this shit. I understand that logically, these pursuits are toxic and fruitless. My need for female validation outside of my marriage is a symptom of a deeper problem. I don't want to be this kind of person.

So I ask of all the redditors patient enough to read through this:

What is it you've done that has made you content and at peace with your life?

............................

TL;DR Was intimately talking to a girl for a few months, and even going on ""friend dates"". I am married. Decided to end it when I discovered she probably has NPD. I feel empty.  How do I not feel empty w/o pursuing female attention?"

Not sure what I should pursue.,Enhancemon,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3xrqtz/looking_to_possibly_find_a_job_outside_of_my/,"My current internship is unpaid but it's at a good company. However the problem is they want me to learn how to do something mainly because I live close by. I want to do it but it's really complicated and could take a long time to learn. I don't know if I really have that kind of time with bills and all.

What I enjoy doing is video editing but it seems assistant video editors have to have almost 5-10 years experience in the industry to be assistant editors. The one that was recently hired is 34 years old.

I am currently 26 but still have a lot of bills to pay plus aging parents that have increasing medical costs because of their age.
I have a degree in film in video and have studied Film producing which involves pre-production, budgeting, and the like in terms of school projects. 

I have had two internships where I did both physical production with cameras and post production with different types of video editing software.

I really like computers and really enjoyed doing video editing.

But because the whole ""Do what you love"" thing doesn't pay the bills anymore I need to find something that I can do with the skills I have.

I know I don't want to do sales, I am bad at it, I have anxiety about it and I spend more time trying to help someone than sell them something for commission. 

I'd like to do something maybe administrative or computer related but I just don't know what I can do with my current skill set where someone will actually pay me.

I live in Chicago is that makes any difference for this post. 

TL;DR Experienced in video production/post production looking for a way use my skills for a more desirable job without going back to school. I live in Chicago"
3xrtfq,39,2015-12-21,Don't hold onto the past,justleaveDB,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3xrtfq/dont_hold_onto_the_past/,"I saw this subreddit linked on another thread a while back. Every so often I come here just to read and quietly cheer you all on. I've never commented before because my advice would always be the same: leave. But I figured I could share my story just in case it can help anyone out.

A long time ago, I (22 at the time) started dating a girl (20) who I met at a really fun internship. We hit it off right away and were inseparable. I thought we were a great couple all around. And I especially thought our sex life was great. Our internship ended, and she moved back to her college town. I was still figuring out my next move in life, so I moved there with her.

When we got there, things started to head downhill in the sex department. It started to dwindle, and I got a lot of excuses. She was too tired, too stressed, worried her roommates would hear, worried my neighbors would hear, only liked having sex in the shower (but still turned me down in there too), etc. But I kept trying to make it work. We were a good team otherwise, so we should be able to work through this issue, right?

The DB started to really affect me. I remember thinking we were going to have sex one time, and I start going down on her to get her in the mood, but she picks a fight about something unrelated as I stare up at her from in between her legs. There were tons of situations like that, and I started to get scared to initiate. I couldn't handle more rejection from her. I put my all into the relationship, and it felt so horrible that she seemingly didn't care about making me happy.

Other physical romance began to wane too. We didn't cuddle anymore, she barely ever kissed me, and forget holding hands when walking together. So I doubled my efforts. We tried scheduling intimacy, staying more at my place (I lived alone), going on more romantic dates, massages, and all sorts of other things. Nothing worked. I might get some pity sex once a month, but that was about it.

Finally, after a little over a year of dating, I came over to her place one night. We were watching TV, and I was trying to be affectionate because we had been apart for a week or so. At one point I hinted about having sex, and she gave me an awful look, as if to imply that she could not think of anything more disgusting. So I started the conversation again, trying to figure out how we could fix this. But this time it ended with her suggesting we take a break. I think breaks are stupid, you're either in or out, but I also don't like giving up on things, so I was willing to try anything. At that point I still thought we had a relationship worth fighting for. 

We took a break for a month, set conditions that we couldn't be involved with other people. I tried to concentrate on myself, figuring out how to be better for her. She ended up making out with some guy she had previously said was 'gross' and 'douche-y' about 3 weeks into the break. She was planning on visiting him across the country where he was staying for a couple months. I went over to her place to beg her not to go, saying that our relationship could not be saved if she went. But she did anyway, telling me ""you need to let me do this even if it is a big mistake, and I will face the consequences."" And that was it. We were done. I went no contact and fully concentrated on myself.

It took about a month before I started to feel like I was moving past her. It would have taken longer, but going no contact helped me see how this relationship had really hurt me. 

I realize that our relationship wasn't that long, but that doesn't mean I wasn't really affected by it in the end. The constant rejection left me with a lot of insecurity that I didn't deserve. I was and am a great partner, but I hadn't felt like one in a long time. I had started to even hate some of my favorite TV shows because they would have jokes about sex, and I would feel jealous that these fictional characters were having sex, so I couldn't possibly laugh. My friends told stories of hook-ups, or things they liked, and I sat quietly and smiled while dying on the inside. I would even get grumpy and lash out to people that didn't deserve it, quickly apologizing as I realized that I was angry for other reasons.

But the most important thing I realized is that I had been holding onto what I thought our relationship could be. When we were at our internship, she was funny, sexy, and caring. I assumed we could get back to that if we just tried hard enough. I was wrong; that would never happen again. I started to see the relationship for what it had become, a shell of what it once was. There was absolutely nothing worth saving. I realized that even outside of the bedroom she wasn't that same great partner as when we started dating. She was selfish, demanding, and always on edge. Even the picture of her I had in my head was her with a scowl.

Three months after the breakup she contacted me because she wanted to meet up. She had written me a letter, apologizing for breaking up and saying that she couldn't imagine her life without me in it. It was so easy to turn her down. A small part of me wanted to yell and scream at her, things like ""so you wouldn't have sex with me, but you would fly across the country to fuck some guy you barely like""; ""if I take you back now, will anything even change""; ""I gave you thousands of chances, and you fucked them all up, I don't owe you anything anymore."" But I didn't. I just stayed matter-of-fact and very cordial, telling her I appreciate the letter, but I had moved on. She resorted to other desperate tactics, like sobbing in front of me and telling me that she was the best girl I could ever find. But it didn't matter, I was done a while ago.

Shortly after that I started dating my now wife. We have been together 6 years total, and it has been a dream. Me and her are an incredible team, always looking out for each other. We are physically affectionate all the time outside of the bedroom, and our communication is almost perfect. 

And in the bedroom, we are both very satisfied. Initially she had to help me get over my fear of initiating, because I still had a sense of dread that I would be rejected. But we worked through that easily. Just last night, while cuddling after an intense session, she turned to me and said, ""I know that we don't do anything too crazy in the bedroom, but it's funny because I don't feel like we even need to. I'm obviously willing to try things that you want to, but I feel so satisfied all the time already.""

So this story ended up being really long. But ultimately, I guess I'm saying to let go of the past. Your relationship is what it is now. And the only way it can possibly get back to what it was before is if BOTH partners are willing to work at it. But, let's be honest here, even that often won't work. Your relationship might have been great at the start, but plenty of relationships sour over time. And we hold onto them for tons of different reasons. In my case it was because I didn't want to give up and I actually thought I could get that girl I met on my internship back. But she was gone for good, and maybe never really existed to begin with.

And if you are too afraid to let go for whatever reason, I implore you to think about what you are more afraid of. Is it losing your current 'partner' or never finding the person that will make you truly happy?"
3xs6dd,13,2015-12-21,"I'm going to confront my mom about her abusive boyfriend on Thursday. If she doesn't listen to me, then I will stop talking to her until she breaks up with him.",oakboar,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3xs6dd/im_going_to_confront_my_mom_about_her_abusive/,"June was the last time I saw my mom. 

Sometimes, a weird and frightening feeling swells up in my chest when I say goodbye to someone who I know I won't see for a long time. I wonder briefly as I turn my head to see one last look at them through streaked windows if that's the last look I'll ever have of them. 

The last time I saw my mom was on a warm, muggy June afternoon. She was dropping me off at the airport so I could complete the rest of my internship. I had plans to see her for Thanksgiving. The holiday would mark the end of my internship and my return home for good. We had already started planning the menu and making the guest list and working through the logistics of getting *that many* people into my mom's tiny dining room. 

Life, for the first time in years, seemed to be on the up. Four years ago this month, I was sexually assaulted by my stepdad, my mom's partner for over ten years. It took over eighteen months of fighting with my mom for her to kick my stepdad out of her home and for us to have a normal relationship. My mom started dating again less than a year ago, and I felt happy that my mom was putting herself out there. 

In August, I didn't have any definitive plans for after my internship ended. I had a job offer, but it was going to be a while before it started. I asked my mom if I could live with her. She didn't hesitate to say no. It flew out of her mouth like it was the most ridiculous thing I could have asked. In June, just two months previous, my mom wrapped her arms around me and hugged me tight enough for me to believe she never wanted me to go. My room was pretty much as I had left it when I left for college except for the bed. My mom had purchased a new bed. I slept on a pile of mattresses and bunkie boards, which was fine for me. But last year, my mom had several surgeries and my grandma moved in with her for about three months to nurse her back to health. Since my grandma can't drive, I was at my mom's house a lot to help run errands and take my mom to appointments. 

I digress. In July, my mom's new boyfriend moved in with her. She claimed to be very happy. I was so happy for her. My stepdad had been such an ass. She deserved to be happy. 

The first indication that something was wrong was when she told me I couldn't move back in with her. She told me that she had rented my room out to her new boyfriend, Tom. 

I got angry with my mom when she said told me I couldn't live with her. I don't really remember what I said, but it wasn't nice. The next night I called her, expecting her to apologize to me. She didn't. Instead, she said the following: ""Sweetie, I was going to wait until you got home to say this, but a therapist of mine told me I should be afraid of you.""

According to my mom, she believes that I try to control the aspects of her life that I don't like. She thinks the only reason I ""let"" my stepdad sexually assault me was because I was trying to break up their relationship. I don't think I need to say that I didn't ask to be sexually assaulted. But my mom thinks I did. My mom thinks I tried to have sex with her husband. It makes me sick just thinking about it. It makes me want to scream and punch a wall, reliving the assault over and over again just to prove to myself that I didn't do anything wrong. 

I never made it to my mom's for Thanksgiving. I got a job at the last minute 500 miles away from home right after my internship ended. My sister made it to Thanksgiving, though. She called me three days into her vacation, crying her eyes out, sobbing in deep gulps. She witnessed first hand the emotionally manipulative behaviors Tom was inflicting on my mom. Tom accused my sister of being disrespectful because she didn't immediately drop what she was doing when they asked her to come and watch a TV show with them. My sister was making a bed. It took her less than ten minutes from when she was asked to join them and when she actually did. Tom was so offended that he yelled at my mom, called her a bad mother, and left the house. He was gone for four days. He told my mom that he was sleeping in a Walmart parking lot because he couldn't stand to be in the same house with my disrespectful sister. My sister left early. My mom was more than happy. My sister lives out of state, about 2,000 miles away. My mom and sister see each other about twice a year. Usually, my mom wraps her arms around my sister when she leaves, envelops her with this hug that makes you think that my mom never wants my sister to leave. Instead, my mom smiled as my sister left, not as much as a wave goodbye. 

My mom has stopped talking to my grandma. They used to talk every day. And now, my mom is saying that my brother, who is gay, isn't really gay, that he is merely gender confused. My brother has been out for almost two years now. He has a boyfriend. My mom has met my brother's boyfriend. 

Last week, I made a decision: I paid a private investigator to run a background check on Tom. What came back wasn't surprising. Tom has 18 convictions. Most of them are for physical assault, domestic violence. 

When I am in the area for Christmas later this week, I'm going to sit down with my mom and tell her what I found. I don't know how it's going to go. My mom isn't my mom. I'm scared. I just want my mom back.

These offers are so similar and great in so many ways, and there's a lot of material already online and this subreddit about the differences between the two. I'm absolutely sure I would be happy and grow at both. 

One of the major ""pros"" for Google is the expectation of what it might do for my resume and the types of doors it would open up afterwards. I'm sure this is true to some extent, but this effect any greater than what might happen if I took the Microsoft offer? Am I mistaken to take this into account for my upcoming decision?

**tl;dr: does google look better than microsoft on a resume?**

**Update:** I chose the Microsoft offer :)"

When i did a google search on the 20th of December 2015, or 2015-12-15 for Mirte Dufour
I found a youtube channel;
a vimeo channel;
a MySpace page;
a Blogger profile;
and a Google+ page;

The youtube channel was Meren2109 with the name Mirte Dufour.
The about page contained a link the the Google+ profile for Mirte Dufour.
The channel had 3 sunscribers with 2,964.
The Related Channels side bar contained one channel, WhisperCrystal.
It contained 5 videos all from over 3 years ago. 
they were:
""Kamuflasjefylla Vs Kil'jaeden"" posted on April 20, 2009.
""Youtube Test"" posted on August 2, 2009.
""Insane in the Membrane"" posted on August 2, 2009.
""A Final Dream"" posted on January 24, 2012.
""Walk Me Home"" posted on March 24, 2012.
""[ARCHLORD] Invisible Mount"" posted on December 2, 2012.
None of the videos contained any talking, only music.
Some of the videos referenced Mandy Moore.
The video ""A Final Dream"" has a picture of a drawn women on a pink background. At the beginning the word Mirte is flashed on the screen.

The vimeo channel contained 106 videos, the most recent being from 3 months ago. 
My impression is that they will all be videos of music, because the few i saw appeared to be music videos, but not of the same artists.

The MySpace page consisted of a picture of a woman in full body profile leaning against a wall in black and white.The location was listed as Antwerpen, Vlaams Gewest, Belgium. It was connected to 10 other profiles:
Christian Johannesen
Rasmus Nielsen
KayDee
Lalouline Editions
NUDEX [Buy ""Hot Shot"" on iTunes]
GREGO
Em prod
Joni Sheila
Xaman-Ek
SMTO

The Blogger profile was started on March 2009, with 391 profile views. 'My Blogs' had the words ""Warcraft Gold"" witch was linked to the blog goldlimit.blogspot.com

The Google+ profile was the same as the one linked by the youtube channel. It had no posts.
It had 4 followers, and 1,947 views.
The about page said that her Gender was Female
The page said that there were 4 people in her circles, but it only showed three:
Miguel Herrera Ögren
Erika Prezioso
Mirte Dufour
There was a link to the youtube channel Meren2109.

The blog goldlimit.blogspot had the header ""WARCRAFT GOLD"" with only a single post from March 8, 2009.
The date was written in dutch, as well as the footer of the page, and the sidebar, and links. The actual post was in english. It was titled ""What is this Warcraft Formula? Does it Work?""
There were two links to the Blogger Profile.

	What is this Warcraft Formula? Does it Work?

	I heard something about a new product the other day from a few friends of mine that spent a lot of time sorting through all the new guide content out there. They had stumbled across what they said was a monthly eBook membership site – I didn’t believe them at first because I couldn’t see how a website could produce an eBook every month. There just isn’t that much to talk about in World of Warcraft. But, I stopped by the site to check it out and make sure it wasn’t a scam. Too many times, these big promising sites will say more than they can deliver. Here’s what I found out.

	First of all, the pedigree here is pretty solid. The authors of the guides on Warcraft Formula are Brad Johnson (of Warcraft Millionaire fame) and T Dub Sanders (of PvP Bible and WotLK Secrets fame). The two are a great pair, bringing in gold making and PvP – the two most popular sources of information and guides for the game – and they pretty much have all the resources you could need to be effective in the game.

	The premise of the site is pretty simple. You pay an upfront fee to get their Fast Track Action Plan – a guide that shows you how to put a solid account together. The guide is actually a lot more useful than it sounds at first look – it shows you how to pick a character but it also shows you which mods to get, how to join a guide, where to level and farm gold, and how to start in PvP and raiding. It’s a solid walkthrough of all the basics of the game for a beginner or a casual veteran.

	After this, you get the actual product, a monthly newsletter that comes complete with details on PvP in the current month, new changes to the game, questions from readers and just about any kind of info on the game you can imagine from class changes to whatever else might come up. There are a ton of different topics already covered in the first four issues (with PvP covered in every issue).

	In the end, you get a solid starter guide and brand new, time sensitive content each month from two of the best guide writers in WoW for a pretty low monthly price. It’s hard to believe, but this is a great deal and even better than my friends told me about. I’ll be subscribing to my own monthly membership, just to see where Brad and T Dub take it.

When I looked up ""what happened to WhisperCrystal"" on 2015-12-21, one post sticks out.
It is from the huffington post, and is titled ""Carlisle Brigham Dead: 29-Year-Old Woman Found Fatally Injured In The Lower East Side (UPDATE)"" 
It is between ""WhisperCrystal - YouTube"" and ASMR Interviews: Cutebunny992 - ASMRYouReady""
The article doesn't contain the word ""Whisper"", ""Crystal"", or ""Youtube""
It was written on 2012-8-27, and updated on 2012-8-29. This was a Monday.
It says she died ""on Monday"" which either means 2012-8-20, or 2012-8-27.
It says the woman who died, Carlise Brigham, lived in New York, on the Lower East Side.
There are five links in the article.
Here is the entire article:

	A 29-year-old woman was found bleeding heavily from a slash wound to the neck in the Lower East Side on Monday.

	The Daily News reports Carlisle Brigham was found on the first-floor stairwell of an Orchard Street apartment[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-dies-found-east-side-tenement-apparent-slash-wound-throat-article-1.1145534], where a neighbor said she ""had blood on her face.""

	The woman was taken to Beth Israel Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

	Brigham was reportedly living in the apartment building with a roommate while estranged from her husband Anthony Champalimaud[http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/08/27/woman-found-dead-inside-lower-east-side-apartment/], the son of a prominent Portuguese family.

	The couple were married in 2011. According to their New York Times wedding announcement[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/fashion/weddings/carlisle-brigham-anthony-champalimaud-weddings.html?_r=1], Brigham worked previously as an intern for the American Museum of Natural History in New York. She is the daughter of James Brigham Jr., who worked as the city's budget director.

	Police are questioning Champalimaud, but sources say it appears as Brigham may have fallen off the stairs[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Found-Slashed-in-the-Neck-on-the-LES-167563265.html]. No weapon or blood trail were found either.

	UPDATE: Brigham's death has been ruled an accident[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/beauty_in_death_fall_OXnjBsAvp5HuRLORGm8ZtM]. A representative for the medical examiner said Brigham fell down the stairs and suffered blunt-impact wounds to her head and neck after falling down the stairs.

	Aside from the obvious this isn't an accident, why did this article pop up when I googled Whispercrystal? I hope that she isn't dead, but this link raises questions as Whispercrystal was also a blonde woman.

	 So when WhisperCrystal stopped uploading it was April 22nd. When that lady Carlisle Brigham died it was August 27th. If WhisperCrystal was Carlisle Brigham, there was a 4 month period of no videos until she passed away, which 4 months of no uploading would be a weird occasion for her. So that means she is probably alive, and she recently deleted her Facebook. She had a husband and supposedly he didn't liked he making these videos and WhisperCrystal was being stalked, and weirdos were trying to find her. So there's a big possibility she's alive, she just decided to stop uploading because of her husband and the weirdos.﻿
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

WhisperCrystals last video post was on April 22, 2012, or 2012-04-22.
The Huffington Post article was on 2012-08-27.
It appears that WhisperCrystal uploaded a video at least every month, but I have not gone through all the videos to confirm this.

On every video WhisperCrystal has a link to a Facebook page.
This is the link http://on.fb.me/fTprqz
This page is currently down, and has been down for an unknown amount of time.
It has been down for at least 4 months according to a comment on the video ""#10 - *Whisper* A Relaxation Journey Through the Senses""

The people are very friendly and welcoming too :) I haven't been to many places in US yet. Just mostly Chicago and Midwest. I hope to visit more places in the coming year ie Florida, New York, Vegas ;D It's a beautiful country and has a lot of great places to visit :) Thanks again for your comment! :) x﻿

I would love to see more of Scotland too, I have been told to visit Shetland which I am looking into :) Thanks again for the comment! :) x﻿

	 @444CURTIS Yes, I can't believe only 2 weeks to go now! Unfortunately I have the bad habit of not packing until the last day.... So not really looking forward to that bit lol. But the rest should be okay hopefully. I actually do enjoy the whole ""travelling"" experience as well, and looking forward to watching some new releases on the plane...lol. Watching the clouds is quite fun too :) Never gone skiing but would love to :) I do enjoy ice-skating though and can't wait to do that this year :) x﻿
 
	WhisperCrystal 5 years ago  in reply to 444CURTIS
	 @444CURTIS I will be moving to the mid-west :) Apparently it is going to get pretty cold with lots of snowfall :) I guess I like the idea because I never really lived in a very cold country. If it snows, this will be my first proper white Christmas, just like it should be. I am really looking forward to getting my Christmas tree when I come there in about 2 weeks time now :) Canada always sounded appealing because of the beautiful nature and cool weather :) I can't wait to visit over there! :D x﻿
 
	WhisperCrystal 5 years ago  in reply to 444CURTIS
	 @444CURTIS I know what you mean. Even if I find the most amazing place in the world I don't think I can just settle there forever. I just have to travel and see more of this beautiful world. I must say we share the same feeling about visiting hot places. I have lived in places that went over 122 degrees (50 C degree), but I can never get use to that and always preferred cooler places. Having said that I never experienced real freezing cold. So we shall see how it goes this winter in the US :) x﻿

	 @444CURTIS lol... Well, I haven't been to China ;D I would love to go there someday. Oh and Nepal.. So far east is a-calling me :D I haven't been to South America either. I would love to see Machu Picchu and Lost City of the Incas :) Tikal and Mayan pyramids.. Easter Island would be pretty awesome :) I want to go to Greece and see the Acropolis in Athens and Temple of Olympian Zeus :D Btw, you seem like you live in a beautiful place already.

I would love to see Canada too, I hear all about it's nature, beautiful cities and how it's one of the most pleasant and peaceful places to live in :) I want to see some of your big cities, and really would love to go to Niagara Falls :D I have been to Egypt when I was younger, it was magnificent!! But I would love to go back.. The pyramids were breathtaking!!! :) x﻿

	 @444CURTIS That's not even half the places I have lived in... lol. Initially we moved a lot because of my father's job.. But eventually I got the travelling bug, and just can't stop from travelling to all these beautiful countries and finding out more about their history, people and culture etc... :) The reason for moving to the US is mainly my husband who is American. We just bought a house over there, so looks like will be settling down ""for now"" lol. Hoping to move next year spring time :) x﻿
 
	WhisperCrystal 5 years ago  in reply to MyWhisperBlossom
	 @MyWhisperBlossom What?!? WOW! That is one of the most amazing origins I have ever heard!! Awesome! You have the blood of Braveheart! :D You should be SO proud.. That really is incredable :) My husband apparently has bloodlines from Scotland from a Knight who was a lord of a town over there. But don't know much more than that... And as for mine, I come from such a mixed background as my family moved a lot over the years, so I don't think I can ever track down my whole family tree. Shame :) x﻿
 
	WhisperCrystal 5 years ago  in reply to 444CURTIS
	 @444CURTIS lol Yes! As I said, there will be more soon.. I just can't see myself not visiting these beautiful places rich with glorious history :) I am very glad you enjoyed it :) I have a mixed background to say the least lol. I have mainly Turkish origins, and some Greek, Italian and Norwegian.. Most of my relatives are still in Turkey, and I lived there too and speak the language fluently.. but I lived in the UK the longest.. Soon will be moving to the US.. I guess I am a world child lol :) x﻿

Next time I am heading up North, I will definately make plans to visit this exquisitely beautiful place :) x﻿

	In this video, I will be particularly talking about my sister's passion for first person shooter games, and how I fit into that ;) I will be mentioning that I am working on a website for her Call of Duty clan in preparation and just in time for the upcoming game Black Ops! ;D

	Hope you enjoy :) x

	 IT'S NOT HER. That's a scammer. Check in the videos where that girl talks fluent dutch while crystal is turkish. Also there is no one with Dufour surname in their friends. No brother and sister? ;) Nickname she use from years for her private things? She didn't even add people on her Steam. Public profile, you think Crystal would do that? 
	She was really reserved. It's not her.
	Also, check the birthday. 21 sept 89, crystal is born 14 dec and she said to be in her early 30's years ago.

	 He has a streaming channel on twitch, /annaisha . He alt-tabbed the game and there were FB and Skype opened. This alone should make you think it can't be WhisperCrystal. Since he was streaming WoW, I reverse searched all the nicknames and found that forum post, in which he posted the same song and was asking for money (gofundme). The gofundme was the same as the one which was in the fake whispercrystal channel here on youtube, then he removed it.﻿

	 She appears to be Carlisle Brigham, who died 3 years ago from a fatal accident. I have found articles of the incident that contain pictures of her when she was still alive. Please the note the striking similarity of her YouTube profile pic with pictures of her found in such articles. Also note that she was married to a man with Portuguese heritage who traveled to Europe for work, and she lived in New York (explains shift in/out of developed accent from being married to a foreigner(?) ). She seemed very outgoing with her love for yachting, being with friends and social drinking, and even worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York (explains her vast video topics, knowledge, creativity, and stunning choice of video images). These are just theories, but a good theories nonetheless. Take a look at the articles below to read in detail. Hopefully, someday, we will all get closure on what happened to WhisperCrystal who shared her healing voice to us all.

	 +kungfumatts Thanks for the info. But are you sure this is WC? There seems to be a difference between her profile pic and the pictures in the articles. The eyes look different somehow. I always thought WC's eyes were blue, but I something still seems different to me...﻿

	kungfumatts 5 months ago
	 I agree with you, WhisperOcean. One cannot say if this is really her due to that fact that we did not even see one single photo of her on YouTube except her profile picture, which appears to be some caricature, in my opinion. But since the profile pic does centre around her eyes, I compared that to the new article photos taking into consideration that she might have worn makeup too. When you add that to her time of disappearance and time of the death in the article, there is a connection. Then I cross-referenced her video themes, personal style, and such to the background info stated in the articles. There's too much to ignore. So, I stand by my findings. I'm glad that my post has caught your attention, because I am a fan of WhisperCrystal. I hope this helped her name and your ASMR community.﻿

	 +kungfumatts I have to respond to end these claims. From the date she first uploaded, she lived in England but has traveled and stayed around the eastern hemisphere for most of her life. United Arab Emirates, India, Egypt, Turkey and more. Her father was not hinted to be a budget director, describing her dad as 'Bruce Willis in Armageddon' who was resourced and relocated to different countries which came about her unique, challenging upbringing. However she did meet an American man, got married and bought a house in the USA whilst working and living in the United Kingdom. There is no evidence to suggest she had citizenship in America but she did travel to and from the United Kingdom when she could. I firmly believe she is a computer programmer and spoken of being married a year before Carlisle Brigham ever made her way down the aisle. 

	Source I have MP3's of her early Youtube uploads﻿

She then got engaged to a guy and was moving to be closer to him and shortly after she stopped posting altogether and the videos with her face were all removed. A fee videos were just changed to have a picture kinda like her usual format. 

	She had brown hair that was 3 or 4 inches longer than shoulder length. Light complexion but not pale white... and she had a roundish face but she wasn't fat.﻿

I am an American teenager currently in high school (I'm a junior, and 16 years old). This summer I will be going to Toronto, staying with my dad's friend. I'm looking for some sort of summer program to do while I'm there. I was looking into programs at the University of Toronto but I unfortunately waited too long to apply. If anyone has any ideas or knows of any good high school summer programs (Internships, etc.) let me know! Thank You!

(...in this case my mono-ex &amp; her bf),new_old_bf,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/3xt41e/resources_about_being_the_new_guy_in_a/,"I'm looking for information/advice I suspect already exists, just not sure what to google and the FAQ didn't get this specific that I noticed.

I'm looking for resources for people in my situation at any level of specificity, so I'll state generally and get more specific:

1. Advice / things to think about when (potentially) becoming involved with one partner of an existing couple?
2. As above, but specifically as a new (hetero) male becoming involved with existing hetero couple
3. Either above specific to it being my first polyamorous relationship
4. As above, specific to it being their first poly relationship (not sure that's strictly true, but I could be first beyond some open-dating)
5. Specific to the fact that I was (briefly) involved with the female partner before she started dating the male partner (doesn't seem like gender matters much here, but specificity doesn't hurt)

Anything come to mind?

To address an imagined elephant: I admit this sounds like maybe good potential for drama, but girl and I dated a few years ago and have been pretty good friends the whole time since. We ""split up for a while"" rather than go long distance during a cross-country internship and she and boyfriend got together before I got back. I don't know her bf super well, but we've always gotten along in our limited interactions &amp; I've always been happy they are happy, if admitidely a little envious/sad for having gotten ""dumped"" with the timing of how things played out.

Anyway, they apparently are entertaining some type of non-monogamy to the tune of polyfidelity after discussing it for a longish time, and she reached out to me expressing interest in rekindling our old flame, an interest I share. I believe that I am sincerely interested in exploring this with her, and ALSO sincerely desire to not cause more than inevitable natural strain in their existing relationship. 

There are several other poly relationships in our social circle so while I think people may be a bit skeptical of the particulars of the history here, they shouldn't be too unsupportive I hope.

Anyway, I am cautiously excited about maybe embarking on this relationship with her and them, but I'm an overthinker and a believer in not making every mistake for your self, so I figured asking for advice probably wouldn't hurt?"

I think I should have an adequate amount of experience / skill / drive but the results don't seem to agree. I've reserved applying for the 'big tech companies' (Google / Microsoft / Facebook / Amazon) because I'm not sure if my resume will be enough to land an internship or new grad position. I've already received rejection emails from Piazza and Twitter, not even having landed the interview. Please give me honest opinions, thanks!

Here's my resume: http://docdro.id/eoj4CzA"
3xteqj,13,2015-12-22,All I want for Christmas is for someone to hire my boyfriend full time.,frustratedandbroke,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3xteqj/all_i_want_for_christmas_is_for_someone_to_hire/,"My boyfriend is a wonderful guy - he's kind, caring and I've known him as one of the happiest people in my life for the past six years.

We went to colleges close together, we had awesome groups of friends and in general, we really had a great time. Then graduation happened and it's like our worlds fell apart. Why? Because my boyfriend majored in English and Education.

If anyone is familiar with NYS teaching certification, then you understand the whole process of this stupid EDTPA project. You spend a whole semester putting together a portfolio of all your work and everything you've done for your class, etc. etc. It's a great idea - except when you fail it. And when you're as unlucky as my boyfriend, you fail it by one point.

If you're also familiar with NYS certification, then you know that you have to take quite a handful of other exams. Each costing over $100. Failing the EDTPA (at least this year, future graduates have to redo the whole thing) requires you to take more exams and pay more money. So whatever. This is all fine and dandy unless you're working a minimum wage job, that only allows you twelve days off a year so you can't just go and take all the exams at once (especially because you can't afford to). 

So unfortunately, it seems like no one will hire him or take him seriously because he doesn't have this certification finished. He only has two exams left to take but he can't afford them right now, and we're hoping he can get them over and done with in January (and that he passes them).

In hindsight, I don't think we thought it would be this difficult and convoluted. If we had known he wouldn't even be able to get a sub position or work for a charter school without a certification, then maybe we would have looked into office work or something else to put on his resume. Internships, or secretary positions, receptionists, etc. But nobody will hire him. Why? Because his entire resume is just teaching experience.

We've applied to so many things, I've lost count. So many nights spent coming up with new job titles to search for. Publisher, editor, junior producer, associate editor, ghostwriter, associate secretary, tutor, nanny, babysitter... it's come down to picking at scraps. And it's so heartbreaking. There's no hope left in those cover letters and emails he's sending. We haven't heard back from anything in months and the last was from a charter school that said they were highly interested &amp; willing to work with someone who was working towards certification. Talk about getting your hopes up.

All I want is to see him light up again. I just hate watching him turn off and get depressed when people talk about Christmas bonuses, or the vacations they're about to take... meanwhile he's being compared to his cousins that both have full time jobs, live in their own apartments in Manhattan and we're all the same age. 

Friends &amp; family have tried to help, we've posted on facebook groups, reached out to former professors; this search is really getting desperate. I don't know how much more he can take. He really isn't himself anymore and it's all come down to money.

Because he has to pay for his exams.

Because he pays his parents rent for his basement.

Because he has to pay for the car he has to drive to his minimum wage job since we live in the suburbs with no local transportation.

Because the deferral on his student loans just expired yesterday.

I wish I could at least pay for us to take a nice vacation and break from all this cruelty but I myself am stuck in an accelerated graduate program until May. So the only money I've been able to make is from babysitting and odd side jobs.

Yesterday he told me ""I wish I didn't go for my dreams. I wish I could have just done something corporate and lived a mediocre life"". 

This is so damn frustrating. At this point, it often feels like I might get hired before he does (my career choice isn't exactly as selective). 

I guess we're all just sitting around waiting for our lives to start.

So santa if you're out there, please align whatever stars you need to get my boyfriend a real job. Thanks.

**tldr** My boyfriend majored in English and Education. There is no luck for any sort of job on the horizon until he finishes his certification - which he can't do yet because he can't afford to pay for the exams with his minimum wage job. Stuck in a circle of despair and constantly waiting for our post-grad lives to start.

I picked Computer Science because I thought i liked coding back in high school when i was doing a year 12 software course, but as time has gone by I have realized that Ive been struggling with coding and I lack the motivation to even try to become a decent coder. I am nearly graduating and I can barely write a whole program without tremendous help and therefore I dont think i would see myself in the future doing programming as a job. I have realised this issue since 2nd year in and I wanted to change my degree but my parents insisted that I tank it out for the remaining few years because I would be ""wasting"" my precious time changing to another degree so I listened to them and tanked it out till now.

But just recently I have realised that my true passion and interest lies with in graphics design. I have been doing graphics design for a few of my University clubs and have had a blast doing it. Looking back at my life, i realised that i am kind of a creative person during my childhood and my high school years.

The problem now is that since I have found out where my true interest lies I dont know what to do starting from here.

Should I graduate with my comp sci degree and then do another 4 years of graphics design?

OR

Should i start looking for interns now relating to graphics design since I have 1 more year left of my degree? (Tried looking for interns but I think they see the comp sci degree and think that I am messing around.)

I am having a real tough go of things. I am currently home for winter break from college, and I am about to start my 8th semester at school. A lot of my friends are graduating, and I have a 5th year next where I am afraid of being alone and worrying about the real world, especially not seeing my family as much.


I am extremely close to my parents and brother. I have always been a homebody, avoiding the active group of social kids who would go out on weekends and party, while I enjoyed playing video games with my brother and enjoying the security of knowing my parents were only a room away in case I needed anything. I have taken summer jobs in my hometown and lived in my house with parents as most people do during school, but I have avoided opportunities to go on trips or internships where I would have to live and spend time away from my family. Moving on to the real world where I will most likely live away from parents and only see them on brief breaks and extremely short holidays is terrifying. I can't function like that. I love them too much, they mean too much to me. I  get into periods where I become extremely depressed and hurt when I think about them passing away in the future. I cant enjoy the present. I am too fixated on the struggles of the future and how time is always moving on and how they are growing old just as I am. I dread the day when they are to pass away, I don't think I will want to live on this earth when they are not here. Its scary, and I beat myself up constantly thinking about that. 

I have always had only a handful of friends with whom I am extremely close. In high school, I had three or four friends with whom I spent time out of school and felt comfortable with. Of course I had other acquaintances in school, but I never felt a deep relationship with them. 

When I started college, only one of my ""close"" friends came with me to the same school. I lost contact with my other closer friends from high school and haven't seen them in years. I stuck close to my one friend from high school when we started college and I was lucky enough to meet another four of five people with whom I have established deep friendships. My good friend from high school graduated this semester, and he is sticking around this next semester to work on campus and plan his life. This is what has recently triggered my emotional breakdown and severe depression. 

I am feeling like all of the friends are leaving my life and are going on to the real world where they will flourish and I will shrivel. They all have other friends outside of our ""core"" group of five or six friends, and I feel as though this core group is all I have. With them graduating and leaving, I feel as though parts of myself are dying off and I am here left outside in the cold. Knowing that my group of close friends is going to be cut in half this summer, and that it is going to be cut down again following the first semester of the next school year is just so daunting. It has taken me so long to get to this point, and now that they are moving on I feel as though I will never make deep friendships again. 

The quarter life crisis is real. I am scared of the future. I have three more semesters of school before I actually enter the real world, and I am already living as if I am in the middle of it. I can't imagine how devastated emotionally I will be when I actually do graduate. I lack confidence in my ability to live as a functioning adult and managing a life-work balance. 

If anyone has any words of advice or similar experiences, please help me. Letting me know what you went through and how to you dealt with it will help me with my struggles. 

TL;DR - I am scared of all my friends leaving me for the real world when I am left at college for another year. I am haunted by the fact that the time I will be able to spend with my family shortens every day, and that I will have no more long breaks to spend with them.

Perks of Apple: Easier conversion process (no interview from what I heard), slightly higher hourly pay, nearby intern housing
Cons of Apple: Very secretive, food not free, shared room in housing, slightly less interesting project

I was wondering if anyone of you got recruited into the Big4 companies (specifically into Apple, if anybody is from there) in 2015 as a fresh PhD from university into their Software Engineering roles with some internship experience. 

- Company Name
- Could you please provide how much salary you were initially offered (Base / Signing Bonus / RSU's and their vesting period)
- Did you negotiate?
- Final offer that you signed 

I have been made an initial offer (after resisting to cite a number first). But I think they low-balled the offer w/the possible expectation that I would ask for an increase. I am trying to get a measure of how much I should ask.

Thank you."

I think I went into this process with my head up my ass. I thought I was a super well qualified candidate and then my dream school rejected me, 2 good Catholic schools deferred me, and so far I had only gotten into one small Catholic school which would be 100% FULL PAY
Then... I got a phonecall that an SEC school offered me a full ride.
So now my college agenda looks like this
Fordham - accepted (no money)
Boston College - deferred
Notre Dame - deferred
Full ride to SEC school (can't say which yet)
And I am waiting on GW, UF, Georgetown, and UChicago

I guess I was waiting for that OMG I GOT INTO X SCHOOL! moment and I may not ever come. Anyways - since I was to go to law school (and that is hella expensive) should I just take the full ride to the SEC school even thought I'm not crazy about it? Or should I throw a few more hooks out there (any recommended schools for PoliSci would be great!) Idk. I need some unbiased advice for once.

3xwar0,4,2015-12-22,Problems with job search as a senior,SUCK_MY_DICTIONARY,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3xwar0/problems_with_job_search_as_a_senior/,"Hey all, wondering if anyone has stories or advice in this category.

I've been searching for a job recently to no avail. Every info graphic I see puts Electrical Engineering high on the list of most wanted degrees.

I've put in probably 20-30 applications, I've had about 4 interviews. And every single interview felt like they were looking for someone that wasn't me, and even when I said ""I've had good experiences in the past learning new unfamiliar topics."" they tend to not really be too interested after that point.

For instance, yesterday I had a full interview that started out with a software programming test for 2 simple functions in C++, Java, C# or a couple others I didn't know.

I know C++ a decent amount, but my last class was Sophomore year. The rest I haven't learned. The EE department at my school doesn't give credit for CompSci classes. I have kept up on programming languages but mostly LabVIEW and recently Python. So asking me to do these other ones kind of got me a little antsy.

I go through the interview and they ask me about hardware, analog and digital. I nailed all those questions. But when the last guy comes in, the big boss, he throws the programming test in front of me and I got it mostly right but it wasn't exactly syntactically correct and I forgot to do an input check for negative numbers, so he sort of gave me that attitude like I didn't know the first thing about software....okay.

And in general, what seemed to be a great interview ended up feeling pretty poor at the end because we closed on a note that showed what I can't do while completely disregarding the fact that if he had asked me to do the same thing in Verilog, VHDL, Python, LabVIEW, etc., I would have knocked it out of the park. He also didn't comment on my ability in hardware, when it seemed a lot like they needed someone good at hardware and I was a really good fit.

For reference, I've had 3 internships. I've studied abroad. My GPA is a 3.4+. I go to a good school with a good reputation in engineering. I feel like I have the credentials to be an awesome job candidate, and I constantly don't hear back from companies or hear back that they're not interested.

What really gets me is that I keep getting told by my brother and I know from other friends that they had multiple offers their fall semester and chose the best one. Here I am at the end with zero prospects and I am seriously worried about this. And their idea is that I must be doing something wrong, but I feel like this doesn't make any sense.

TL;DR: Good resume, good experience, well-rounded, actively searching, and getting no results of job opportunities. 

Anybody have any similar stories, or advice?"

I go to my local county college for computer science and I just finished my first semester. All I learned was how to build forms in Visual Basic. On the side, I taught myself basic html/css/bootstrap. I finished the semester with a 3.48 GPA, if that matters.

The company provides tech support and services including IT services, social media management, web design and hosting, merchant services, security, and a few other things as well. They're only taking on two interns.

I gave them my resume but honestly it's completely irrelevant because I started college late(age 20) and I've been a carpenter/remodeler since mid-senior year. I was even in the carpenters union at one point and things just didn't work out, mainly because I've grown a strong disliking to the work and everything involved(constantly travelling to different places, inconsistent hours).

I just discovered this subreddit and would appreciate any advice. Here is some background:

I am 24 years old with a Bachelor's degree in Journalism. I had a couple of marketing internships while in school but they were not very helpful for advancing a career. My first job out of school was as a manager for a family entertainment center (pizzeria, laser tag, mini golf), which was actually fun at times and I really learned a lot about how a small business is run. I was also not paid well and working 45+ hours a week so after 4 months I had decided to quit and find something else. My next job was in sales and operations in a small department of a large company that was experiencing some significant growth. I was there for a total of 9 months before my girlfriend and I decided to use some of our savings to quit our jobs and move to a new city and start fresh. That move was 6 months ago and I am very happy we did that. It was tough finding a job in a new city but after 2 months I found one also in sales and operations, this time for a very small company that resells software to mid-large sized organizations. I've been there just over 4 months and while it isn't perfect, I get paid well, the benefits are nice and there is a lot of potential for the future as my boss would like to train me to become a high-volume account manager with more potential for more commission.

Here is where I'd like to seek some advice. Ever since we moved to this new city, I have been thinking very thoroughly about what I'd like to do with my life, even if it would take years to reach. I've decided that I'd like to pursue a career in policy analysis in the public sector.

My questions are: 

Should I go to grad school within the next year? Or should I continue working, saving money and gaining more experience at my current job and go to school 2-3 years from now? Should I explore taking complimentary classes or certs in the before applying?  Should I find an entry level job in the public sector before school? Should I continue working in my current job and go to school part time (the Univ. near me has a part-time program I could get into and I'm certain I can handle the time commitment)?

I feel I've exhausted my thoughts on this so I will stop here and answer any follow up questions as needed. Thank you for anyone who read and is willing to offer their advice. I appreciate any and all thoughts."

I'll finish philosophy in another year and likely be able to graduate with a second bachelor's in CS in 1-1.5 extra years. 

My question is about internships. There is a military base with a few contractors in my home city, and several of them offer internships. The descriptions for the internships are often vague and have few to no requirements (for instance, must be a CS major at an accredited university). I wanted to know if it would be a bad idea to apply for a few that seemed fairly low level this summer, that way I could get some experience and maybe land something better next year when I know more CS?

When I was in high school I'd dream of being an adult, somehow I'd magically transition and move to a different country to start a fresh life. I'd have a good job and a group of tight-knit friends I could rely on.


I turned 20 some weeks ago and so far I have yet to ""check"" anything on that list. I was dreading turning 20 ever since I was 18, and now it finally happened. It just struck me the other day that now each year is a new twenty-something, and before I know it, I'm 30 and a bigger failure than I am now.


I was loosing weight last year but gained it all back and some. My teeth are awful, and when I was almost done with this almost 10 years long treatment I was advised to change dentists and start a new one. After about three years I haven't even started the new treatment because I'm waiting for the dentist's good graces to call me back (my mother called him this month - because I'm such an independent adult I couldn't do it myself- and he told us to wait for him to call us).


After missing out on basically everything a teenager experiences in those years because of depression, being transgender,etc now I'm sure I'm going to miss out on everything about being an adult. I see people on facebook, they are all independent, they do things on their own and with their friends. I never go out on my own, I don't have any friends.


But except for these ""fantasy lives"" I have on my mind I don't really have any plans for the future. I think to myself ""I'll just kill myself in a couple of years now, why even bother?"". Suicide has been on my mind daily for the past 6 years now, and sometimes by the end of a week I feel physically exhausted because I have so many negatives thoughts about myself, and I just bombard myself with them 24/7.


I have social anxiety and now because of my internship I only have ONE SINGLE WEEK for holidays, which is this one. I loved school/college breaks at the end of the year because it felt like my time to recharge, to leave my home the least possible and not have to deal with anything social.


For now getting thinner would be good enough. Sometimes I think in postponing a possible suicide because I wouldn't want people to see my dead body like this. I wish I had the will to become anorexic, but its too hard."

3xx7ys,1,2015-12-22,"To Studio Executives, the MPAA, and everyone who wants to kill movie piracy",leafs81215,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3xx7ys/to_studio_executives_the_mpaa_and_everyone_who/,"Since downloading movies is such a big deal right now, given the situation with 'The Hateful Eight', 'The Revenant', and the numerous other 'screeners' hitting the internet sometimes in full advance of their theatrical release; I want to give you one film fan's opinion of the problem and how to solve it. 

First of all, stop saying that piracy is killing the movie industry. It's impossible to make that argument when Star wars made $600 million in Box Office revenue in 4 days. It makes you sound like complete idiots.  I can't stand when some studio exec or MPAA rep comes out and says that we lost x amount of dollars, and people are losing their jobs because of piracy. The film industry is going to hit a new high in box office receipts this year. Yes, film attendance is likely down, because ticket prices are up and the economics are starting to make very little sense.  

Think about it, I have a family of 4 and i want to go and see a movie. $13.99 a ticket, that's about $55 right there, add another $12 total for 3D you are up to $68. The kids want popcorn, the wife likes M&amp;M's, and we're thirsty. There's another $40. So it's just around $110 to go and see one movie. And your only seeing that movie once. On top of that, i have to sit next to that infamous 'Tommy Texter' in the theatre, or 'Sally Gabbers' and her idiot friend who won't shut up. My kids won't sit still, there's not enough leg room, and I honestly can't stand it when I get there too late and have to sit up close enough to kill my neck.

The alternative is that I can sit at home, download the movie for free, let the kids run around all they want, spend a total of $8 on better quality snacks, have a few beers, lie on the couch and watch the movie over and over in a comfortable pair of pajamas. And i keep the movie on hand, because the kids love it and it's really the  only thing that shuts them up when I'm ready to send them to bed for two days because i have a blasting headache. 

2nd scenario.  i want to take my wife out to see 'The Hateful Eight' on Boxing Day. In fact, I'm a huge film nerd, and my wife and i want to go and see all of the potential Oscar nominees, before the Oscars so we can have an intelligent debate (and actually care) about the winners/losers of the night. I love challenging films, small, indie films, foreign films and highly regarded and critically acclaimed films.  So I have to find enough time to see all of those movies, enough babysitting hours for my kids because these movies aren't for them,  and enough money to go through the same routine I mentioned above multiple times to enjoy the best films that the year 2015 has to offer. 

Let's say I clear all of those hurdles, and I now have the time to go and see all of those wonderful films. Let's check showtimes, release dates, yeah...not a single one of those movies is playing near me.  Star Wars is playing in 18 different screens, in every conceivable format, every half an hour on the hour. But I've already seen Star Wars and, while I thought it was amazing, I'm ready for something different.  Yes, not one of those movies is playing close enough for   me to go and see. 

The alternative is that some nice intern who works for Joe Oscarvoter, was kind enough to steal his bosses copies of all of those movies and upload them to the internet. Because awards mean big business, studios send out out free copies so that people will watch movie X, nominate it for Best Picture, so that the day the Oscar nominations come out the studio can make a brand new TV spot claiming movie X is now the most acclaimed movie of the year! I believe that movie X might be good, but here we are 3 weeks from the Oscars and I haven't seen it. So now, i'm kinda bummed out that there are so many great movies up for all of these awards and i can't watch them unless I go onto the internet and download them illegally, which might make me happy until my Internet provider sends me an email demanding that I cease my copyright infringement right away. 

I felt bad about stealing, and I don't want to do it, but I just want to see those movies so badly, I'd be willing to pay to rent them, or stream them online. But there is no service like that available, because if there was, the big bad theater chains would be so upset that they would refuse to screen movie X in their theaters and that would mean more lost revenue. It's too bad that now I'm considered a thief, and a pirate, because I wanted to watch those great, acclaimed films but they were not available to me legally, so I had no choice. At least now ABC, and NBC, the HFPA and the Academy will be happy because I am an informed and invested awards show viewer.  But I am a criminal in the minds of Studio executives and the Motion Picture Association of America. Thanks to new copyright laws, I could be charged up to $5,000 for each movie I downloaded.  I was totally willing to pay $10-15 to see these movies, or even pay a subscription to a premium streaming service that would make all of these movies available to me. 

i guess, i just won't bother at all.  I'll be 8-10-12 months behind, until the movie shows up on Netflix or iTunes. There's no point in watching any awards shows, because those movies aren't available in my area. And now instead of getting $10-15 from me, or even more should I subscribe to a premium service that allows me to stream these movies, you'll get about 4/10 of a cent of my Netflix subscription. Or potentially $5,000 if you decide to sue me. 

It seems ironic that most of the leaks onto the internet come from  somebody within the film industry. It's even sadder that without movies, movie theaters are big empty houses with alot of seats, like most NHL games in Florida. Yet, the movie theater chains seem to have alot of control over when I can see movie X, without having to put up with Texters, talkers, overpriced shitty popcorn, cramped  seats and poorly projected films.  36% of Canadians who download movies would pay a reasonable fee to watch the same movie, at the same time, legally.  

You know, there used to be another step between the Theater Chains and Cable subscription services, that would get exclusive rights to rent out movies 3-5 months after they were in theaters. They had high prices, overpriced snacks, and even charged you fees for bringing a movie back too late. Whatever happened to them?"

After talking to a few people, many suggested attempting to get summer jobs/internships in other majors and outside of the college recruiting services.

I'm new to this and I'm looking for advice. 

1. Where would be good places to market myself to look for internships/jobs in other fields?

2. What kind of fields can a petroleum major like me hope to apply to?

3. How can I change my resume or sell myself to seem appealing to a recruiter in a different major?

Honestly I wrote this post in the middle of the night, just feeling so down about myself. I thought posting here would be worth it if only one person replied, I mainly just needed to vent about my situation. But I did not expect all this! Thank you all so much, what a wonderful community! I am feeling so much better about my situation and have not felt this way in a while, all thanks to you r/xxfitness :) 

Sorry in advance for the wall of text. I don't know where else to post - I guess loseit might be better but honestly I feel a little more comfortable here. I have no one to turn to and I'm just sitting here crying about what has become of my life. I'm just so tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a person I absolutely despise. 

Just some background - I am currently 22 years old, 5'2"", 155 lbs. When I was 18 I was around 100 lbs and starting college. In that gap it feels like I've tried everything to live a healthy lifestyle, but I've just about given up. When in high school I also suffered from bulimia; even at 100 lbs considered myself to be overweight. 

2011 - 100 lbs, ran cross country in high school. Never ate breakfast or lunch (usually no money for food) but ate dinner. 

2012 - 115 lbs, slightly bummed out with my weight but didn't do anything about it because I figured it was a healthy weight to be at. Also used my unlimited access to food at college as an excuse. 

2013 - Beginning of this year I end up being 125 lbs and begin going to the gym religiously, eating scraps, etc. By the second half of the year I'm down to 108. Because of certain situations I start having suicidal ideations. By the end of 2013 I'm committed to a facility for about a week. I also receive a job offer to work for a year before returning to school, which I gladly accept so I can take a break from school stresses while earning some extra cash. 

2014 - Still 108-110 lbs. I'm pleased with my weight, and I am on meds which make me feel much better. I move to a southern state for work, and everyone is obsessed with my weight and how small I am. Everyone says how they're going to feed me and make me chubby before the year is up. They are joking around, but do make sure I eat. By June I am around 120 lbs. Feeling self conscious of my weight and decide to hit the gym but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. During this year I also take up drinking, HEAVILY. I am plastered all the time, always blacked out, not taking my meds, and just being very irresponsible. This is not my typical personality at all. This leads me to eat fast food all the time as well. By the end of the year I'm at around 130 lbs, the biggest I've ever been. I take a family trip out of the country and everyone is seriously shocked at my weight gain. No one holds back comments, and it makes me feel like shit.

2015 - I'm back at school. I've never been so self conscious about my weight. I begin lurking loseit, xxfitness, and fitness subreddits. I want to lose that weight but instead of refusing to eat/working out obsessively I decide this time I am going to do it the healthy way. I get about 5 personal training sessions to learn about weight training. Discover I LOVE it. (I used to do XC but at this point I'm so over cardio.) However, by my summer internship I'm at 150 lbs. I joined a gym and workout at least 3 times a week, but I'm also eating like shit and drinking a lot so I don't really lose the weight. After the semester started I try to get my shit together - I eat as healthy as I possibly can, I try to incorporate some cardio/weight training at least 3 times a week, and by the end of October I'm at 144! Small difference, but still something. Since then... I don't know. I have no motivation. Never go to the gym anymore, only eat shit, and leave my house as little as possible in order to avoid running into people that are used too 100 lb me. So now here I am, 155 lbs, and stuck. 

I feel as if whenever I try to make a lifestyle change I try to go all out at once, making me feel super burned out. Basically I have no idea what to do anymore, and how to do it safely. I know I need to eat less calories than I burn, but I have ZERO self control right now. I feel like I don't even know myself, that I'm a completely different person. I hate myself. I hate what I look like, I just hate everything. I feel like if I don't make a change soon I'll be committed again by summer. 

So I'm posting here as a last resort, I have no idea how to make these changes. I thought I did but I'm just not sure anymore. I'm graduating this May and decided that I want to lose at least 20 lbs by then. I not currently working out but I just bought a pass for the community gym (all it has are treadmills, an elliptical, some dumbbells). I am currently at home and none of my family members workout/eat healthy (which makes it so much harder for me to say no to a fast food run). When at school I live with my boyfriend, who can eat anything in the world yet remain extremely thin. He does not work out at all. 

I just aspire to be someone who is healthy. I want to eat healthy, work out, and just overall improve my lifestyle. 

How do I get back into the groove of working out/eating healthy without breaking the bank or feeling burned out? Please, please, please help me. I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to get this out somewhere. Any tips at all are welcome! I have begun to cut out alcohol and only drink an occasional beer here and there.

3xy7a3,1,2015-12-23,Thinking about setting up VOIP for my mom's business.,goeatsomesoup,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3xy7a3/thinking_about_setting_up_voip_for_my_moms/,"Diagram:http://imgur.com/mtxYg4Y

So just to preface, I'm an IT intern at a company that develops point of sale software. It's only been 6 months and I feel like I'm finally starting to get the hang of things (took down several email domains for 40 minutes cuz I didn't know what propagation was during my first month on the job ooohohohoho). My job is to work with mySQL databases, set up/manage server/switch racks, wiring patch panels all that good stuff.

Anyways, so I *think* I know what I'm doing, but I just wanted some reassurance/feedback before I spend my money on this project.

So my mom owns a nail salon and I noticed she's been paying $120 a month for just a phone line with caller ID. That is it. Nothing else, no long distance, no forwarding nothing. And I thought that was retarded so I decided it was time to put some of my newly learned skills to use. What I want to do is, start an internet plan (AT&amp;T is charging $45/mo for 25mbps which isn't too bad imo) and use an ooma device as the VOIP thingie. From there we'll transfer the phone number and hook up the existing business phone. Now, I'm well aware of the minutes limitations, but I doubt we'll go over 200-300 minutes a month, time is money and we don't spend much time on the phone making reservations. The only thing I'm worried about is the reliability. If you look in the diagram I attached, options 1 and 2 rely on the ooma. I personally would like to use option 3 since that helps ease up on the single point of failure issue, but I don't really know how I would set it up. My mom is very tech illiterate and I don't think she'd like to have to dial GV every time she needs to call a customer back.

I don't mind paying the taxes and fees for the ooma by the way if that matters. I looked through its features and it looks like its up to the job, but if you have any other suggestions do let me know. I'm not too familiar with VOIP in general and ooma looks like the easiest to work with.

The server does things, one of those things is function as a DVR for the cameras. I was thinking I'd get 2 western digital purple drives and run them in raid 1. OS will run on its own SSD. I'm not sure how I'd handle cloud back up since the upload speed is not nearly enough for 8 1080p IP cams, but for now raid should suffice. The server should be secure in the storage room, but if necessary, I can also have it write to an external HDD in like, the attic or something I dunno. Might be overkill since not much really happens at a nail salon. Obviously I could go with an all in one pre built DVR solution, but the server is multi purpose. It also plays music, and hosts quickbooks to run payroll and all that stuff. It's also a better idea to move it to cloud, but like I said, my parents are the kind that are too old to want to learn anything new so I'll just have to deal with it. They thought $120 for just a land line is normal so that's their mind set about tech in general. Oh in case it isn't clear, the server already exists, but it's a shitty dell optiplex running XP from 2003, but I plan to migrate the software to windows 10 with a new server and run QB in virtual XP with no external network access.

As for the wifi, I initially thought it would be a good idea to create a hotspot for the customers, but I'm worried about security. So for now the plan is just for employees only, which includes my parents, no SSID broadcast and all that.

______________________________________________________________

Also I want to say, my main question is about the VOIP. The server, the networking equipment, IP cameras, that's all stuff I can handle on my own, the VOIP thing is a little new to me so I just wanted to make sure what I'm doing in regards to that is solid. I do plan to keep the land line for a month to test VOIP incase anything goes wrong. But feedback on the rest of the setup is good as well.

I already thought of some stuff that i should say, but i'm really looking into gathering more things to say because this is my first time doing it.


I work in customer service in a medium-sized company. I like working here, but it is not related to what i'm doing at university (computer science). I made an interview to work in one of the best companies of the world and they called me. It is a job position that will have to do with what i'm studying and is full of oportunities.


The problem is that people here in this company i am really likes me, since i'm their best intern (confirmed by the company indicators) and they want me to work at their development area next year, so they were really counting on me.


About what i said above, my boss said that the manager from the developer area would talk to me to summarize what would be my tasks, but he still didn't talk to me, i've been waiting this for like 1-2 months.


So i really decided to take that oportunity at the other company and go for it. Any tips to how to tell my boss about it?

   
**tl;dr**: People on my current job count on me. I was called to another job with great opportunities and related to my university studies. I need tips from you to know if what i tought is the right thing to say.

3xz4bm,2,2015-12-23,[23/M] Questions about a career,Balpenpotlood,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/3xz4bm/23m_questions_about_a_career/,"Hello. I decided to post here because I don't really know where else to post, and because I think the people here understand me the best.

Last year I graduated with a master's degree in English and Dutch literature &amp; linguistics. Currently I'm doing a 1-year postgraduate teacher training course, so I can become a language teacher. But I'm really not sure that I want to be that.

The main point is that I feel stuck. I am 23, and I don't feel as if I have accomplished anything, and being a teacher won't let me accomplish anything either. I feel like I am made for greater things than just be a language teacher, on a dead career, with no prestige in society. It used to not bother me at all, I figured you should do what you want to do right? But many of my friends are now starting to make a career and have promising futures ahead of them and it's starting to get to me. I feel like I'm failing myself.

Being a teacher is a fun job, I've taught some classes as part of my training and it was fun! But it's a lot of hard work for no recognition. And I'm sure I would be a good teacher, I've only gotten positive criticism from my mentors and I enjoy standing in front of a classroom, it's just that I'm just not sure that I *want* to be a teacher.

But I don't know what else to do, and I feel trapped. I feel super trapped. If I'm not going to be a language teacher, what else can I be? A random worker in the private sector? Many of my friends with the same degree as mine but who decided not to be teacher are doing somewhat shitty jobs in the private sector. That's not an option.

So many things have been going through my head. The only constant is fleeing everything. Just, really, throwing my laptop in the garbage can and getting. the. fuck. out. of my current life.

Options that have been going through my head the last half year:

*I could make a dash to the french foreign legion, and become a soldier. It's probably going to suck, at least in the beginning, but I'll also be outside, active, and -doing- something with my life. I'll also be part of something greater than myself.

*I could become a religious worker/chaplain. It took a long time, 6 years, but I turned from an agnost into a catholic (yes). I've already went to the faculty of theology to get into contact for this, and in May I'm going to do a internship as a chaplain in a local prison, to see if I like it. However, if I actually wanted to be a professional chaplain, I'd have to study for three more years part-time. The plan was that I could then be a part-time language teacher to fund the studies and get an income, as I no longer want to be dependant on my parents.

*I could become a monk and spent the rest of my life in the local abbey (for real, I've gone there on a spiritual retreats for a total of two weeks in the last year and a half and I've enjoyed it, but it's pretty extreme).

*I could enter politics and gain power and personal satisfaction that way, but I'm not sure I could make that

*I could become a priest, move to Rome, become a part of the staff in the Vatican and raise through the ranks

Some of these options are more ludicrous than others, but they are just things going through my head because I feel super stuck. I feel like I have nowhere to go. None of the options above are ideal. I probably can't go to the legion, because I have glasses and shit, I'm not a soldier, be real. I have a degree in linguistics and literature. I don't really want to be priest, because eventhough I don't have a girlfriend and have never been very succesful with girls, the celibate life is a thorn in my side and really, it's the 21st century, who becomes a priest these days?

I don't know what to do. It's been good for me to write this out. If you want to call me a retard because of the listed options, please, I know, but I'm desperately looking for an alternative because I really don't know what to do.

What would you guys do if you were in my position? I feel like time is running out on me, and I feel like I'm failing myself."

""They can strip you of your command, Sir."" Bartleby argued, fearful the Commander was needlessly making light of the situation.

""No, they can't."" Baggam argued back. He could see the doubt on Bartleby's face. ""Okay, let me put it like this. What happens if they find me unfit for duty. Like a grievance, they have to sustain the verdict. Only three entities--the Daimyo, the Central Senate, and the Emperor--can do that. Only those three can sustain a civil court judgment of this magnitude. 

""The Daimyo is dead. The Emperor is missing. Only the Senate can handle something like this, and they won't. They won't because it will draw to much attention to the fact that the Emperor is missing. If they tried to impeach me,"" Baggam warned, ""every last man and woman in the Empire would stop to watch the proceedings.

""It would be tantamount to handing the Elder Siblings a major victory. The Senate can't afford a loss like that. They can't enforce this, so why go through the charade? The answer is, they never planned to.""

""I don't know, Sir."" Bartleby countered. ""Your assumption comes with a big risk. What if that's not their play?  You're gambling with a lot of lives. No one else can lead this fleet the way you can. They'll have some kind of back up plan in case the assassination failed. They'd bee fools not to. If it's House Diederoi plotting this, they didn't do it alone, and they've been planning it for quite some time. If it were me, I'd have contingencies. 

""If this truly is a plot by the Elders, then their plan--whatever it is--depends on stripping you of power. One way or another, they'll have to remove you."" Bartleby reasoned. 

""Their plan doesn't revolve around me losing power. It revolves around a weak plot to engage the Central Senate."" Baggam corrected.

""You're fixating, Sir. You've got tunnel vision where this is concerned. Granted, you're probably right, but it doesn't feel right. What if they have another way to remove you from power?"" Bartleby asked pointedly.

""They don't."" Baggam growled.

""But, they might. I'm just saying, keep an open mind."" Bartleby urged. Baggam's reply was a grunt and a shrug. 

The transport gently lurched, pulling Bartleby from the discussion. Baggam's reply wasn't the reassurance the Aide was hoping for, but it was better than nothing. He twisted about, and peered out the driver's windshield. The shuttle was slowing down like it was preparing to land. 

""We there?"" He asked. 

The Guin driving nodded and pointed to a pub in the middle of the crossroads ahead. The shuttle touched down with a little bump a few store fronts away. The crossroads was far to busy for her to get them any closer. 

The moment the shuttle was down, the driver slipped from her seat and hurried around the shuttle to open their door. It was a refreshing courtesy. One in every hundred dwarves might have performed it. Of course, that one dwarf only would have done it to solicit a tip. 

Bartleby waved his consumer badge across the reader she presented to settle the fare, then dropped a few cron in her open palm in gratitude. She seemed amused by this. 

""You didn't expect a tip?"" He asked.

""Not really. The damn dwarves really lower expectations all across the board. He considered that and dropped a few more in her palm then smiled as a new thought popped inside his head.

""How much would you charge to take us to Savinbrod?"" Bartleby asked. The Guin started in surprise.

""That's all the way across the ship and five hundred levels down."" She replied.

""How much?"" Bartleby asked.

""For the pair of ya?"" She asked. Bartleby shrugged but nodded. 

""How much?"" He asked.

""Twelve hundred cron."" She replied squeamishly. Bartleby winced. 

""Fine. I want you to take a trip across the ship."" He said, running his badge across the scanner again. ""I don't want you to stop till you reach the barracks at Savinbrod. When you reach it, give this to the duty officer."" He pulled a dagger from a sheath on his forearm.

""That's it? You just want me to give some knight a knife?"" 

""That's it. You make twelve hundred cron for giving a knife to a knight. That work for you?"" He asked. Her grin grew.

""Oh, that definitely works for me, pretty boy."" She replied, smacking his cheek playfully. 

She hurriedly dodged back around the transport and slipped back inside. A moment later, she was lifting off, giving Bartleby a flirtatious wink while she did. Bartleby dipped his head, then turned away with Baggam. The pair made a beeline for the tavern. Behind them, the shuttle lifted off and sped away. 

Bartleby glanced back when he reached the tavern to make sure the driver was truly gone. He didn't want her to know their true destination which lay just beyond the tavern. 

He'd given her the bar's address in case the Ministry guards tracked her down. It was a fortuitous precaution. At the time, he hadn't really expected them to come looking for them. But now that they knew William was William, they'd be coming for Baggam in force. The Aide searched the corridor for curious eyes then hurriedly changed direction when he didn't find any. Baggam followed his lead.

""You will be paying me back for that, right?"" Bartleby asked.

""Expense it."" Baggam quipped. 

""Is that allowed?"" Bartleby asked in surprise.

""Will you focus."" Baggam growled. ""How do you know how long they've been planning this?""

""She noticed the time stamp on the petition--my friend, I mean. It was signed before the Summit. One rotation before actually."" Bartleby replied. ""If House Diederoi is behind the grievance, then they've been plotting this since before the incident with Daniel at the Summit. They filed it before anything with the harvest went wrong. It was like they knew this harvest was going to blow up in our faces."" Baggam mulled that over then shook his head. He didn't agree. They reached the reprinting facility and pushed their way through the lobby doors.

""You're forgetting something momentous that happened before the Summit."" Baggam said. ""The Daimyo was assassinated. It was overshadowed by what happened at the Summit, but it was most definitely before. That's the only reason their plan has a chance. The Daimyo is gone. The Emperor is gone. It left them an open path to the Senate. If they win a judgment against me, it'll force the Senate to acknowledge publicly that the Emperor is missing. The Elder Siblings can't just announce it themselves. Right now, their power is limited. If they start throwing accusations around, the Senate will just denounce them. But if they can get me in court, they'll have the stage they need to win public support.

""The Elders need the support of the people. They need the support of the army. They need the Central Senate to admit that the Emperor is missing all on their own. If they can get them to publicly acknowledge the fact, then they can bring their charge against the Senate. They can force the Senate to acknowledge that the Emperor is gone.

""If the Senate refuses to declare the Emperor dead, then public sentiment will shift and split. We'll have a civil war on our hands."" Baggam predicted. ""It'll be the end of the Empire Choan Vaat built.""

""I have the greatest respect for you, Sir, but aren't you placing a little too much importance on your role in all of this?"" Bartleby asked. ""You haven't been to Cojo since before Sylar.""

""It doesn't matter."" Baggam groused. ""My position is impactful."" 

""So is an all meat diet."" Bartleby fired back. 

Baggam gave him a sour look and let the lobby door swing shut behind him. There were three doors coming off the lobby, and three people reading tablets seated on benches in the waiting area. The only other person present was a bored looking red headed woman seated behind a counter across from the door. 

""Where the hell is he?"" Baggam demanded of the receptionist. She looked up in surprise. Bartleby sighed and took the lead, approaching the counter with as disarming a smile as he could muster.

""Hello."" Bartleby greeted, a patient smile splayed across his face. ""This is my first time here.""

The woman behind the counter sighed heavily and looked almost as bored as the Guin that drove them there. She slowly reached forward and pressed a black button on the counter between them. A holographic head suddenly appeared accompanied by a jaunty little jingle. The hologram was of a old grandmotherly woman with bouncy brown curls, warm eyes, and an inviting smile.

*Welcome to Rejuv-the-Nation. The premiere destination for everything dying. At Rejuv-the-Nation, everyone gets that second chance they always wished for. Maybe your body has begun to sag. Perhaps you have an unsightly blemish marring your beauty. At Rejuv-the-Nation, we take away your worries and give you the body nature denied you.* 

*Did daddy's little princess take too many pills? Did Mommy die in child birth? Did a jealous lover overreact? Was he a good soldier that died for his country? Did you just want the pain to stop? We understand, and we don't judge. We just make it better, because we can bring them all back. And, we'll bring them back better than they were before.*

*We'll take away the scars. We'll take away the wrinkles. We'll take away those aching joints, that missing leg, and give you that smile life cheated you out of. We'll make it all better and fix the mistakes only nature could make. This is the Rejuv-the-Nation guarantee.*

*Rejuv-the-Nation, keeping families together when no one else can.* 

The look Baggam gave the woman behind the counter had her recoiling in fear. 

""You think this is funny?"" Baggam growled.

Baggam reached through the holographic head smiling back at them. He grabbed the woman behind the counter by her smock front and pulled her across the counter. 

""It was an ad, Sir. It wasn't personal."" Bartleby declared, slipping his arms between the receptionist and Baggam.

""Where is he?"" Baggam growled.

""W-Who are you . . . looking for?"" The red head asked nervously. Bartleby carefully pried the two apart. Baggam released her with a little shove.

""He's a bit touchy about the leg."" Bartleby apologized. ""You're reprinting a man named Daniel Sojourner. He's a government contract. There's probably a lot of knights loitering around his room. We need to speak with him immediately."" 

""B-Bed 32."" The receptionist stammered, pointing toward the wall to her right. 

""Much obliged."" He responded, leading the way. Baggam gave the little red head one last hard look then stomped after his Aide. ""You didn't have to scare the little minx."" 

""I did, and I make no apologies for it."" Baggam snapped. ""Where are all the others?"" Bartleby pushed open the door the receptionist indicated for Baggam and woke up his NID.

""The Baron and his men are up ahead. Aaron and Kalala are up ahead. Pemphero, Margo, and Abbot Brumchild are up ahead. Prince Ogct and General Shar are two neighborhoods off and coming fast. Baako is up ahead. And, Luke is one neighborhood away and coming quick. He was bringing Ciyth with him. Did I miss anyone?"" Bartleby asked.

""Jocosa."" Baggam grumbled.

""It will take her a little longer. She was training acolytes at the temple in Parv Berdu. It's usually a knell by skiff, but with the quarantine in effect, she'll have to come through the ship. She's looking at about two knell. I think that's everyone though.""

""Speaking of the quarantine. What's the status on that? And, did the Baron bring any men with him?"" Baggam asked.

""The reports of incapacitations peaked yesterday around mid-rotation. The rate has slowed since with only a few dozen being reported each hour. The Grey Guard, the Imperial troops, and the knights are all on alert. They're scooping up everyone who collapses as ordered. As far as the Baron goes, I don't know. There are a lot of NID signatures clustered up around the bend in the hall. I recognize a few of them. Some of them are with the Dame's security detail."" Bartleby revealed.

""Better and better."" Baggam growled, stomping forward. He round the bend only to find a dozen knights laid out in the hall before him. They appeared to be alive and breathing, but they were covered in sweat and exhausted. ""What the hell is happening here?""

""I-I don't know."" Bartleby replied. 

Baggam picked his way through the downed knights and entered the only door left. Bartleby knelt and checked the vitals of the knights he passed. Inside the room, Baggam found a dozen more knights with their faces drenched in sweat, their teeth clenched tight, and their eyes pinched shut. As he watched, one of them began to sway. A Med Tech rushed over to the man and caught him as he toppled over.

""What the hell is going on?"" Baggam growled heatedly. The Med Tech who'd caught the knight scurried over to where the Commander stood.

""They're trying to smother his will, Sir."" The Med Tech replied, pointing to the figure strapped to the bed. It was Daniel.

Baggam surveyed the room. There were over three dozen neural dampeners in the room. Five of them suddenly overloaded, exploding in a shower of sparks as he watched. Two other Med Techs scurried out of the back room with three more dampeners in their hands. The immediately replaced the damaged ones, throwing the destroyed ones on a knee-high pile of broken dampeners piled against the far wall.

""I'm going to need an explanation."" Baggam commanded, searching the struggling men and women arrayed around Daniel's bed for a familiar face. 

The three Weapon Masters he recognized. They stood shoulder to shoulder down the left side of Daniel's bed. They had their hands pressed against his chest and head, and they were every bit as lathered as the other knights. Keflan was kneeling to the right side of the bed. His huge hand gripped Daniel around the middle. Abbot Brumchild was at the foot with both of Daniel's legs gripped in his meaty fist. The rest of the knights had their hands lying on the shoulder of the knight before them, and all of them were pushing themselves to the limit.

""Speak damn it."" Baggam barked. The Med Tech at his elbow started with surprise then dove into what was happening in the room.

""T-They made me put a parasite in his h-head, Sir."" The Med Tech stammered, his stringy black hair was soaked with sweat and plastered to his scalp, testifying to how long he'd be at it. ""The subject had been reprinted before--many times in fact. I tried to tell--""

""I know that already. I authorized it. Tell me what the hell they're doing to him."" Baggam snapped.

""The Dame put him to sleep, but she couldn't keep him asleep. He keeps trying to wake up, but every time he tries, he starts to lose control. They're struggling to keep him . . . sedated."" The Tech explained. ""They have to do it several times each rotation. It was easier when the big man with the curly brown hair was present, but he was called away. We keep having to bring in more and more knights to smother his will. It's very distressing, Sir. We're almost out of neural dampeners. I've had to send one my interns to the warehouse to bring back as many dampeners as he can find. It's been very exciting, Sir. Very exciting."" 

""How long do the attacks last?"" Baggam asked. The Med Tech thought it over. 

""Usually another eight knights will drop before the episode passes. The time between attacks keeps shortening though. Last time it was two knell. This one is nearly over."" The Tech predicted. Three knights groaned aloud and dropped, one after the other. The two Med Techs setting up the neural dampeners hurried over to them and began dragging them out into the hall with the others.

""Why don't you go help them."" Baggam ordered, motioning for Bartleby to assist the Techs. 

Bartleby obeyed without question, while Baggam drifted over to where the knights struggled to keep Daniel down. He slipped between Keflan and another knight, cozying up to Daniel's bedside. He wanted to see Daniel up close for himself. He wanted to see the monster that was about to tear the Empire apart. Three more knights wilted to the floor. Baggam ignored them.

""Why'd you do it?"" Baggam asked sorrowfully. ""Why'd you kill him. Why'd you kill the Emperor?"" His words were barely more than a whisper, but they struck a chord in Daniel. They cut through the psychic battle and reached the man inside. 

The knights all gasped in unison and staggered back. Daniel had given up the fight. 

""Look what your lies have done to me. You took my leg. You took my vigor. You took it all away and for what? Why'd you kill Choan Vaat?"" Baggam wasn't expecting answers to his questions. He just needed to say the words.

""It's all clear now, Commander."" The Med Tech announced. ""The episode is over. He'll be down for a couple of knell."" 

The knights all dropped to one knee but it wasn't out of respect for their Commander. They just were just too weak to stand any longer.

""Baron?"" Baggam called. ""The mission I authorized you to undertake is cancelled. I have an eye witness that will testify that your brother murdered Choan--""

""The Emperor lives."" The words were barely audible, but they were loud enough to freeze the Commander in place. Baggam turned his attention back to Daniel. The former Prior's lips were moving but nothing was coming out.

""Say that again."" Baggam ordered, leaning in close so he could hear.

""Choan. Vaat. Lives. On. Jolliox."" Daniel breathed, pushing out each word with effort.

""He's alive?"" Baggam sighed in disbelief. ""The Emperor is alive?""

""Jolliox."" Daniel repeated. ""Jolliox. Jolliox. Jolliox!""

""The Emperor's on Jolliox?"" Baggam asked excitedly. ""He's really alive?"" He grabbed the medical gown Daniel was wrapped in and pulled him close much as he had the receptionist. ""Say it aloud so they can all hear, and don't youlie to me, boy. Gods damn you, don't you fucking lie to me. Is he really on Jolliox?""

Daniel's eyes flew open without warning even as the straps that held his wrist and ankles let go. Before Baggam could pull away and before the knights could stop him, Daniel's hands shot up and grabbed Baggam by the head. The former Prior's whole body began to vibrate and spasm, and to Baggam's horror, Daniel spoke again.

""Jolliox!"" Daniel roared, pouring his will into the Commander. He shouted the word over and over again, while knights and Med Techs beat on him and tried to tear Baggam free of his grip, but it was like his hands were welded to the sides of Baggam's head.

Baggam jerked and thrashed wildly, like he was having a seizure; like he was be electrocuted. And nothing they did, could make Daniel let go. The Battle Commander's eyes slowly rolled up into his head until only the whites were showing, and blood-flecked foam formed in the corners of his mouth.

Knights threw their will at Daniel, and he shook them off like they weren't even there. The neural dampeners overloaded in pairs. Witch lights burst in showers of green flame. Steel walls bowed out. Ceiling panels popped loose. Decking steel ripped open. Reprinting equipment exploded in a shower of sparks. One knight was hurled across the room. Abbot Brumchild was sent smashing into the ceiling. He stayed there, pressed against the panels by Daniel's will. And all the while, men and women pulled at Daniel's arms without effect. 

It was Bartleby who ended it. He drew a blank from the holster of one of his sister knights and swung it at Daniel's temple with all his might. It ended the fight, but not how any of them thought it would. The moment it made contact with Daniel's skull, Daniel disintegrated, dissolving into a golden cloud of atoms that trailed after the blank in Bartleby's hand. 

The cloud golden dust was swept into the crowd of knights and through them, only to coalesce into Daniel once more. The Abbot was suddenly free of Daniel's influence and came crashing down atop several of the knights.

Some of the knights tended to Baggam, but the rest just stared at Daniel, their expressions unreadable.

""Daniel?"" Aaron called from the doorway. The shouts had drawn him in from one of the other rooms.

""What's happening to me?"" Daniel asked in a frightened voice. He stood alone, everyone else slowly backing away ""What the hell is hap--"" He broke into a cloud of atoms again. The cloud exploded out into the room, filling every corner then re-coalesced in a different spot. When it was done, Daniel was whole again. 

""What's is this?"" He asked, searching the faces of the other knights. He looked pleadingly into the eyes of his little brother. Gorjjen pushed through the crowd.

""I don't know."" Gorjjen murmured.  ""I don't know, but we'll figure it out."" Daniel broke into a cloud of atoms once more. This time they didn't scatter. They swirled in place like angry bees. A moment later, Daniel was back, rematerializing in the same spot he'd just left.

""Oh dear."" A new voice sang merrily. ""It's already begun."" All eyes went to the door and speaker. The woman who spoke was handcuffed and under guard. The smug all-knowing smile she wore looked out of place on Leia's face.

""What the hell is happening to me, Baako?"" Daniel asked hotly.

""Nothing that hasn't happened a thousand times before. You're remembering."" She replied. ""Don't worry. It'll pass."" He exploded into a cloud of atoms again and rematerialized inches from her face. She kissed the tip of his nose. ""Welcome back lover.""

""What the hell is happening to me!"" Daniel exclaimed, wrapping both his hands around her throat.

""Careful, Daniel. You'll want to stay calm. One stray thought, and you'll rematerialize outside this ship."" She warned, laughing gaily. 

""You did this to me."" He accused.

""Oh, Daniel. I was the one who *kept* you from doing this."" She replied, stroking his cheek affectionately. ""You'll remember in time. For right now, I'd start thinking calm thoughts. You can't control it when you're scared.""

""What did he do to the Commander?"" Bartleby asked, going to his knees beside Baggam. The Commander was still spasming.

""I-I didn't mean . . . He blamed me for . . ."" Daniel grabbed at his head and screamed then promptly sank through the deck.

Everyone in the room was left staring into the eyes of the others. No one seemed to have an answer or an explanation to what had just happened.

""Where'd he go?"" Ailig asked, edging over to the spot Daniel had just vacated. He drew his sword, fully intending to cut the Jujen Queen down if she didn't answer.

""Down. Up. Left. Right. Earth. Cojo. Jolliox. It's really hard to tell when he's like this. There really isn't a limit for him."" Baako replied witheringly. The looks they awarded her were filled with a mixture of emotion--shock, surprise, fear, incredulity, but mostly wonder.

""You knew he could do this?"" Margo asked threateningly.

""Did I know? Why do you think I fell in love with him, Sweetie?"" Baako asked laughingly. 

""Where do you think he went?"" Aaron asked.

""Hard to say, Aaron. He seemed really interested in some place called Jolliox, didn't he?"" Baako asked playfully.

""He sank through the deck."" Aaron argued. ""He's still on the ship."" Baako shook her head sadly.

""Probably, but will he stay here. I gave him the control he needed to deal with this. That's why I was in his head. I don't know what he's going to do now, silly goose. He's got that bitch of his in his head now. If she can't reign him in, there literally nothing he can't do. He's remembering, Aaron, and he's just getting started. Pretty soon, he's going to remember why I took his memories in the first place."" Baako warned.

""Why'd you take his memories, Baako?"" Kalala asked, pushing her into the room.

""To save his life."" She replied, all of the humor going out of the queen at the sight of Lira's host.

""Explain."" Kalala ordered.

""Daniel is two-faced. He's a Janus. He's a Gemini. He has a twin."" Baako warned.

""God dammit, speak clearly."" Aaron snapped.

""Daniel has a twin."" Baako seethed bitingly. ""He reprinted himself while he was still alive to give your precious Emperor a host to live in. That was our deal. I don't kill your Emperor, and Daniel submits to me.""

""What do you mean a host?"" Baggam asked from the floor. He was beginning to recover from Daniel's attack.

""I mean host."" Baako repeated.

""Why would Choan Vaat need a host?"" Pemphero asked.

""Because, he's a symbiote."" She replied, her smug smile re-emerging. No one said a word at first. What could they say. 

""There is no fucking way that's true."" Baggam growled.

""Well, actually . . ."" Keflan chimed in. ""That would . . . actually make a lot of sense, Sir.""

""There's no way Choan Vaat is a fucking worm."" Baggam snapped.

""He might be."" Gorjjen argued. ""I had the squire research the Emperor, Commander. What Baako says fits with what he found.""
Baggam turned on the Weapon Master like he'd just betrayed him. The look Gorjjen returned him was filled with sympathy, but that melted away in wonder once more.

""Your eye."" Gorjjen breathed, reaching out toward the Commander's face.

""What of it?"" He snapped, realizing only at the last moment that he could see out it again. 

He pawed at his face and waved his hand before it. He could see it clear as day. Baggam searched the room, spotting a reflective surface on the side of one of the machines. He hurried over and peered at his reflection. The cloudiness had gone out of the eye. It was as bright and clear as the other. As he watched, the scar tissue above his once injured eye began to sprout hair as the eyebrow regrew.

""What'd he do to me?"" Baggam asked emotionally.

""He fixed you."" Baako replied. ""As I said, nothing is beyond him now.""

3xzcgq,1,2015-12-23,Suggestions on an Internship offer ?,careernoobie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xzcgq/suggestions_on_an_internship_offer/,"I'm a fresher and recently I got an internship offer from a startup. For some background : for my degree I conceptualized and developed a very specific middleware. This startup is developing a similar concept and they happened to come across my project online. The lead developer of the startup contacted me and offered me a job to work similarly for her application. During a telephonic conversation she happened to ask me whether I was had a pay package in mind and but also conveyed that due to this startup being in the nascent stages she may not be able to pay me that well. Now my understanding is that she is open to the internship being a paid one(as per the convo),but I'm in a dilemsma how to ask for a pay. 

Confusion due to muliple factors are in play here: 
1. Being a fresher with no particular expertise, I'm not exactly sure what pay I can ask for. 
2. The founder of a startup seems to be far more experienced and more than money, I could really do with networking with such a person.
3. Being a startup, it has a potential to take off, and I'd love to be part of it in the long run. 
4. At this point of time I can sustain myself for another 6 months without pay. 

What do you advise? Do I ask for pay? How much do I ask?"
3xzcrw,5,2015-12-23,Is Java a necessity?,ThrowAway91a1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xzcrw/is_java_a_necessity/,"I've dealt with a few a internship rejections over the past few weeks from some small to mid sized SV startups (most of which contacted me first and most small) and it seems like a large part of almost every interview is hammering on Java despite me putting on my resume that I've not worked with it extensively.

My strengths lie in C++ and Python but it doesn't seem easy to find an opportunity using either without the teams they're associated with being essentially locked off exclusively to higher level devs. Is this just bad luck on my end? Is it the size of the companies that cause them to be so specific? Do I just have to start prioritizing Java a bit more? Thanks again for the help"
3xzfew,31,2015-12-23,Neckbeard and the police,uv-vis,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/3xzfew/neckbeard_and_the_police/,"So this is another good story about the NB in my life. Thankfully no innocent m'ladies were hurt in this story (Pedobeard's mom's feelings did get hurt however), and no one was sent to the friendzone.

Cast

uv-vis: Still a student at this point, going onto the 5th year of University (I know...). I took little to no part in this story aside from being a witness.

otaku1: from the name you can tell he loves japanese culture (japanese speech club, anime/game clubs etc) a good friend to this day.

asshole: Sarcastic shit disturber, but makes everyone laugh, we all love him.

nerdfriend: The one with the highest GPA, the one who never skips class and studies at least a week before an exam. Another good friend from high school.

buffguy: another friend from high school in the same year of uni as us, works out alot, really nice to all his friends.

Pedobeard: Typical neckbeard behaviour. Typing everything wrong with him gets repetitive (Sorry!)

So it was the summer of the end of my 4th year of university. At this point sad to say most of us were still in school. I had switched from a bio-sci to a chemistry degree and had to take an extra year, because I suck and basically gave up on medical school and I liked my prospects better. Otaku1, asshole, buffguy all switched to business school doing finance or accounting (good choice), nerdfriend could have graduated but took an extra year of random courses just so he can apply to medical schools again, and Pedobeard was one year below us so he was still trying to become the doctor again.


So anyways during the summer right after we finished all our exams, we were all hella broke, so we all needed part time jobs or at least someway to pay for our spending over the summer. Ofc we all found pretty good places to work over the summer, well except me ofc, I got to wash dishes at a greasy pizza place. But anyways, Pedobeard was lazy as f*ck as usual but luckily Mombeard and Dadbeard were pretty experienced professionals and dadbeard got him hired to do admin work at an engineering firm in a suburb that's only a 10 minute drive away. This son of a fuck (no disrespect to his parents) got hooked up with an $18/hr part time job and he COMPLAINED about his parents forcing him to work and nagging him?! To put that into perspective I make just over minimum wage ($10/hr?) washing dishes, and the year before when I did a lab internship I made even less than that. So hearing him complain about almost a liveable wage kinda made me mad.


So the summer goes on as usual, we all do our things, occasionally meet for dinner/drinks, see movies. On most friday nights when we dont have to get up in the morning we all game at night together and chat over skype. So one night while we were playing together (Warcraft III Dota, this was before Dota 2 was released) we were just having a good time, when all of a sudden we hear Pedobeards parents over his mike. It wasn't very clear but the gist of the conversation was Mombeard telling him to stop gaming, he has to get up to go to work at 8AM and it was 1230AM already. Mind you, I love my parents, but nagging does bother me also, but Mombeard was pretty reasonable here, if I were him I would have just said ""okay sorry mom!, last game and I'll go to bed"". However Pedobeard decides to stand up and give out a really long annoyed SIGH and proceed to yell ""Go away! I can do whatever I want! I don't care if I don't wake up early for work!"" At this point we were all really uncomfortable to say the least. I was actually a little upset, people being disrespected especially when they don't deserve it is one of my pet peeves. So anyways all we hear over skype is a door slamming and then we continue awkwardly.. then 5 minutes later, we hear some loud ass yelling from dadbeard and pedobeard trying to stop him and then after a brief moment, pedobeard stops moving his character in game and then just disconnects altogether, he also disconnects from skype. We all had an idea of what happened, and turns out his dad SMASHED his laptop. He stopped coming to hang out with us, we even invite him to social gatherings but nope he never comes out, just at home being upset. According to otaku1 (otaku1, buffguy, nerdfriend live in the same neighbourhood) instead of creeping/gaming on his laptop, he spends his time on his ps3.


We all thought w/e this wont last long, his dad did feel a little bad and payed for his computer screen to get fixed, it just took 3 weeks to ship back and forth. So fast forward to the next week on a Friday. A few months back, I started seeing someone, so I was home late after dropping off m'lady and I had missed most of our nightly gaming session. I checked skype and it turns out no one was talking to eachother, so I thought it was a little strange. I messaged otaku1 and asked if he was up to play a few rounds, and his response was, ""Pedobeard is the biggest f*ckin idiot I have met in my entire life"". So what else is new? So after asking what was up, turns out this retard had an arguement at dinner, his parents expected him to be more productive and comment on how he is so miserable without games and internets, and would it kill him to go out and play some sports or some shit. You can probably imagine how the arguement went. At some point Pedobeard tried to just walk out the door, and then his parents blocked off the door saying that he can't just run away from this discussion. And then Pedobeard went up to his room and called the POLICE on his parents (apparently for forcibly confining him). Anyways he ran out to otaku1's place and told him what happened at his front door and asked if he could stay over (his parents and siblings were on extended vacations in different places again) he basically said ""fuck off"" and slammed his door. The next place he went to was nerdfriend's place, he was really uncomfortable, but he didn't like refusing friends so he let him stay there meanwhile but not the night. Otaku also told me he wanted to get everyone together to have an impromptu meeting to discuss his feelings (pity party) at a McDonalds. So nerdfriend called me and said, ""Hey wanna go to get Mcdonalds! Everyone's going!"" (he didn't know that otaku1 told me everything). My response was, ""I don't know, a group of hooligans at McDonalds at 1Am? Someone might call the Police"". And of course he was on speaker phone so Pedobeard could lurk. All I heard was an aggravated ""OH MY GOD!"" and then nerdfriend saying, I should probably go.


So anyhoo fast forwarding to the next morning, talking to Otaku about the McDonalds meeting (all hearsay from this point, I had Pizza and 1.5 servings of dessert earlier and I would have been updated on Pedobeard later anyways). Apparently Asshole was being a giant dick to Pedobeard telling him to calm the fuck down and that his parents were pretty reasonable/patient with him. Pedobeard, being the arrogant motherlover he is, told everyone to go fuck themselves etc. Buffguy, who thought Pedobeard had gotten kicked out and was really sympathetic and offered to let him stay over unconditionally, heard the real story and changed his mind and told him to go fuck off as well. So in the end after they all tried reasoning with him, they were all labeled bullies and ignorant for not understanding or sympathizing with him, apparently we had no real feelings or our lives were so much better than his (???). Pedobeard went home almost right after McD and the police recommended counseling for the family.


-fin-

EDIT: the formatting before made it impossible to read. 

Also to add a TLDR: Pedobeard's dad rages and smashes his computer because Pedobeard is being himself. And later Pedobeard calls the police to arrest his parents because he feels like his human rights have been violated."

3xzyeb,3,2015-12-23,I would like advice on some thoughts I have on my questioning and also about friend/romantic interest and a fear of other peoples reaction on my actions.,MaiaNOvA,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3xzyeb/i_would_like_advice_on_some_thoughts_i_have_on_my/,"So for about 2-3 years now I have been questioning whether I am female. I have taken steps to figure this out by posting a few questions here (other accounts) and also seeing a therapist (including group sessions guided by the same therapist). All new clothes I buy are from the women's section (mostly via the internet, although a few weeks ago I bought a shirt and scarf with my sister). 

I live in the Netherlands and am going to start my ""diagnostic"" phase in January. 

The thing is, I am still not 100% sure. Yes I have taken all the above steps, but there is still this feeling that I am not actually a woman. That because of an emotionless puberty (lost in gaming, no real friends, etc.) and being depressed (I believe), that being transgender is like a fantasy where I can be happy (I can't find another way to describe this right now) 

I also don't feel physical dysphoria (besides not liking body hair). I know this isn't a requirement or anything, but it is a cause for more doubt.

Another thing is that the friends I did have in the past where always male (also never had a relationship with a woman even though I am into women) and the 1 female I am friends with..... is more of a friend by relation (girlfriend of 1 guy in the group). 

Recently though I have become somewhat closer to a girl from school who is doing her internship at the same place as me. She is a very nice person and I feel really comfortable talking with her...more so than with maybe any other person I know. 

However I can't tell the difference between liking a girl as a friend or something more and/or if I would want to look like that (so envy, i think?). 
I might be able to figure this out, but I would like to talk to someone about this.... Specifically with the girl I just mentioned, however she is the 1 person I can't really talk with about this, because it concerns her. (Do I just want to be close friends with her or do I like her as well. It really could be either one.)
How do I go about this, what do I do?


Another thing, I recently got access to some LSD. I used it with friends and had a mixed experience of mostly fun and a few bad moments. The bad being really afraid of the others seeing me do something and judging it in a bad way. Even though I know they are maybe the least judgmental people you can meet (2 of them were aware of my questioning). I already knew that a big part of why I am afraid of transitioning (besides the doubt) is that I am afraid what others will think and do (not just in relation to transition). Which was now confirmed to be true even among friends (although amplified by the LSD)
I adapt my way of talking and adapt my responses to what I believe the other person wants to hear (to a certain extent). 
How do I stop being afraid and stop adapting my way of talking to suit what I think they want to hear? 


I apologize for the long wall of text, I hope it isn't to much of a mess. 
Thank you for any insights you might have and feel free to ask me questions."

3y02qt,47,2015-12-23,Where I imagine they are now...,autumn-solace,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/3y02qt/where_i_imagine_they_are_now/,"I'm doing my 9 millionth re-watch of the series and I've been entertaining myself with imagining where some of our beloved characters have ended up. I'd love to hear what you think happened to them. This can be as silly as you'd like. Beware because there might be some spoilers in here. 

First I'll start with our favorite and most missed around here, Joe the bartender. I imagine that Joe and Walter are married and have a newly adopted baby. They got the phone call in the middle of the night and Joe had to sell the bar rather abruptly because owning a bar working those hours wouldn't allow him to be the kind of dad he wanted to be. They moved to Vermont where they own a bed and breakfast. 

Izzy Stevens - In my mind she became an OB/GYN surgeon with a special focus in gynecological oncology. She has learned some distance but still does on occasion get too close to her patients. She's divorced for the second time because she's a combative super bitch. Her divorce caused her to move clear across the country, she now works in New Jersey. She has a cat. It barely tolerates her. 

Leah Murphy - She's on the cutting edge in cancer research. While she didn't have the chops for surgery, her extremely competitive side has made her an exceedingly talented researcher. She's on the edge of a breakthrough. She's finally found the one for her - he's a super sweet reformed Mormon who pays her full attention. 

Intern Steve Mostow and Wife Meagan - Steve finally conquered those nerves and butterfingers and has become a neurologist - after all, he does have the hair for it. Meagan got pregnant for the second time during her residency and has since dropped out of the program to pursue being the best mom she can be. 

Nurse Olivia - She contracted a case of fatal extreme bitch syndrome and has succumbed to her illness. RIP in pieces Olivia. 

Eli - Eli now runs the nursing staff in a hospital in San Fransisco. His focus on patient care has earned him much recognition. In a hilarious parody of his relationship with Bailey, he's now married to the chief of surgery at his San Fransisco hospital. He was made head nurse (or whatever they're called) long before he met his wife, nepotism was never a factor in the decision. He helped save the mayor's life and to recognize his excellence in patient care was given the key to the city of San Fransisco.

Nurse Debbie - Nurse Debbie has long since retired. She occasionally picks up shifts at a local nursing home like many retired nurses tend to do. She's just welcomed her sixth grandchild into the world. Her husband died long ago which left her bitter. Her daughter bought her tickets for a singles cruise where she met Mr. Right (who is a passionate Pomeranian breeder) and is now truly happy. It is rumored that she is now seen smiling in her personal life. 

Shane Ross - He became a kick ass Cardio God like Christina, his mentor. They were sleeping together for a few years, both just trying to fill the gap in their lives. Shane then met a really cute Swiss girl who is bubbly yet morbid whom he fell completely head over heels for. He's since broken it off with Christina and is happily married without children.   

Sadie - She became a pathologist because she's way too much of a psychopath to be allowed near living patients. Her daddy pulled some strings and landed her a job somewhere in south Florida.

Sydney Heron - Sydney Heron is now in sunny Arizona where the people are a little perkier than Seattle. She was considering a paeds fellowship but found that even children were put off with her super cheerful nature. She has become the best God damn urology surgeon this side of Catherine Avery. Men are confidant that their junk is in the right hands when they encounter someone that exhaustingly happy. 

Robbins leg - It was cast aside roughly and tossed into the closet as Arizona grew another in it's place. She is the first known human this has ever happened to. No one knows this has happened besides you, me, Arizona, and the leg. It is rumored at Grey Sloan Memorial that she never even lost her leg. 

Who did I miss? What do you think happened to our favorite missing characters?"

My initial are : GG
Both works as a signature (i put an example on how i used my logo for now)

My own opinion is that the first one is more original and have more sense into it (this is my current logo) but is not that nice looking, the second is way more better looking, and it is a lettrage i have done myself (i really like to do this, so i thought maybe i should do a G in lettrage) but it is more common.

I was told on here that I should wait until after I get my bachelors to worry about getting my remaining credits for the CPA, and getting internships and a job should be my main priority before the CPA as well.

I also know about the changing state licenses but it seems its not a difficult thing to change between states. My main concern is about trying to get a job on the west coast, preferably California. I live on the east coast and have always wanted to move over there but I've barely been out of state as it is. Have any accountants who have moved across a great distance within the U.S., or even across countries, had any issues with making the transition?

I'm about half way to my bachelor's so I still got about 2 years to go but honestly if it wasn't for college, I would have made the move to the west coast by now. I've also considered Boston and Philadelphia. I just really need a change once I'm done with school. Also, say I do end up getting a job out of state but don't finish my remaining credits for the CPA, is there anyway I can still cheaply go to school? I know colleges around me say you have to live here a certain amount of time before being considered in state so I feel like that could mess me up if I try going back to school in another state.

I guess this also includes anyone whos moved out of state for a job so any insight pertaining job interviews, moving, and anything else would be great."

3y0xu8,15,2015-12-23,Why aren't we talking about Jessica Jones?!,mynameis4826,Earth199999,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earth199999/comments/3y0xu8/why_arent_we_talking_about_jessica_jones/,"So, I've recently had been interning at Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz (really high class lawyers in New York), and one of the partners, Jeri Hogarth, basically has contracted a superhero or whatever to work for us.  Her name is Jessica Jones , and while she looks pretty normal, she's wicked strong and has a nasty temper.  From what I've gathered, she works as a private eye for Alias Investigations, a detective agency in the Hell's Kitchen Area.

Me, being curious as hell, decided to do some private sleuthing on Jessica.  She was directly related to those recent cases of mind-control, setting up a support group for people who had been forced to do the mind-controller's bidding.  She basically takes no precautions with her powers (we have a running tally on the windows she smashes whenever she visits Hogarth), and doesn't use a superhero moniker or wear a costume or anything.  Also, she doesn't seem to have any contact with SHIELD or anyone big, as she lives and works out of this shitty apartment in Hell's Kitchen.

My question is, why the hell isn't anyone talking about her?!  Here we have a superhero walking around New York, just using her powers out in the open with no attempt to conceal her identity, and NO ONE'S COVERING IT.  The leaked S.H.I.E.L.D. files don't seem to have anything on her, but there's this one weird military company that keeps popping up in her history.  I've been trying to talk to people around the office, but they just keep pushing me aside, or straight-up warning me not to investigate further.

EDIT: Welp, somehow word got to Hogarth that I was sticking my nose where it shouldn't have been, and I've lost my internship.  All in the name of the truth, huh guys?

EDIT #2: So, I've been delving deeper into the case, taking with various people who've been in contact with Jessica Jones. Her neighbours seem pretty reluctant to spill the beans (though there was this one chick who looked like she really wanted to talk), but there was this one lady that messaged me from Florida who was a total goldmine for info. Apparently, she was a client for the firm I was working at, and was advised to hire Jessica Jones to keep tabs on her husband. She claimed that Jones has around a hundred contacts in the NYC area that are, shall we say, similarly gifted. My contact seemed pretty hysterical, so I don't know how much of that to believe; however, it's pretty safe to say that Jones has at least met and keeps in contact with other superhumans. I'm currently trying to find people involved with the Killgrave incident that would be willing to talk about their interactions with Miss Jones. I'll keep you guys posted.

EDIT #3: HOLY SHIT, I'VE JUST HAD A BIG BREAK, GUYS. So after I had gotten a hold of one of the regular members of the Killgrave support group, and she led me to believe that Jones and Hogarth had recently had a falling out (this was news to me, since Hogarth always acted so protective of Jones).  Just asking Hogarth what was up is kind of out of the question, so I decided to talk to Hogarth's former secretary to see what she knew. After a bit of coaxing (and a sizable amount of yule tide beverages), she started taking about Hogarth's relationship with Jones. This lady was paranoid as Hell, apparently -- she kept a file on every case she every had Jones work, including the police cases Jones has been involved in. What particularly struck my interest was Hogarth's obsession with some firm known as IGH -- the same firm that keeps showing up on Jones' history.  I'll see if I can pull just one more Christmas miracle and get a hold of those files! I'll keep you guys posted!"

3y11tt,1,2015-12-23,Transitioning from Teaching and Job Skills,jobhelparu,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3y11tt/transitioning_from_teaching_and_job_skills/,"Hello fellow Redditors.

This will be a long one. 

Like many on this sub, I am looking to switch up my career and would love to hear from those that have successfully done so. 

The important info:

29 years old

Education:
B.A. English Language and Literature
M.Ed English Education

Participated in no extra-curricular activities or internships as I have been working full-time since I have been legally allowed to. 

Relevant Job Experience:
3 years as a high school teacher (AP Literature mostly)
3 years as director of an independent learning center

I have no network to speak of beyond a couple really good references.

The Dilemma:
Right now, I'm a maybe above-average fish in a small pond. I'd like to move to a bigger pond. Partially for salary--I've been stuck in the low $50k range for these past 6 years--and partially because I'm bored. The main issue at hand is that I'm having a lot of trouble marketing myself.

I've done good work in both of these roles. I've had lots of great observations and feedback from supervisors as a teacher, and I've worn a lot of hats as a director, but I can't help but feel that I don't have much in the way of notable accomplishments to make myself stand out. 

Additionally, the skills I have are of the less tangible, and seemingly less appreciable, kind. I'm good at research and communicating difficult ideas; I'm empathetic and great at build rapport in an instructional or conference setting; I have great public speaking skills and little stage fright; but lots of people are like that. I feel like I need some more hard skills to bank on. 

To compound the issue, I have (as I'm sure many do) a fair amount of student debt and little savings, making additional training extremely difficult. 

I would like to work in a somewhat creative capacity for a larger organization than my current one, which is about as small an operation as it gets. 

Careers I am interested in:

* Assessment/Curriculum development
* Digital lesson/content creation
* Data Analysis for an educational organization
* Writing in almost any context
* Other related jobs

Since there should be a question: How can I make myself more immediately marketable and actively work towards progressing my career? What kinds of steps are even viable options for me?

I've done two internships, one school project, and one personal project for web development and all four have been done a different way (Java Spring, CGI scripting, standard html/css/javascript/php). I'm confused what the ""best"" way of making a website is, and by best I mean the most scalable. One person told me that serving static html with ajax is the best, but my job told me not to do that and use cgi scripting mixed with ajax for ""lazy loading"", because ajax is for action, not content. 

How do places like Facebook make websites? I want to learn the best way. Please don't comment about frameworks. I'm fairly new so I want to learn solid foundations."

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! Also, would anyone be interested in seeing the entire list of movies (some I saw more than once) and possibly some compiled stats based on time, day of the week, and 2D/3D/IMAX? I'd be happy to provide that, and maybe some proof. Would a picture of my stack of stubs suffice?

I don't know my team yet so I don't know what type of language I'll be working with or the type of project I'll be dealing with. 

I know people work and learn in different ways but if there are any helpful tips and tricks please let me know!

**reel**

[pondering](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5194) is an orchestral track I wrote which reflects some of the dramatic documentary music I've been obsessed with the past few months. Although geared more towards film, this track shows my technique in orchestration and composition. 

[woods](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5193) is my kokiri forest inspired track. I heard that some of my tracks sound like Zelda, so why not make a Zelda inspired track?

[to the old witch's hut](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5192) is another cinematic styled orchestral track. I forget what the exact inspiration for this track is, but it reminds me of trekking through a forest. 

[title theme](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5190) is a piano piece I composed to imitate a jrpg title screen. It's a nice simple song and I love writing these kinds of melodies. This style can be translated to 8-bit pretty easily for that nostalgic retro soundtrack.  

[polar bear vacation](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5270) is a fun, laid back electronic track with lots of samples and synths.

 Summary: This is a thread about how i started opening girls by winning over my negative beliefs. I wrote it as evidence, that people can overcome their negative beliefs.

Body: Since it is my first post i will write a bit about myself, main post will follow in the next paragraph so feel free to skip this one. I am 26 yo, I finished my universities studies a couple years ago , got a shitty job at H&amp;M folding clothes quited after
2 months. After that i decided to play poker for a living. I was already playing poker casualy and thought maybe i would take it to the next level. In the past i used to run underground games
, boy the money was good and really easy. Been playing for 2 years now, i also have decided to pursue an MBA in finance this September and study for the actuarial exam P in order to become an actuary.
 Used to be an incel in highschool medium grades training all day , i was into sports, but not many friends. Also i struggled with a porn and masturbation habit. At some point i decided to stop that
and beat what i had thought at that time was approach anxiety. I took the decision seriously , i am on my way of beating my beliefs even though i haven't beat all of them.Been reading here for some time but still i have a lot of work to do.
 Now to the main post.
 
 I was out in the night a couple days ago. We were 3 friends, a good friend of mine and his friend. We were at a club, at that club everyone knows us the barmen, the bouncers etc. we get free 
drinks and stuff. I was there with the intention of having fun and if i like something maybe open it up. I was drinking my second round of vodka having fun and and the same time because night clubs are a place where my negative thoughts go on overdrive i was also 
writing down the negatice pop ups that came out in order to work with them.
After a while i noticed two girls that just came next two us.I really liked one of them. I wanted to talk to her but something stoped me from it. At some point my friend something told to them, it 
was really efortless from his side ( both friends are Alpha by the way). I told myself, "" if am not gonna open them i will beat the shit out of me when i go back home, i am tired of that situation""
 A couple seconds pass. And i open both of them
 Me: ""We haven't met. What are your names?""
Them: "" I am x , i am y. ""
Me "" nice to know you ""
-I don't remember how exactly it went after that, the main thing to remember is that over the next couple of hours i talked to them both but, not too much while also having fun with my friends,
 and a some points i focused on the girl i liked.-
 Me -to the girl i like- : Where are you from?
Her: I am from that place and now i am studying here while i also do my internship in the mornings""
Me to the other friend: "" How do you know each other?""
Her: She proceeds to tell me.

 Then i stop talking to them ,and just having fun dancing and drinking with my friends.
At some point i start too feel that i have drunk too much and need some fresh air i go out, and come back after 5 minutes or so. Then after some time. I talk to the girl i like. She was just sitting alone, relaxing or something.
Me: ""You look bored""
Her: ""I am not bored i am just tired i have been working all day""
Me: ""Ok ""

Now after some time the music stops the place was closing. The other friend had already left with two women. And my friend tells me ""hey, let's go"". I reply ok. Then i proceed getting my phone out
and saying to the girl ""Give me your phone number so we can talk some other time"" 
Note:Before i even asked for the number she took the phone from my hands and started writing the number.
I say goodbye to her and her friend. Talk a bit to the barwoman and proceed to go.

That's it more or less.
 Overall i think the interaction was a bit chopy, i need more practice i guess. But still it was a big step for me. The think is that i was talking to them every 10 minutes or so. I don't know, any insights?

 Now i am planning on the date, the venues we will go,the logistics and stuff, i have some stress. Been reading on Ask Trp about first dates and escalating. Any tips about that?

 About the negative beliefs,i read a couple of books about them, what i do now, i really take notice of what i say to myself,what comes to mind in situations that bring out negative beliefs and reading everything i can on that matter.



Lessons: It is possible to overcome self imposed limitations and start getting the life you want. Thank you."

...develop more quickly to fill in and improve the basics? Why can I still not rename multiple files together? Why is the photo viewer still total crap and can't be replaced as the default app by something else?

...tell us transparently so we have faith in the future of the OS what the hell is going on with the crOS touch UI, the cancelled crOS touch Pixel C, the oddly crappy (as in ""Jeez, I don't know. Maybe put some of those summer interns on the UI?"") snail's-pace Material redesign of crOS, and the Android-crOS merger/non-merger (aka, what the hell is that gonna be, or does no one even have a clue what will work yet?)

...what percentage of google employees use crOS as their main OS?

...design the menu with reference to quick accessibility rather than ""ancient"" Windows menus. For example, why 2 clicks to turn on bluetooth, etc? Why not on the first click? Why not directly on the shelf so zero clicks to get there? Why a tiny vertical Windows-like menu, not a large block with the settings I need, just like a full-screen system menu on Android. And let me modify it to add whatever I need there from almost anywhere in the system?

...have widgets for the desktop? A huge desktop and all I can put on it is ... nothing whatsoever??

...filters everywhere, like the one in Settings, especially when bookmarking or anywhere we have to choose a folder?

...work more closely with the Drive team and others so basic functions are consistent? Basically, why doesn't Google kick some butt in the Drive dep't so we no longer have to deal with Drive NOT having the endlessly convenient ctrl-enter to rename files? or NOT using the same search terms as Gmail? or NOT having a clue about column sorting? (""You mean sort by only 1-2 random columns, so it's different every view but almost always useless? Great idea, let's go with that! Larry hates sorting, I heard."") Etc."
3y2omo,1,2015-12-24,TIFU (I'm about too) by confronting a crush with things she said about me,ForcadoUALG,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3y2omo/tifu_im_about_too_by_confronting_a_crush_with/,"Well, probably this is an issue brought many times to this sub (boy likes girl; girl doesn't like boy; boy confesses to the girl; friendship ruined), but I'm still in the need to bring this up to someone.

I've met this girl a few years back, while on college (I was in my final year, she was in her second year), we weren't really close at all, and we met just because we had friends in common - actually, I was dating a friend of hers. When I graduated, I immediately got into a big company here, and one year later, my boss told me that I could get someone to work with me, as an intern. So, I asked a few friends if they wanted the job, and that girl answered in a very positive way. We then started to talk more, and getting to know each other, and eventually she came to work with me. We've been working together for roughly 16 months.

And now starts the whole friendship / friendzone dilemma. I'm not the most atractive guy in the world (not at all, trust me), and she's kinda cute - also, not the biggest beauty in the world - but I'm really into her. She's super nice, we have some things in common, and we make a hell of a team. But she's not into me at all. 

One day, when she was sick at home, I had to check her e-mail, if any important thing had arrived, and made a pretty scumbaggy thing: I went into Chrome, and Facebook loaded, into her account. And I went to read some of the conversations she had with my best friend (also works in the company). And I felt really bad doing it, but some of the things I read were really unpleasant, and outright mean. I was in shock. Questioning my sexuality, calling me a jerk and a bi-polar person, and making things on purpose just to make me feel bad.

This happened 2 or 3 months ago. But every day that passes, we are spending more and more time together (I usually sleep in her house from time to time, when we go to a movie or a concert), and I feel a urge in me to confront her with that situation. The awkward part: although the things she said, I still like her, and still have a great crush on her.

I'd like to hear some thoughts on this.

**TL;DR: I ""accidentaly"" read some mean things a co-worker (also a crush) said about me, and I'm having a strange urge that I should talk to her about it, and ultimately confess my feelings to her.** "

Here it is near impossible to find a job, either you hang around as an intern at microsoft/nokia/kone for years on end, work at a startup for nearly nothing, or get a better wage as a cleaner. For those that do land CS jobs, most I know get about 2500 dollars a month. I've jumped around several short term contracts myself.

So the question is, if I decide to go back to the states, how/where do I start looking? what are my chances of landing work before arriving? how do salaries look?

I know I would be giving up an enormous amount of benefits, that's understood. The absolute one thing I would have an incredibly hard time giving up is the minimum 6 weeks vacation. paid or unpaid, is this an impossible proposition?

I'll try to provide some background and give you guys an in-depth view of how things went, and maybe you can see whether i took a bad turn or i should've seen it coming

I've met her about 9 months ago while i was on a project in her country, back then i was in a relationship with someone else so i didn't really feel for her or anything. Fast forrward couple months and we start talking more and more. The more i talked to her the more i was realising thats how i've always imagined my SO would be.

Now, i have been in quite some relationships but i've never felt so.. connected with someone on so many topics and aspects of life. Shes this kind and caring, nerdy type of girl, really good at both listening and communicating. As far as i know she had a long relationship but broke up a year or two ago.


We start speaking more and more, and i'm able to flirt with her responding positively. She keeps telling me on how i should come see her and even tho i'm trying to keep cool, its all i'm thinking about. One night being a bit tipsy texts me on how much she talks to her friends about me and wants to see me. You can see where this is going.


Even tho i wanted so freaking bad to go see her and i was so falling for her, i always felt a bit scared of commiting.


Fun part starts here, two weeks ago i get an offer for an internship from her country and the same city as well. And that was it, i quit my job, canceled my xmas plans and booked a flight.I was all in. Nervous as heck but there i was, going for it. Now i've never commited so hard in my life to just one single thing. But i was happy.


**Now is where the downhill begins.**


The first week i had to attend some meetings and formal stuff so i could in no way meet up with her. On saturday i get to leave from a party early, already had some beers on board and i was feeling just great. I ask her to have a few drinks, she's responding super positively, gives me her address and there i go in a cab to her place.


Apparently she thought i was joking about the whole thing and didn't expect me one moment to actually come. She thought i was joking about the whole coming to her country as well. Things get a little awkward..but ok.. we head off to a shop grab some beer. We get home and start talking for quıte a few hours about random things. Now i know when something goes bad.. And that night it wasn't the case. In fact for some reason i was somehow expecting her to say something. But nothin happened.


Anyways few days later i'm texting her and she just shruggs me off, saying shes all busy. (shes in exam period; i graduated)
Reddit, did i somehow fucked this up? Did i flew in with way too high expectations on how things would go? Was she just a tease?


TL;DR: Flew to another country to meet crush; ended up being shrugged off. How should i react?

I'm a junior in high school and a couple friends that are in college came back to my programming class and talked about college and them trying internships and jobs with their coed programs. I really like the stuff we do in my class, solving problems together (and dicking around a little too much). I was thinking of going into a business intelligence or predictive analyst job, but I'm afraid that those jobs and even developer jobs are ""code monkey jobs"" where your boss tells you to crank out code.

Thanks!"
3y3g2p,2,2015-12-24,Side Projects - Where to begin?,jacketsontop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3y3g2p/side_projects_where_to_begin/,"backstory: I am currently in my fourth year of college, however I only switched to CS last year. I spent most of my fall semester applying to literally every CS internship I could find. Ended up getting a few phone interviews, and one on site final-round interview. I wound up not getting the on-site one, and they told me ""they want me to have more experience, then I can reapply for next summer"". After many more failed attempts, I've accepted an internship in the spring at a fairly large, non-software-based company for software development. Its not a stellar internship, but I'm happy with it. Everyone always stresses the importance of side projects when applying for internships and jobs, but as a change-of-major student in CS, I sometimes feel like I'm behind and not sure where to start. I have a great GPA, solid extracurriculars, and now I finally have a software internship, so I feel like the area of side projects is the one thing I have missing that my fellow students can hold over me. 

My questions is, where do I begin with side projects? I definitely want to do them, I just have no clue where to start. I've started to do a few tutorials on android programming since I know java from school, and I also have messed around with basic HTML and CSS and built a basic personal website. I know java pretty well and I've taught myself the basics of python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. "

I have two more years left until graduation and I was wondering what steps I would have to take to be as attractive as I can be to US tech firms.

I'm completely fluent in English, so I'm not worried about any sort of language barrier. But I am worried that since I am graduating from a school that's outside the US, I will have a hard time being hired and sponsored for a visa. I used to go to a school in the US but I had to transfer to a Korean school due to financial issues.

My plan right now is this: 1. Take as many relevant/advanced courses I can next year. 2. Work on developing a portfolio. 3. Apply for tech internships in my country (hopefully Google).

But I'm not really sure what else to do aside from all that, nor do I know whether doing all that will even make me a viable candidate for US tech firms. It'd be great if you guys can give me some advice and point me in the right direction. I feel very lost.

Also, I wasted a few years of my twenties because I had to go to the military (two years) and worked as an English instructor (needed the money). I'll probably be about 30~31 when I graduate. I know that's a big minus in the tech industry =/."

Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.  
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.  
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my speciality."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.  
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal cow, after all.""  
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.  
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
  
""And if they misbehave?""  
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
  
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste.  
  
""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".  
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the ceiling.  
  
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

Opposing quarterbacks have put up a 96.2 cumulative quarterback rating against the Redskins' secondary this season, including a 122.6 by QB **Sam Bradford** the first time the two teams met this season.|
Last week, QB **Kirk Cousins** completed 22 passes - including four touchdowns - for 319 yards in the Redskins' 35-25 victory over the Bills. In doing so, Cousins (336) broke the Redskins' single-season completion record which was previously held by QB **Jason Campbell** (327) and set in the 2009 season.|
If only Washington had more home games - QB **Kirk Cousins** led the Redskins to a 6-2 record at FedExField this season, and his passing numbers at home (2170 yards, 16 TDs, 2 INTs, 117.0 rating) are much better than his road numbers (1455 yards, 6 TDs, 9 INTs, 74.6 rating). Cousins now owns the franchise single-season records for most passing yards at home, surpassing QB **Jay Schroeder**, who passed for 2111 yards at home in 1986. Cousins's completion percentage at home (74.7 percent) is the highest single-season mark in home games in NFL history by a player who threw at least 75 passes at home.|
QB **Kirk Cousins** currently leads the NFL witha 69.7 completion percentage.|
WR **DeSean Jackson** makes his second visit to Philadelphia since signing with Washington after the Eagles cut him before last season.  Jackson has nine catches for 243 yards and one TD in two games against the Eagles. He was injured and did not play against the team earlier in the 2015 season.|

Milestones|
:---:|
TE **Brent Celek** (368) needs four catches to pass **Keith Byars** (371) for fifth place and six receptions to pass **Pete Pihos** (373) for fourth in Eagles history.|
TE **Brent Celek** (4,657) can move into 8th place on the Eagles all-time recieving list with 115 more yards.  He would pass WR **Ben Hawkins** (4,764) and WR **Jeremy Maclin** (4,771).|
RB **Darren Sproles** (17,794) needs 206 more all-purpose yards to reach 18,000 career all-purpose yards.  Additionally, Sproles is 375 all-purpose yards away from moving into the NFL's top 10 all time list.|
WR **Pierre Garcon** (5,898) needs 102 more yards to reach 6,000 career receiving yards.|
WR **DeSean Jackson** (49) needs 1 touchdown to reach 50 career touchdowns.|
LB **Ryan Kerrigan** (46.5) needs 3.5 sacks to reach 50 career sacks.|
QB **Kirk Cousins** (40)  needs 1 more touchdown to take sole possession of 10th place on the Redskins all-time touchdown list. He currently shares 10th place with QB **Robert Griffin**.| 
RB **Alfred Morris** (1042) needs 2 rushing attempts to pass RB **Terry Allen** (1043) to take 5th place on the Redskins all-time rushing attempts list.|
WR **Jamison Crowder** (52) needs 2 receptions to pass **Charley Taylor** (53 in 1964) for third-most receptions by a rookie in Redskins history.|
The Redskins could win their 600th game in team history, including postseason play. Washington would be the fifth NFL franchise to reach the 600-win mark.  They would joint the Bears, Packers, Giants and Steelers.|

Matchups to Watch|
:---:|
**Redskins WR DeSean Jackson vs. Eagles secondary**|
The Eagles are going to have to double team Jackson all game. He'll probably see a lot of rookie cornerback Eric Rowe, with help over the top from either Malcolm Jenkins or Walter Thurmond. The way to handle the mercurial Jackson is to get a jam on him at the line, play physical with him and basically just knock him off his routes. It's a tough test for the rookie.|
**Redskins LB Ryan Kerrigan vs. Eagles LT Jason Peters:**|
Kerrigan, with eight-and-a-half sacks, leads the Redskins in that category and is the key to the team's pass rush. Coordinator Joe Barry will move Kerrigan from side to side and he'll stand up and put his hand on the ground. More times than not he'll line up over Peters and the left tackle will have to show he's worthy of the Pro Bowl berth he received earlier this week.|
**Redskins OL vs. Eagles blitz**|
The Redskins have kept Cousins clean most of the year, allowing just 24 sacks, the sixth lowest total in the league. In a loss to Dallas three weeks ago the Cowboys blitzed like crazy and caused some trouble for Cousins. The Eagles need to copy the plan and get after him the same way. This is going to be a game of wits on both sides and the Eagles coaching staff better be on top of their game.|

3y47e7,5,2015-12-24,"Question about a short, personal letter with resume.",Uhfolks,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3y47e7/question_about_a_short_personal_letter_with_resume/,"Edit: Thanks for the responses so far!! I'm planning on taking out any mention of my girlfriend &amp; adding in more about a few specific reasons I think I would be a great fit.

**~If you want to skip the background information, my question is at the bottom of the post**

I'm going into my last semester of my Senior year, which means job hunting is in full swing for me. I've attended this semester's career fair &amp; landed multiple interviews. But none of these places are where I necessarily ""want"" to be. Multiple reasons: location, the job itself, etc...

Long story short, my girlfriend of 3 years lives in a small town I'll simply call ""Town"" for sake of privacy. She already has a great job she loves there, plus a majority of her family lives there. Obviously, she wants to remain in Town for these reasons, but is willing to move if I absolutely can't get a job nearby.

I'd love to live in Town, but it has a small problem. There is only one plant that employs Chemical Engineers &amp; it is not somewhere I'd want to work. The main reason is that they've had multiple *major* safety incidents in the past few years that have resulted in deaths.... so I'd rather not end up there.

But good news! A new plant from a very well respected company is opening soon &amp; is actively seeking engineers. Not only that, but the job description is almost down to the letter what I've done in all 4 of my internships. They have 17 bullet points of ""Job Functions"" &amp; I've extensively done all but one of those in my previous positions.

Essentially, I sincerely believe I'd be a perfect fit. Not only because it's exactly where I want to be, so there aren't any worries of me moving off in a year or two like a lot of young engineers seem to. But also because I feel very confident the projects I've already worked on &amp; excelled in line up perfectly with what they're looking for.

Now for the problems... The Job description asks for 1-3 years of industrial experience. I've always heard to apply for these types of jobs even if you don't have the length of experience they're looking for, but it still worries me that I only have 4 summers of experience (So *technically* a year, but not what I’d truly consider a year of experience). Also, my GPA is definitely not the highest. It's sitting at a 2.82 currently. As many hours as I have under my belt by this point I don't expect that to change by more than .1 up or down in a semester's time. I had a really rough start, but my grades have steadily increased since then &amp; I can furnish the individual semester grades to back that up.

~`~

Now, finally, my actual question.

Would it be considered unprofessional or ill-advised to include a short ""cover letter"" of sorts with my resume? Something to the effect of:

""My name is X and while I'll let my resume communicate my specific qualifications and experience, I wanted to include a personal letter as to why I sincerely want to work for {their company name}.

My girlfriend of over 3 years is employed locally and loves Town, as well as her job. I've been searching for opportunities in the area and your soon to be opened plant is essentially an answered prayer. Not only is the location exactly where I want to spend the rest of my life, the job description is an almost identical match to the experience I've gained in 4 summers working for {Company} as an intern.

If nothing else, I'd ask you to please consider bringing me in for an interview. I realize a few short paragraphs and a resume are not enough to convey how great of a match that not only I would be for the company, but the company would be for me. I apologize if this letter is slightly unusual, but of all the companies I've interviewed with or looked into leading up to graduation, yours is the first I've truly felt I would be a perfect fit in.

Sincerely,

Uhfolks""

I wanted to keep it as short as possible, because I know an inordinately long letter would have the chance of either not getting read, or even hurting my chances."

I'm in my junior year and am currently applying for internships for next summer. However, due to pursuing the CS track relatively late (I had just made the decision to do so at the start of this semester), I don't have any side projects under my belt, just the Java and C++ knowledge I got from classes as well as an understanding of data structures. I don't know what to say about past experiences or expertise, or what my chances are of even obtaining internship positions. If there is anyone here who has been in a similar position as me, could you please tell me your stories? I feel lost and need some help.

I'm majoring in Computer Information Systems and so far have worked at two comic book stores, interned with an IT team at a marketing company, and currently host at a restaurant. I LOVED the internship but these other jobs are meh but none of which I have been employed at for more than 5 months. 

Maybe it's just the part time/retail/food jobs I don't like to stick around at but even at that IT job I don't see myself there for more than 4 years if I were to ever get a job there. Basically I like fresh environments and change. I know a few people, my dad included, who have been somewhere for 10+ years and get amazing benefits (cudoos to them really) but I just don't see myself doing that.  I want to work in a variety of IT jobs when I get older from consulting to higher up management positions. 

Is this a normal thing to strive for? Would jumping around a lot make it harder to move up the ladder? (Most of the time I talk to professionals they got to their boss or management position after being with a company for X amount of years).

-------------------------------------------------------

As the sun slowly starts to peek up over the treetops of Route 5, Elliot Fleet finally wraps up his marathon training session. Inspired by the Sleep Powder incident in the Power Plant, he has spent the night practicing a series of rudimentary hand signals with his Pokémon in case non-verbal communication is ever necessary again. Now, each of his four Pokémon can consistently and accurately respond to four hand signals apiece, one for each of their moves. It was hard work drilling, but the team is coming along and learning them quick. Elliot lifts his hands to get his team's attention.

*Okay, guys, that's good. Wow, I can't believe we spent the whole night out here. Huddle up, team meeting! Okay, so. A few things. First, we're gonna challenge Clemont today. I know you're all exhausted, and I am too, so we'll all get a good rest at the Center, then have a couple of hours before meeting Shauna at 5 and heading over. A little weird schedule, I know, but that's how it worked out. Any objections?*

The team shakes their heads, tired and ready to rest, but still as excited as their trainer to visit the Gym in Prism Tower.

*Next item of business...something I've kind of been dreading. After all the excitement in Coumarine City with Serena and Mr. Ramos, and then the whole thing at the Power Plant, I got distracted from doing something I said I would do. It really pains me, but I want to be true to my word. Bluebeard, I'll ask the Nurse today about the possibility of sending you to a nice Lapras Conservation, where they'll know just how to take care of you and you'll be able to be with your own kind. It's been a real joy getting to know you, but I figured you'd rather be where you belong.*

Hearing this, the sensitive Bluebeard shakes his head vigorously. Elliot looks at him tenderly as he puts his two front flippers on Molly's and Salt's feet, the Pokémon on either side of him. His eyes welling up with tears, Bluebeard keens earnestly. Seeing Molly reach out and put her arm around the Lapras' neck while Salt shakes his head and Toshi looks heartbroken, Elliot relents, feeling filled with relief.

*Alright! You want to stay with us fulltime, Bluebeard? I'm thrilled! I just wanted to make sure.*

He steps forward and hugs Bluebeard around the neck. Overcome with joy, the Lapras hops up and plants his front flippers on Elliot's chest, pushing him over and landing on top on him. He begins covering Elliot's face with Lapras kisses.

*Haha, alright, alright! Get off me, you crazy boy! I'm so glad you decided to stay.*

Still laughing, Elliot stands up and returns his companions to their Pokéballs. Backtracking to the Pokémon Center, he heals them up, then rents a room in the back and falls into bed. He is asleep before his head hits the pillow.

*

What seems like a moment later, he wakes up and looks at the alarm clock on the bedside table. It's 3:30 in the afternoon. Just enough time to wake back up and meet Shauna. After splashing cold water on his face, he heads outside and takes a walk through the streets of Lumiose to work the last of the sleep out of his system. Before he knows it, it's time to head back. In the Center lobby, he is greeted by his ebullient friend. Together, they set off to Prism Tower. They arrive in the lobby, which is pristine and uniformly white from the floor to the ceiling. On the floor is an upright sign reading ""Next Exam in 30 Minutes."" Baffled by the sign, Elliot approaches the receptionist and asks for the chance to challenge Clemont. The smiling receptionist hands him a clipboard and points to the sign. Elliot brings the clipboard to a nearby chair and sits down next to Shauna.

*What the heck is this about?*

**Oh, I forgot to tell you! Clemmy likes to test his challengers' brains before battling them, so everyone needs to sit for a little quiz on the basics of Pokémon training before heading in. Whoever scores the highest gets to battle Clemmy! The Lumiose City Gym gets the most challenges, as you can imagine, so Clemmy needs some sort of screening process, otherwise he'd be battling 24/7! Pretty fancy, huh?**

*Dang, he really doesn't mess around. A quiz huh? We'll see...*

Elliot fills out the form and submits it to the receptionist. Gradually, the Gym fills up with prospective challengers, eagerly poring over study sheets and schoolbooks. Seeing his intense competition, Elliot gulps. Just then, the receptionist stands up and announces the list of names for the next round of testing. As everyone stands and gathers in front of her desk, the elevator dings again, and Clemont's sister Bonnie marches out, flanked by her Dedenne. Both of them are wielding stout wooden rulers. In her distinctive, little-kid voice, Bonnie pipes up.

&gt; Alright, look alive, challengers! Come with me for testing!

With a comically exaggerated stern expression on her face, she herds the group of challengers, including Elliot into the elevator and, standing on tiptoe, pokes a button with her ruler. The last thing Elliot sees before the doors slide closed is Shauna waving at him and giving him a playful wink.

*(Oh man, what have I gotten myself into?)*

The elevator opens, and the challengers find themselves in a sloping lecture hall. Bonnie shoves her way to the front of the group and begins barking out instructions.

&gt; Welcome to the Amp-itheater! Take your seats, leave spaces in between, and await further instructions!

Once everyone is seated, she passes out a thick test packet to each person, then she and her Dedenne being prowling up and down the aisles, proctoring the exam.

&gt; BEGIN!

Amidst a flurry of others doing the same, Elliot flips open his test and stares at the first question.

*Oh, good...multiple choice. Let's see. ""What is the attack multiplier afforded by STAB?"" What the hell? What is STAB? Damn, I'm in way over my head...*

Elliot slogs through the test filled with technical questions and nitty-gritty aspects of training he's never considered. Heck, he just drills moves with his Pokémon until they seem satisfied, strong and confident. Is there really more to training than that? Elliot's mind is boggled by how much he does not know. Before he knows it, Bonnie is collecting test papers. She brings them to a walled-off side office in the corner of the lecture hall and shuts the door, leaving the trainers to chatter and speculate nervously. Presently, Bonnie emerges from the office looking somewhat flustered.

&gt; Challenger Elliot Fleet, come with me!

Stunned, Elliot rises and follows the petite drill-sergeant-in-the-making back into the elevator. She presses another button, and they begin whizzing upwards.

&gt; Congratulations, Mr. Fleet. You have been selected to battle my brother Clemont. He's super duper strong, so you'll need a lot of luck to beat him! And don't you forget it! 

Overcome with belligerent love for her sibling, Bonnie jabs Elliot lightly in the belly with her ruler to punctuate each word. Simultaneously smirking and wincing, Elliot resists the urge to tousle her hair, figuring she would not take kindly to such a patronizing gesture. He doesn't want to know what that ruler feels like across his face. Finally, the elevator opens once more, and Elliot faces a bizarre site: a room as white as the lobby with the notable exception of a checkered tile-patterned boxing ring. The square tiles change color every second or two, creating a dazzling if disorienting display. Standing on the opposite side of the ring is Clemont.

* Oh, Elli! Shauna's friend. You're Elliot Fleet?! Wow! I just got a call from Ramos of Coumarine City to follow up on the blackout, and he said you helped him kick some Team Flare goons out and restore order. That's really something! I owe you big time, so I figured I'd override the test results and let you up immediately. Still, I had to see the test through as a formality. Don't wanna ruffle any feathers, ya know? Okay, so. You ready to go? I conduct my Gym battles in 3-on-3 format. We go until a trainer has no Pokémon remaining. One healing item per trainer. Is this agreeable?

*Sounds good to me.*

* Excellent. Before we begin, I received one request from a prospective visitor. Do you consent to our match being spectated?

*Must have been Shauna. Of course she can come!*

Clemont nods to Bonnie, who reaches into her purse and pulls out a walkie talkie and speaks into it. After a moment, Shauna appears and takes a seat in the bleachers on either side of the ring. She waves to both battlers and blows them kisses, unable to pick one to root for.

* Begin! For my first Pokémon, I select Baron!

*Molly, you're up!*

Elliot's Exploud faces off against Clemont's Emolga, both ready for action. 

*Start with Rock Tomb, Molly!*

* Baron, evade and counter with Quick Attack!

The Emolga darts forward and nimbly navigates through Molly's flurry of debris, scoring a direct hit. Still, its tiny body is too light to inflict much damage. At their trainers' commands, the Pokémon repeat the same moves. This time, Rock Tomb hits, but Baron manages to hang on by a thread. Elliot attempts a third Rock Tomb for the knockout, but Clemont foresees the attack. 

* Baron, Volt Switch!

The Emolga sends out a crackle of electricity and retreats to his ball, immediately being replaced by a tough metal Magneton. The Rock Tomb glances off its hard body, barely leaving a dent.

* You can't be such a one-trick pony, Elliot! Strategy matters in my Gym! Jumpstart, Electric Terrain!

The Magneton tilts over and presses its six magnets to the ground, charging the floor of the ring with a lively current. 

*Molly, time to start buckling down. Power-Up Punch!*

Molly charges forward and launches a punch at the Magneton. Not used to delivering physical attacks, Molly wrings her hand in pain, but the callous has already begun to form. As Jumpstart delivers a Thunderbolt, Molly rushes forward and delivers another Power-Up Punch. This one hurts Jumpstart more and Molly less. Gritting his teeth, Clemont extends his robo-arm to spray a Hyper Potion over his Magneton. Elliot grins, remembering Korrina's words from a long while back. ""It's not wise to stall and let Power-Up Punch build up.""

*Molly, it's time for Bulldoze!*
 
Molly brings her toughened fists crashing to the floor, creating a ripple in the ground that causes the Magneton to spasm violently. To Elliot's shock, however, it rises back up, just barely holding on.

* My Magenton sure is Sturdy, huh? Thunderbolt, Jumpstart!

Lighting bolts arc out from Jumpstart's magnets and juice Molly thoroughly, dropping her to one knee. Not wanting to take any risks, Elliot darts forward and administers his one and only Super Potion, enabling his Exploud to stand back up. To psych herself back up, Molly takes a huge breath and forces it out the holes in her back, legs, and tail, generating the sound of a pipe organ keyboard being pounded on.

*It's on its last legs, Molly. That's a free Power-Up Punch for us!*

Molly crashes her now-rock-hard fist into the Magneton, and it spins backward, collapsing at its trainer's feet. At full health and with massive attack power, Molly has no trouble dispatching Clemont's remaining fighters, Emolga and Heliolisk. Clemont returns his last Pokémon and looks ruefully at Elliot.

* Good work, Elli! You really are as tough as I've heard. You earned this badge. And this TM, too! I love this one - it's my favorite gadget. And that's saying something! Now -

&gt; Challenger!! You have defeated my big brother Clemont of Lumiose City! However, your test grades were abysmal! Consider hiring a tutor - mmph!

Clemont's robo-arm scoops up the rambunctious, interrupting Bonnie and covers her mouth as the Gym leader blushes self-consciously. 

* Bonnie, please! Try to be polite. Sorry about her, Elliot. It was a good match. I should have known better than to let you get away with so many boosting moves. You made an excellent physical attacker out of a Pokémon renowned for its special-attacking prowess and took me totally off-guard. You see, we all still have lots to learn!

*Thanks, Clemont. That means a lot. I'll see you around!*

Elliot, Molly, and Shauna make their way down to the lobby and back outside, where they can see the sun setting. 

**Good work, Elli! So, where to next?**

*Well, I checked out that Gym leader database you mentioned yesterday, and it looks like my next destination is Laverre City. You wouldn't wanna come with me, would you?*

**Oh, Elli, that sounds like to much fun! But...I applied for an internship at the Trainer PR Video studio, and I just got accepted today! So it looks like I'll be living in Lumiose for the time being, filming videos of serious competitive trainers and their Pokémon. Best of luck, though! I mean it!**

She gives him a final squeeze, then heads off through the labyrinthine streets of Lumiose. Elliot is happy for Shauna. She had seemed rather directionless early on in their journey, so he is glad to see her finding something to be excited about. Still, he finds himself surprised at how disappointed he feels that she can't join him on the next leg of his journey. He shakes his head to clear it and looks down at his Exploud.

*Molly, you were a total rock star today. You get to pick where we got for dinner tonight. Lead the way.*

---------------------------------------------

This Gym ended up being no sweat, thankfully, since like I mentioned last time I am insanely overleveled. I'm gonna try to dial it back moving forward, reducing grinding and avoiding trainer battles when I can to get back on fair ground.

I'm really glad Molly had a chance to shine today. Ever since the team filled out, it's been tough to give each member equal spotlight, so Molly really deserved the chance to get some love. Very proud of her today.

&gt;The Great Battle

&gt;The Write To Market conference last month in Corte Madera was interesting. It was run by Xxxx Xxxxxx and a man who sounded remarkably like Nicholas Cage. The man-who-sounded-like-Nicholas Cage suggested a new title for my memoir, “**The Telepathic Buddhist.**” I think this is original and upbeat – much more snappy than the lengthy “Never Give Up…” I have been using.

&gt;I practiced my two-paragraph pitch and gained new insight into my memoir. I realized more clearly what was (and still is) at stake. **These past fifteen years or so, ever since I started having “mental health”/feelings of persecution problems, my sanity was at stake**, but so was my marriage, and so was my life. Since this is an ongoing problem (i.e. **the people who have targeted me are still here**), my sanity, my marriage and my life are still at stake. This has yet to be resolved – at least at the time of this writing.
Over the years, I wondered how this nightmarish situation looks to other people. What do they perceive as the problem(s), the causes, and/or the solution. I’ve come to believe that every person has a different perspective. Much of the stories floating around simply aren’t true, and it is an extremely difficult situation to explain, especially without all of the information. **Many people (including numerous U.S. government employees) are facing indictments, although I don’t know specifically who or what the charges are. I can only speculate. Bribery, perjury, obstruction of justice, impersonating a federal agent, interfering with a federal investigation, bomb making, and the list goes on. Some people are facing an international trial with the International Court of Justice, one of which, Xxxxx Xxxx, was my former boss for two months in 1999-2000. Others remain here in the U.S. or have been extradited to their home countries to be held accountable.**

#3 - it appears that nothing has actually occurred - this is all her own pathological persecution delusion.

&gt;From a Nichiren Buddhist perspective, part of our practice includes a battle or struggle between the forces of good (the Buddha) and the forces of evil. I believe this constitutes the nature of my experience. As SGI President Daisaku Ikeda states

&gt;*This is a battle between respect and contempt for people. When practitioners of the Lotus Sutra [Nichiren Buddhism] endeavor to propagate its teachings in the real world, great opposition arises, a manifestation of the function of the devil king of the sixth heaven that resides in people’s lives…In Buddhism, “devils” or “devilish functions” are defined as “robbers of life.” In other words, they drain away the life force we need to lead positive lives…Living Buddhism, December 2015 p. 30-33*

It does not help anyone's mental health to be talking about ""devils"" or ""demons"" or ""battles between good and evil"" as if such nonsense actually exists.  We MUST stop this sort of toxic thinking, and the first way is to stop the dangerous charlatans who promulgate it.

&gt;**This makes sense to me, but I have been practicing this Buddhism for over 25 years.** When I thought of how other people might perceive this situation, I did not know quite how I would explain this Buddhist perspective. Obviously, this nightmare did not occur merely to prove the validity of this particular Buddhism, nor did it occur merely to cause people heartache and concern. When I read further, I found a definition of the Devil King of the Sixth Heaven that I had not read before. In Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism, much of the Buddha’s teachings are metaphor, they are not meant to be interpreted literally. What I found was this:

&gt;*Nichiren Daishonin says that the devil king of the sixth heaven attacks the forces of good with his “ten kinds of troops.” The ten kinds of troops are listed in The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom as: (1) greed, (2) discouragement, (3) hunger and thirst, (4) craving, (5) sleepiness, (6) fear, (7) doubt and regret, (8) anger, (9) preoccupation with fame, fortune, and false glory, and (10) arrogance and contempt for others. All of these are devilish functions that arise within us. Living Buddhism, December 2015 p. 30*

This bullshit they're promoting is harming people - see the effects right here.

&gt;In Buddhism, our struggles are almost always an internal battle, but sometimes there are external forces at work that might influence our faith, our judgment, and our happiness. **In my experience, I have had to develop my Buddha nature so that I am not influenced by these “devilish functions” at work in my life, *even though they are external.***

Honey, there's nothing there.  Really.

&gt;There is still the internal part of me that has to be able to deal with their evil in order to survive – to preserve my sanity, my marriage and to protect my own life.

She keeps saying that...circular thinking, mind going round and round, chasing its own tail, consuming itself with itself.

&gt;In August 2011, I created a blog to chronicle my experience dealing the mental illness I was diagnosed with in 2002: schizophrenia. This diagnosis was based on the symptoms I described to psychiatrists: hearing voices, paranoia, and the belief that I was being persecuted by the mafia. **In reality, I never believed that the “voices” I heard were symptoms of schizophrenia. Instead, I believed that a form of communication which has never been scientifically proven – telepathy – was what allowed me to hear the “voices” of my enemies in my head, and which also allowed my enemies to “hear” my thoughts.**

Notice how she knew better than the doctors - this is Severe Mental Illness 101.

&gt;These bizarre set of circumstances, combined with **the demented insanity of everyone involved** created a horrific set of circumstances for myself, my husband and our families. 

Talk about projection!!

&gt;Ultimately, the situation devolved into chaos for the people and surrounding communities who were forced to become involved. I challenge my circumstances and find hope, courage and strength in my Buddhist practice. I turn to my husband and family for love and support. Writing and photography are my creative outlets and emotional therapy. I never give up in my fight. My memoir is a source of hope, inspiration, and encouragement for everyone.

Well, that's ONE way of looking at it, I suppose O_O

I'm repelled and horrified, personally!  But let's continue:

&gt;There is more than one antagonistic force in this memoir. Specifically, the antagonistic force(s) are people. They are **the people who began stalking, harassing and persecuting me in 2002. The people included a former roommate from Oxnard, CA in addition to a man whom I initially believed was associated with the mafia (it turns out he was former CIA). Initially, there were 3-4 people involved, but over the years, the number grew and now this group probably numbers around 40-50 people (although it could be more than this). This number includes the people [government employees/agents] who may not have necessarily been stalking me this entire time but were (and still are) nevertheless involved [by using me as a scapegoat] in an attempt to avoid their own indictment.**

WTF??  Her delusions are clearly becoming more and more grandiose - the mental illness is becoming more severe.

&gt;Primary Conflict (*this is a category of literary analysis of what she's writing*)

&gt;My struggle against the people (devilish functions) in my life who constantly torment, stalk, persecute, and harass me. Initially I believed I had done something wrong and that I somehow was at fault for their behavior. **I eventually realized that [from a Buddhist perspective], this was my karma and I needed to be able to change it. I had certainly never done anything to warrant this type of persecution and harassment directed at me by complete strangers.**

&gt;My inner conflict was coming to my own understanding of why this happened, using my Buddhist practice as a guide.

And boy howdy, is it ever working O_O

&gt;Secondary Conflict:  Trying to understand why no one ever felt comfortable enough to approach me with questions about this situation, or why no one I knew (i.e. friends, family, Buddhist friends, etc…) ever discussed this problem with me.

&gt;I keep wondering when this is going to end. **I still can’t figure out why the person (people) stalking me has not been arrested. I would think that by now, there would be some way of figuring this out. After all, this man (Sam?) has been stalking, harassing and threatening me for the past thirteen years. Yet, he is still out there? Nothing can be done about him? Nothing? Why is this?  Does this make sense to anyone? Does it seem reasonable? No! Absolutely not. He is still accompanied by two or three others.**
 
&gt;On Monday, I had a dentist appointment. **One of the women associated with him made an appointment at approximately the same time as my appointment. She was seated in a dentist chair not far from mine, and although I didn’t hear much of what she said, she appeared to be lying about her reasons for being there at the exact same time I was.**

Dentists do not disclose to people who has appointments when.  This is pure crazy.
 
&gt;On Wednesday, I took my dog Xxxxxx to her vet for a nail trim. **As I walked into the vet’s office, I heard sirens. The people who follow me everywhere are prone to making fake 911 calls (often claiming that I am actually the person making the call).**

Maybe she is O_O

&gt;Xxxxx and I walked into the vet and told the receptionist we were in for a nail trim. **One of the women who stalks me was already there.**

How did she manage that?  Was she reading her thoughts and knew where she'd be going and just scampered there ahead of her?

&gt;She looked to be Asian or South Asian and was talking to one of the tech assistants, claiming that she was some sort of “inspector,” or perhaps that’s what she wanted me to hear. 

Honey, if you've got anything against Asians, you do NOT want to be involved with the SGI!

&gt;Woman: “Well, you let me see everything and you signed the form…” (inaudible conversation)

&gt;Tech: “Yes, well we’re an independent clinic. If someone wakes up in the morning and sees that their pet has a problem, they can come right in…” (more inaudible conversation)

&gt;I waited for Xxxxx, and when her technician brought her back out to me, the Asian woman looked at Xxxxx as if confirming something. Then she left. 

&gt;Assistant to the Tech: “Was that Animal Control?”

&gt;Nope, it wasn’t animal control. Here’s what happened later in the afternoon when I went to the Kohl’s at El Camino Real and Lawrence Expressway: I walked into the store and walked into the fitness department. I stopped to look at their workout shirts and sweatshirts. **I heard a store employee by the cashiers tell someone, “No. Once you’ve gone in through there, you can’t go leave.”** Hmmmm. I think what happened was one of the other women (also Asian or South Asian) had followed me in Kohl’s. Then she ran into one of the dressing rooms and hid. **See, the problem is there is a restraining order on every single one of these people (both the men and the women) prohibiting them from following me into stores (and people’s houses) and requiring them to maintain a certain distance. The issue is they consistently violate the restraining order. Often on a daily basis.**

Yuh huh.  I'll bet there's no restraining order, as she has already defined these individuals as ""strangers"" and she has no idea how many are involved.  I'll bet she imagined the restraining order as well, right along with all the other ""I'm so noble and righteous and innocent and beleaguered"" details.  I'm no expert, but there are often delusions of :

**Schizophrenia is a mental disorder distinguished by a loss of contact with reality and the occurrence of psychotic behaviors, including hallucinations and delusions (unreal beliefs which endure even when there is contrary evidence). Delusions may include the false and constant idea that the person is being followed or poisoned, or that the person’s thoughts are being broadcast for others to listen to. Delusions in schizophrenia often develop as a response to the individual attempting to explain their hallucinations. Patients who experience recurrent auditory hallucinations can develop the delusion that other people are scheming against them and are dishonest when they say they do not hear the voices that the delusioned person believes that he or she hears.** [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiose_delusions)

**[P]ersecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in paranoid schizophrenia, where the person believes ""he or she is being tormented, followed, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed.""** [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutory_delusion)

**Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world. People with schizophrenia often have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in strange or confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched.** [Source](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-signs-types-and-causes.htm)

&gt;**I visited my parents in Colorado over Halloween, and all of these people flew to Colorado, although they had absolutely no reason to go there. They only reason they flew to Colorado was because I was visiting my parents. The majority of them were on my flight! Surprise, surprise. They all left when I left. Certainly this is extremely perplexing!** So the fact that this nightmare continues to drag on astonishes me. **I can’t believe that there is nothing that can be done to prevent sh#$@&amp;d (as I call him) and his minions from carrying out this type of behavior on a daily basis. He should have been taken off the streets years ago. This is my firm belief.**
 
&gt;So, while I don’t know what the holdup is, I will continue to “speak out” about this on my blog as long as it continues. I am hoping for the best possible outcome, and of course, for the justice we all deserve. 

&gt;*Addressing young people, SGI President Ikeda affirms that when confronted by cruel reality, if we cannot feel hope, it is time to create some. We can do this by digging deeper within, searching for even a small glimmer of light, for the possibility of a way to begin to break through the impasse before us. – Daisaku Ikeda, October 16, 2015, World Tribune* 

&gt;This is how I often feel before I get out of bed in the morning – “confronted by cruel reality.” Especially when I don’t want to get out of bed and live the day. **I get tired of all the people following me around and all the screaming and yelling.**

The people who don't exist and the screaming and yelling that don't exist.

&gt;I read this story last week sometime and felt encouraged. The article and the idea of “creating hope” gave me the motivation to create a little more hope and happiness in my own life. It didn’t take too much effort, all I did was think of a few things to work on that I enjoy and help me envision a more positive future.

&gt;I decided to revisit the second memoir I started writing last year but hadn’t worked in eight or nine months. My second memoir is about my experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic, but it’s still in the very beginning stages. When I started working on it again, I felt better. I discovered how much I remembered from the two years I spent overseas and how much I still have to write. This did involve some effort on my part, however, writing, especially memoir requires me to delve into my memories and as President Ikeda says, “by digging deeper,” I was able to shift my thoughts away from my external environment and back towards my own life. In other words, I was able to distract myself and focus less on my own unhappiness, and more on the positive aspects of my life.

&gt;I also decided to get really creative and wrote a children’s poem in the style of Shel Silverstein. My poem made me laugh and the funny thing is, I “wrote” it while taking a shower. A few hours later, I decided to type it up and save it on the computer before I forgot all the words. I’ve also spent more time working on the XXXX website. I’ve hired an intern to write a weekly blog for XXXX starting in November, and I’m really looking forward to working with her.

I wonder if she really hired someone, or if this is just another one of her delusions talking O_O

&gt;Hope is a decision.

&gt;Life is definitely looking up and **I can’t wait until this is over and these people are gone from my life for good**.

&gt;**I attended a brief Q&amp;A with our new SGI General Director last Friday, and I gave him a copy of my memoir to take back with him to Los Angeles. I told him my determination is to share my experience (based on my memoir) with SGI President Ikeda at the Hall of the Great Vow for World Peace in Tokyo. During the meeting, my mind frequently wandered about the ongoing events over the past 10-15 years or so. Ultimately, what strikes me as the most extraordinary of all is the fact that it actually happened.
What I mean by this is the fact that the schizophrenia diagnosis my psychiatrist gave me in 2002 turned out not to be a mental illness, but a truly terrifying and bizarre reality.** According to the accepted psychiatric definition from the DSM-V, (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association), the following “characteristic symptoms” are listed for schizophrenia:

A. Characteristic symptoms: Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated):

1.	Delusions – false beliefs strongly held in spite of invalidating evidence, especially as a symptom of mental illness: for example,
1.	Paranoid delusions, or delusions of persecution, for example believing that people are “out to get” you, or the thought that people are doing things when there is no external evidence that such things are taking place.
2.	**Delusions of reference – when things in the environment seem to be directly related to you even though they are not. For example, it may seem as if people are talking about you or special personal messages are being communicated to you through the TV, radio, or other media.**
3.	Somatic Delusions are false beliefs about your body – for example that a terrible physical illness exists or that something foreign is inside or passing through your body.
4.	Delusions of grandeur – for example when you believe that you are very special or have special powers or abilities. An example of a grandiose delusion is thinking you are a famous rock star.
2.	Hallucinations – Hallucinations can take a number of different forms – they can be:
1.	Visual (seeing things that are not there or that other people cannot see),
2.	Auditory (hearing voices that other people can’t hear,
3.	Tactile (feeling things that other people don’t feel or something touching your skin that isn’t there.)
4.	Olfactory (smelling things that other people cannot smell, or not smelling the same thing that other people do smell)
5.	Gustatory experiences (tasting things that aren’t there)

&gt;**During my experience, starting in 2002, or perhaps a couple of years earlier, I experienced Delusions #1, #2,  and #3. Of the Hallucinations, I experienced #2, the Auditory. However, Delusion #1, the “delusions of persecution,” and Hallucination #2, the “hearing voices,” have been the most significant and the most persistent over the years. They have also been based in reality (i.e. they are neither delusions nor hallucinations, although given that there is no scientific proof of mental telepathy, whether or not the auditory hallucinations I experience are based in reality is up for debate).** Although I notice that the definition does state, “false beliefs strongly held in spite of invalidating evidence.” So, while I myself do not possess any “invalidating evidence”, **the fact that “invalidating evidence” does in fact exist, proves that my “delusions” are not in fact delusions, but rather a horrible reality.**

O_O
 
&gt;At any rate, whenever I think about the possibility of this happening – of **a person (any person) who experiences in his or her life, a horrifying variety of acts that exactly match the definition of a severe and incurable psychiatric illness, what are the chances? Zero. That tells me that this was not a coincidence and it was no accident. There was a reason this happened and there is meaning in it. I just haven’t determined yet what it is.**

Oh brother.  Yet another life transformed into a diamond-like state of unshakable happiness through Ikeda and his Ikeda religion.  Notice that she became ill 10-15 years after starting practicing in the SGI O_O

&gt;As difficult as it is for me to believe, every time I read a letter of encouragement or a piece of guidance from SGI President Ikeda, I find the following words,

&gt;*Whether we become happy or unhappy is not determined by other people or our environment. It is decided by our own inner determination or resolve. - Living Buddhism, September 2015 p. 31*

&gt;**I’ve always thought to myself, how can I be happy when I live day-to-day surrounded by madness and crazy people? How can I be happy when I am constantly faced with a seemingly neverending nightmare that I have no control over? Certainly this seems to be an insurmountable obstacle. Yet according to Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism and President Ikeda’s guidance, my happiness isn’t determined by external factors. My happiness is only determined by me. How difficult is this?**

Impossible, actually.  By now, this should be clear - you are being deceived.  Ikeda is, in fact, your worst enemy.

&gt;It is human nature to seek happiness outside ourselves, but the key is to bring it forth from within. I constantly need to refocus my thoughts in order to draw my attention and my energy away from the people in my environment and keep it focused on my own life and its more positive aspects. This is a big challenge – to bring forth happiness, wisdom and enlightenment from within – but it is the key to advancing in life and winning over obstacles.

&gt;*Our minds are more powerful than we know. When we are able to control our minds, our thoughts, and our emotions, we become empowered over our own lives. We also become stronger, and are able to positively influence other people.*

&gt;*When our minds change, we and our world also change. The Lotus Sutra teaches this as the “wonderful workings of one’s mind.” (OTT, 30) One’s mind, the innermost realm of life, is vast and boundless; it is dynamic…by changing the innermost orientation of our minds, we change both ourselves and our world…Everything is determined by our “earnest resolve.” - Living Buddhism, September 2015 p. 37-38*

&gt;This is what I was taught many years ago when I first started practicing Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism. I clearly remember being told, “Everything is determined by your ichinen,“ meaning “everything is determined by my earnest resolve.” This is difficult to believe, but faith and our prayer play a very important role. Every day I work on strengthening my faith and my determination so that I can persevere and see this fight through to a victorious end.

Mmm hmmm O_O"
3y56u2,4,2015-12-24,put my job of one month on my resume? (x-post from /r/jobs),kroooo,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/3y56u2/put_my_job_of_one_month_on_my_resume_xpost_from/,"I'm a recent college grad and I got my first ""real"" job less than a month ago. I have no real world experience; didn't do any internships or have a job during college because I was a bio major and the curriculum was too much for me. During my job search I was applying anywhere and everywhere. After a few unsuccessful months, I began growing more and more desperate and when I got offered a part-time job as a buyer, I pounced on it, figuring to take it to gain office experience and build my resume.

Fast forward to yesterday when I heard back from a county government job I applied to when I was looking for a job. They want me to forward them my resume. The only requirement for the job is a relevant college degree, which I have.

My question is do I put my new job of 3 weeks onto the resume I send to them? It would make me seem more experienced and thus more attractive as a candidate, however the fact that I am looking at this job after just being hired could hurt my chances as I may be seen not being able to stick with a job (the other positions on my resume are short-term: a recent 3-month stint as a tutor, a recent 9-month stint as a private tutor, a 2-month stint as an admin assistant back in high school; I do have a 3 year stint as a waiter which I do not list on my resume because it was so long ago(07-10; it is on my linkedin though)). Or I could just resubmit the same resume I submitted at the time I submitted the application, but lying or deliberately excluding information is subject to disqualification, I'm pretty sure.

What would be my best course of action?"

I'll try to provide some background and give you guys an in-depth view of how things went, and maybe you can see whether i took a bad turn or i should've seen it coming


I've met her about 9 months ago while i was on a project in her country, back then i was in a relationship with someone else so i didn't really feel for her or anything. Fast forrward couple months and we start talking more and more. The more i talked to her the more i was realising thats how i've always imagined my SO would be.


Now, i have been in quite some relationships but i've never felt so.. connected with someone on so many topics and aspects of life. Shes this kind and caring, nerdy type of girl, really good at both listening and communicating. As far as i know she had a long relationship but broke up a year or two ago.


We start speaking more and more, and i'm able to flirt with her responding positively. She keeps telling me on how i should come see her and even tho i'm trying to keep cool, its all i'm thinking about. One night being a bit tipsy texts me on how much she talks to her friends about me and wants to see me. You can see where this is going.


Even tho i wanted so freaking bad to go see her and i was so falling for her, i always felt a bit scared of commiting.

.


Fun part starts here, two weeks ago i get an offer for an internship from her country and the same city as well. And that was it, i quit my job, canceled my xmas plans and booked a flight.I was all in. Nervous as heck but there i was, going for it. Now i've never commited so hard in my life to just one single thing. But i was happy. 

**Now is where the downhill begins.**

The first week i had to attend some meetings and formal stuff so i could in no way meet up with her. On saturday i get to leave from a party early, already had some beers on board and i was feeling just great. I ask her to have a few drinks, she's responding super positively, gives me her address and there i go in a cab to her place.
Apparently she thought i was joking about the whole thing and didn't expect me one moment to actually come. She thought i was joking about the whole coming to her country as well. Things get a little awkward..but ok.. we head off to a shop grab some beer. We get home and start talking for quıte a few hours about random things. Now i know when something goes bad.. And that night it wasn't the case. In fact for some reason i was somehow expecting her to say something the following days. But nothin happened

.

Anyways few days later i'm texting her and she just shruggs me off, saying shes all busy. (shes in exam period; i graduated) 

Reddit, did i somehow fucked this up? Did i flew in with way too high expectations on how things would go? Was she just a tease?

.

 What should my next move be? I don't really want to give up..but what can i do? 


**TL;DR** : Flew to another country to meet crush; ended up being shrugged off. How should i react?"

I nailed the first interview with the initial HR/recruiting team from both companies. I have nearly three years of IT experience and personal projects that I bring up. I've been told by a number of people I have a strong resume, both in terms of presentation and content. Even when I get my resume reviewed, they give me a few tips for improvement but say it otherwise looks great.

But when it comes to interviews, I feel really clumsy. It seems like no amount of preparation helps, because I always seem to prepare for things that never come up (but have in past interviews).

I never really get a natural chance to talk about my projects, and I'm always asked why I'm transitioning to development (I have a largely systems/IT background). I typically answer along the lines that I have found I enjoy it so much more because I love solving puzzles and building things. I don't know if those are bad answers or not.

In the last interview, I felt like the call ended pretty abruptly. When they asked if I had any final questions, I asked them a few about how my role as an intern would fit into the team, their methodology, how often they meet, give feedback, etc. Most of my questions were answered early on, or with the couple I asked at the end. They asked again if I had any more questions, I said, ""no, I think that covers it,"" then the call was ended pretty awkwardly and abruptly, saying they'd talk it over and would ""be in touch."" Maybe I'm just over-analyzing it."

Anyways, just wanted to thank this community for all the posts that made me realize I was in a relationship that would not work out in the long term. I am just going to type and type and hopefully fall asleep sometime, so apologies if things do not make sense!

I started dating someone in college my Junior year - she was a Sophomore. We got along well, and the sex was... well, I cannot remember if it was plentiful, but I liked it and I felt wanted, so as far as I remember, it was - and this is probably the wrong word, but I cannot seem to come up with a better one right now - enough. However, the sex started to wane and I wondered if it was my fault. Was I not attractive? Maybe she was a lesbian? All thoughts in my head. We talked about this and she told me that she had never gotten an orgasm. She had tried herself, had a partner who tried, etc. This made it feel like sex was a waste of time. I told her we could work on it, and so I bought toys, lube, etc. I even watched videos (something blueprint) to learn different ways to please her.

Then came a break in our physical contact - we both had internships that were far apart (East and West coast). I asked her to try and take some time to experiment with herself cause I believed that she could be the best person to find out what she liked and she said she would. We FaceTimed every day and soon enough, the internship ended and I was a Senior and her a Junior. The physical contact was there again, but the sex waned faster this time. Eventually I asked if she had figured out anything about her body and she admitted that she had not tried. Of course, being committed this far, I wanted to keep going and still try.

Long story short, the topic of sex caused a lot of fights, problems, you name it. I started reading DB when I came back from the internship and saw how people were frustrated with their situation. I did not want that to happen to me, so before I graduated, we decided to end our 1.5 year relationship.

I do not know if I said anything 'good' about her, but other than the physical aspect, she was a wonderful girlfriend. Maybe she is just asexual - or perhaps maybe she is a lesbian. Who knows. All I know is, I am glad that we did end the relationship because I know that eventually, I would become frustrated or maybe even angry and I would never want to make her feel sad or uncomfortable.

Since our breakup, I went on Tinder, and luckily met this insatiable woman who I have been seeing for almost 5 months now. I want to gloat so I will say that the videos that I watched along with all the effort that I put in with my ex has payed off immensely at pleasing this new girl. I have also discovered that I am more into pleasing her than getting pleased myself. I make it a goal to get her to orgasm at least ten times before I get off once. I just love being able to please someone like this - and plus, that O-face brings a big ass grin on my face. I just keep going until she says she cannot take anymore... But I know her, so I keep going again until she says her safety word.

That up there is the joy that I wish everyone here could have... Or at least some form of it. I wonder a lot why people here are with their partners who do not make them happy. I have only just got out of college, so I would not be wise about things such as how kids affect the relationship, but in the end, if one is not happy, why endure the hardship?

Well, my mind is kind of lost in thought right now. Sorry if the above is of the same quality. Let me know if you want anything explained.

tl;dr - Happy Holidays!"

3y6fri,7,2015-12-25,"It's incredible how long humans can put up with doing something they don't like, even if the situation can be changed - really glad that I found my way now",throwaway_forgood,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3y6fri/its_incredible_how_long_humans_can_put_up_with/,"I have been chasing the wrong career for 4 years now. I always wanted to be an airline pilot, but after high school, everyone went to college, and since college is free where I live, it was pretty much the most viable option, so I went too. I had no clue what to study, so I decided to go for a high school teacher's degree in psychology and economics.

What I had not taken into account back then though, was the fact that I have never really been into theoretical stuff or learning abstract things at all. I have always been more of a 'practical engineer', who likes understanding machinery by operating it and not just studying it.

Anyway, 4 horrible, stressful, unsuccesful years followed, I have not been performing well, and I've had issues learning. I was so preoccupied with shit that I didn't even think about whether I was doing the right thing anymore, I was just trying to keep going. But everything was just a huge struggle, so I was looking for some internal defects - depression, ADD, or even the whole college learning system being faulty, or I was just shrugging it off by thinking doing only shit you don't like is simply part of growing up...

Fortunately, it was at this year's internship at a high school, when I came to realize that I don't want to be a teacher at all, and that I was just blindly following other people's career paths, simply because they looked reasonable, and 'everyone was doing it'.


So here I am now, ready to attend flight school and more happy and energetic than ever. I have no issues learning at all, because everything we have to learn for the flight school exams is exciting and 100% relevant for the career.

Looking back at those 4 years though, I am amazed by how long I've been able to put enormous amounts of effort into something I haven't been convinced about in first place.

So here goes my advice: If you have the chance to change the situation, go for it, even if it means taking a risk or losing some relationships due to moving to another place. You won't regret it. It's such a simple wisdom to say *do what you love* but apparently, it's really not that easy to follow. But as long as you can, you should really try as hard as you can - otherwise it's not legitimate to complain about ""shattered dreams"", if you haven't even tried in first place.

**TL;DR:** If you can - do what you love. It might seem more convenient to follow *some* career, but one day you will get sick of it."
3y6iwf,3,2015-12-25,I've signed for a FT role but now have an interview for an SA position... Could this blow up in my face?,chickenpi,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3y6iwf/ive_signed_for_a_ft_role_but_now_have_an/,"Following an internship I landed a graduate offer for big 4 CF/transactions to start late 2016. However, I've been sending off a few applications to some banking 2016 SA positions, and now have an interview for S&amp;T coming up.

Neither are bad roles by any means but clearly the banking role would pay a lot more and is probably more exciting. The idea would be to graduate, take the summer (if i got it!), then join the big 4 company for a year and leave in late 2017 depending on the outcome on the SA internship, whether I enjoyed it and got a permanent offer or not.

Clearly this is a bit cheeky at best. I feel like I would be compromising my integrity by simply attending the interview. The worst case scenario would be for both companies to find out what I'm doing and withdraw any offer they have/would have given me. How would you think the SA interviewer would view this if they asked about it in the interview (I definitely wouldn't lie if they asked!), and the Big 4 company if they found out I'd taken another internship? A twist in the tale is that the Big 4 company would have to provide a reference to the bank... whilst expecting me to come and devote my life to them!

What is your opinion on this? Am I being too sensitive? should I think about ditching one option and just go for the other? Is this just business and the way it goes when you're a lowly graduate fighting to get anywhere?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts."

It was finding all the pixels that made a red shape in an image. 

I assumed that the pixels are stored in a 2D array and based my algorithm on that. Each spot in the 2d array would store the color of the pixel. 

Is this correct though?  Should I have assumed a 1D array? Or nor an array but another data structure like a bidirectional graph, where each pixel points to 4 others?

I also used another 2D array to keep track of pixels I visited. Should I have used something else,  like a stack or queue?

For example, a clinical trial associate position asks for one year of experience with clinical practices doing 1, 2, 3 and although I have had one internship, it was in quality and not clinical practices.

3y8ite,33,2015-12-25,Need Advice. Performance rating dropped and promotion withdrawn 2.5 months after finalized.,helplessdeveloper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3y8ite/need_advice_performance_rating_dropped_and/,"**LONG WALL OF POOR STORYTELLING INCOMING, FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO TL;DR**

I work as a developer and rejected an Amazon AWS IAM offer that required me to relocate to Seattle for this company around Feb 2015. This meant a lower salary but I was genuinely interested in the (new, $700M) project. Our team handles the user-facing portion of this large project. Anyways, 2 months in I'm doing great, working hard. This new lady (let's call her K) who has worked here 10 years joins the team to replace our current back-end team lead (E) who basically was juggling 2 projects and had to dedicate her time to other project. At least point 2 more people join our team, and help out on front-end because for some reason management wants to have a highly functional UI before any back-end is done so they can show it to the customer(s) and get feedback. I voice my suggestions (to start back-end at the same time and start integrating and having actual communication going front to back), but a demo is coming up and everyone is concerned about this.

We have our customer demo with this UI-only ""product"", and get great feedback from all parties. After this time I'm asked to become team lead (J) for the front-end as I'm pretty much already doing what they'd expect of a team lead. No raise/official promotion though. Soon 2 more people join, 1 of who joins my team, and another (J2) added to the back-end with K. Our first major delivery is at the end of October, and back-end officially starts building REST services. Another developer (A), joins. A couple months go by ~June, and I bring up again, that we cannot continue to have front-end so far ahead and not have any communication with back-end as we will not make our deadline. I suggest that we ""loan"" 2 of our current 4 people to the back-end to help bridge that gap. Only an intern is left on my team at this point, while back-end has 5 people + K, who, unlike me, does not need to code as she's a ""100% team lead"".

This is where everything starts going wrong. Actually it was even before people were loaned to K but I digress. She creates very vague requirements for developer assignments, and then tell them to re-do it over and over because it's not what she expected. At the same time, she does not give any guidance on what she actually wants, and perpetually complains about being overworked, stressed, and always stuck doing code reviews, meanwhile doing ~5 hour work days (coming in at 9:45, and leaving at 2:30). J2 brings up some suggestions to the supervisor/project lead (J3) to improve these issues without blaming K specifically. K insists on taking the lead on these suggestions and absolves herself of the need to participate in them herself (standups, defining scope and requirements more clearly, etc). J2 brings this up with the line manager (C), who is not involved in the project, but manages employees' career development, needs, etc. Each employee is assigned one. C tells J2 to be more frank/direct with feedback if she has issues with anyone/processes on the team.

At this point 2 other people on K's team start raising similar concerns and frustrations. J2 is excluded from important meetings by K citing ""workload"" and ""she doesn't want to come"". *J2 decides to leave after 3 short months*. Nothing improves; K is still changing things willy-nilly, two-facing people, and creating a lot of busy work in general that sets the project further behind. I get called in to talk to C after J2 leaves and am asked about the team atmosphere etc, I hint that similar to what the 3 previous people have already mentioned, there are serious issues, and am told to gather some feedback and tell the project lead (J3).

Right before I speak with her, she gives me my performance review (first image, Oct 6th), with the highest ratings in all areas along with comments about my work thus far and taking on the team lead role, simplifying inefficient processes, setting up CI and automated E2E testing, etc all with high praise. This feedback goes to me and C to be signed, and is finalized and sent out to all parties involved. After bringing up these issues with J3 though, she thanks me for raising them and soon a lot of discussions start happening behind closed doors with J3, K, and some people with more tenure at the company. After another 2 weeks, my invitation to the weekly team lead meetings hosted by J3 get cancelled. Every other team lead still attends. *Another two members of K's team leave*, 3 months worked. Aside from the frustrations they raised previously, they do not say anymore to prevent burning bridges.

Around this time, J3 is increasingly upset and concerned that the project will not make the deadline set at the end of October. Since K only has 2 team members left and I only have my intern, J3 asks upper management/the client for more time, and I proceed to integrate the very few working endpoints into our front-end. At this point, a large number of issues arise, such as a simple GET request for 1000 records in a database taking 40~52 seconds, some that completely break functionality. It is clear to me that a lot of this was never vetted/tested or simply magically passed K's code reviews, but I'm careful to not point fingers. I raise these issues while emphasizing their impact, and ask for them to be resolved ASAP. K defers, defers, stalls, defers, stalls, stalls, and does not resolve them or even so much as assign people to resolve them. She forces the devs to make more breaking changes, ignoring their comments on the impact, and creates even more busy work. Meanwhile I'm under increasing pressure as the features that should be working on the UI are not (as a result of endpoint issues). Another extension is requested and a lot of upper management is angry and state that this is the last one (end of 2015). I'm instructed to ""finish everything"" before Christmas/the new year, and K, J3, and most of the other non-devs go on vacation for the month of Dec all the way until delivery date (early Jan).

Thursday, Dec 17th: C calls me into his office. He says my performance review rating has been dropped and makes me add my initial (2nd image). I ask him the reason and why it was adjusted this long after. He simply says ""it was a mistake"", and goes on to say that dropping from 5 to 4 is not a big deal, I'm simply ""not at the level"" of 5/5. He then goes on to say that ""it's okay, because that doesn't affect what happens next. You are getting a promotion. And this raise. It's the maximum we give around here."" K's 2nd last remaining team member lets me know she got an offer with J2's new company and is giving notice.

Friday, Dec 18th: C calls me on my office phone. He simply says, ""actually, we're not giving you a promotion"".

My issue is not with whether or not I got a 4 or 5 on my review, or whether I got a promotion or not. My issue is that my performance review was changed 2.5 months, after it was signed by all parties, finalized with HR, and distributed to all parties.

Needless to say I need advice. I've already been quite distressed the past few months at the state of this project and about K in general, but at the same time I also wanted to do my best to leave my work in a good state and get it over this first deadline hurdle.

**TL;DR:** Project in a very messy situation, I'm under tremendous pressure to deliver while all responsible parties are on vacation, my performance rating from 2.5 months ago was lowered after the fact, and a promotion I was told to be given was withdrawn. Advice?"

That was when I was in a minor accident and received what was considered to be a very minor head injury/trauma. What was supposed to be gone in a couple of days has turned into a nightmare for me for the last couple of years. 


I went on sick leave from my studies (I'm in IT) for a year trying to recuperate. I just couldn't study or do much of anything for the first 6 months. It was an awful time but after the first 6 months, I started showing signs of improvement. And I started slowly resuming some of my life and after a year I went back to school to continue my education. 


Things were tough in the beginning but I slowly got back in gear and I had a wonderful semester and lived a relatively normal life with some limitations. During this time I was told by multiple doctors in various specialties that things would only go one way and that was up and that my capabilities would improve, my symptoms would fade and that everything here on out was just going to get better.


At this time, I was finishing up my semester and the exams, I had applied for an internship and gotten a great one. Now all I had to do was finish the last semester with that internship and a final project.
 

Just then, my symptoms came back in full force. From one day to the next, I was mentally crippled again. I tried to rest and see if things would get better quickly but they didn't and I therefore had to call up my internship a few days before I was to start and tell them that I couldn't come work for them and that I had to cancel all that was planned and that I probably wouldn't be able to start with them in the foreseeable future. Especially considering that last time I was sick for a year. I also applied for sick leave again from my school.


I tried to get back on my feet and things go up and down with this condition. I did manage to get my last exam done from the previous semester which I hadn't gone to due to illness but I was still not feeling too well.


Here's the thing. I've been talking on and off with my school about how to approach this and if we can find a way to get me through my education since I only have one semester left. But I have a hard time making plans since things can change so easily. And right now, despite having told my school that I would try to find an internship at reduced time (I can't work full time and it's quite possible I never will) but I just keep getting worse and worse. I'm supposed to start in January or February depending on how fast I can find an internship (if I can - very few want to bother with someone not going at it full time, let alone if they find out my mind doesn't function well).


I do realize that my formatting is awful by the way. I'm just jotting down what comes to mind.


But I'll go into more detail on my medical history for context:
I first had minor symptoms of headaches and tiredness. They turned into dizziness, nausea, vision problems, neck pain, numbness in extremities, occasional memory and concentration problems but nothing major in that regard (contrary to what is expected). I went to multiple doctors who just said rest, avoid this and that, and that's what I did as best as I could but mistakes have definitely been made in the process due to very vague information from doctors.


One of the problems is, if I overexert my mind, my symptoms will flare up and they can do that from one minute to the next with little to no warning that my brain needs a break (something that prior to my injury was unheard of, I could pull all-nighters with no effort). If I relax, my symptoms will slowly fade over days, weeks, months only to return (like hitting a reset switch) from one careless moment to the next. That's why this condition is difficult to deal with.
Relaxing often means doing pretty much nothing, or at least very little. Which is boring and a sad way to live but one has to think of one's health first.


Before I went on sick leave, I finally got to see a neurologist who explained a few things but also mentioned that there's no treatment options, they know very little about these things and nothing about how to deal with it other than let the body heal itself and hope for the best. I got a CT scan (this was three months after the accident). It came up negative. 


I also developed a depression and general anxiety during this time and I went on antidepressants and started seeing a psychiatrist and I went for regular sessions and took my medication all this time during recovery but there were side effects from the medication such as dry mouth, a bit tiredness and I frequently slept for 10-12 hours if I didn't set an alarm. 


After becoming sick again with the symptoms and things just going wrong in my life and having been like that for several months with no significant change (and I had gotten into an altercation with a family member who has mental problems of his own, lost his cool and hit me in the head, which caused my symptoms to flare up even more than usual). I kinda lost my shit for a few days and wanted to shake things up and I stopped taking my medication and everything was fine but months later, no improvements, only things getting worse.


I then went to another neurologist. I wanted a second opinion, since it's been two years now. I mean this thing was supposed to be over in days and it has been years. I thought someone had to have an answer or treatment that could help me. 


He just looked at me when I presented my story and went, basically, ""from my experience with these things, you've never been ill and you should go see a psychiatrist - this is probably mental illness"". 


I was shocked considering the previous diagnoses by multiple doctors and specialists and my medical history. But he ordered an MRI to be sure. It came up negative, but all the vibrations from the machine made me feel worse in the following days. I'm quite sensitive to a lot of things in this condition, even breaking fairly hard in a car can make me feel bad. So I guess I should have expected the vibrations beforehand but I didn't - I only knew that it was gonna be noisy and that was fine.


So I have a specialist saying I'm fine. I have family who say that the way I've been doing things too cautiously and I'm not as fragile as I think I am. That I should get on with my education so I don't end up on welfare for the rest of my life or spend my life hoping for recovery while doing nothing with it. I thought maybe I'll try to follow their advice. Maybe I'll try to start working again. I mean it's been over 2 years. Any damage that can be healed will have been healed within 3-6 months. The doctors told me that.


So I tried starting working a bit again in order to prepare myself for resuming my studies. At first it was difficult and I did feel some signs of overexertion but I shrugged it off a bit. 


Suddenly I could tolerate working again and things seemed fine. Some months passed and I started feeling very bad again. Usually when things get worse, it was from one day to the other. This time it was over a long period of time, so I didn't notice to begin with. 


I have difficulty concentrating while remaining relaxed. Right now as I'm typing this. I can concentrate but I can feel that I'm in a tense state. It's difficult to explain, it's a new situation that I'm unfamiliar with and I just realized this. I can't, for example, watch a video or something. I can't concentrate while trying to kick back and relax. I need to keep my mind and body going in order for me to concentrate.


Before it was in some ways reversed. I felt fine, but I couldn't do much of anything that included displays such as tv, but I could listen and talk for hours or listen to podcasts for hours with no problems. Now I can't do that without feeling restless.


I much prefer my previous state but now I'm unsure if I can recover from this. 
I might have removed my chances to recover by trying to force myself to get ready to finish up my education. 


Of course, there's a chance I can salvage things by ""pulling back"" and trying to rest of the next few weeks. This would of course also mean in all likelihood that I'm dropping out completely. I've already overstayed my welcome and will have to apply for extended time as it is but I can't continue on this path if I don't start this January. That's my last straw. So I'll say goodbye to all I've done with one semester left. 
I think the only reason my school has tolerated me this long is because I'm a straight A student and my teachers have vouched for me because I'm well-liked by them. But no amount of vouching will help me in this matter. It's now or quit it entirely. That means everything I've done and my time there have been for nought and a waste of time (mostly).


My future will also be completely uncertain. My family will be disappointed. I would mention friends, but my social life was nothing spectacular (to say the least) before my accident, it died completely after. Not because I have shitty friends or anything. It's complicated. But I will say that I withdrew. My life was changed and it's hard to live with. Very hard. Writing all this is hard. It makes you think of all the wasted opportunities and all the things I can't do. I can't study, I can't work, I can't do my hobbies. It's a sad life and I know it.


Now I will say this. I'm not suicidal. My belief system makes it pointless, but I do feel like my life is an exercise in futility and in the end, useless. So I'm just going through the motions at it is.


Christmas makes this all the more clear to me (I do understand if the timing seems suspicious.)


I'm seeing succesful family members and I still have my Facebook (have considered deactivating it to spare myself) where I can see all the successes and happiness of the people around me. It's hard seeing people seeing the world, traveling places, getting married, having kids, getting jobs and degrees, buying houses and pets while I'm left with nothing. Nothing at all.


I have no prospects of happiness, love, wealth or anything as it is. The health care system has failed me. They can do nothing for me and there's very little I can do. I can only start trying to pick up what little pieces I have left on the board and try to make something out of it. 


Now all I've written here is only half of the story. I have other problems (I have at least 5 chronic medical problems including chronic pain in addition to what I've mentioned), I have close relatives with massive problems as well.


I was told I was so talented with wonderful prospects in life. This is no longer the case.


So here I am. Writing up a block of text with very little coherence and probably with a lot of missing important details. Not knowing what the hell to do because my options are so extremely limited. And I'm not even 25 yet. I have a long way to go.


I have no one to turn to, no one who can advice me or understand me.


So I thought I'd try this corner of the internet. Hoping someone had that golden advice, those golden words that can encourage me and guide me. Because right now, things seem to hopeless.


I need to find a way to live my life the way it is. I can't just keep hoping that things get better or that I stumble upon a magical cure (although if you have one, I'm all ears). 


I think the key is to find out how to be happy with what I got instead of being sad about all the things I can't have anymore. But those words are easy to say, but hard to actually live by.

3y9g8j,39,2015-12-26,How I Decided To Be Better,TheIronKraken,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3y9g8j/how_i_decided_to_be_better/,"I'm five weeks into a total turnaround in my life... I know that doesn't seem like very long, but I feel that the trajectory of my life has changed course for the better. This is my story.

**Before My Turnaround**

I am 27 years old... but let's rewind to 9 years ago. I was an honors student in high school, and developed a relationship with a smart and beautiful girl. I went to an elite university.  I had a 3.7 GPA after my first semester at this university... but then came a downward spiral. The cause of this spiral is very difficult to explain... so I'm not going to get into that here. But my grades plummeted because I resorted to hyper procrastination (not attending classes, not even beginning to study for exams until mere hours before they were to take place, and handing in papers weeks after the due dates, or not at all)

It would take me 9 years to finally graduate from college, as my pace of course completion became very slow. Some semesters were wasted entirely. I was fortunate enough to be able to transfer to a good school, but only after taking classes their as a non-matriculated student and proving myself first. I ended up graduating with a pretty good GPA... but my potential was still wasted, as I still made the minimum effort to carry me through.

During these 9 years, I went through 2 long-term relationships, and maintained a few friends... but I also went through periods in which I was socially withdrawn. In the worst incident, I hid inside my dorm for nearly a full semester, living in my own trash.

Since my last girlfriend broke up with me nearly 2 years ago, I have not even made an attempt to date again. Outside of occasionally seeing a couple of friends that I cling onto since high school, I have little social activity. I live with my parents.

I had very little job / internship / volunteer experience during this time. My resume was very thin.

Outside of two times when I exercised for a few weeks at a time, I never made an effort to exercise, play sports, or stay in physical shape. 

You may ask what I did with all my spare time. For years, I have gone in and out of addictions of various kinds. Among my addictions were poker, video games, and pornography.

In the last year and a half, my video game addiction became very strong. I developed an obsession with one particular game, desiring to be one of the best.

In the 7 months preceding my turnaround, I found myself staying at home, making little or no effort to look for a job, rarely seeing friends, allowing my video game habit to consume nearly the entirety of my world. I was heavily reliant on pornography to nix my anxieties. I continued to believe that things would just get better one day... but this was always my biggest mistake. By believing that things simply would get better one day, I allowed my downward spiral to continue far longer than I ever should have.

---

**The Spark**

Five weeks ago, I attended a video game tournament. It wasn't the first one I had been to. But nearly everyone there was... very different from me. I didn't particularly like the people I forced myself to talk to. Not because they were bad people, but because they weren't people I aspired to be like. This was an event I had spent so many hours training for, and yet I felt miserable. I had a moment of realization that this wasn't where I wanted to be, not right now... and not ever. For what had I been training so hard? What were my goals, really? It might take me years of additional training to be as good as I wanted to be... But wait a minute, I'm going to be 28 in a couple of months. Before I know it my 20s will be over, and I will never get them back. This was supposed to be the best decade of my life, and it was passing me in a flash. These were all thoughts I had had thousands of times over... but in this instant, it hit me like broken glass.

I spent the entire commute home fuming. Fuming at the Don't Walk signs, fuming that the subway couldn't go any faster... and fuming at myself for wasting so many years of my life. Years that had infinite potential that I would never get back. I was resolved to better. I wasn't going to allow myself to waste any more time.

---

**How I Have Changed**

The first step was deciding that I was no longer allowed to play the video game I had sunk more than a year of my life into. I packed it away, and said goodbye to all the online friends I had made in the community. 

I forced myself to stop watching porn. This is something that made me waste many hours on a weekly basis. It also stagnated my desire for intimacy with real women. Even when I was in a relationship, this habit wrecked havoc on my sex life, as I was able to be aroused more easily by porn than I was by my partner. In the first week of trying to destroy this habit, I encountered some problems. I tried to convince myself that hentai was still okay. I tried to convince myself that nude massage videos were still okay. After a couple of steps back, I eliminated everything, no exceptions. A few weeks in, and I am much more in touch with my natural libido. I masturbate only once every few days now (instead of many times each day). My desire for real women has increased dramatically, and the way I communicate with women has improved.

Following these steps, I found myself with a completely blank schedule. What was I to do with my life now? Here are some of the things I have done:

- I applied for a bunch of internships and actually landed one. It involves writing and editing, which is a strength of mine. I am making a real effort and have felt great pride in the work I've done and the feedback I've received. I have updated my resume and am actively searching for job positions.

- I joined a gym, started running 5 days a week and weightlifting 3 days a week. Now, I usually begin my day with going to the gym.

- I took up rock climbing as a hobby.

- I changed my diet. I now keep the snacks and sweets to a minimum, and eat much more protein.

- I made a couple of new friends, and have made more of an effort to strengthen my relationships with my old friends. For many years, they would always ask me to do things... but that gets old fast, and I've lost friends this way before. I've actually made an effort to reach out to them so that we can hang out and have some fun together.

- I did some major clothes shopping. I also do my own laundry on a regular basis now. I make sure I look my very best every day before I leave my house.

- I read. I've been reading some fiction, but I've spent the most amount of time reading about current events, science and technology. I'm turning myself into a more informed person.

- I write. I'm crafting some articles that I will be able to include in my resume, and even more importantly, I'm proud of what I've written.

- I cleaned my bedroom (and bathroom) completely. I got rid of all my old stuff that had been cluttering my room for years, including my old clothes and school papers. My room is now somewhere I feel happy to spend time in.

- I go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier. I used to go to sleep anywhere from 2 to 4 AM, and wake up at around 9AM. Now I go to sleep sometime between 11 PM and midnight, and wake up at around 6:30 to 7 AM.

---

**Reflections**

All of this has only been five weeks, but my life is completely different now. Although I still live at home, am dependent on my parents for financial support, and have yet to begun dating again, I feel like I am doing what I need to do to fix those things. I now have confidence in myself that I will get things done. For the first time in ages, I feel happy with myself when I go to sleep at night. My only regret is that I didn't turn things around sooner... but what's done is done, I remind myself. I can only look forward.

Do I worry about reverting back to my bad habits? Yes, I would be crazy if I did not, given my history. But I have never had a turnaround close to this magnitude before... and in my heart, I feel like this truly is the great turnaround of my life.

I guess the biggest takeaway from my story is that one needs to recognize their destructive habits and simply force themselves to stop, no matter how difficult that seems. Without the option to engage in your destructive habits, the remaining option is simply to acquire productive habits... But even then, one needs to find the desire within them. Even if you tell yourself you want to be better, you might be lying to yourself if you think you want it more than continuing your addictions. And that's understandable, because our addictions can give us moments of pleasure and fulfillment within a cruel world... even while they ruin our lives.

Your desire to be better has to burn hotter than anything else within you, truly. I know how easy that sounds and yet how difficult it can be. But once my desire to be better truly trumped my desire for all my addictions, I felt it burning within me like a raging inferno. My desire fueled my will power, and I was finally able to force myself to cease my destructive habits, and my whole life changed for it. 

I think everyone needs a turnaround moment. You need to say, ""today is the day my whole life turned around,"" and *force* that to be true in the days and weeks and months and years to come. 

I have written quite a lot. But that's okay, because I really wrote this for me. And if by some unlikely chance it can be an inspiration to someone else, going through similar issues? Well that would be even better."
3yanj2,1,2015-12-26,Advice for a prospective owner.,YungKob,BMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/3yanj2/advice_for_a_prospective_owner/,"Hey all,

So I need some advice from you all. I am a junior-year college student with a stable, very well-paid internship until I graduate. I was just involved in a motor vehicle accident (not my fault) and my previous car, a VW Jetta, is most likely going to be claimed as a total loss. While I prepare for the settlement, I started shopping around for cars. A friend of mine who is looking to upgrade his current '06 325i gave me what I think is a phenomenal deal on his car: 5,500 cash on the spot and its mine. The car has around 80k miles on it. 

Now I ve always been a BMW fan, and I really wanted to get a car that is more fun to drive, and this looks like a greta car to do exactly that. However, I am more then well aware of BMW's maintenance problems once the car hits 100k + miles. I have a steady income, so I think I would be prepared to do maintenance. I also treat my cars like children, I don't slam on them or drive them into the ground. 

From your experience with BMW, is this a good deal for me? Price-wise, I am pretty sure it is a great deal. However, I am not sure how much the cost of ownership is going to be and if this car will last me a long time. Ideally, I'd like it to last me 4-5 years until I am out of college and start making some real money. Let me know any thoughts"

I'm a 25 year old, married, non-traditional student looking to transfer from a community college (currently at a 4.0) into the computer science program as a sophomore. Initially I was considering to transfer to Northwestern but my ACT score was only a 24 when I took the test back in high school.

I currently work for Loyola University Medical Center and am considering Loyola because of its tuition discount among other reasons. Does anyone know of any students that have received internships at Google, Microsoft, or any other top tech companies?

I'm debating on retaking the ACT in order to better qualify for Northwestern. The financial aid scholarship there is fantastic. I would end up only paying $2500 a year in loans. Additionally, I love the atmosphere of the school. The next best thing is obviously Loyola with my tuition discount.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

My issue is that i'm having trouble picking what specs I would need. I'm not the best at determining what I won't really need, and as a result I always spec high and under use.

So my needs...

I'm a college student who is becoming on the move from my campus more. Between trips to work, home, internships, trips, etc.. My Late 2012 iMac is stationary and can't be moved easily.

While on the go the system will primarily be used for Web browsing (Reddit, YouTube, News Sites, Social Media, Etc.), Word Processing, working in audacity/recording audio for a podcast, some minor video work if possible, and the occasional indie game on steam (Undertale, BoI, etc..)

What do you all think would be the perfect match for me in either the Pro 3 or 4? Obviously as a college student I can't blow big money so the farther away from a grand the better.
My concerns with the Pro 3 are if its showing its age, not being stocked anymore.

Some Off topic questions:
How does Comixology work on Surface? I read A LOT of comic books.

Are there any lesser known deals around? Microsoft seems to be sold out of most Pro 3's.
Thanks for all the help :)"

This happened about a year ago when I was a senior in high school. At the time, I was the Webmaster Intern for the school and my ""boss"" was the head of the business department. His friend was $BOSS from the local home realtor agency and needed somebody to revamp their website, seeing as it was very outdated. Cue $ME being hired as on-site tech support and Webmaster.  

*2 months later on a Monday*  
I busted a tire driving to the office so, after a lot of swearing, I put on the spare and call $BOSS to let him know I'll be late. While on phone, $BOSS lets me know that the network was down and that I need to fix it when I get in. The office was small, with only about 10 people actually staying on-site, so they use a old office grade router.  

&gt;**$ME**: Greets $BOSS and walk to server closet.   
&gt;Checks back of router, see that the Ethernet cable going to the network switch is undone.  
&gt;Notice a lot of cables between the switches are missing.  
&gt;Plug in cables and wait for traffic to resume through the switch.  
&gt;Pack up and go to desk.  

&gt;**$BOSS**: So what was the problem?  
&gt;**$ME**: There was just a *few* cables undone on the switch.  
&gt;**$BOSS**: Oh, yea. I thought I looked messy last week so I got rid of a bunch that didn't seem to need to be there.  

*Facepalms into oblivion*  

Tldr: Boss sucks and doesn't know how networking works.  

**Edit:** Holy crap this post blew up. I guess I'll write some more horror stories from my IT experiences lol. Thanks guys!"

I'm 23 years old and graduated college last May. I was hired directly out of my internship and am looking to finally upgrade my '98 Chevy Prizm. I could use a little advice.

Grew up in WI, currently live in Denver. Accustomed to snowy conditions. I work in the medical field so getting to and from work RELIABLY is critical. I don't drive my vehicle all that much, but little commutes/occasional road trips are what I mainly do.

I'm looking at purchasing this vehicle and holding onto it for ~10 years or longer if I really enjoy it.

Preferences: New (2015/2016), AWD, decent fuel economy, attractive design (subjective, I know), automatic transmission, $20-30k price range, room for a few passengers/some cargo (don't need a minivan), moderate ground clearance

Initially I've looked a bit at the Subaru Crosstrek for an overall package. I quite dislike the hatchback style of the Impreza and Outback, but I am still considering other options. I would also REALLY appreciate any personal reviews if anybody owns the vehicles they recommend.

Thank you!"

My ex girlfriend and I fell in love with eachother and 2 weeks after, she moved outside of the country for school internship.

Ofcourse after a while we faded away from each other and every holiday ended in drama. About 3 months ago we broke up for those reasons, as our holiday stranded on the 3th day.

Since a few days she's back in the country and I have already seen her and even had dinner at her parents.
When meeting her the day after she told me her feelings for me we're ""complicated"". I felt really lonely since the breakup and I was so happy to have her back here, but she didn't felt the same way.

By coincedence I saw an facebook message in my ""other"" inbox, it's filtered so it doesn't show up normally. It was dated from september (3 months ago) and it said:
""Your girlfriend has been cheating on you with ***** ****
she has been sleeping with him for 3/4 months.""

It made me cry, because after all she still broke my hearth....
I called her immediately and she kept denying and that people hated her there. But I still got my doubts, as the guy the unknown person mentioned was already A LOT in the picture when we had an relationship.

Now I listened to my closest friends and blocked her and her family on everything. 
It still hurts me to not know the exact truth, but the relationship we had drove me crazy, just as the fact I still have feelings for her now and she doesn't....

She was my first girlfriend, and I'm 21. I feel so fucking abandoned and lonely now..."

I've read many books on self actualization, goals, motivation and things like that in the past 5 years. Admittedly, I didn't try new experiences much but I at least decided to stop ""looking"" because I wasn't going to find anything.

So, I'm just gonna force myself to learn enough things, well enough to be a software engineer because I'm usually lazy. If I happen to hate being SE, well, tough luck for me. If not, then yaay. I don't know what else I could do any more. I tried being intern a few times, I also studied CS in college. They didn't help me make a decision."

This is just going to be an incoherent rant, I honestly don't expect anyone to bother reading this, I know I wouldn't. Also since I have friends that browse reddit this is a throwaway account since they would recognize my main account's name. I feel like there is something wrong with me, maybe I'm just depressed or I'm bipolar. I just feel dead most of the time, like I'm not really here. The only times I feel happy are when I'm doing something with friends but even though It's Christmas break they are all too busy to do anything. 

I feel like I've wasted my life and am continuing to do so. I'm 20 years old, I went to community college to get all my gen eds out of the way and to figure out what I want to major in but even after those 2 years and a semester break from school I'm still not comfortable with what major I've chosen. I feel like I'm just continuing school for the sake of making my parents happy, I'm unsure if I even want a job in the field I'm majoring in. The only subjects I really enjoy are history related but I'm too afraid to pursue a field where getting a job seems so unlikely. Not to mention my dad will despise me if I did.

I'm jealous of my friends, with the exception of one they all have found a major they enjoy and they know what kind of job they want and have already made progress doing internships to get it. I feel like whenever they talk about school they are rubbing it into my face without meaning to, seeing them feel confident about the direction of their lives just makes me feel like even more of a fuck up. The only one I can relate to is my one friend I mentioned earlier, he is even more of a fuck up than me and honestly I don't know how he hasn't killed himself yet. At least he has come to terms with it, I feel like I'm living a lie.

The more I think about my life the worse I feel. I've had opportunities other people wish for, living in a nice neighborhood, going to good schools, being middle class and having loving parents. But here I am, hating it all and hating myself more because I hate it all. It feels like a cycle that just feeds itself and brings me down even more. I should be enjoying my life and I should have some plan for the future but I don't and the fact that I haven't been able to accomplish either of those makes me a failure.

I have thoughts of suicide daily and I wish I could bring myself to act on it. Honestly the only reason I'm still alive is my parents, my dog, my friends, and a vein hope for my future. I have an idea for a book that I've been thinking over for three years now and have just begun writing it down. I think when I finish it and read it over, depending on how good it is I'll decide whether I should bother living or not. I don't see myself working a standard job, I've done office work before and have worked in retail and both jobs have made me hate my life even more. I just have a dream of writing some good series of books and getting rich or well off from that alone. It feels stupid and pointless but fuck it's the only thing I have going for me so I guess I might as well try it out.

In the mean time I'm just going to hope I get into an accident or something. I wish I would just be killed or maybe be able to apply for government benefits by being crippled. I dream of going to school next semester and there being a school shooter who either kills me or takes away my ability to walk. Just anything to end this stress and paranoia. Honestly, I don't think writing this all out has done any good for me. They say it's good therapy to write out all your problems or something like that but now that I've finished my rant I feel worse than when  I began. If you read all this then I guess thanks."

I've never been on this subreddit before, and I'm fairly new to Reddit as it is. I don't want to unload on anyone in real life, because I feel like it'll drive them away even further, so now I'm here. 

 I'll put some TWs just in case, because I don't want to hurt anyone. TW: rape, suicide, abuse

2015 is almost over and reflecting back on it, I'm shocked by how awful of a year it was. Fall 2014, I started college. It wasn't bad at all. I met some people, liked (most) of my classes, met a guy, started dating him. Then January came around and I moved out of my parents' house. They're verbally and physically abusive, and I had to pretend to be practicing their religion for them to accept me. They wouldn't let me live in my own apartment, so I moved into a student house filled with girls of the same religion whose parents were friends with mine. It was the only alternative to living at home at the time, and I took it, thinking things would get better. In a sense, being away from home was nice. I wasn't constantly stressed about the negative atmosphere I'd be coming back from school to. 

However, because I wasn't with them, my parents kept close tabs on me, which led to severe paranoia. I'm not ""allowed"" to date, and so if I was ever with my boyfriend and my parents called, I'd have severe anxiety attacks. My dad would stalk me in another car just to see where I was going or what time I got home. My mom would ask the other girls in the house to find out where I'd been and what I did on a daily/weekly basis. It was awful, and with every passing day, I felt myself getting more and more distant from my parents. 

The guy I was dating was my first, and I have insecurities that made it hard for me to convey my feelings to him. I always felt inadequate and didn't know how to word it, and it made the relationship complicated (for me). I'd wanted to have sex with him before, but it just didn't end up happening. The first time we did have sex, I didn't want to. I didn't feel like it, but I didn't say anything out of fear. Growing up with abusive parents makes you afraid to speak out or emote your feelings for fear of being treated poorly. I always fear rejection, so I just let him do what he wanted, even though it hurt. This happened a couple of times, and I would go home and cry about it. I always felt like he didn't care enough about me, and that if he knew all the things I went through as a child, he'd think I was fucked up and leave me. 

Eventually in March, I couldn't do it anymore. I tried to kill myself, but I didn't take enough pills and ended up in the hospital. I left, I told my boyfriend. He didn't say much. I felt awful. He didn't know what to say because he'd never been in that position before, and we both felt like shit. I didn't tell my parents about why I was in the hospital, said I was having panic attacks because midterms were stressing me out. 

In May, I got caught with my boyfriend by the girls I was living with. They slut-shamed me, called me names, and threatened me.Knowing they would tell my parents, I lived with my boyfriend's family for a month until they calmed down, because my home wasn't a safe environment at the time. 

I got into an internship that took place in Africa, and went away for two weeks in June. After that, I went to Boston to visit an old childhood friend who'd invited me there because she wanted to have a roadtrip. Her best friend came back just when I did, so instead of staying with her, I got my own empty room. For days, I sat in that room. My friend hardly checked on me or talked to me. I went 3-4 days without even having any human contact because she ignored me. There was no roadtrip. I just stayed in that room for two weeks. Coincidentally, my birthday was in July, and despite my mother sending reminders to this friend, she did absolutely nothing. I stayed in my room the entire day, felt awful and alone, and went out to have dinner by myself. I would have explored Boston if I'd had enough money and knowledge, but my friend, who is quite wealthy, had said ""all expenses paid"" when she'd invited me over, so I didn't have any resources. I felt fucking awful and my depression heightened and, while I was walking around feeling like shit on my birthday, I saw the train (metro? I'm from a city that doesn't rely on public transport as much so I'm not even really sure what it was called??) approaching and without thinking too much about it, I stepped in front of it. Someone pulled me back last minute but all I could think about was how much I'd wished the train had hit me. When I got home, my boyfriend and I were on the phone and I was pretending to be okay, but I burst into tears and told him what I did. He said he was busy and his friends were over. I was shocked and so, so hurt. This was the second time I'd attempted to kill myself EVER (and in the same year) and that was his response? I told him we were over, and I didn't speak to him for the rest of my stay in Boston. I don't think I've ever felt that alone and desperate in my life. 

I'm trying to keep this shorter so it doesn't bore you all to death but I came back, he begged me for a second chance and to start over, apologized for everything, including the nonconsensual sex (which he didn't realize I didn't want because I made it seem like I did) and after a while, we got back together as a leap of faith. I was back with my parents at this point, and determined to move out. I got a job, I found a girl who needed a roommate, I moved in with her, and things seemed to be looking up. My parents, however, were not okay with me moving out. They tried everything. They threatened me, they guilt-tripped me, they begged me to stay, they refused to let me leave the house, but eventually I did. Obviously, for the first week, I was just a huge ball of stress and anxiety because I felt so guilty about leaving my parents. I kept second-guessing myself. My boyfriend had just switched into the architecture major, and he was at the studio until 4-5 in the morning every day, with his earliest class being at 9 AM. I understand that he was really busy, and me being so stressed and hysterical that week must have been hard for him. One day, after days of working without sleep and being tired as hell, he told me he couldn't do this anymore, that I had too much emotional luggage and that he didn't love me anymore and he left. I was stupid enough to beg him to come back. Eventually I decided I would let it go as soon as I found out what made him stop loving me. He told me he didn't, but he was exhausted and so stressed from schoolwork and financial issues, and he decided it was the easiest way to end things. It hurt, but after long days of self-reflection, evaluation, and figuring out what was wrong and needed to be changed in our relationship, we got back together. 

I couldn't be happier now, with him. He's so supportive, he's always making me the happiest I've ever been, and he makes me feel like I'm the most amazing and beautiful person on the whole planet. My love life is wonderful, but my roommate turned out to be crazy. Someone has a restraining order against her because she beat the shit out of them, I figured out she's secretly dealing drugs to make extra money, she shows a lot of signs of being bipolar and has the shortest temper ever, and on top of that, she's trying to purchase a gun. I also found out she's stealing for me, so I'm currently looking for a new roommate. I've found some potential ones who seem a lot better than her, so I'm working on fixing that. Because she was stealing from me, and because I had some medical issues, my financial situation has been awful, despite having two jobs and an on and off tutoring gig, so that's been stressing me out lately too. 

I don't know how things are going to get better. Other than my love life, nothing seems to be looking up. I'm constantly considering dropping out of college and checking myself in somewhere because I feel like I'm completely alone in the world. My boyfriend tries to be helpful, but he doesn't even wake up when I have my practically daily nightmares that give me panic attacks (things like flashbacks in dreams of getting beat up as a kid, etc). I know it's not his fault, since he lives an hour away and he's always at work or at the studio and constantly tired, and I don't blame him, but none of my friends are what I would consider to be ""true/real"" friends. Besides, I feel like if I keep telling him about my feelings, he'll say I have too much ""emotional luggage"" again, even though he says it's the biggest mistake he's ever made in his life and he swears up and down that he would never put me in that situation again. I believe him, but because of my fear of rejection, I'm still scared. I feel that way with friends too: if they know too much about how I am, they'll get bored/annoyed/disgusted and walk away. 

I feel helpless. I keep trying to motivate myself to keep moving/pushing forward, but for what? The years have progressively been getting worse, with this year being, hands down, the most fucking awful year ever. I don't know what to do, what to think, how to feel (other than miserable). 

If you have any words of advice, or any stories of your own to share, please go ahead. I don't know why I even wrote this. I just wanted to get it out there. And in case anyone suggests this: I am going to therapy, but it's really not helping. "
3ycve5,1,2015-12-26,A question about job titles and resumes,bits-and-bytes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ycve5/a_question_about_job_titles_and_resumes/,"Hello! 

I am graduating this May with a BS in CS, and I have a software engineering job lined up at a great company. However, I am worried about the fact that I had incorrectly listed my title for one of my jobs on my resume while I was interviewing with the aforementioned company.

The summer after my sophomore year, I did research at my university through a program that sponsors minority students (let's call it organization X) who want to engage in research. Technically, my title was Organization X Research Intern. However, on the resume I used while I was interviewing, I had my position listed as Undergraduate Researcher. I put Undergraduate Researcher as my title simply because I did not know we were given ""official"" titles, and therefore chose a job title which most accurately conveyed what I did. 

The research position in and of itself was completely legitimate. All organization X did was provide us with a stipend, and some ""soft-skills"" workshops. I did legitimate research, though we did not publish at that time.

I spoke to the director of organization X, who coordinated the summer research program, and she said this was fine since the two titles were practically synonymous. 

However, I am still concerned that this may perhaps be an issue. What do you guys think? Should I tell my recruiter about the incorrect title? "

I am a 19-year-old U.S. university student studying Computer Science and Linguistics (hoping to go into translation software--or at least software--development), and I am currently halfway through my second year at university. I hope to move to Western or Central Europe upon graduation, whether for graduate school or a job. With French (at B2) and German (A2) in progress, I believe I will be linguistically prepared for a variety of options. My reasons for wanting to move are those of work-life balance, better financial security/safety net after having become a PR/citizen, and the best Computational Linguistics schools' and companies' presences there.

The countries I'm eyeing are France (likely Rennes or Marseille), Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and Austria. I have around $15,000 in savings and currently have a job; I plan to add more to that savings account in the meantime. My questions are these: 

1. What can I do over the course of the next couple years to make the process of immigration much more likely to happen and go smoothly, aside from having the patience of a rock? My grades are flawless, I have internships lined up, and I have no debt and will likely not have any upon graduation.

2. If I should be networking, how should I go about it to gain connections over there? I have one connection in French-speaking Switzerland that I regularly talk to, but no others at the moment.

3. How can I get a job on the other side a few years from now, given the strict requirements of each country for immigration and the fact that I will need an employer to sponsor me? "

3ydmeo,31,2015-12-27,I screwed up my first job.,Misterlulz,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ydmeo/i_screwed_up_my_first_job/,"I just got done going through my father's computer. Back in October I found an unsent ""goodbye"" letter in a Word doc that was addressed to me. For whatever reason, I decided to take another look at it tonight - I was too embarrassed to give it a thorough read the first time, after all - and I just couldn't help but feel ashamed for myself. The letter essentially said that he was proud of how well I did in school and during my job hunt, and how I was ""gonna kick this job's ass."" Who knew I'd be out of work within six months.

I'll start from the beginning, I guess: I worked my ass off at school and graduated with a 3.78 gpa. Albeit, I majored in Communications, so the workload was a bit easier than a STEM or Business major, but I was so proud of myself nonetheless. That, coupled with five internships and a spot as editor of my college's newspaper, I felt that I was more than prepared for life.

I didn't really fit in at my school. It was a small, liberal arts college in the Midwest and the vast majority of the students were athletes. All the students, it seemed, stuck to their cliques that consisted almost exclusively of their fellow teammates.*Who needs friends at this place?* I would tell myself as I saw my peers socialize with one another. *When I get out of here, I'm going to be well on my way to an awesome career and a happy life.*

While I wouldn't admit it at the time - and part of me still doesn't like admitting it now - I think part of the reason I buried myself in my work was because I felt like a social misfit. I had one person who I could call a friend throughout the whole time I attended my school. I'd often pondered what I'd do without him, as if it weren't for him, I'd have nobody to hang out with. 

Once we lost touch, though, that would turn out to be the case. Still, when I buried myself in my work, I didn't really notice it as much. 

Nevertheless, I'd passively look down at my peers all the while telling myself how much more ""prepared"" for life I was than them. But really, when I look back at it, I wasn't. I wasted four-and-a-half years of my life studying. I learned a lot, sure, but that can't replace all the friendships and parties one normally experiences in college.

I have actually developed a weird aversion towards people who seemed to have enjoyed themselves at college - weird, right? Whenever I hear an older, gray-haired man reminisce on his care-free youth, or a young coed talk about how much fun she has at her new school and how many friend's she's making, I start to get jealous. It starts to upset me. It's ridiculous, I know, but I can't help but feel like I missed out on something that I can never get back and I have a tendency to let it irritate me.

The crazy thing is I'd be in the same position I am now if I just acted like everybody else for a change and partied a little more. I don't know, I just think it's crazy how society espouses traits like *uniqueness*, and *individuality* as something people should strive for, yet these values seem inconsistent with what gets one ahead in life: i.e. fitting into a specific, rigid box and molding one's self to societies expectations. Lately, I've been trying hard to fit myself into that mold; trying to become what people expect of me. It's easier said than done, but I figured it was worth a try.

At any rate, when I received this job offer last January I was so damn excited. I went through five interviews to get this job. But what I was most proud of was that I got it all on my own. Nobody helped me, I had no connections and I had earned this job offer through hard work and perseverance. 

It was crazy, the moment that I had been waiting for had finally come. After going through four and a half years of school and having to live at home for part of my education, I felt like an actual adult for the first time in my life.

My mom was so proud of me and had helped me a lot along the way, even when I was an asshole teenager. I remember she cried before I moved out of state for my job and said that I could always visit but things ""would be different"" now that I finally moved out of her house.

She was wrong. Within six months I'd be out of a job and within another three I'd be moving my personal belongings back home.

I know I didn't do particularly well at this job, but I was new. I knew nothing about the industry and thought that I'd have a mentor who would guide me and - perhaps, naively - hold my hand as he taught me how to manage a store. 

It wasn't like that at all, though. My two months of training didn't prepare for the job ahead of me and my first day at my new position I was bombarded with tasks I knew nothing about. It didn't help that I made a mistake my second week out of training (I sold a big customer the wrong paint) costing the store roughly $10,000 and, not to mention, my boss her annual bonus.

At the end of the day, my boss didn't want me there. She couldn't fire me - she admitted it herself - but she seemed to be on top of any little mistake I made. It eventually got to the point where I couldn't even ask her any questions. If I did, she would record it and run to the district manager or HR lamenting how I was ""X months along and still didn't know what such-and-such item was used for."" 

I knew not every store in the company was like this. One time I ran into a worker at another store while running errands for work. We must have chatted for 10-15 minutes while he spoke with me about the job and his past experience. He offered to answer any questions I had and encouraged me to call his store if I ever needed help with anything.

Looking back, that was probably one of my best memories of my job. Still, I really wish I had not taken that position, or rather, I wish I went to the Lexington store when I had the chance. The sales manager even *asked me* if it would be alright if he changed my assigned store after training to the one I was eventually assigned to. I wanted to be a ""yes-man"" so I agreed, and while hindsight is 20/20, I can't help but feel I made a big mistake.

The mistake is made even more obvious when I look at my bank account. When I finally left (when it was made clear that no matter what I did, how hard I tried, nothing would have worked and I would have eventually been pushed out of my position), I had over $9,000 in my account. I just took another look and I'm down to roughly $1,200. I remember spending that money on food. I was really depressed and started to eat a lot. If I remember correctly, I spent over $700 on food one month. Maybe that would explain the 20 pound weight gain.

At the end of the day, I know I screwed up and I know it was my fault. I screwed up a good job opportunity and I feel like I sullied my good reputation as a hard worker to not only my peers, but myself.

I'm hoping that this all happened for a reason and perhaps it did: I have decided to pursue writing in my free time and perhaps, with luck, I'll be able to get something published one day. I'm not a great writer *yet* but I know I will be if I work at it. I have faith in my self and I think my family does as well. 

I know this is just a bump in the road and that's what I keep telling myself. Some days are easier than others, though. It just sucks that, for the time being, I'll be out of work and I get upset when I realize that my career may have to take a detour while I work my next job - I really hate the idea of being behind in my career when comparing myself to my peers - but I know that if I work my ass off, try really hard at what I do and perhaps most importantly, pray, everything will work out in the end.

**tldr?** - I lost my first job out of college and had to move back in with family. I spent a lot of time working hard in school and was upset that my hard work in school didn't translate well into my first job.

3ydmhm,8,2015-12-27,Second bachelor's or build portfolio?,helmutkilo40,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ydmhm/second_bachelors_or_build_portfolio/,"Hi all, I'm a career changer who wants to work in software development, and I'm looking for specific advice. I'm 24, and graduated from an Ivy League university with a BA in History in 2014 (I know, believe me I regret it). I started taking CS courses during my senior year, and now have continued to take CS courses (and math pre-reqs) as a non-degree student at a local state university. At this point I've taken courses in Python, C, and Java, as well as Data Structures, Discrete Math, and Object Oriented Programming.  I had an internship this summer where I ended up doing database development for the company's database, and a have a few side projects, though I've been so busy with school and a part time job that I haven't been able to really dig into them. 


I applied and have been admitted to a second bachelor's degree in CS at this university, but I'm not sure if it's the right move. Part of me feels like I know enough to pass a technical interview (not with the Big n, but with smaller companies and start ups), and that if I invested time in my portfolio, and learning the skills I want to develop (mobile development), I would be able to land an okay entry level position.


If I earn a second BS in CS, it will most likely cost me around $50,000 in loans and 3 years of further study (I have no debt from my first degree).  I like studying, and I like coursework, and have felt that it helps me get a better understanding of what's working under the surface, and has made me more confident as a programmer.  I'm also interested in learning advanced topics like AI and Machine Learning. But I don't know if the time and money spent on getting another bachelor's is worth it at this point in my life, and I am aware that this state university is not in the Top 5, but the Top 50. 


But, I also don't want the lack of a degree in CS to hold me back during my career. I'm very serious about a career in software development and the tech industry, and I don't want to be 35 years old and passed over for a promotion or paid less because I don't have a degree in CS. If a degree in CS is that important in this industry, then I can invest the time in getting a degree now rather than later. 


Furthermore, I keep getting mixed advice. Everyone I talk to who works in industry says to just get a job, and everyone I talk to in academia tells me to get a degree. What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear from people who are well into their careers. "

I've lost ALL motivation and if I don't get it back I could ruin my future plans/life,fivefeetevil,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3ydu6p/please_help_me_ive_lost_all_motivation_and_if_i/,"I am currently a college junior studying abroad in China. What should have been an awesome experience has turned into the most trying time of my life. I go to a small but prestigious private college in the United States, known for it's academic rigor. When they sent me and 4 of my friends here, they loaded ridicoulous demands on us, and left us with a program coordinator (no relationship to the college) who is largely unproffesional and largely absent. It's a newer study abroad program, and thus underdeveloped but I did not realize how much so until we were stranded here.
We were told we get financial help to pay for food and transportation from our very very VERY expensive school but we didn't. 

I come from a family that is beneath the poverty line. I financed my trip on my own, but had to pay the school 1,450 dollars to a tuition hike that my scholarships no longer covered. I am now broke. I now live off of about 20 dollars a week in Shanghai China from my family. I ran out of money today (which this has been happening for weeks) and I ate breakfast but I won't be eating lunch or dinner. I did have a teaching job to mitigate this, but the mother no longer needed my services. I have no other income coming in.

I also have 4 hours of chinese 5 days a week. On top of that, I and the other students dealt with the stress of a miscommunication from our school to the program coordinator who told our intern sites that we would also be working 4 days a week, to complete 200 hours. We all had hour long commutes which both sites refused to cover transportation costs. It cut into my food money greatly every week. A month in, we had convinced the school in the U.S that the time was far too much, kept us from being able to study (it did) and was more hours than we would receive credit-wise. They changed it to 3 days a week, which damaged our relationship with our boss and the work was that much harder.

All of this stress has caused me to stop having a period. I only eat twice a day (which is so much better than so many other people around the world, but it is taking it's toll). I'm a college athlete and alot of my muscle mass has evaporated. My skin is dull and it breaks out. I'm tired all of time. I constantly run out of money to eat with and have to wait a day or two until someone back home can pitch in for me (which i am grateful for). The pollution in Shanghai made me sick, I am black, so I'm constantly being stared at, followed, having pictures taken of me, being harassed/groped by men, or disrespected.

My finals are in about 2 weeks and I cannot bring my self to study. This christmas weekend my friends with richer families all went to travel. I stayed behind and I am alone. I have spent the past 3 days in my bed for hours, only going out to eat the last two days, and not today after breakfast because I now have no more money to eat. My mom is not sure if she can send anything tomorrow. I cannot study, I cannot write my papers, I cannot get out bed, and I cannot work out. I cant do anything. As soon as I get up I just want to lay back down. I have been on Reddit or youtube or facebook for hours doing NOTHING. This is not like me. I am an honors student, who has always worked hard.

I feel like...I am caged in here. I really need help so I can study again ASAP and hopefully make good grades before I leave.

TLDR: Stressed and burned out in China. Please give me some advice on how to make it the next 3 weeks and study for my finals until I return home"

3yekyk,14,2015-12-27,paganism + anger,aherewego,Wicca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/3yekyk/paganism_anger/,"I used to post here very frequently but I have not been able to recently (grad school, internship, work have taken over my life.) I have not been able to practice as much, and my spirituality is changing. I used to be very ritual based, but I've realized that it is time to make sure I am incorporating my beliefs daily - core beliefs, like harm thee none, threefold law, etc.


Now, to the question. Philosophically I have no problem with these beliefs and I try to embody them. No one is perfect by any means.


I had a pretty rough childhood and it has left me with a lot of unresolved anger. This anger is beginning to rear its head in my life. I'm in therapy. I try to eat right (I don't have time to exercise and don't enjoy it very much but hike on occasion.) I do give myself some basic time for self care, but it's never enough.


But my anger persists and grows and it is destroying me and my ability to embody these beliefs. When I am angry I want to destroy myself and everyone around me ... the energy I am beginning to build in this way quite honestly frightens me. I know I won't physically harm anyone, but I can be very cruel and I fear this. Even if I am not, the energy isn't good for me and I fear what happens when I will eventually release it. Sometimes I think about how I would enjoy cursing someone who has made me angry. These are VERY dangerous thoughts that I in NO WAY ethically agree with.


I'd like to note that while I am not a Wiccan, and more of a pagan, I do think cursing is a pretty big no-no. Some cases are gray for me but in the long run end up harming the person who cast them and are probably not worth my time. So I refrain from doing them.


Any interest in most positive spirituality things, like meditation, has left me. I don't even try to meditate anymore, I feel like I am forcing something I don't want on myself.

Perhaps I am no longer a Wiccan/Pagan?

My question here is, am I alone in this? Anyone go through something similar? What can I do to help me stay on my path - and deal with this large amount of anger I am working with? Is there some type of magickal tool that can act as a vessel to store my anger, releasing me of it, but making sure it stays out of the world?
Thanks for sticking through this long, perhaps icky post. All opinions welcomed."

Sly told ESPN on Saturday night that he recanted his story to Al Jazeera when he realized that it had used information he had ""made up"" to Liam Collins, a British hurdler and the undercover reporter who he said was trying to get into the supplementation business.

Sly said he was a student intern at the Guyer Institute in 2013 rather than 2011, as the Al Jazeera story alleges.

He told ESPN he was ""testing"" Al Jazeera's undercover reporter by dropping ""names like Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter, Ryan Howard and James Harrison."" He said none were clients. While Manning, Howard and Harrison were mentioned in Al Jazeera's HGH investigation, Jeter was not.

""When I realized Al Jazeera was using a secret taping and Collins as a so-called investigative reporter, I was baffled,"" Sly said. ""I cannot believe that can happen. That's why I recanted the story. It wasn't true, and I was trying to pull one over on Collins to see if he had any idea of what he was talking about.

""I was trying to determine whether this guy [Collins] was legitimate or just trying to steal some knowledge about the business.""


This honestly seems like a legitimate response form the source and makes perfect sense whether he felt he was prospective client or what he claims here is irrelevant despite what Pats fans may say. "

As a software engineer, my best ability to increase decentralization is to work on an alternative implementation. Unfortunately, I'm a full time student with profitable projects of my own, a part time job, and full time summer internships. If there is funding for alternative node development, I could drop the part time job and personal projects. I'm guessing several others are in similar situations.

Is anyone aware of funding possibilities for a development team making a full alternative node implementation? I'm imagining it would have user-configurable BIP 100 / Unlimited / etc. support, and be a dedicated node without wallet support. Wallets would be separate projects, as they've been planning to do eventually with Core.

3yg3p6,3,2015-12-27,[Troubleshooting] I might have killed my motherboard and PSU,kukiric,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3yg3p6/troubleshooting_i_might_have_killed_my/,"**Final Update (3 days after post):**

So, after sending the parts in for testing in a computer shop, one of the technicians (the owner) concluded that both the motherboard and PSU are fried, but everything else is fine (including the GPU). The PSU was delivering incredibly unclean power (5v variation going both ways on the 12v rail alone), which might have blown a capacitor near the 24 pin power socket after a few failed boot attempts.

It's still unclear as to whether the contact with the glue was actually the cause, but the owner suggested it could instead have been a combination of the PSU being old (4+ years) and extended use of unclean power (my house doesn't even have proper grounding, so that could've contributed to the long term damage).

I'm actually going to RMA the parts, as even though it's unlikely I'll get any replacements due to the provided conditions, they're both still under warranty so it's worth a try. In any case, the motherboard can be repaired by a specialized company instead of replaced, and I was already planning to upgrade my PSU in the near future (going to scale down to SFX for better case compatibility).

Finally, thanks to everyone who read the thread and tried to help. It's sad that half of my primary PC is dead, but at least I can get my old desktop up and running with a new PSU until I build my dream mini-ITX machine.

**Update (1 hour 15 mins after original post):**

Just tried the PSU on my old computer, known working at the time of the new build. The PSU fan spins once and shuts down, while nothing else on the system shows any signs of life. No onboard LEDs, no front panel LEDs, no USB power, and the CPU fan doesn't even twitch. Just the PSU fan, and that's it.

I hope this means that my PSU took the fall for the old system, and my (new) motherboard is still fine, as PSUs are much easier to replace and I was going to upgrade it later anyway. It isn't possible that the PSU got damaged and killed my previous motherboard as well when I plugged it in though, is it?

**tl;dr:**

Glued antenna connector into place, spilled some of it into motherboard, which probably killed the system when it turned on. Nothing happens when I press the power button anymore, please help.

**Story:**

So I built a new Mini-ITX taking advantage of some Black Friday sales, and after many delays, the whole thing arrived at around the second week of December. With new mobo, CPU and case in hands, plus my previous PSU, GPU and drives, I started building everything right away. After a few hours, everything was done and working fine, phew.

Except one thing: the Wi-Fi antennas. For some reason, the little connector screw came loose and I couldn't screw the disk on the other side (dunno what it's called) to hold it in place, because hand-screwing in the antennas in would just make it come loose again. It was pretty sad to see the antennas always drop into the lowest position they could, so I applied some instant super glue to both connectors. Fast forward a few minutes to put the system back together, and everything was working perfectly ever since.

But yesterday, something happened. One of the antenna connectors came loose again, and the antenna wouldn't stay up anymore. I already knew what to do, but couldn't find the same glue I used before, so I just grabbed a couple of different glues from an old drawer (mistake #1). After getting frustrated because the first one was expired (a lot of liquid came out, and didn't have any glue strength anymore), I cleaned it up with some Q-tips (without disassembling the antenna part of the mobo, BIG mistake), and applied another kind of glue I found. Everything looked fine after that, so after about 20 minutes I turned the system on, with little regard of what had just happened.

The system booted fine for a few seconds until it got to the desktop, then suddenly it rebooted without any warning. I quickly shut down the PSU, and attributing it to bad luck (Maybe a cable wasn't really all the way in? Maybe something else caused it to crash? Software issue maybe?), just checked up on all the cables, removed the GPU and drives, and turned it on again (my biggest regret). To my surprise, the system failed to boot a few times with the fans just spinning for a second, followed by a reboot. The cycle repeated a few times, and just was I was about to open it up again to reseat the power connectors and RAM (common symptoms and all), the whole thing died.

The power button didn't show any sign of life. No more LEDs, no more fans spinning, and obviously no video signal on the mobo. All that was left was a heart crushing silence and a very expensive paperweight. In a flash, I quickly disassembled the whole system (again) down to the motherboard and unscrewed the antenna connector part (huh, didn't know it was removable until recently), and found there was *still* glue under there. I quickly dashed to grab some more Q-tips and alcohol, and rubbed it the best I could without breaking anything else.

Right now, the motherboard is sitting on top of its box with only the ATX 24-pin power and CPU 4-pin power connected, and the PSU is not plugged into the wall. I'm trying my best right now not to cry as I was very proud of this build, which was *very* expensive (I live in Brazil, so things cost twice as much and the overall income rates are way lower). Even though my parents paid for this upgrade, I  still have some money I've been saving up from a paid internship to get a new GPU, but it's enough to replace either the motherboard or PSU (or both in February) if the worst has happened.

**Pictures:**

Top of the motherboard under the antenna connector (you can see the cleaning left some residue, but nothing that should cause anything to short): http://i.imgur.com/ehC4Eqc.jpg

Back of the motherboard near where the glue got spilled (top right looks like it has a burned spot between the solders?): http://i.imgur.com/SEkafnK.jpg

The antenna connector piece, with glue in excess resting near the bottom (no liquid left after cleaning): http://i.imgur.com/2r1TPdt.jpg

**Closing words:**

Please, I know not all of you are experts, but I hope someone can at least shed some light on what might have happened, and whether I really killed the motherboard, PSU, or both. I can do more tests, buy only after I'm sure it's safe enough to put the parts under more risk (I really, really, really don't want to ruin the CPU as it's the most expensive part).

**Edit:** I did ground myself correctly every time. The system worked fine for a while and rebooted on its own, so it can't be ESD.

**Edit 2:** Nothing smelt of burning during or after the fact, nor was there any kind of noise other than the usual click that my PSU fan makes when it turns off.

**Edit 3:** See the ""Update"" section at the top.

**Edit 4:** Final update."

I obviously lacked the experience he was looking for, but he was still interested in me. He advised me to download and install Microsoft Server 2012 and play around with it and he told me to look into virtualization. Afterwards, he told me to keep him updated on how everything goes.

So far, I've downloaded and worked with both VMware's workstation and Oracle's Virtualbox. On Microsoft server, I learned how to create an Active Directory Service for the server and establish both the DNS and DHCP for the server. I want to know where to go next from here. It seems like I will get a job from the IT department, probably an internship. I've also looked into certifications as well. I want to know, am I heading the right direction? "

I am the one in the building everyone calls when they need computer help such as reconnecting their internet or showing them how to add a graphic in Word.
I also teach a few classes on basic programming and electronics.

I don't have any CS education but I understand how programming works, how to use software, how to connect hardware, and I can learn whatever I need to fairly quickly. I think my biggest strength is that I can teach people without confusing them, so I would to do training or customer support (not just like reading script though, actually helping solve problems) and I could also do things like setting up computers or configuring routers but I might have to look a few things up first.

This is the job I got almost right out of college with now much searching and a lot of luck involved, so I don't know much about a first career search, never mind pivoting to a different career.

Some Questions:
*are there certain certifications that are worth getting?
*How do you set up an internship? Are they already decided by the company or can I email a company and ask if i can tag along with someone for a month
*What kind of job titles should I be searching for?  I know I'm not a Lead App Developer but I'm at least some kind of Help Desk. What does Tier 1 mean?

3yha6x,2738,2015-12-27,"Submitted my last check for my tuition! All 4 years by myself, no loans!",CEOChip,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yha6x/submitted_my_last_check_for_my_tuition_all_4/,"Long time lurker of this sub. Just a little bit of a background...

I come from a working class family where not one intermediate family member has gone to college. Upon graduation from High School, I was pressured by my parents to not attend college and to pursue a blue-collar job just like my brother and sister. They believed that I would do just fine with just a decent job and didn't like the risk I was taking with college. 

I told them I didn't want a decent job. Now... I am aware that you can get a good job without a degree but that's besides the point. My parents were unable to help with any financial contribution to my tuition and I absolutely refused to take out any loans because of the financial burden it would have on my future after graduation.

In order to make this work, I ended up commuting to my college for my first 2 years. My 3rd year I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment on the edge of campus and this year (final year) I live in a 3 bedroom apartment on the edge of campus. 

Commuting obviously saved me a ton of money because of the rent aspect so my parents did end up helping me there. 

I ended up working about 30 hours a week since the start of my freshman year of college until recently where I picked up a 2nd job upping my hours to around 50 hours a week. Note that this was maintaining a full-time schedule with school. Tuition was about 4.5k per semester and I took a few summer classes which ranged from 1-3k per summer for 3 summers. 

During this recent Summer (2015), I pursued two study abroad programs through my University. I ended up applying for a large amount of scholarships to help out for this which cut the cost down to about 1/3. Before the trip...my junker of a car broke down and it wasn't worth getting it fixed so I bought a newer ish car for around 11k out of pocket. 

I lived sort of frugally throughout these last 4 years to be able to accomplish all of this and I consistently applied for scholarships throughout all 4 years as well. Scholarships took about half of the cost down for my tuition expenses.

TL;DR - Worked my ass off, applied for scholarships, kicked my college tuition's ass.

EDIT 1: Addressing some questions and concerns from the comments... I double major in Entrepreneurship and Marketing. I currently go to an in-state University. With my job that I had through all of college, I was able to do a lot of my emailing and research on slow days and I took a 1-2 online classes along with classes on campus. My 2nd job that I picked up for my senior year was a bouncer job (security) at a local college bar where the hours were 3rd shift so it cut into my sleep schedule but it gave me a secondary source of income.

EDIT 2: I just turned 22 as well. Some people are questioning my field of study as well as the University I currently attend because it wasn't expensive and prestigious. I have job offers lined up and am working with a job coach that is guiding me to phenomenal employers. For the spring of 2016, I landed an unpaid internship at a federal level in a nearby location. They are working me a minimum of 18hours per week which cuts heavily into my current workload and time. I know I am taking a huge risk with the ""unpaid' factor and my time but this will make my resume look very strong.

EDIT 3: The feedback here is overwhelming and I wish I can show you guys how much I appreciate the positive comments. I have been following this sub reddit now for quite awhile now and every story or piece of advice submitted on this sub has helped me and is helpful to others. Again, thank you so much for the positive feedback! Happy holidays!"

Let me just give you a quick background on me. I graduated in 2012 with a bachelors in business administration. I quickly found out that, while great, my education didn't equip me with any hard skills. Since then, I've been slowly self teaching and taking computer science classes at community colleges. I'm hoping to try and get enough prereqs cleared so I can apply to a masters program and, in the future, find a career in computer security. I've taken several programming courses, computer architecture/ASM, web development, and am now working on math courses. Since 2008, I've been working nonclinical roles in healthcare. I've slowly worked my way up the ladder and currently work as a supply chain analyst at the corporate office of a decently-sized hospital chain. 

My job is pretty stable, the income isn't terrible (a little over 50k/year) and I have an amazing team. I was recently offered a position at a stand alone hospital doing what I currently do now for $65k/year. The kicker is they know I want to work in IT in the future and also said they'd set up formal sessions with their network engineers so I could learn the ropes. After seeing how it goes, it could turn into a one-day-per-week internship as long as it doesn't affect my or the network engineers' work.

I was really happy about this! I have no real IT experience and networking knowledge is essential for my future career so this opportunity looked really good. 

I told my current superior that I was considering another job because it aligned more with my future goals. She ended up giving me a counter offer of almost $70k and also spoke to the VP of IT about my career goals. She told me she received a commitment from him to have the regional director of Computer Security work with me so I could have the same type of internship deal as the other hospital. 

I was floored. We have a ton of hospitals, so getting a commitment from the VP of IT to allow me to not just learn in his department but specifically in **computer security** is something that I never thought would happen. Because the offers are nearly identical, I've decided to stay at my current job since we're much larger than the standalone facility and I feel I'd possibly get more out of the IT internship here than the other.

I'm not sure what I need from you guys but I'm both extremely excited and scared at the same time. I've made no exaggerations as to my experience in that field, so they know I don't have much. I know that one doesn't just jump into a career into computer security so I feel like I'm extremely lucky to have this opportunity and I don't want to screw this up. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should be learning, looking for, questions to be asking during this time? 

*Sidenote - I'm not worried about being terminated within a few months of accepting this counter offer. My boss and I have a really good relationship and, while I'm not irreplaceable, what I do is essential. Getting rid of me would cause much more damage than do good and with the rate we're growing, we are actually in need of more employees in my department*

**tl;dr:** Work in supply-chain, got a counter-offer from my boss which includes an internship in computer security. No netsec experience, what I should be learning, looking for, or questions should I ask my trainer?

**First hour:**


* The studio has been disinfected again because Fez was in yesterday with his boil that may or may not be MRSA.

* Opie says that management told Fez he can't come back in studio until he gets diagnosed by a doctor. Apparently there wasn't any good news yesterday since they cleaned the place again.

* They have a new bunch of interns on the show and check out Intern Stevie, who is fat and has thick glasses. They read his ""bio."" They see some of his ""likes"" (Devo, Big Country) and wonder if the kid is retarded.


* Sam explains they have told Stevie he has to come up with a new bit idea for the show every day. They read a few include a really hacky ""Schlong Soda"" ad.

* They invite Intern Stevie into the studio. They ask him to come up with a second hit by Big Country, and he can't. They ask if he's retarded, and he says no but he gets that a lot. He explains he has an eye condition called nystagmus which causes his eyes to wander uncontrollably. They try to test his eyesight and ask how bad it is. They have him sing ""In a Big Country"" a capella.

* They find out Stevie and Ant both went to the same elementary school in East Islip. Also Stevie's parents recently separated. They ask Stevie why he's still a virgin. Opie asks to see Stevie's glasses, and he sees that they're all bent and busted up. They all try on Stevie's glasses and see how horrible his vision is. He's just short of the legal limit to be able to drive a car. They have him read a list of the top 20 mean names people have called him. Some of them are ones that Sam made up. Jimmy points out that Stevie has tiny hands.

**Second hour:**


* The top one on the list is ""Fat Drew Carey Motherfucker."" His least bothersome of the lot #20 is ""faggot."" They come up with some new ones as he reads.

* They have him read the ""Schlong Soda"" script over a music bed. They ask if he has any broadcast experience, and he talks about going to sportscasting camp. He says when he called basketball games he couldn't tell any of the kids apart.

* Listener comments come in comparing him to Mark David Chapman and John Candy's character in Vacation

* Someone also thinks he looks like the ""Warcraft guy from South Park.""

* Opie offers to buy Stevie new glasses if he lets Opie shave his head like that character. He relents and says yes, but Opie has mercy and backs down.

* Sam says they also have a female and a non-white intern. Jimmy boos.


~ break ~


* They talk about Michael Grimm winning America's Got Talent the previous night. They are reminded last year's winner was Kevin Skinner, and Travis says that Skinner's album didn't crack the Billboard 200.

* They play a Kevin Skinner song and trash the lyrics.

* Caller says the million dollar prize for that show is actually paid out over 40 years.

* Anthony talks about watching Death Wish 3 last night. He says the gang leader looks like Bill Burr and everything about the film is ridiculous.

* They start watching the movie and tear it apart. Ant says it was so horrible he couldn't take his eyes off it. They reveal that the gang leader is in fact the guy who played Chuck, Richie Cunningham's older brother on Happy Days who was written out in the second season.

* Ant talks about how some guy once chicks give blowjob advice by saying they should make a Charles Bronson face so their teeth wouldn't scrape his dick.

* Jimmy says the last Death Wish movie was cancer looking for Bronson and Jill Ireland. Too soon?

* Caller says his 12-year-old son was watching last night too and thought the movie was hilarious. Ant asked if his son enjoyed the rape scene.

* They talk about the character known as the Giggler. Jimmy's face gets hot in embarrassment.


**Third hour:**

* Opie notices a lot of suits in the office today, and Jimmy quips, ""There's a giant acquisition happening."" Mild speculation ensues. ""Is this guy coming in to fire us?""


* They play a clip of Jimmy's Raw Dog show featuring Bob Kelly talking about blowing a guy in exchange for a steak when he was young.


**Rich Vos and Bob Kelly enter the studio**


* Vos brings up hanging out at the ""picnic"" at Nick DiPaolo's two weeks ago, and they argue about the semantics of what you call a barbecue.

* Rich brings up Opie's messed up nose and gets off a few good lines about it. Then they tell Vos to stop immediately because he always goes one line too far and bombs when this happens. They talk about Nick's barbecue and the fact that Jimmy didn't get an invitation.

* Opie talks about being evacuated for one day for Hurricane Earl then going back after finding out it was a bust. He talks about catching a wave badly while boogeyboarding and hitting the water so hard he was afraid at first he'd literally gotten paralyzed while his wife and baby were sitting on the beach.


* Bobby talks about getting dragged by a wave in Aruba that also ripped his shorts off.

* They riff for a long time on how the show would be different if Opie had really gotten paralyzed. Ant does a Stephen Hawking voice.

* They make some references to Opie's ""imagination"" bomb from Tuesday. They talk about how paralyzed Opie would get his comeuppance from all the people he's abused over the years.

* Opie brings up his new gimmick of asking guys if they have ever intentionally taken a shit outside. Bobby says he did the last time he went camping, but it's not the same as Opie taking a shit on the beach. They catch Vos bombing then trying to pretend it didn't happen, so they have Travis roll back and replay the clip.

* Bobby says he has a friend in a wheelchair who rents himself out for people to take him to events so they will get priority seating.


**Fourth hour**


* They notice a cute chick outside so they invite her in. She's a NASCAR employee from L.A. named Sherri who just happened to be passing by. Opie brings up a story about Sandy Kane harrassing Kyle Busch's fiancee on their ESPN2 reality show.

* They find out Sherri is an ethnic mix of Mexican and black. They keep demanding she introduce them to Kyle Busch, but they later find out he already left the building. They mess with and flirt with her for a while, and she's a good sport about it before politely bowing out of the studio.

* Caller repeats a line of Opie's he thought was good, and Vos says ""I'm glad you got through to the pandering line.""

* Opie says he's dying to pick his nose, but he's afraid to because he knows someone in the room would catch him on camera.

* Vos may or may not be doing a show Friday because it's his and Bonnie's anniversary. They talk about Uncle Vinnie's in Staten Island which Bobby says is really beautiful; Vos and Jimmy say they haven't played that area in years. Vos talks about going to the ""dime district"" to trade in some jewelry, and they boo Travis when he isn't able to instantly pull the audio clip for them to replay. They tease Vos for promoting how good the food is a the club he's going to be at. They start piling onto Vos for a few minutes and get on a roll. Finally Chip chimes in to completely step on the moment.


~ break ~


* After having made a quick phone call, Vos announces he won't be playing a show on his anniversary after all.

* Vos wants to talk politics and asks whether Republicans or Democrats did better in the primaries. Ant points out that's a retarded question because both parties are just selecting their candidates. Vos strikes back with some shots about Ant gettin gized(typo?) during his own house party. Ant recaps the story for Bobby's benefit. It frequently derails into more jabs at each other.

* Bobby asks what parties are like at Ant's house because he's never been. They mention naked girls in the pool at Keith's birthday party, and Vos asks ""were they hot or your fans?"" They riff for a while on girls with ""one fuckable quality."" They talk about pissing in a jacuzzi and whether it's worse than shitting on the beach.


* They talk about MacFarlane's Red Dead Redemption and how there's a character coincidentally has the same name as Bonnie. 

* They mention Ron Bennington doing a voice in the game &amp; some of them whine that they've never been asked to do any voices.


* They talk about Vos' dentures. Bobby says ""someone went to school to make your mouth."" Ant tells Bobby, ""someone bought a steak to make your mouth.""



**Fifth hour:**


* They bring Blind Stevie back into the studio and immediately rip on his looks. Sam explains that Stevie's been working on a new bit. They ask him some questions about his eyesight. Stevie says he has a bit of ""OCD like Anthony"" to which Anthony objects.

* There's some more sparring between Vos and Bobby, but it turns back on Stevie again.

 *Opie asks to see Stevie's glasses again. When he hands them to Opie, everyone gets really worried for the kid but nothing happens.

* Opie asks Stevie to talk about his father, but Stevie's not comfortable with the subject. Bobby and Ant share father-issue stories with Stevie to try to draw him out. They can barely get through it without taking more shots at each other. Stevie talks about his dad taking him to see a &lt;i&gt;Rocky&lt;/i&gt; movie on a school night then wanting to theater-hop into another screen and beating Stevie to the ground when he refused. They ask Stevie to re-enact the scene with Sam. Stevie says he hasn't spoken to his dad since he moved out last October. They talk about it for a bit then start to tear into each other again. They never even get to the bit Stevie was working on, but they have him read Vos and Bobby's plugs on the air. They heckle as he stumbles through it then say goodbye.

My problem is that currently my Tech GPA is 2.12. I have been completely fucking up in the last 3 semesters, and for some reason even when I put as much effort as possible into my classes, I fuck up on the exams and get boned. I have also been on tech probation for 2 years, and I believe next semester will be the first semester when I get out of it. Whats even more stupid/insane is that I still want to work in the ECE field. I enjoy things such as comp design alot and I am even working as a research assistant at Talbot. 

My question to you guys is will I still be able to get a job? I have a year left, and will most likely be taking one extra semester to try to get my grades a little higher. I haven't been able to get any internships because of my GPA, and I know when I look for a full time job, no internship is going to be a deal breaker for many companies. What can I do to try and get something before time runs out?

My plan for winter break is to apply to a hundred companies, and hopefully get atleast a couple interviews. Do you guys have any ideas as to which companies I should I apply to? I will mostly be targeting start-ups and other small firms.

I have experience in Java and Haskell because of my studies in CS and in JavaScript because of an internship I did. I noticed a framework called NW.js (previously node-webkit) that allows building desktop applications from web-based applications (in which I have experience due to my internship).

So my goal is to build a recipe manager in JavaScript, using AngularJS and NW.js, but I have read in a comment somewhere that Angular is discouraged with NW.js because routing gets really messy. Also, NW.js isn't always considered very good.

**EDIT: Thank you for all of your answers. This is a great resource for interns and will hopefully be used as such in the future. I know several people have saved a link to this post.

New post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3ynr6o/resources_for_the_list_of_most_bangforbuck_things/)**

**Memorizable list of tasks/knowledge:**

1) Fluids. Know why, when, how much and what to look out for.

3) Standard pn orders: pain killers, sleep aids and antiemetics aka how to reduce nighttime calls from nurses by 25%

4) ""Reflex"" antibiotic choice for routine inpatient infections. 

5) Initial work-up and treatment of heart-failure. 

6) Initial work-up and treatment of  kidney failure. 

7) A sensible initial approach to ileus.

2) Respect the history. History is king. /u/fivo7 

3) Respect yourself. You are a doctor. Your patients are YOUR patients. Approach their workup accordingly. /u/LolYourAnIdiot

13) Creative questioning lets you get the answers you need without ""embarrassing"" yourself: ""What do we normally do for this (general)/what have we been doing for this (patient specific)?"" is a nice way to ask support staff to remind you of usual med choice/dosing at your hospital when you forget. /u/OmNomDoubleDouble

Any tips, suggestions, comments? Is there a standardized short list or reference you feel is relevant.

3yis0k,5640,2015-12-28,"LPT: How to get the most out of Google/search engines(Boolean searches &amp; additional tricks) - long post, but have always found it very useful for general &amp; specific searches",thisismycuntaccount,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3yis0k/lpt_how_to_get_the_most_out_of_googlesearch/,"This is my first attempt at a proper LPT, so please go easy on me. I'm sure this will be very basic to some people, but hoping others would find this very useful. 

**Wow, my first gilded post! Thanks mysterious person. Hope this proved useful for you!**

A few years back (I've no idea how long ago, to be honest) I discovered in some computer magazine that there exists these hidden tricks within Google to get the best out of their search engine and have been pretty much doing it ever since then.

This will be a somewhat long post, I imagine, but only because there's a lot there.

The various things I'll be covering will be Boolean searches - [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) goes into it in greater detail than I will be, as I'll be keeping this as basic as possible (and as basic as I know it!) and various other tricks.

**Boolean searches**

As mentioned earlier, I'm really not going to go into this in a huge amount of detail, especially regarding what is going on behind the scenes, because I genuinely don't know that.

For Google searches, the ones I'd use the most are OR and NOT (AND was included in this, but now I believe that Google recognizes any space as an AND function). **These always need to be entered in all caps, otherwise Google doesn't recognize them as operators**

**OR** would be used when you want to search for multiple variations on something, essentially, and brings back all the searches it finds. Imagine you're looking for motorbikes from all over, but you know they're referred to motorbikes and motorcycles in different places. An example of a search you'd use would be

&gt;motorbike OR motorcycle

This will return all the pages it finds that used either the word motorbike or motorcycle within their text. *I believe that you can also use the character |, making it motorbike|motorcycle, but I think both works equally as well?*

**NOT** is how you would get rid of search results that you know aren't at all useful to you. I would usually use the minus sign (**-**) as opposed to writing NOT. I would usually place this at the end of my search string, but I'm not 100% sure if it matters. *I'm sure someone will confirm if this is the case*

To continue the example from earlier; you're searching for a motorbike, but for whatever reason, it keeps bringing up results for some knock-off brand, we'll make one up and call it Kavasaci. You absolutely don't want this at all, so your search string would look like this:

&gt; motorbike OR motorcycle -Kavasaci 

Make sure there's no space between the minus sign and the word you want to remove. This will remove *all* the search results that mention this particular brand.

Boolean searches are more or less covered now, so I'll move on to other tips and tricks - I'll be ignoring the motorcycle example from earlier and using ones people might actually use frequently.

**site:**

We all know that many sites have an absolutely awful internal search engine, which is either basic as hell, is too confusing to figure out, or just doesn't work whatsoever. You can combat this by using site:, followed by the URL of the site you want to search for, without the www. I'll give some small examples below, but it is only really limited to the amount of websites that are searchable through Google.

&gt;site:reddit.com

&gt;site:reddit.com/r/lifeprotips

&gt;site:linkedin.com

What this is pretty much doing is telling Google to search this very specific website, ignoring every other site.

**"" ""**

Quotation marks are extremely useful in Google searches, because it tells the search engine to search for the exact word order and phrase within them.

As mentioned earlier, Google recognizes a space as AND (which will return any site that mentions all of the keywords within it). Let's take this example: You're trying to look for a song that you heard on the radio, but you only gleamed maybe one line and the DJ refuses to name the song. If you were to type the lyric into Google like this

&gt;mama just killed a man

It might return a load of results that happened to contain all of these words - maybe a sentence like 

&gt;mama just went to the shop. Back then I would have killed for a cup of tea. I saw someone coming towards me and I realized it was a man

To combat this, you'd use quotation marks around the exact phrase you know that you want to find:

&gt;""mama just killed a man""

This has been a very basic view on how to use Google. A lot of these can be applied to most search engines. To give one last practical example, **lets say you're looking for a new job**, whose description lists your skills, using LinkedIn's search engine. We'll use OR, """", NOT. This will be an example to show looking for specific skills and other keywords that would be useful.

You might look for - 

&gt;HTML OR JavaScript OR PHP media OR internet OR ""online media"" OR ""digital media"" -internship -trainee

You might notice above that there is a space between PHP and media. This is taking advantage of the fact that the search engines recognize the space as AND. It is being told that you'd like it to return all results that mention *any* of the keywords from HTML to PHP but *also* any that mention from media to digital media. This can be useful for finding very specific jobs. 

It will also get rid of any results that will mention internship and trainee.

And there we have it. A very basic view on how to use Google and other search engines, to find very specific things when it is required.

A lot of this has been gleaned from the people over at [Boolean Black Belt](http://booleanblackbelt.com/), which while geared towards sourcing talent/recruiting, can be very useful for learning new tricks.

If you have any questions, let me know. I'm sure someone will tell me I misunderstood some concepts and I'll most certainly update this if that's the case.

Edit: Fixed typo. 

Glad so many are finding this useful. There's some extra tips in the comments section that I absolutely recommend people to read. "

3yj1p4,0,2015-12-28,What should I do to prepare myself if I want to eventually become a software engineer?,gettothechapa,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3yj1p4/what_should_i_do_to_prepare_myself_if_i_want_to/,"I'm a student that's wanting to go to school to get a cs/se degree. However, I have close to basically no experience with this profession. I still have around two years before I'm planning on taking college classes, so I wanted to get a head start and learn as much as I can. 

I've been reading through this subreddit, and I found some things that could help me get on my feet: 

-find an internship

-learn how to build a webpage

-make an android app

-learn some programming languages

I have no idea where to start with any of these, so are there any sources that are helpful for beginners like me? What programming language should I start learning first? What can I do find a job opportunity while I'm in college?"
3yj79e,2,2015-12-28,Student Job Transition. How to Make It Better,CraftResumesTeam,CareerSuccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/CareerSuccess/comments/3yj79e/student_job_transition_how_to_make_it_better/,"Leaving school for the first time is exciting, you just received your degree and are now ready to venture out into the work world. You know there will be a challenge and are often facing challenges far bigger than you anticipated. The transition from school to the professional world does not have to be as challenging. Even with less experience, you can move your career ahead.

**Make a vision**

The first thing you need to do is firmly decide what you want to be doing with your career. Make a vision – determine what is acceptable for you and what it will be like in the future. Begin by determining what organizations you would like to ideally work for, be creative. Coming out of school brings a world of opportunities and now is the time to set the tone for the beginning of your career. Determine your acceptable salary and the company culture you want to work in. Would you like a more formal or casual environment? Decide on the location and the amount of growth you expect. Are you just looking for a position to get some experience, or are you looking to be working at an organization that offers several options for professional development?

If you are coming out of school for the first time and are not sure what direction to move in, consider seeking out informational interviews from professionals who are already working in the perspective sector you are interested in. Ask these professionals what it has been like and what made them choose their career direction. This will allow you to gather information and make an informed decision about what job to apply for. 

**Use the network**

After graduation, we often have a social network that is comprised of friends, managers you have worked for and professors. What many students neglect to develop is a professional network of industry specialists who have already started their careers. Joining an industry association is a great way to get to know others in your industry and look for a mentor. A mentor is a learning experience, it’s an opportunity for you to build a relationship with an experienced professional and gather insight about your industry, and the professional world in general. Another great way to build your network is to consider volunteering positions are also a great way to grow your skills, improve your resume and network. 

**Research trends**

[Becoming visible](http://craftresumes.com/how-to-get-noticed-in-the-job-market/) and keeping updated on current events in your industry will make you a much more marketable candidate. Coming out of school you have the theory and understanding of your field as a whole; however, subscribing to business magazines and researching on current industry trends can really give you a big step in the right direction. Often there are new pieces of legislation coming out and professional designations that you can obtain which will help you to move forward in your career.

**Make your resume more effective**

For several students a common element which can significantly hold them back is their resume. Often [recent grads](http://craftresumes.com/recent-graduate-resume/) have a resume that has not transitioned from the “school format” yet. When you are out of university you have officially achieved all the rights and provisions of your industry to identify you as a professional. Your resume should reflect that. But how do you put forth your knowledge with limited experience? Consider using a functional or combinational resume. These resumes use a format that explains skill sets followed by explanations of how you are able to perform these skills. For instance, if you are a finance major and have completed some internships or projects on a certain topic and know you could perform successfully in the workplace, you may create a section for that ability. You can follow this with two to three examples of how you worked with that skill along with a short description of the knowledge you have of it. Always ensure that your resume puts forth your most relevant positions of your field.

Another common concern that recent graduates have is the fact that they have worked a lot of service jobs and aren’t sure how to use these positions on their resume. Consider using the transferable skills such as math, analytical, sales, organization and communication skills. These skills are transferable and valuable. When [editing your resume](http://craftresumes.com/resumeediting/) still list your positions and keep the focus on the parts of the job that will be the most useful and interesting to a new employer.

Finally, never let setbacks get you down. Your career, especially the beginning, will be full of ups and downs. How you respond to and learn from your experiences will set the tone for your career. Always keep in mind what made you passionate about your career decision in the first place."
3yja9z,6,2015-12-28,"Failed Math 100, what do I do now? -- Need Advice",TechyCSNerd,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/3yja9z/failed_math_100_what_do_i_do_now_need_advice/,"So I fucked up. Finished Math 100 with 40%. Fuck.

I'm not going to point my finger and blame anyone other than myself. *I* failed, and it's *my* fault. But I do need to move forward and achieve success in my future, and this is why I am reaching out to you all. By the way, I am a first year CS student.

I studied so hard for this course. Every day I did a bunch of problems. Went to the math resource centre and everything. But every quiz in class I kept getting 1-2/10 correct, and on the exam I don't even know what happened. I really don't think I had the background for this course anyway, as other people in the class were much better than me with past concepts. My high school math was abysmal at best, and i'm paying the price for it now.

My other grades came back fine, with high 70's and low 80's on the rest.

I find it hard to blame myself since I know I tried my best, but I guess my best right now doesn't cut it. So, **How do I move forward from this**? Do I get a math tutor throughout next semester and practice Math 100 concepts? Do I try to keep up with the Math 101 curriculum in preparation for when I will next take it? I'm willing to do whatever it takes trust me.

Obviously now I can't take Math 101 this next semester, and this means I will have to stay at school for the summer session. Not that thats terrible or anything, but I feel like it's going to be something I have to do. So I guess I will get to see what beautiful van city is like in the summer sun. 

Also, will this fuck up my future in any sizeable way? Will Google take a glance at my future internship application and go ""look at this guy in math 100 god damn what a chump""? Hopefully I'm not in too bad a spot, and seeing as I will have to re-take the class, if I get a better mark will that sort of cover this one up? Does first year GPA matter a whole lot? Did NASA actually go to the moon? Will I ever find true love?

Kind of scared right now, and Im looking forward to your replies, thanks for reading!

TL;DR 
First year CS nerd got dunked on and sideswiped hard by Math 100. Upcoming rematch in June. Need advice on how to prepare."
3yjgku,7,2015-12-28,Moving forward in my career...,dcsrunner,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3yjgku/moving_forward_in_my_career/,"Hi everyone. Not sure if I'm posting in the right sub, but I knew you guys might have some advice for me. I've been interning at company close by my college for almost a year now. I've done well here and have moved up in responsibility. Our IT structure is basically two people, (my boss/co-worker and I), serving close to 300 employees. As you can imagine, having two people handling almost 300 is extremely hectic, but it's allowed for me to jump into what I call a ""Sysadmin Intern"" type role. Me and my co-worker handle anything and everything IT related, which has allowed me to gain tons of knowledge and experience. I love it, but it's very stressful at times. I've been told by my company that there would most likely be a position available for me after college, which is great, but I often wonder if staying here would be worth it with our ""not-so-great"" IT structure and the stress and inefficiency of it all. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on this, feel free to ask me any questions! Thanks!"
3yjgon,1,2015-12-28,Repeatedly failing on day 1. I have a few questions related to nofap in general and a few issues I have been facing. I am a 19 M looking for some guidance on how to proceed. The post is relatively long so feel free to pass on.,J_U_S,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3yjgon/repeatedly_failing_on_day_1_i_have_a_few/,"Alright, thank you for reading. This may be a common problem, but pardon me.
I'm a 19 year old male. I have been masturbating several times (usually 7-8 times) a day ever since I was 12 and occasionally to porn. I have a really high sex drive and no girlfriend. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not shy or anything, I am very outgoing and find it really easy to talk to people but I happen to belong to a relatively conservative culture and girlfriends are hard to come by. 
Due to a constant want to have sex and not getting any, I'm constantly frustrated. 
I heard of the nofap challenge last year and failed miserably. After multiple tries, I could only reach day 3. So I dropped the challenge, as I thought I wouldn't be able to complete it.
Now i'm setting nofap as my new year resolution. I am going to complete the 30 day challenge atleast once this year. 
I tried not masturbating the past few days, but always ended up doing it by the end of the day. I couldn't even make a day.
So I'm writing to you to help me with a few tips for the problems I've noticed.

1) Everytime I see/read anything sexual, I get a huge turn on and I can't focus on anything but masturbating. It's like my body is pleading me to release. It usually ends up with me stroking my penis a few times, then trying to control, then stroking and then full blown masturbation binge. 

2) I masturbate in batches. (I can't think of a better word). I masturbate like 3-4 times at once and do this three four times a day, after waking up, in the afternoon, when I'm bored, before sleeping. You get my point? So when I fail once, I fail HARD. 

3) I am so horny after a few *hours* of not masturbating that I think of weird stuff like stealing panties, forcing it on a girl etc. I would not go on a raping frenzy obviously, but I think I may have just enough drive to attempt it if I don't release myself regularly. And that will ruin my life. 
This is not a major possibility, but I am just hypothesizing that if I can fantasize about it, I may end up doing it blinded by sexual energy.

4) I have read frequenting to the gym helps, and that is what I had done last year to manage three days. Now I have a minor shoulder injury that will keep me off the weights for a month now. And I really want to do this challenge, because I know my future self will thank me for it.

I have found postponing masturbation to the evening (referring to me failing in the past few days) is also quite helpful. I have more energy and a general want to get things done. 
Now I am a total virgin so I don't know how masturbation is different from sex, but I have realised that masturbation is what has been making me so lazy all the time. I have accomplished a lot in the past few days itself.

Note that I am a student doing an long internship. When I am home, I am usually by myself even though I live with my parents because I have become addicted to my computer. I am working to convert this to a reading habit.
Please also note that I am not some lost child. I know what I am doing with my life and in which direction I am taking it. 
I am having difficulty solving my masturbation and pornography addiction/want. I have surfed the internet and it says that masturbation in any quantity is healthy and normal, and unless it is really interfering with your life there is no point in stopping it. Masturbation is not interfering with my life but it is a part of it. I have fights and other emotional issues and I solve them by simply masturbating. This would be a ""pro"" of not stopping. I use masturbation as a emotional release.


I just want to do this nofap challenge because I like being productive and I have gotten more done in the past two days than in the past two weeks. I am seeking the enhanced productivity, clarity, energy and a drive to get things done.
I am not a slob but I am really disappointed that I cannot even make a day of just simply restraining from stroking my penis.

I do not know how to proceed in this situation. Should I just leave the whole thing behind and continue the way it was? Or whould I keep trying in vain?
I do not have anyone I can share this with which is why I am writing this here. 
I would be heartily thankful if you could please tell me what to do in my situation.


    Additional Details:

        I am fairly fit, very social, I have a high IQ and dyslexic and I have never had erectile dysfunction, if that is at all relevant.

My goal in life is to pursue physics. I love sciences in general as long as it applies well to the world around me hence I like to read sociology 

However, in order to pursue a career in said field, I need an education and I am willing to pursue that at high cost.

But I need to be aware of the costs.

My family shares housing at the moment and we had been homeless a few times and my mom works at low income to support five children.

I am a legal citizen of this country but my parents are not. As a legal American, I am going to pursue the opportunity present in this country as the opportunities seem to be running out.

I am bilingual as I learned Spanish in school and completed AP Spanish Language. My first language of Jamaican patois, I consider to simply be English with African lexicon and structure so I don't consider it a separate language. Apparently, it is considered a separate language internationally due to the strong differences.

You can see other information about me in my scholarship post. I am willing to do all I can to get into college and get the life I dream of hoping I won't have to join the military.

I am currently looking for jobs and internships to help support the loans that I may carry. If there is ANY opportunity to be able to pay for college, please tell me either by comment or PM. I am looking for scholarships as we speak and messaging a lot of potential resources. Thank you for your time."
3yjvqb,1,2015-12-28,"Should I aim for an internship or should I aim to graduate ""early""?",GetMoneyProductions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3yjvqb/should_i_aim_for_an_internship_or_should_i_aim_to/,"I've been browsing this subreddit for a while and noticed that people here put a lot of importance on getting internships before graduating. 

My story:

I'm currently in ""what could be"" my last year of my undergraduate studies. I say ""what could be"" because I switched over to CS beginning in my third year and therefore have to cram the four year CS program over a two year period (kind of unorthodox). My concern is that I have no internships under my belt, mediocre grades, and no personal projects (yikes!)

Question:

Going forward, I can finish school in August of 2016 (after summer school) or I can finish in December of 2016 (after finishing the fall semester).

I want to graduate in August of 2016 because I want to finish school as soon as possible. Being a bit older (23 turning 24 soon) I feel that it is time for me to move on. 

However, I feel like I won't be too competitive for jobs if I finish sooner. If I finish later, however, I can get an internship for the summer of 2016 and then be more competitive for employment after December 2016.

Now, most people would probably say to graduate later and to aim for an internship if I want to be competitive, but to be quite honest, I am not too picky on which development job I take. I'm not aiming for the Big 4 or anything like that. I just want a job when I graduate where I will be doing something related to development. With no internship experience, mediocre grades, and no personal projects (I can change this from now to August), but with a CS degree under my belt, are even these ""average"" kind of jobs out of the picture? Right now I value working over being in school for any longer."
3yjxr6,1,2015-12-28,Summer Plans: Junior in college as a CS Major,shelledpanda,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3yjxr6/summer_plans_junior_in_college_as_a_cs_major/,"Hey all! As said, I'm a junior in college, trying to make some plans for the summer.
First off I should say I'm not doing very well in school; my Major GPA is about 2.7, with my cumulative only marginally higher. In the more concrete coding classes I perform very well, getting B+ to A averages, but with the classes like Theory of Computation or Computer Organization I get C's. 
Most people my age at this stage of college are getting internships. I'm going to apply to a bunch obviously, but it's definitely not how I want to spend my summer, since for the most part I'd be doing pretty low skill level work most likely, as an entry level intern, and honestly it sounds extremely boring and I can have a hard time with that. 
The idea I have is that I really want to do some independent projects to strengthen my Github profile, as well as learn what it is like to be an independent programmer, and to test myself and my bounds as a coder. In the independent study classes I have taken I perform pretty exceptionally well, as the projects are self driven and I have an easy time spending 8-12 hours of solid coding in a day(the college I attend I only take one class a month to completion). 
I am strongly of the opinion that this is what I want to do with my summer, but I need some more input on the pros and cons before I'm able to make a truly informed decision.

I got a profitable internship and my personal reward is splurging on a gaming PC for the first time! I'm looking for maximum upgradeability; I'd like to use this stuff over and over for future builds/upgrades.

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Games: League, Fallout 4, Star Wars Battlefront, Battlefield, Civ 5, Steam stuff

Study/Work: Light CAD modeling software/rendering tools. Lightroom.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$1000-1250, can stretch a little but would prefer not to

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Next couple of months. I know this will be little outdated, but I want a template to build off of

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower, monitor, keyboard

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Massachusetts. No micro center.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I really have nothing. I have a mac laptop I use for school, and a gaming mouse.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Down the line, I may overclock!
I don't know what CPU/GPU or combo would be most beneficial in this price range for my uses.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Small SSD for OS and frequent programs with a larger HDD

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Probably a bigger tower because I'm not experienced in optimizing build order/cable management.

I don't care much about aesthetics, but if worked together that's be a cool extra feature. Mostly looking for functionality, as I'll be upgrading in the future!

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

University provides a free copy of Windows 10! So no

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Any tips on first time building would be awesome! I've never done this before, but I'm interested in these kinds of hands on projects."

3yk7r6,129,2015-12-28,"Financial Careers Overview (Investment Banking Analyst, AMA)",rowsforthebros,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/3yk7r6/financial_careers_overview_investment_banking/,"**Why this post fits here:** Given the demographics of reddit, most of the people in this subreddit are computer scientists and engineers.  But the concepts used in financial independence (income statement, balance sheet / net worth, time value of money, market efficiency, asset allocation, etc.) share many similarities with finance as a course of study.  This post is meant to serve as an introduction to just a few of the finance careers that can help you towards FIRE.  If you find yourself: making your own excel projection instead of using firecalc, looking into how the 4% 'rule' is derived, and modeling out your future, then these careers may be for you.

**My background:** I graduated from a top 20 school this May  majoring in finance and math and began work as an investment banking analyst at a boutique investment bank.  I have interned in the past at a well-known asset manager (active investing) and one of the country's largest private equity firms.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Investment Banking:** This is by far the most popular entry point out of undergrad.  It preserves a high degree of flexibility towards future careers and shows that you can work long hours under tight deadlines. Investment bankers, at an analyst role, are typically in excel and powerpoint producing various analyses.

Investment banking mostly deals with mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A), debt issuance (bonds), and equity issuance (IPO).  My boutique deals primarily with M&amp;A, so I can explain this in the most detail.  We are paid a fee to either sell a company or buy a company for the best price possible for our client.  Like a real estate agent, we are there to maximize value.  In either case, the analyses are similar.  

*Accretion/Dilution Analysis:* This looks at earnings per share (EPS) of the bidder (the buying company). This is simply net income (revenue less expenses) divided by the share count of a company.  This will change when a company acquires another company.  Revenue and expenses will increase by the revenue and expenses of the seller.  In addition, the company will be acquired using either (1) the bidder's cash balance, (2) a debt issuance, (3) stock issuance, or (4) some combination of the prior ways.

(1) The only additional expense is the opportunity cost of the foregone interest (this is typically very small).  This is why analysts are clamoring for Apple to make acquisitions.  Apple has a large cash balance that is earning little-to-nothing, and they could be buying companies with it.

(2) There will be interest expense due to the new debt raised.

(3) The company will have to issue shares to acquire the company, so its share count will increase, increasing the denominator in earnings per share.  Obviously, hopefully earnings will increase as well.

An acquisition is generally thought of as ""good"" if it is accretive (increases the buyer's EPS) within the next few years, and ""bad"" if it is dilutive (decreases the buyer's EPS).  This is too simple, however, because the buyer should consider long-term planning.  For example, in Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram, the deal was dilutive for a long-time.  They paid $1 billion, but Instagram was making no money.  However, over the long-term, it was a great strategic fit and Facebook was able to maximize the value of the company.

*Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:*  Under this analysis, one projects a company's future cash flows, including a terminal value.  Then, these future cash flows are discounted back to the present and summed to determine the overall value of a company.

With financial independence, my spreadsheet is a ""snowball"" calculation in which I save a given amount per year, and these savings grow at market returns to reach a given amount near my retirement goal. 

A discounted cash flow is basically the opposite of that. A company will make (based on estimates, obviously not reliable for most cases) a certain amount each year -- this determines the value of a company.  However, as always, I prefer the company to make this value sooner rather than later.  Say if Tesla, for example, will not actually produce cash flow for 20 years.  At an 8% discount rate, a cash flow 20 years from now is worth 1 / (1.08^20) = 1 / 4  -- one quarter what it would be if it were produced today.  Wow!  Anyway, this analysis is another way of determining the value of a company that is being bought, sold, or raising money in an IPO (initial public offering).

In investment banking, pay is somewhere is the area of 130-160k (including bonus) for a first-year analyst.  First-year associates (after 3 years of analyst or out of an MBA program), will make 250-325k.  This is at bulge bracket firms (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays) and elite boutique firms.  **Hours are 65-100 hours per week.** Most firms, however, and now instituting weekend policies.  I am guaranteed off from 8pm on Friday to 9am Sunday, so if I wanted to have a girlfriend, I could.  It's extremely nice to know that you can make plans for a given day of the week, and it wasn't this way in the past. On a typical day, I get up at 8, am in the office by 9:30, and leave around 11. Dinner and taxi home are paid for. The pay and intellectual stimulation are great, but the main advantage is the career path flexibility.  With the ability to work hard and work smart proven, I can move to many different related fields with some of the following: more pay, better hours, and better type of work.

**Equity Research:** Equity researchers model company financials and rate various stocks.  For example, a consumer/retail analyst might cover Nike, Under Armor, Lulu Lemon, and 5-6 other names.  They attend industry events, get a feel for the companies and meet their management teams, and become all-around experts on the industry.  Hours are likely 50-80 a week, depending on the firm, with additional hours during earnings season, when the analysts will almost always publish updates on the companies they follow. The main analysis for this type of job is a simple 3-statement model, which covers the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.  If you can do a personal income statement and balance sheet / net worth, you can do this with some training.  A 3-statement model helps put a value on a company.

There are two types of equity research jobs, sell-side and buy-side.  Sell-side sells their research to buy-side firms who then use it to decide whether or not to BUY securities, such as hedge funds and large asset managers.  Buy-side researchers give their research &amp; opinion directly to the portfolio managers that make final decisions.

Hedge funds hire these equity research analysts to help them make decisions on which securities to buy.  A hedge fund typically raises funds from pensions, endowments, and the wealthy, and uses them to actively invest in public securities.  They are often paid a 2% fee on the total capital they invest, and take 20% of their returns. The employees are highly compensated and will also make huge bonuses if the fund has a high return.

**Active asset managers and hedge funds have a huge amount of resources at their disposal, including meetings with the company's management and expensive calls with industry experts.  They bring efficiency to the markets. They are why you should not try to actively invest as an individual investor.**

**Private Equity / Venture Capital:**  Private equity firms buy companies (either public companies or private companies) and take them private. They often put on high amounts of leverage, which will increase returns (in upside cases) and shield the companies from taxes via an increased interest expense.  They attempt to back strong management teams and companies with stable cash flows. They will often make operating improvements, such as reducing administrative expenses, better sourcing of materials, or expanding into a new product line.  

Growth capital firms invest to help a company grow.  They help firms roll-out nationwide, such as restaurants or retail chains.

Venture capital firms invest in a large number of early-stage companies, knowing that many will fail but hoping that one or two might become the next Facebook.

-------------------------------------------------

**How to Get In:**

*Out of Undergrad:* The following are hugely important, and they are generally given in order of importance:

1) Attend a top school, such as an ivy
2) GPA above 3.6, preferably above 3.8
3) Internships in similar roles: do whatever needed to do these, including loans or taking a second job during an unpaid internship
4) Examples of leadership (club president, etc)

After this, there are numerous technical and 'fit' interviews to prepare for.

*NOT out of undergrad:* Usually one goes through an MBA and off to investment banking.  It's often not possible to get an investing role post-MBA without having an investing role pre-MBA.

*Backdoor:*  I think one aspect that is really overlooked is the ability to specialize.  While I am (happily) a generalist in my current position, we have a lot of senior bankers with detailed experience in the sectors they cover.  If you are an engineer, you will be able to talk with and will have a stronger background for an ""industrials"" group. If you have experience at a tech firm, you will have a stronger background for a ""technology"" group.  I am on a lot of deals in the healthcare space, and its quite tough for me to understand, because a lot of it is description of molecules and the like.

This is getting really long, so I'll stop here for now and add anything I missed in the comments.

Questions I had in particular:

2) I mention the game engine I created in the skills section, should I back it up with more info in the Projects section? Seeing as it was a part of coursework in my Masters degree it wouldn't technically be a Project as such, but considering I'm applying to an engine programmer role...

3ykzyh,9,2015-12-28,2016-2017 IO Grad School Q&amp;A Mega-Thread,ResidentGinger,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/3ykzyh/20162017_io_grad_school_qa_megathread/,"Last year's thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/3dcag3/20152016_io_grad_school_qa_megathread_all_please/).

The grad school application bewitching hour is nearing ever closer, and around this time, everyone starts posting questions/freaking out about grad school. As per the rules in the sidebar...

**For questions about grad school or internships**

* Please search the previously submitted posts or the post on the grad school Q&amp;A. Subscribers of /r/iopsychology have provided lots of information about these topics, and your questions may have already been answered.
*  If it hasn't, please post it on the grad school Q&amp;A thread. **Other posts outside of the Q&amp;A thread will be deleted.**

That last bit is something we haven't enforced as much as we should have in previous years, but the readers of this subreddit have made it pretty clear that they don't want the subreddit clogged up with posts about grad school. 

Don't get the wrong idea - we're glad you're here and that you're interested in IO, but please do observe the rules so that you can get answers to your questions AND enjoy the interesting IO articles and content. 

By the way, those of you who are currently trudging through or have finished grad school, that means that you have to occasionally offer suggestions and advice to those who post on this thread. That's the only way that we can keep these grad school-related posts in one central location. If people aren't getting their questions answered here, they post to the subreddit instead of the thread. So, in short, let's all play our part in this. 

Happy application season! 

Thanks, guys! "
3ylc5m,11,2015-12-28,Just when I thought I was doing okay...,ind1goskye,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3ylc5m/just_when_i_thought_i_was_doing_okay/,"(On mobile, apologies for bad formatting, blah blah blah)

I was with a guy for 2.5 years, we finally broke up in July after a bit of a decline. It needed to happen, but the breakup did not leave us friendly with each other. 

I got to know a friend of his (long story that isn't super relevant) and managed to fall for him. Bad idea, I knew, but I wanted to see where it'd go. Let's call him Bobby. We were friends for a couple months and I knew starting a relationship wouldn't work - I needed time to heal, it was a friend of my ex, and I'd be leaving soon for an internship far away without concrete plans after. Bobby and I talked and agreed maybe in a couple years we could reconsider. In hindsight, I should've seen that as his way out. But I needed a friend and something to hold onto. Some sort of hope. 

We talked for the first couple months I was gone - mostly texting, but a couple conversations over the weekends. Things seemed pretty good. I texted him more than he texted me, but he'd never been super verbal over text. The last couple weekends before Christmas, when I'd be coming home, he couldn't really talk but I didn't mind so much because I'd expressed interest in hanging out when I got home and he replied enthusiastically. 

I got home and texted him to see if he'd want to hang out that weekend. He called me almost immediately - he never called out of the blue. Bad feeling. ""Hey, maybe we should stop talking for a while. I see [your ex] pretty regularly and it doesn't feel good talking to both of you. Maybe we can talk in a couple months, but for now we probably shouldn't."" 

As much as I knew he had a point, it still fucking sucked. And I knew he was telling me he was done. He won't contact me. He chose his friend - as I, deep down, had known he would do. Because why choose some girl it might not work out with over your friend? But for some reason I kept talking to him, never badmouthing my ex (who had given me plenty of reasons to bad mouth him) so as not to be That Ex. I wanted to make things work. 

So now I had to wonder how long he'd been putting off telling me that. Had it been the whole couple months I was at my internship? A couple weekends? It's also stupid because he had basically told me to do the same thing with my ex - telling me to wait until our lease was up to break up with him, to act normal until then, so as to avoid a ton of confrontation. I didn't wait, because that's fucking terrible advice, but now I'm like ""so he does follow his own advice. Interesting.""

So this was, what, a week and a half ago? And I'm doing okay. We were involved for a couple months so I was dealing with the whole ""so many things remind me of him"" which sucked, but I knew time would make it better. 

Today I get a text from my roommate from my university: ""guess who I saw at my work today? Bobby and his current significant other."" What. The. FUCK. It felt like someone had punched me in the stomach when i read that. How long has he been with her? Is that why he was ""busy""? Is that the REAL fucking reason he wanted to stop talking? Fuck him. FUCK. HIM. I'm so hurt and angry and upset. 

I don't know what I want from posting this. I just...I'm so upset with how things ended. I'm upset that they DID end, though he's proving that he's not someone I'd want to be with, if he can't fucking communicate when something is difficult for him. 

TL;DR: if I ever needed a sign to cut contact with someone, I got a big one with fucking neon flashing lights and a goddamn brass band. Fuck. "

I’m a fellow Yellow Jacket that graduated with a BS in BME a couple years back. I recently finished my masters in BME at a different school, and I’m looking to network with GT alum that are in the industry.   

I haven’t had much luck with the job hunt despite having ~12 months of internship experience (R&amp;D) at 3 different BME companies over the past 2 years as a part of my masters degree. 

My GPA is good, and I’m fairly confident that I’ve got a solid resume, but unfortunately the traditional job hunt route hasn’t yielded much. 

I’m hoping that through networking with some GT alumni I can perhaps have a better chance at landing an interview. 

I have generally performed well at interviews, and have a lot of confidence in my interviewing skills – I just haven’t been able to get a chance to show it yet. 

Happy holidays and Thank you!

3ym6zv,7,2015-12-28,"Its scary sometimes asking yourself who you are, and what you want out of life.",Green_Tea_Dragon,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/3ym6zv/its_scary_sometimes_asking_yourself_who_you_are/,"Hey Reddit, took me quite a while to actually get around to posting this hopefully it’s in the right area or ill surly get down voted into oblivion for sure.
 I have never posted something on Reddit before, but always finding myself reading comments and random threads to odd hours (not so much anymore). I didn’t even have a profile before this post.
Stick with me I swear this wall of text isn’t just me losing my mind!
Funny thing is I’m not really sure why I’m posting this to be honest, maybe it’s just to vent or have my story heard? Maybe to get feedback that, yes my life is indeed just a huge glorified “stage” or perhaps I am actually growing as a person and getting out of that nasty circle of negative thoughts that I have been in for years?

Hmmm where to start? How about with myself? I’m 22M, My relatively small group of friend usually see me as the “dreamer” of the group(they can be just as much!), I have gone from being a police officer for 6 months(wasn’t my thing), day trader  then trying to think of an idea for a small business. Now I can see where the dreamer part comes in. Thinking back I probably did sound pretty naïve, always calling my buddies ecstatic about a new idea or thing we could buy and sell from alibaba or online private labeling. I even had a job as a paid intern for a local (very popular) bar to teach me how to run a business; the owner took to liking me pretty quick. But like most great things, they come to an end. My main source of income now is my eBay store; I sell things I get from estate sells and thrift stores. Don’t be fooled I only make enough to cover gas and going out (I still live at home with my parents.)
Still reading? You my friend will deserve gold at the end of this.
My family is relatively wealthy, my mother is a tech with a local fortune 500 company and my father is a forty year detective vet with my home town’s police department. My father is a huge local figure in a way, if we ever eat out it isn’t uncommon for someone to come up to my family while eating and chat with my father and them leave and find out that was the town’s freaking mayor. If I’m ever riding around town and a police officer sees me I usually get a smile and a wave and if I’m out of the car usually a conversation. The usual ‘how’s your father’ blah blah blah. My father always wanted me to join the force with him, I tried and I failed. I always get self conscious when talking to my father coworkers because the question “are you still in law enforcement?” will usually be asked, and of course be answered with a usually pitiful grouping of the word “umm and err” and the word eBay at the end.
Now this is where I kind of lose structure or whatever in the hell I’m writing here. I’m so used to suppressing my emotions I find myself going back and trying to reword things I’m typing even now. 
Growing up I was diagnosed with ADHD and later I was pegged with an “anxiety problem” put in “special” classes from 4-7 grade(not all my classes)I hated them, I always felt like I wasn’t normal or something since I couldn’t go with my other friends to lunch. Around those times I was bullied for my weight (the ADHD med were to blame) quite a bit and at first I tried to speak out about it but it seemed after a while it kind of fell on closed ears and I just dealt with it. Around those times I was very much hooked on video games and from then on out I would opt to just close myself in my room and play video games for 8+ hours a day, even getting to the point I was staying up and falling asleep in class, skipping showers. I hate myself so much for those days I spent glued to a TV screen rather than spending time with my grandmothers or making actual friends.
 My mom is much like my dad(keep that in mind)he’s a very stoic man, my entire life I have NEVER seen the man even anywhere close to what someone would call sad, he always had a Slight smile, straight face or pissed and he was big on punishment. Around 6-7th grade my family was hitting the time where my family started to drift apart (uncles, aunts, cousins etc) when a long string of deaths happened in my family, after sitting down with my sister (29yo) after my last grandmothers death she told me “you know, thinking about it we’ve been to about 21 funerals (family and family friends) in both of our lives.” I just kind of laughed and told her she’s right. Some of the things that clicked about my own emotional state and acted as a slap in the face on what I was becoming, was that  I get a lot of my mannerisms from my dad, I never cried at any of the funerals(or in front of anyone),even families funerals I just stoned faced thought the whole thing , even when slide shows of happy times with said members were being played, I would  never want to live those moments again. Trying to stay straight faced while you see smiling photos of that dead family member who you’ll never see again until it’s your time to go as well(unless you don’t believe in that).
I left so much out but I have been putting off posting this for probably about a month, so I need to get this out before I somehow find myself a week later procrastinating. Bear with me please!!!!!!
After high school I started getting into cross fit and lost about 60 pounds, I was eating organic and drinking nothing but coffee, green tea, water and whey protein drinks. Now I smoke, usually to the point where I’m glued to the couch with my buddies. The other day high school was brought up and how things panned out, I didn’t really have any friends in high school but I also didn’t have any enemies, just a ton of acquaintances. I had a lot of people I would talk to in school just never out of school. i would go back and change soooo much in my life If I could. After talking about the old days in school one of my friends looks at me and says he wished he had my life because I always seen so chilled, as I was one of the nicest people he’s ever met, all I could do is laugh and shake my head, trust me you don’t. A failure that probably tarnished my mom and dad’s rep as good parents and their long careers.

Currently I find myself I think its depression, I saw a post I liked a few days ago on how it is that I really liked. I’m so sorry I’m not sure who said it or I would quote you but it went along the lines of “if I wanted to do something and the options were there like in mass effect or fall out and a few of the options were grayed out and you couldn’t for the life of you choose them” or something along those lines. I have tried to convince myself to at least get back out there and jog a few days. Even bought some cleats and thought about trying soccer again or taking a martial art class. Making my health shakes again but those are even hard to do sometimes and it’s just fucking getting a few ingredients like, just get them out lazy ass and put them in the blender. 
My latest thing I have looked at doing is perhaps going to get my BA in English and teaching English in Japan with the jet program, I love the culture, but I doubt it’ll happen. I still have hope grant (pays for college pretty much) but my GPA is on the edge, if I fail a class I will lose it. My anxiety usually keeps me from doing or acting on anything.
I’m so sorry about this freaking wall or book of text guys not really sure what else to do I kind of understand after years of dealing with this I might not be able to get myself out of my own mess that is my head. I hope you guys had a great day and holidays or managing at least.

3ymed0,2,2015-12-29,I'm not sure if I should move out.,ghost_sanctum,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3ymed0/im_not_sure_if_i_should_move_out/,"I stay with my parents for the sense of familiarity and its convenient to milk living with my parents at least until I'm finished with my undergraduate, besides having to do chores here and there.

However, it's come to my attention that my goals for myself aren't exactly in line with what my parents are comfortable with. I need to *grow* as a person, and as a 20 year old man about to turn 21, I think I'm past the point where I have to ask my parents permission to make a decision for myself. We don't share the same values, and I feel like in their eyes I'm still 17 or something.

People my age , or younger than me, live on their own. 

In addition to that, I feel like I should be able make decisions like:
- get a medical marijuana card to treat my depression, anxiety, and insomnia
- go out on a date with a girl 
- choose my own friends and girls I date without having to get their approval from my parents
-buy a plane ticket overseas if it means getting an internship
- go to certain social events if there's a possibility I'll make a friend who'll save me from being a homebody in isolation all the time.

There are other, not so important choices, that'd I'd be able to make for myself as well.

I mistakenly tell people what I can and cannot do because my parents said so, and they always seem shocked when I tell them I'm 20.

It feels strange being 20 years old and ending up telling people ""I can't do ____ because my parents won't let me"".


The pros I see of this:
- my social life becomes better ( right now it seems nonexistent )
-my dating life becomes existent , and I have my own place.
- I'm given the freedom to personally explore myself and  grow *as my own person*
- one day I need to learn how to live without my parents anyways

The cons I see of moving out
- inevitable homesickness 
- money is going to be tight 
- my room in my parents basement is my safe haven, and if I move out - no more safe haven.
- it's gonna be tough getting used to living without my parents, and at certain points I'm gonna feel really discouraged , alone , and feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.

I also plan on transferring to university in two years at least, so maybe I should just wait until then.

But it's gonna be weird to be 21, drinking a beer in front of my mom while she's telling me I can't be friends with John Doe because she thinks he  smokes weed.

I wish I could talk to them about how I'm feeling, but they're always gonna pull that ""their house, their rules"" card.

I really want to get *out there* and grow as a person, and I feel like my parents are holding me back from doing that, but at the same I like how much money I'm saving, and I feel like I'm more in a safe space at my parents house.

Given the fact that I have to move out sooner or later, I'm not sure which of the decisions will benefit me more.

In a picture perfect world, I'd still be independent enough to get ""out there"" and make decisions for myself, and my parents would let me stay with them until I'm financially independent enough.

I am a 22 year old with a full time job in the public safety sector. I have a 2 year degree in a social science completely unrelated to anything technical. I like my job but I don't know if it's my passion.

I don't have any particular background in IT but I've been around computers my whole life, know the hardware and basic computer troubleshooting stuff just from experience, and have been using websites like codecademy, and freecodecamp to mess around with some HTML, JS, Python, etc.

I am interested in IT and see it as a promising and growing field, I am particularly interested in security aspects or potentially forensics, that would kind of play into the career field I am already on.

My question is this, I am interested in the IT field but my current job is pretty good to me except for the hours (overnights and every weekend), but as for pay, benefits, PTO, etc, it's very agreeable. Not saying I'd never consider a career change, but I'm not going to change a career before I even know if that's the career I want.

So my question - is it possible to moonlight in some IT work, part-time, per diem, PT internship? Whatever? Just some way to see what the field really looks like from the inside and be able to determine if it would be a fit.

Thanks for any responses!"
3ympfs,22,2015-12-29,Advice for a Rails bootcamp grad struggling to find work.,__iceman__,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/3ympfs/advice_for_a_rails_bootcamp_grad_struggling_to/,"As a graduate of a Rails bootcamp in Atlanta, I'm surprised by how difficult it has been to find a job.  I come from a non-tech /CS background but have always had an affinity for tech and grew up on the internet (like early 90's dial up!)  I finished the Rails bootcamp back in April and have been on the job hunt ever since.  I've done a few code challenges, over 6,000 points on Treehouse(Ruby, Rails, SQL, Git), some of the Rails/Ruby/TDD courses on Upcase, Rails/Ruby on Codecademy &amp; CodeSchool.  I recently finished a two month internship at a local start earlier this month.  I attend the Ruby meetups here in Atlanta and I try to be active on some of the Slack chatroom forums.  I'm beginning to teach myself Angular as well.  

I feel like I've put in a lot of effort on the job front as well.  I've applied to at least 40 + jobs but only have received one offer from a company out of the Atlanta area.  Any advice for someone in my situation?  I'm a pretty outgoing and social person, so I don't need to be told to ""put myself out there"" (I bartend for a living, so small talk is an essential thing I've learned.)  I got the internship by introducing myself to the CEO at a meetup.  I'm not opposed to relocation, but I would need help from the employer. 

I seem to get a lot of push back for not having any CS background.  Any practical way around this or ways to get some CS street cred?  Read some books on data structures and algorithms?  How can I display CS core competencies?

I plan to work on a personal project of a Rails API with an Angular front end to keep myself busy.  My final project from the bootcamp was a JSON API with an Angular front end (Angular done by another student taking the front end course.)

As far as a junior Rails developer salary goes, what is an acceptable salary range for someone in my position?"

During this time apart he became quite jealous, and agonised over the thought of my cheating on him while out with my friends. I've given him no reason to think this, except for things that happened before we became exclusive. Anyway, one night he got very drunk with his fellow interns and had sex with one of them, who also was/is in a relationship. He didn't plan on ever telling me and we had an amazing fall semester together. 

It's winter break now and we're apart for a month, he just broke this news to me yesterday. I don't know what to do. For starters, he betrayed me in one of the worst ways possible, but he also made a terrible assumption about me and used that to justify his actions. He says the reason he finally decided to tell me is because he now see's a future with me, he loves me, this I believe. And I love him. But I can't see myself staying with him as this pain is just gonna slap me in the face if we ever go through a slightly rough patch. How can I ever trust him again? He's my best friend in college and most of our friends are mutual, so ending this relationship would probably make me very lonely.

It all seemed like it was gonna work out great. 

Unfortunately, a year ago I got pretty sick and went home for a month before winter break last year but we would text almost every day.  When I got back, we both expected to start hanging out but I decided to focus on other things.  I have really been excelling in my business finance major with school and internships, I am a very social guy with many friends, I've made some good money for myself, and I know I am definitely taking the right steps towards becoming a very wealthy and successful man.  I think about my career, future, and investments every day and I love it.  

But recently I have been thinking a lot about her.  It seems like she is doing very good as well, she's really into fashion and seems very driven.  I know she is a great girl, and I definitely want to be with her one day.  But I don't know if that time should be now. I am very focused and trying to get my life organized while trying to be completely independent.  But at the same time, I don't want to miss my chance for this great girl. The type of girl I would marry. 

I don't know if having a girlfriend would distract me and make me think about her during my day when I would normally be thinking about things that would help better myself and my future.  My number one priority is to have a successful future and be financially very well off, but having an amazing girl is also important to me and I think this is something I'll regret if I miss. 

I think she would still be down to date me, but it's hard to actually conjure up the strength to take it to that level and start talking to her again.  And there's the fact of me being unsure about the whole thing. What do you guys think?"

I'm not particularly looking for advice (because I think the issue has been resolved?), but if anyone could share similar stories or sentiments I'd love to hear them -- and if not, just consider this a cautionary tale to keep in mind when you look for your own place!

For the past few days I've been looking for cheap student housing close to my city's downtown area because I'll be starting an 8-month internship around there in January. I'm not sure how common this is for other areas, but here gender and racial preferences (e.g., ""females only"") are very common for listings. So last night I found a female only listing that had everything I was looking for -- furnished and all inclusive, very reasonably priced, short commute from work -- and so my parents and I went to see the place earlier today. The listing also indicated ""Asians preferred"" and no one here ever states a preference for Asians (this is relevant), but I thought, ""Well, it's probably a house that's owned by an Asian couple, so they'll probably be fine with me because I'm Asian, right?""

Turns out I was far from the truth and that the property was an apartment unit owned by some dude in his late 20s/early 30s. It had a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen, and it was actually pretty nice. The landlord seemed very friendly (almost TOO friendly, now that I think back on it ...) and said that he was renting out the bedroom to help him pay rent, since he also lived in the unit and slept in a section of the living room separated by opaque screens. He mentioned that he'd rented out to several students in the past including five Japanese girls and a Spanish dude, among others, and that he liked cooking and didn't mind sharing food with his roommate. He also showed me some photos on his phone of him with some of his old roommates (they were all female). I asked him why he preferred Asian girls for roommates and was expecting a landlord-like response like, ""In my experience they're easiest to live with."" But instead he told me that he was interested in Asian culture since he was a kid and included some other backstory about his life, including the fact that he had ""tried a relationship"" but it hadn't worked out and for the past 8 months he had been trying to get his life back on track.

Anyway I think you know where this is going, but at the time my gut instinct didn't feel like anything was wrong and I was thinking, ""All kinds of people are really into Asian culture, right? And even if this dude is into his roommates, he seems like he'll back off once he finds out I have a boyfriend?"" Plus I really liked the place and so did my parents, so we put down a rent deposit immediately in exchange for the keys and my dad and I went to get the money as well as my younger sister from the car. As soon as we came in my sister whispered to me, ""Are you sure you're okay with this? This seems really sketch,"" before telling me to look for hidden cameras in the room because /r/LetsNotMeet made her super paranoid. I just kind of laughed her off. But then right before we left, the landlord mentioned that his neighbours were really nosy and that he didn't like talking to them so if any of them asked me what I was doing, I should ""say something like you're living with your boyfriend"".

I don't know what I was thinking at this point but as soon as I got back home, I phoned my (actual) boyfriend and told him everything about the place, including everything the landlord said and how he acted. His response was, ""Yeah, I'm getting a really bad feeling about this and I know I can't tell you where to live, but the more you talk about it the worse it sounds."" I also called up one of my close older female friends and she said, ""I don't have a bad feeling, but it is a weird feeling. It's a strange setup. Even if he respects your boundaries, it'll be awkward living in super close quarters like that, especially when your boyfriend visits.""

I think my dad also felt something because he started telling me about how there's a device out there that can scan for hidden cameras and he was considering buying me one. So I blurted out, ""Dad, I changed my mind because I talked to my friends and they all said they had a bad feeling about this place,"" and after a moment he simply said, ""Okay, call him and see if we can return the keys and get our money back this evening. We can leave now, it's not that late."" So I phoned the guy and as soon as I told him I'd changed his mind he went from being super warm and friendly to kind of hostile, and he told me that I would only get half of my deposit back (which is actually illegal). So my mom took over the call with him and got him to concede to giving us 90% of the money now and the other 10% next week because he admitted that he'd already ""spent it"" and didn't get paid until then. And then my parents and I drove all the way across the city in a raging snowstorm as I told them exactly what was written in the listing description, and then my dad pointed out, ""That explains why he was saying that he didn't mind cooking for you. He probably wanted you to sit down and have dinner with him.""

Anyway my parents have most of their money back, and they got the landlord to sign a note saying that he returned 90% of the money and that we'll come to pick up the remainder next week at the specified time. (Apparently when my parents went up to meet him, he didn't say anything. Even though earlier he was super talkative and after meeting us he sent me a text where one of the sentences said, ""I enjoyed meeting your family :)"".) I'm kind of bummed that the place was too good to be true, but I don't mind settling for another place. Better safe than sorry, and I hope all you 2xcers can also stay safe!

**TL;DR: Didn't realize that landlord was a creepy dude who (possibly) preys on his female tenants. Was ready to move in until three people closest to me advised me not to. Got most of my deposit back. The red flags were all there, it just took me a while to realize them as flags.**"

I'm dominant and into many kinks. I am pretty open for some play today but here are a few prompts.

1- cheat on your man with me. This can go a few ways. But I am mostly looking for you to be mad at your boyfriend/husband and come to me ready to fuck. Setting and characters are up for discussion.

2- the prostitute. You're hard up for cash and you decide to see what you can get for your body. You post on the website like Backpage or craigslist and hope for the best. You get a call from me and schedule a time to come over to my house. When you get there you realize that we know each other, either from work or the gym or somewhere. You get embarrassed and try to leave but I make you go through with it. This one would be a dub con

3- the intern. I'm the boss of a sales team. We hire you as an intern. You are extremely naïve and believe anything I say. I convince you that it's normal for an intern to suck her boss' cock after hours.

I love deep throat, light bondage, age play, anal, cum shots, and more. I'm up for these or any other ideas that you might have. Hope to talk to you soon"
3ynhrq,10,2015-12-29,If Clinton and Trump are in the general it will be tough for Hillary to combat his candid style. Do you think Hillary will be able to tap into the Clinton teflon with Trump's crude attacks?,atomicpete,PoliticalDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ynhrq/if_clinton_and_trump_are_in_the_general_it_will/,"First of all I don't support Hillary or Trump, but have come to the realization that if nothing changes between now and the primaries they will be the nominees.  I also don't agree with where Trump is taking things, but he is like something that the Clintons have never faced, at least in an election.

As noted in the following article, it looks like Trump may attack Hillary through Bill.  On Monday, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Clinton of having a “terrible record of women abuse” and warned that he would be a liability to her campaign.

http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/28/donald-trump-takes-on-bill-clintons-behavior-toward-women/?_r=0

Over the weekend, Mr. Trump said that that Mrs. Clinton was playing the “woman’s card” and that her husband’s sexual history would be fair game as the 2016 race ramped up. “His presidency was really considered to be very troubled, to put it mildly, because of all of the things that’s she talking to me about,” Mr. Trump said

Mr. Clinton admitted to having an affair with an intern while he was president and rumors that there were other instances of infidelity have swirled around him for years. His political opponents tried unsuccessfully to have him removed from office and the issue has largely receded in the ensuing decades.

But Mr. Trump is going there.

In pursuing this line of attack, Mr. Trump appears to be taking a page from the playbook of his former political adviser Roger Stone. Mr. Stone, a veteran Republican strategist who worked for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, published a book earlier this year titled “The Clintons’ War on Women” in which he accuses Mr. Clinton of being a serial philanderer and a rapist who he compared to the disgraced comedian Bill Cosby.

Although Mr. Stone is no longer officially affiliated with Mr. Trump’s campaign, he has been encouraging the criticism of Mr. Clinton on social media while promoting his book. He accused Mrs. Clinton on Monday of bullying her husband’s sexual assault victims and over the weekend he reposted an old photograph on Twitter of Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky standing together in the White House."

Title: **Something which happened this year, should be resolved by the end of the year**

Jan Ken Pon! Aiko-desho!

Year 2015 is ending in a few days. 

Looking back on this year, Aiko found a fact and was surprised!!

I've been taking plane-ride every single month in this year!

It's my first time to travel by plane this often since I joined Sakura Gakuin.

Or more precisely, I've never taken plane-ride this often in my life. lol

By travelling back and forth between Kagoshima and Tokyo, Aiko has been trying my best to be successful as both a Sakura girl and a middle-schooler. And at the same time, Aiko has kept watching movies -- that's my hobby -- and watched 16!! movies.

The first movie I watched in this year was 'Big Hero 6' and the last one was 'WE ARE Perfume -- WORLD TOUR 3rd DOCUMENT'. I have something to say for every these movies, but it's hard to write all of them. This time, I want to introduce some of them♥

The first movie I want to recommend is 'The Intern' on which my favorite actress Anne Hathaway-san plays the lead. I watched a movie with subtitle for the first time. Honestly, it was tough for my eyes and brain to watch movies while reading subtitle. But...

The movie rapidly attracted me as time proceeds. 

Anne Hathaway plays a successful 'high flying career' woman. She meets an elderly man Robert De Niro and gradually realize the importance of relationship with others, comes to know what is the most precious thing as a human being.

It's very heart-warming story and you'll feel indescribable happy feeling after watching it.

The second movie is 'Heroine Shikkaku'【No longer a Heroine】 Anyway, the leading actress Kiritani Mirei-san is just awesome. Although she is so beautiful and neat, she plays a comedienne perfectly. So, the movie is super fun! I thought I must learn acting from her. It's also fun to see Fukuda Ayano-san plays a role of a high-school girl. An AMUSE KIDS girl Negishi Himena-chan plays a role of Kiritani Mirei-san in her childhood. She is very good at acting, as you can expect in a movie actress.

Aiko want to be better at acting.

The third movie I recommend is, as you expect, 'WE ARE Perfume -- WORLD TOUR 3rd DOCUMENT'.

Daily life of three of Perfume-san, their state in dressingrooms, their behavior at rehearsals, their expression just before shows, and of course videos of shows...there are full of highlight scenes. You can also watch scenic beauties and tourist spots all over the world, and you can feel as if you were travelling together with Perfume-san.

Besides these movies, 'Biri-Gal' and 'Bakuman' -- there appear AMUSE actresses in both movies -- were great♡

Now I've introduced some good movies, but screening of them are done. Please check DVDs or Blu-rays!!

In this year-end, I can go back to Kagoshima earlier than usual. So, I want to enjoy a lot of movies and DVDs to get inspired.

Fukei-sans, please tell me your recommendations!!!

To Fukei-sans; Thank you very much for your supporting me in this year.

I'll try my best in 2016 again, so please keep supporting me.


To Teachers of Sakura Gakuin; At 0:00 a.m. on December the 1st, Dorm members gave me a surprise birthday party. They gave me an icecream-cake and I had it. I apologize for my having sit up late☆ ('Something which happened this year, should be resolved by the end of the year' lol)

3ynr6o,274,2015-12-29,Resources for the list of most bang-for-buck things every intern should know before starting.,ankihelp,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3ynr6o/resources_for_the_list_of_most_bangforbuck_things/,"This is a follow up to [meddit's amazing advice to interns post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3yinay/list_the_5_most_bangforbuck_things_an_intern/) from yesterday. 

Now that there is a tentative consensus about what interns would most benefit from brushing up on/memorizing prior to the beginning of their internship, I wanted to collect advice, articles, lectures, blogs etc. on each topic. 

**EDIT: Any and all comments, suggestions, pearls, resources would be very much appreciated. I have added what I feel I know something about. Will update accordingly.**

I have modified the list a little bit for clearity - I feel the points should be fairly specific as the original idea was to find *specific* things an intern should brush up on (e.g. management of electrolyte derangements is pretty broad). I will first post the list without any links to resources and then add them with edits. Hopefully, I will have some crowdsourced help from meddit. The list is as follows: 

**1) Fluids. How and when to use them, dosage, timing and other pearls.** 

- [Review of fluids](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakWOfKcCcCZBMlKIJLofiOhp) (not how to use them per se) by Dr. Strong /u/ericstrong

- [Maintenance Intravenous Fluids in Acutely Ill Patients - NEJM](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1412877?rss=mostViewed) Not sure about the relevance. Please comment, may remove. 

- Pretty thorough review of fluid management on [openanesthesia.org](http://www.openanesthesia.org/fluid-management/)

Still hoping for a more practical no frills do-this-then-that-resource. 


**2) Nausea. When to treat, how to treat and at what dose.** 

**3) Standard pn orders: pain killers, sleep aids and antiemetics aka how to reduce nighttime calls from nurses by 25%**

**4) ""Reflex"" antibiotic choice for routine inpatient infections.**

- http://www.bpac.org.nz/Supplement/2013/July/antibiotics-guide.aspx /u/ChristianM and u/ive_been_up_allnight

**5) Initial work-up and treatment of dyspnea.** (more realistic to approach by symptoms as, unfortunately, you first have to diagnose whats wrong. E.g. heart failure, pulmonary edema, embolism, COPD, pneumonia).

**6) Initial work-up and treatment of oliguria/anuria.**

**7) A sensible initial approach to suspected ileus.**

**8) Blood. When, how, why to replace.**

**9) Pain. Optimal management without inducing narcosis.**

- [Managing cancer pain: Frequently asked questions: CCJM](http://www.ccjm.org/index.php?id=107937&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=365585&amp;cHash=bbfa0a0455a459f2d18e792efcec9334)

**10) Potassium. When, why and how to shift or replace.**

- A review on both potassium and sodium disorders by Dr. Strong /u/ericstrong (Not reposted in 12) hyponatremia but applies there as well) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakXVIAapcSEleP4doUdHVtld

**11) Hyponatremia. Most common electrolyte disturbance, commonly mismanaged.**

**12) Resuscitation aka commit the ACLS algorithms to memory.** 

- Current ACLS guidelines. https://www.acls.net/aclsalg.htm

Would love a video series, interactive cases etc. 

**13) Basic EKG interpretation.**

**Whole EKG video courses**

- A [whole free youtube EKG video review course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakXhL1WoDvNPm1cG57pjE0d7) by meddit's own u/ericstrong

**Practice EKGs with answers**

- Watching videos isn't enough, you still have to grind out EKGs to keep your game strong. Visit http://ecgmadesimple.com and http://ecg.bidmc.harvard.edu/maven/mavenmain.asp for this.

My concern is that a program such as this that **doesnt** require GRE test scores. How can i distinguish myself enough to be competitive in this selection process when my GPA is a whole point lower than there average accepted GPA?

I am working with some really niche tools that are quite painful to use. The work itself is not challenging in the slightest. The code I write basically boils down to manipulating json strings. I feel like an intern could do my job. 

I was at my previous job for 5 years (a well-known corporation), where I worked my way up through the ranks and became a senior developer. I also have 2 internships on my resume. I decided to change things up by moving to a new city and taking a job at a small company in a new domain. Here I am. 

When I look at my coworkers I can tell I am over qualified. Perhaps it was a red flag when they turned out a verbal offer 2 hours after my interview. 

I feel like the longer I stay here the more stagnant my skills will become. At my last job I was constantly learning new things. Now if I want to learn something new it has to be on my own time.

People talk bad about job hoppers. I don't want a big mark on my resume if I leave so soon, but on the other hand I don't want my skills to stagnate and end up leaving me to climb out of a career black hole. How do you balance these competing forces?"
3ynzyt,4,2015-12-29,Feeling hopeless and depressed,lonewarrior92,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3ynzyt/feeling_hopeless_and_depressed/,"Hello everyone, I am a 23-year-old male who has been unemployed for the past year. I graduated from University late 2014 with a degree in Business Administration. During that time, I also worked in the University part time as an administrative assistant. My duties included data entry, answering phone calls and emails, and sorting and delivering mail. I did this throughout my 4 years in college. During my last year in college, a female coworker threatened me with physical violence, and claimed that her boyfriend, who was about to be released from jail, would come after me. She threatened me because her friend, another female coworker and I were getting along well. She felt jealous about this and began to slander me. In fact, the other female coworker explained to me that the crazy coworker was coming on to her saying stuff like “Only a woman knows what a woman needs” and other flirtatious comments. I have nothing against people’s sexual preferences, but slander and threats are a different matter. I felt very uncomfortable by this crazy coworker and told my supervisor. His reaction was “you’re still alive aren’t you?”. He made no effort to reprimand the coworker or show any concern for my safety. I then went to Human Resources, and told the HR manager the situation and she just brushed it off as if it were not important. She then contacted the director for my department and had me demoted with fewer working hours (punishment for whistleblowing). The coworker who threatened me kept her job, and was not reprimanded.

Upon graduation, I left the job voluntarily and began to look for work. Jobs that I was qualified for did not want to hire me. My gut tells me my former employer is bad mouthing me. No matter how hard I try to find work, it never works out. I stay at home applying for jobs daily and have become so depressed. I really don’t know what to do. I’ve even applied to internships and volunteer positions and to my surprise they ask for prior work experience! What’s the point of an internship then? Although I have experience, it does not match their criteria as they are looking for a specific skillset. I then turned to staffing agencies and have regretted it. They just ask me to fill out forms and give them my references. My references have told me the staffing agencies are soliciting their services and never once asked about me or my work ethic. I can’t believe staffing agencies have come to this. It’s as if they post fake job listings to get job seekers to come in the office, take all their information, and never get them a job. I think they have a daily quota and get paid not to place jobs for job seekers but rather to get their personal information. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 2014 to report my former employer for demoting me in retaliation for whistleblowing, but they are so backed up with cases they won’t get to mine until late next year. Even then I doubt anything will be done about this. I even contacted attorneys in employment law and they all ask about my current job and salary. When I tell them I am unemployed, they refuse to take the case as I can’t afford to pay them.

I hate my life. I have thought of suicide in the past but kept trying to move forward. Now I have no reason to live. I have no money, no job, no friends, and no purpose. I have searched for ways to painlessly kill myself, but have no luck. All I see are articles as to why I should continue to live in misery. My whole life I have worked hard, and have helped my peers. Now in my time of need no one will help me. All the people I thought were my friends who I have helped numerous times, turned their backs on me. My own relatives don’t even talk to me because they hate my father. I am not responsible for what my father has done. I am my own person. In fact, I don’t even remember my father. He walked out on me when I was very young. I have never heard nor seen him since. I currently live with my mother, and every day she complains about me being unemployed and always finds something to pick at. The stress is unbearable. I just want to die."

3yoayt,38,2015-12-29,IAMA associate at a large boutique investment banking firm. It's pretty dead at work this week. AMA about IB recruiting or the job,restructuring,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3yoayt/iama_associate_at_a_large_boutique_investment/,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2l0lgj/iama_1st_year_analyst_at_a_large_boutique/)

So, it's been pretty dead at work and I thought I'd do a new AMA. A bit of background - I work in a restructuring group at a large boutique investment bank. I came from a target school with a low GPA, but a lot of networking.
 
My group conducted both summer analyst and full time analyst interviews this year. Here's how the undergraduate recruiting process works from a banking group's perspective


**1A. The Resume Drop**: During the summer, we will coordinate with HR to get resume drops set up at our target schools. These drops result in around 500 resumes per advertised position. 

Once we have the resumes, we screen you primarily on GPA and previous finance internships. At this point, we are only really glancing at the resumes - each one gets 10-15 seconds max. While there is no hard GPA cutoff, we will only pass you with a sub-par GPA if you have direct relevant experience.  Cover letters are skimmed. You also get a huge plus with course experience in a related field like mathematics, statistics, economics, etc.

**1B. Networking**: The other way to get into the process is through networking. Most of my networking requests have come through cold emails, forwarded resumes, and on-campus recruiting events. We have a de facto policy to speak to anyone that reaches out - if you're going to go to the effort of reaching out to me, it's the least I can do to talk to you for 15 minutes (unless I'm completely slammed). On these calls, I'm looking for a reason to pass you on to the next round - show me that you've some research on the position, and have your elevator pitch down.

We usually aim to pass 15 candidates and 5 alternates per position to the phone screen.

**2. The Phone Screen**: Congratulations, you passed the resume screen. Now, you get on the phone with me or another junior person in the group for thirty minutes. This is a structured interview. I will ask you three or four fit questions and three technical questions. 

&gt;Example questions:

&gt;- Tell me about yourself

&gt;- Why are you a good fit for this group?

&gt;- Tell me about your last internship

&gt;- What are your favorite classes?

&gt;- [Bond math] All else being equal, which financial instrument would you expect to have a higher yield, a 5 year bond or 7 year bond?

&gt;- [Accounting] Walk me through how X would affect a company's financial statements

&gt;- [Brainteaser] Is 899 prime?

Usually by the time I make it through these questions, we'll have 5-10 minutes for you to ask questions. This portion can really make or break your interview. This is a chance to have an actual conversation instead of just regurgitating canned answers to canned questions.

We aim to pass 7 candidates and 3 alternates per position to the second round.

**3. Second-Round Interviews**: These are 30-45 min in-person or videoconference interviews with the associates/VPs of the group. This is a softer interview focused on fit and can get much more subjective. You'll be asked to walk them through your resume before opening it up to informal conversation. Just be yourself. We're a relatively small group and fit is really important to us. We will literally be in the same room for 60-80 hours a week for the next two years so we need to know you're relatively normal. 

We aim to pass 3 candidates and 2 alternates per position to super days.

**4. The Super Day**: We fly you out to interview for a full day in our office. There's a case study/project, a series of technical questions, and a full hour interview with our managing directors. Do your homework - we expect you to be prepared. Appearance matters too. Dress nice, comb your hair, and smile. 

After the super day, the group has a meeting and an informal poll on who we give offers to. The managing directors have supervotes. We usually give out the actual offers the following Monday.

So, that's it. I'll be answering questions for most of the day.

Edit: I'm signing off for the night. Feel free to ask any questions you have anyways - I'll answer in the morning."
3yobab,147,2015-12-29,I don't know what happened to it,mkcrto,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3yobab/i_dont_know_what_happened_to_it/,"About a year ago I was working as a help-desk intern for a large American ISP.  I handled requests from internal employees, and one of the most common of those was equipment pickups. So a manager would request a laptop for a new employee and when it was ready we would have the employee come and pick it up.  This story recounts one of those occasions.

Important background: Several thousand people worked in this particular location, so we constantly had a backlog of at least 50 reimages at any given moment, and they were all handled on a first-come, first-served basis.

The story:

A new employee comes up to the helpdesk and asks to pick up her laptop.  
&gt; Her: ""Hi, I'm new here and I came to pick up my laptop. Am I in the right place?""  
&gt; Me: ""You certanly are! What's your username? So I can look for it in the cabinet.""  
&gt; Her: ""It's &amp;lt;her username&gt;""  
&gt; Me: ""Okay, let me check.""  

I look through the cabinet and don't see a laptop with her username on the label.

&gt; Me: ""I don't see it in there. Did you get an email saying that it was ready to be picked up?""  
&gt; Her: ""No, but my manager told me to come up here because she needs me to start working on a new project and my loaner laptop is too slow.""  
&gt; Me: ""I see. Well, unfortunately, we have a backlog of reimage requests, so yours probably isn't ready yet. But, we'll send you an email when it is and you can come pick it up then.""  
&gt; Her: ""Okay.""  

She goes back down to her floor and I help the next person in line. Maybe an hour or two later, she comes back up again.

&gt; Me *(starting to walk towards the cabinet)*: ""Hi again. Did you get the email saying your laptop is ready?""  
&gt; Her: ""No, but my manager told me to come back up because I really need that new laptop.""  
&gt; Me *(knowing that everyone really needs their new laptop now)*: ""I'm sorry, really I am, but we have to process the requests in the order that we get them. But let me check with the person who handles the reimages and see if I can get an ETA for you.""  
&gt; Her: ""That would be great, thanks.""

I look up the ticket number and walk to where we do the reimages. I can see laptops on docking stations sprawled across all the shelves. I ask the guy in charge of them, $ReimageTech, when he thinks this particular request will get done.  He looks into it and says that he should be able to get started on it by the next day. I go back to the user.

&gt; Me: ""Good news, your laptop is close to the top of the pile, so we should be able to get started on it for you tomorrow. You'll either be able to pick it up tomorrow afternoon or the following morning.""  
&gt; Her: ""Okay.""  

She leaves and I once again help the next person in line.  She comes back up twenty minutes later, but this time her manager is with her.

&gt; Manager: ""Hi, this is one of our new employees and she needs to get her new laptop.""  
&gt; Me: ""Right, it should be ready tomorrow afternoon or first thing the following day.""  
&gt; Manager: ""No, that's unacceptable. She needs it today so she can get started on a new project.""  
&gt; Me: ""Okay, let me go talk to the person who handles the reimages and see what he says.""  

I once again walk back to where we handle the reimages and talk to $ReimageTech. He's reluctant but he says he'll get started on it shortly and it should be done by the end of the day. I go back to the user and her manager.

&gt; Me: ""He's getting started on it now and he says it will be done by the end of the day.""  
&gt; Manager: ""That's better. We will receive an email when it's ready?""  
&gt; Me: ""That's correct.""  
&gt; Manager: ""Good, thank you.""  

They leave and a few hours pass. $ReimageTech comes out and places the laptop in the cabinet for pickup. He says he sent the email so the user should be up shortly. Sure enough, a few minutes later she and her manager arrive.

&gt; Me *(holding up the bag)*: ""Here's your laptop.""  
&gt; Her: ""Great!""  

I have her log in and make sure her email and other apps work properly. She is satisfied and they leave. I'm relieved that this headache is behind me.

But, I'm not so lucky. She comes back up maybe a half hour later holding the laptop. She shows it to me and it has a six-inch spiderweb crack towards the bottom right corner of the screen.

&gt; Me: ""Oh wow, how did that happen?""  
&gt; Her: ""I don't know! I had it on my desk and I looked down to read a paper for a few seconds and when I looked back up it was like this! Help!""  
&gt; Me: ""Is it possible that you placed it down a little too hard on the desk?""  
&gt; Her: ""No, I just looked at the paper and then it was like this! What do I do?""  
&gt; Me: ""Okay, well I'll have to put in a ticket for a screen repair.""  
&gt; Her: ""How long will that take?""  
&gt; Me: ""It may take a day or two. The ticket has to get assigned to a technician, they order the part from Dell, then it gets shipped here and they replace it.""  
&gt; Her: ""Oh. Will you give me a loaner laptop to use until then?""  
&gt; Me: ""Normally we only give loaners if your department doesn't have any spares.  You should still be able to use the one that you were using before you got this one.""  
&gt; Her: ""Okay.""  

I put in the ticket and she leaves. 

If only I could have been there when she told her manager that the brand new laptop, that she wasted both of their time in rushing, spontaneously cracked while ""sitting on her desk.""

TL;DR  
User and her manager rushed a new laptop to get done only for the user to crack the screen within 30 minutes, causing it to need repairs."
3yof0z,2,2015-12-29,I [20F] need to fight for us [20M]. I just don't know how. [1+ Year],funfun4every12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3yof0z/i_20f_need_to_fight_for_us_20m_i_just_dont_know/,"Hey Reddit, I'm in desperate need of help.

Before anyone comments, I know people may advise us to just break up. But I stick to my commitments and I love him, I will fight for us. I just need to know how.

Me and my boyfriend Alex have been together since December 2014. We are now in our second year of uni together. We study a demanding, competitive subject. We started off as friends, then hooked up, then got into a serious relationship. Our honeymoon phase was incredible. He's fun, vivacious, intelligent, driven, a wonderful lover, and he means the world to me.

First year of uni was basically a massive vacation where we were basically glued at the hip. Our sex life was incredible. We didn't really run into any problems and if we did it was resolved by the next day. As someone who comes from a string of bad relationships, this was absolutely shocking. I fell in love, hard. I know we're young but I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

But then things started getting rough. We come from the same hometown so we're usually in the same city for breaks.

**April**

We went home for study leave. I knew this would mean we'd see each other less with exams coming up, but it became a stark contrast. I saw him maybe 4 times in the month we were there and this made me really upset. I am 100% in support of prioritising studying first, but it seemed like everything came before me––family, friends, errands. He was really apologetic and would surprise me with little gifts to make up for it (e.g. getting flowers delivered etc). But I occasionally struggle with depression which had really flared up that month (I am in therapy) and I felt that I needed him there, not the gifts. He promised to make it up to me after exams ended and he did, we were back to normal after that. 

**July-August**

Between April and July we were back to being fully 100% in love and devoted to each other. But the same issues that arose in April arose here without the addition of schoolwork. He wanted to see friends from back home, spend time with his family, etc, so we didn't see each other for weeks at a time. I also waited for him to take initiative to see me and he didn't. I wouldn't communicate that I was upset until I was blowing up (not screaming, but definitely emotional). 

This took a serious toll on our relationship and we began fighting. Things were really rocky until he came down with pneumonia and was in hospital for about three weeks. He doesn't like having people around him when he's ill so although I offered to visit he declined. He was literally in and out of various blood tests etc all day. I was racked with worry about him. He regained his health and immediately had to leave on a pre-planned family vacation. While he was on vacation, I got a summer job and our relationship began to pick up speed towards the end of summer because we knew we'd be back at uni soon.

We spent the first two weeks of uni living together because my flat hadn't gotten all its furniture yet. Our relationship steadily improved but wasn't up to the early day level.

**December**

We come to now. This year is our second year of a highly demanding course, and our grades now count for 50% of our final mark. It's very high stress. He's been apologetic about being distant and busy but in his credit he's really taken on a lot of responsibility. I on the other hand was sort of in denial that our fun first year was over and kept putting off work and procrastinating. He got annoyed with this, and I kept promising I would change but never did.

We had our one-year anniversary and by then we were mostly fine. Again, not near the honeymoon level, but relatively stress-free. We've now returned home for the holidays and old issues are rearing their heads again. He's had two concurrent demanding internships and I haven't seen him since we came back in mid-December. 

I went back to therapy and I was shocked at how upset I was about the relationship and realised we needed to have a big big talk. Today we finally had a chance. 

He told me he was now having serious doubts about us in the long term because of these recurring issues. He said I often didn't take initiative to see him and said he wasn't a mind reader; he also said he had been extremely busy with Christmas, his internships, an essay we have due, and revision. We have study leave again in April and he's said if we can't resolve our issues by then we must separate. He also said he's awful with time management (he suffers from ADD but doesn't medicate) so he'll have to spend 2x the time on a task that I would. He's questioned whether we can keep the spark alive seeing each other so infrequently. He doesn't want us to resent each other.

**What now?**
 
He's said he's willing to work on these issues and he loves me, but that we really need to make a drastic change. He's expressed doubts about whether we can actually make these changes.

1. I'm now going back to CBT to work on my attachment issues so I can be less clingy, and also to learn coping strategies to express issues early on before they spiral into massive fights.
2. I am now studying up to 6/7 hours a day. I am fixing my sleep schedule and eating right. I plan on going to the library with him now so I can get work done and spend time with him too. I am applying for internships and being more optimistic.
3. I am going to actively initiate time to hang out and be understanding. We already have a stable date night, but we don't use it when we're in our hometown. I am considering implementing this for easter.
4. I am fighting for this relationship. It hurts me so much he has all these doubts about us. But I will do everything I can, because I don't want anything to fail just because I didn't make enough effort.

Despite these changes I'm making/going to make, I know he's still going to be doubtful. Does reddit have any advice for me? I know he loves me.

**TL;DR: My relationship is falling apart, but I won't let it go for lack of trying.**"
3yogem,1,2015-12-29,XFS data recovery,Fathochta,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3yogem/xfs_data_recovery/,"Hey techsupport, I find it funny that the worst cases come from those that already work in the field. I'm corporate tech support, mostly hands on, but I'm at a loss here. I've got a 2TB external that came from a NAS and I need to recover the files. 

Steps taken:

* Scanned through linux viewer for windows, prompted to pay ridiculous fee to actually recover. 

* Scanned through Undula, program crashed after compiling list before I could recover.

* Attempted to mount drive to a virtual box through XUbuntu, OS refused to see drive let alone map it. 

* Windows keeps saying to format, hell no. 

Are there any free working pieces of software designed to recover data, any that can scan and convert XFS to a readable format, or any black magic I can sacrifice an intern to? 

Help me brobiwan kenobi, you're my only hope."

3yolmi,3,2015-12-29,What is an entry level help desk position like?,WillFerralsMicrowave,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3yolmi/what_is_an_entry_level_help_desk_position_like/,"I had an interview for a helpdesk internship. 

When I went to the interview, two guys conducted it. 
They asked me normal question like who am I, and they also gave me scenarios related to the job.


Well one scenario was ""What would your troubleshooting process be if a client couldnt get internet?""

My response was 

""If they couldnt get internet then I couldnt do remote assistance so I'd have to go to their computer. First I'd check the ethernet cable on both ends to see if they're plugged in. Then I would open command prompt on their computer. First I'd ping google. Then I'd ping the gateway and check if other users are having internet issues as well. If they were I'd assume it was the gateway and I'd go from there. If it was only the one machine I would assume its a dhcp error and adjust it accordingly.""

The 2nd interviewer looked to the first interviewer and said ""That was actually a really good answer"" 

It made me happy that I seemed to be succeeding in this interview but it also confused me. 

They seemed impressed as if thats not something a typical IT guy would do. 

So it also makes me think what is help desk really like? Is everyone going to talk to me like im some moron who doesnt know what hes doing? Am I too competent to be holding an entry level position? I dont think I did something complex. I did a normal thing for testing internet connectivity. But they were genuinely impressed by it. 

Or were they impressed because its just a helpdesk internship so they didnt expect me to be fully competent "

I'm looking into applying for internships (PwC to be exact). My plan itself is to work my socks of during the internship and end up being offered a grad scheme at the end. 

However, my plan after that is to exit the company after 3 years having done the ACCA and move on to something else, maybe CF. When I have asked people opinions on this they are telling me the only way of being successful in doing this is by applying to only the London branches because there is more scope of networking - something that is very important. Furthermore, was told to apply to other London finance schemes over applying Big 4 non London areas.

I'm a junior at a northeastern university (fairly well regarded) looking for internships in the coming year. I switched to CS a little late in the game, so I've only taken four classes in the major--Java, Data Structures, a hardware/logic class, and discrete math. I think I have a pretty good grasp of the concepts though (all As). I've got my first interview for a software development internship in the next two weeks and I'm a bit curious as to what to expect. I've read some of the guides around here about technical interviews, but they don't seem to be a perfect fit for my situation. Here're my details:
*I applied for an internship at a small, tech-heavy company in the healthcare industry
*I've already done a basic, online technical test that was writing a function to do some simple data structures problem online.
*I got contacted for a second technical interview over the phone with an engineer at the company. They said it would be about 45 minutes.

So, basically, how will a tech interview on the phone work? They can't really have me write code, can they?

Thank you!!"
3yphv0,2,2015-12-29,Audio Buzzing on Transitions (PP 2015.1),AkyrXX,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/3yphv0/audio_buzzing_on_transitions_pp_20151/,"Can't figure this one out. I'm trying to mix audio for a bunch of talking head videos and I'm about to throw my computer out the window and start New Years early.

Trying to put transitions on tracks to smooth out edits, but every time I get this horrible buzzing during the transition. Doesn't appear in exports, but it's there in the timeline when editing. Doesn't matter what effect I use, all there. Keyframing audio is not a option.

Workflow is like this: Intern and/or Producer rough cut usable clips from interview in FCP7 -&gt; XML to me for the rest. I feel like the culprit is in the FCP7 -&gt; PPro exchange, but I can't figure out how to fix it. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there is two stereo tracks, on for left and one for right?

Only thing I can find is a bug from a couple years back. Other than that, I've been SOL on figuring this one out. It's probably something super simple I'm missing.

PPro 2015.1
OSX 10.10.5 on a Trashcan

Edit: Fixed it. Apparently XML import is completely broken right now in 2015.1. Moving to a new sequence with dual mono rather than dual stereo with one channel in each fixes that problem. Also if there is a slug in the sequence, it literally fucks everything up, and if you try to delete it, Premiere crashes instantly. 

Upside to this is I finally convinced our producer to start moving away from FCP7 and learn PPro. So that's cool. "

Based on my degree, high-income area (Northern Virginia, just off of DC), and factoring in my current internship, I'm estimating my starting salary to be in the $55K-60K mark (considering that's about how much the entry-level employees with my degree in my industry make). Given that a decent 1bed/1bath apartment goes for ~$1250/month and I'll have a hefty ~$45K in loans to pay off after college, I'm definitely going to live at home, live frugally and save up.

I'd like to know the pros and cons when it comes to using your savings to buy your first home in a very cheap area. I understand that both my salary and costs of living would go down, but would this strategy be cost effective? I'd have a very low mortgage and can dedicate even more money to my savings at that point."
3yplsh,3,2015-12-29,First internship coming up.,Bruhmon,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3yplsh/first_internship_coming_up/,"So i have been studying IT for 2 years now, and I have my first internship coming up soon and i have a few questions.

As much as i enjoy my study I don't have any real experience of IT in a corporate enviroment apart from the 'realistic projects' i get.
Now i was lucky enough to find an internship suitable for me and fulfills my schools requirements.
But it doesn't really feel that 'entry-level' to me because of the responsibilities i get shoved in my face.

Because i will be responsible for the IT service and setup for a small international company with no senior or direct colleagues i can rely on or ask for help.

And it's not that i am questioning my competence or feel like i am not able to manage all this, I feel this will be a great experience for me and i will really learn a lot from this opportunity, but i just need that little push into the right direction.

My work will be a variety of tasks from adding new users/e-mails, resetting passwords etc. to repairing/ordering new laptops/PC's, running backups, providing direct support, keeping the server alive and drinking a lot of coffee.

I know everyone's job is not the same, because different scenario's apply for everyone, but if anyone with experience can advice me. Or give me some tips on how to handle this workload properly and some standard procedures i could apply and check on during my first week. I would really appreciate that.

So currently I am a finance major in Iowa state university currently in my junior year with a 3.60 GPA and I am an international student from Malaysia wanting to stay in the United States.  I know a lot of the companies do not want to hire international students because they have to go through paper work and fees in order to hire me.  It is my dream to be able to stay here in the states.  I am willing to do whatever it takes to be able to find a job.  It is my last year of college so I am wanting some advice on what I should I do so I can locate a company that would be willing to hire me.  Does anyone know of any companies or anyone that offers internships or job offers for finance students who are international students? I really appreciate whoever took the time to read this. 
3ypzh9,1,2015-12-29,Course selection questions WRT interviews and beyond?,parkourdeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ypzh9/course_selection_questions_wrt_interviews_and/,"I'm currently a freshman CS major and am signed up to take data structures and computer system fundamentals in my second semester. Most freshmen didn't get into CSF because all the spots were taken by the time it was our turn to register, so I hope for this (and skipping Intro CS first semester) to put me a little ahead of the curve, as it's a requirement for most higher level CS classes.

Problem is, the majors-only section of data structures conflicts with CSF, but the professor is supposed to be quite a bit better.

Since most interviews tend to be data structures/algorithms oriented, I suspect having a better professor for data structures could definitely outweigh the benefits of getting a small head start on CS requirements, but I know that some companies also like you to know the material covered in CSF when you apply to an internship, and it'll help me in terms of being eligible for other classes earlier as well. What would you guys recommend? (If I drop CSF, I'd probably end up taking a non-CS course, BTW.)

Also, less important question, probably, but I've applied to a bunch of places already and wrote that I'd be taking data structs and CSF for the coming semester, so how much would it matter to those places if I didn't end up taking CSF, and do I need to let them know?"

3yqb01,2,2015-12-29,21 [M4F] NorCal - Looking to just talk to new people. Cute puppy pictures if you decide to read my post.,TrustMyself88,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/3yqb01/21_m4f_norcal_looking_to_just_talk_to_new_people/,"I kinda suck at this whole meeting and talking to people thing which is why I am probably on this.  I know this isn't really the right place to try to meet new people but I have to start somewhere right?

I recently got out of two back-to-back long term abusive relationships and since then I sorta have been distant and not really been talking to people, more than normally that is.  I don't want to go into detail about it but if you are interested send me a PM I'll tell you the whole story if you really want to know.

Since then I have sort of forgot how to actually talk to people without making it awkward or beyond something that is just small talk or just a reply/answer.  I am still okay with talking with other guys but I do not know how to talk to females at all anymore.  I miss having actual fun enjoyable talks with females like I have had in the past.

Well I guess I need to say a little about me as well? I am 21 years old and I am a full time student in college as well with a part time job. Although most of the money I earn is spent on my puppy.  I plan to graduate by June and then go for an internship for 1-2 years before I apply to graduate school.  

A few of my hobbies/interests:

* **First of all I LOVE my puppy.  Her name is Bella and she is basically my baby.  I love her to death and I will be with her forever.  She is a 4 month old German Shepard/Pit Bull mix.  She is absolutely adorable, but don't let her cuteness fool you.  She is also one of the most destructive living things I have ever seen.  She loves people and will not hesitate to slobber all over your face every second of your life.**

* **I love to watch films, TV shows, anime, or any type of visual entertainment.  I've often been called the ""Critic"" by my friends because of how harshly I judge these films/shows.  I don't really mind because I still find watching anything that is horrendous still enjoyable.  I used to keep up with anime but with today's lack of free time I haven't had time to.**

* **I used to be an avid gamer but with the lack of free time I haven't really had much time to be gaming anymore.  I still play a few games but most of my games now reside on my phone, on a board with lots of pieces, or on many cards.  I still own an Xbox One but it is mainly now my Netflix box.**

* **I love and hate all different kinds of food.  I am usually not picky with the exception of a few particular foods.  I hate pickles and cucumbers and anything of the sort.  I cannot fathom how anyone can stand to eat those things.  I do not like to eat any kind of steak, it just does not taste good to me.  Whenever I tell anybody about this they always just stare at me like I am crazy.  I love to eat nice fancy food if I can, but otherwise my wallet directs me to more affordable options.**

* **I enjoy going to the gym and working out but as of recently I haven't had the time or had a partner to go with me.  I am still fairly new to going to the gym.  I dislike cardio a lot but I am starting to try to get into it, mainly because my puppy loves to run and I need to be able to keep up with her.**

* **I haven't really been a big music listener in the past but I am now trying to get into the music scene, although unsuccessfully.  I enjoy Electronic Dance Music and I plan to go to the upcoming EDC event next year! Woo!!!**

Anyways I'm pretty sure there is a lot more about me that I can ramble on about so if you want to talk more don't hesitate to send me a message.  Just leave your preferred method on contact in your message and I will try to get back to you.  I have most of the popular messaging apps but what I do prefer the most is a plain old text message.  I am just looking to be able to talk to someone anytime of the day especially at the dead of night which is most easily done via texting for me.  Don't let this discourage you from sending me a message if you feel insecure of sending me your phone number as I can understand.  Just message me your most comfortable way of contact and I can most likely accommodate.  [Well enough about me, this is all what you are here for right?](https://imgur.com/gallery/kpECB/new)

Thank you for your time and reading through this entire post and I wish you all happy holidays!

3yqc67,3,2015-12-29,The year is about to end and it's been my worst ever,lonelyguybroke,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/3yqc67/the_year_is_about_to_end_and_its_been_my_worst/,"Hi, thanks for reading!

Well, I've always been a loser but I always worked and three years ago I started to study a new career for the better. I had to work and study, yet living with my parents because in my country it's hard to get away from home unless you have friends or a girlfriend who moves with you to live together.
I left a job early this year for an internship due to my studies, the internship was awful and I couldn't stay there but I didn't think I would never find another chance to get a job during the rest of the year (this happened about 6 months ago). Now, I barely have any money.

Psychologically I feel really bad, I always was a lonely guy but now I don't have a job and no money even to buy cheap stuff, I'm not on drugs or alcohol btw. I'm studying CS but nobody hires a CS student unless he's doing an internship.  I've done well in my studies, including the internship even though it was such a bad company. Last time I checked my account I had like 25 dollars.

My parents are poor and we live with an aunt. The neighborhood is not good (loud music, people who sell drugs, ghettoes) but it's not terrible for our standards because neighbors don't mess with us directly. Yet I wanna leave as fast as possible because it's what I should do but I can't now. 

As you can guess I don't have friends to vent, I have classmates but not real friends. Sometimes I wanna cry but tears won't come up, I haven't had a breakdown ever since although I know I'm at my lowest point. It's as though crying was giving up or plainly wrong.

So, I'm not lazy, yet nothing works well in my ""adult life"" whereas others live by themselves, stressed, with problems but with friends and family, a partner who supports them. I'm at the bottom. If I died I wouldn't be remembered by too many people. Not that I want to die literally, there are some dreams that still put me on the move like travelling in the future when I finish my career (this year if everything goes fine academically). Reading books is the only thing that makes me forget about this shit and fortunately I live in a city where there are lots of libraries around and one of them is at a walkable distance.

Now it's new year's eve and I'm gonna go with my parents to see some relatives. I prefer that to stay in this house that I loathe but if I could afford it I would have gone elsewhere. I won't be able to tell them how worried about my near future I am, it's gonna be a nice dinner with fireworks nearby and that's it. 

I need a shoulder to cry on (and a job or a good internship). Now at least I've put this off my chest. 

If you read this thanks. I hope we have a good 2016.

What is wrong with me?,wontgivebackstuff,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3yqr0s/he_was_terrible_but_i_miss_him_so_much_what_is/,"I had such a rollercoaster ride that when I type it out it all sounds so bizarre to me how things happened. Sorry I just need to vent, and need support right now more than anything. Most of the time I just want to crawl under a rock.

D and I met at a workplace 4 years ago, I was an intern there and after I left from the workplace he pursued me relentlessly. I was very cautious at first because people at the workplace really didn't like him (RED FLAG number 1). But he was so charming, and wonderful to me I fell for him hard. I believe he really did love me, and I believe that we had some marvellous times together.

Half a year into us dating, he lost his job and I've been financially supporting the both of us for almost 3 years as he tried to get a job. The problem is, he's a smart guy but he's the CEO or nothing type. So I've actually relocated countries twice for him now as he tried to pursue different things and I supported him through it all. Last year he tried to do a business in a country he didn't speak the language, and lo and behold, I stupidly relocated and supported him through all of that. When the company failed, we were both really devastated.

He got a job in a different state (yet again) and I wasn't willing to relocate this time so I stayed put and he promised to come back on weekends and work there during the week. After he moved there, he would go radio-silent for most days of the week and he told me it was because he was busy. When I found out it was because he was sleeping with girls and prostitutes I was furious and threw him out of my apartment. That was two months ago.

My family and I supported him through a lot. The whole relationship is bizarre how everything even happened. After I threw him out he sent me a really indignant email blaming me for everything. 

I don't understand why people do this, I don't understand why he would treat people like this. I definitely know that getting back together is NOT an option, especially after all that he's done. But I don't get it and I just really want an apology from him or even acknowledgement what he's done. After I caught him the first thing he said was ""I thought you had someone"".

So here I am, living in a country I relocated to for him not knowing what I'm going to do with my life. I try to tell myself every day that things will get better and that I will come out of this stronger but it's so hard, I don't really trust myself.

Sorry for the rant. It will get better.

He messaged me on boxing day saying Merry Christmas. It's not even Christmas anymore asshole."

I teach 4th grade. I've managed to make it to winter break with only a few breakdowns, but it seems like I'm having my biggest during a time when I'm supposed to be relaxing. I like teaching and I like my students, but the work and the stress is killing me. I'm dreading going back. During this break I was able to do things that I used to do before I started teaching (play video games, read, sew, etc.) and I'm not really willing to give up my hobbies for nights where I'm getting stuff ready and having panic attacks for the next day. To top it all off, I have one parent in particular who basically thinks I suck because her son has a F in reading. I have some students who are super successful, some have shown improvement, and some are still way behind. The other 4th grade reading teacher (who is kind of like my mentor) has told me time and time again that teachers aren't miracle workers, and that there's always going to be students who struggle no matter how hard you try. I still feel like a failure.

In my student teaching, I earned straight ""highly effectives"" and I was the mentor intern for other interns who were struggling. My principal has come through my classroom a few times and I've somehow gotten effectives in everything but classroom management, which was rated as developing. For someone who is a perfectionist, that one rating destroyed me. I think my principal thinks I suck and I have nightmares about getting fired. I'm slightly intimidated by her even though I know she's fair, and my mentor teacher (who talks to the principal more than I do) says I'm fine. My official observation is sometime when I get back from break and I'm terrified. 

I know that many first year teachers feel like this and there's something called a ""disenchantment"" period. I'm just afraid that mine won't go away. I feel like crawling in a hole somewhere and dying. I'm anxious about being evaluated again, anxious that that angry parent is going to get me fired somehow, and I'm anxious that I'm not adequate. Even during the break I felt guilty for relaxing and not getting stuff done. I've even done research on possibly switching careers. I just don't see things getting any better. I don't know the purpose of this post, I just wanted somewhere to post my sad little rant. "

I'm a grad student for Montreal, doing a four month internship in Ottawa, and need to find a place ASAP (like by Saturday) since I realized that I was in contact with this scammer that started pressuring me to send him money last minute.

I was wondering how you can go about looking for housing near Carleton and most importantly - how the hell do you just *know* something is an obvious scam? I moved from BC to Montreal without having visited first and I ordered a title search on the property my apartment was in to check identity and the status of the building and everything was okay - I didn't think I would need to do the same thing for Ottawa, but after this experience I'm really nervous.

The room I found was average priced, address checked out on Google maps and earth view, everything looked okay.. so would you guys have any tips for me in avoiding things like this in the future? 

Lastly, if anyone knows of a place (room) that is up to $500 a month, could you send it my way? (Also, if uh, anyone would like to let a pathetic, starving student sleep on their couch next week I can offer money compensation and cooking skills haha.. ha.. kidding, not really)

So I just started college this fall at WPI in mass. The first term I got a 3.3 gpa, but a B in my first CS class. We only have A, B ,C, NR. I got an 87 because I miserably failed the final. The class was an accelerated class that did twice they amount of coverage on topics and work than the regular freshman intro to CS class. The professor said I did very well and should be proud with the grade but it's a B. This 2nd term I ended up getting a B in Object Oriented design because the class was terribly graded. I learned nothing in the class literally nothing I had not know going into it. The class was very opinionated. Eg. using getters and setters instead of a comparator method would make you lose points.. So I sadly got a B in the glass to.. Which brings me to a shitty 3.12 gpa in total for the year. It didn't help that I was rushing a fraternity 2nd term too. I know you need a good gpa to get a good internship and get into a decent grad school. But i screwed myself over with this shitty gpa. I've just bought a new java reference book, modern approach to AI, and into algo books to review on my free time. But I don't think it's going to be enough. I even talk to my professors alot and they knew me on a first name basis. But with all respect, If i can't get a good internship or a respectable job or get into a good grad school whats the point? All those things are important for a Computer Scientist become they set one self into a position where they can maximize their potential and ability.. What do I do now? "

I am really ashamed of myself for being in my situation. I am going to University for seven years pursuing mathematics degree. I have very low gpa, which is lower than 2.5. I haven't done any internship because I was so ashamed of myself for having such low gpa. And I couldn't ask for help from others because I was always afraid of getting rejected and being judged by people. I always had extreme social anxiety for my entire life, and this made me not possible to hang out with people and make new friends. Currently, I have no friends and only person I talk to and text with is my mom. 

I lived in United States for thirteen years but I still can't speak English comfortably. I still have hard time expressing my thoughts and this is so detrimental to my social life. I really want to be able to speak English fluently and make white friends, but it is just so intimidating and seems impossible. I wonder if anyone would want to be friend with me and I always convince myself that it's not even worth it to try to approach people because I am going to get rejected anyway. 

I'm so ashamed of myself to meet new people because of fear that people will think of me as immature and screw-up who can't take care of his life. I really don't know what to do with my life and feel suicidal. Only reason I don't commit suicide is because I'm scared. 

My plan is to move out to some place new as soon as I graduate. I don't know if I can handle it but I feel like I have to forcefully put myself in a new environment so it's inevitable to become different person. 

I'm so sorry for bad English but I hope it was not too difficult to follow. I just wanted to vent out and wanted some emotional supports and advices. Thank you for taking time to read.  

EDIT: I also have 40k debt I have to pay for loaning tuition. I'm the most irresponsible person living on earth."

I just recently came to terms with the fact that my mom does have narcissistic traits, although she is not formally diagnosed with NPD.  I have a couple of questions for you all, but first a story to help you understand where they come from.


For some background, I'm in the process of finishing my bachelors degree, the final component of which is a 6-month internship which I'm 5 months into right now.  I started this internship last January, but had to return home after the first 2 months due to a severe episode of depression and dynamics with my coworkers/supervisors playing out my childhood for a second time.  When I left internship I was not doing well at all, my anxiety was so severe that I was unable to perform my duties without second/third/fourth guessing every move I made.  I spent most of the spring and summer in therapy learning how to deal with everything, then I went back to my internship, and have been doing extremely well and am honestly very proud of my progress, and I feel strongly that I will do well in my chosen field.  


Being back home for Christmas is the first time I've been home since September, and even though I've only been here since Christmas Eve, I feel much more depressed than I've felt over the past 4 months, just since being here.  I can't be with my family for even 30 minutes without something being said or done that causes either my nMom or my nSis to go off.  


For example, earlier today, I come home and I'm looking for a skillet that I usually use to cook with, so I ask nMom and nSis who are sitting in the kitchen, ""Where did the skillet that I go like?""  I mixed up the words go and like.  Haha.  So funny.  nMom and nSis continue to make fun of me for this for the next 20 minutes.  I let it go even though each comment after the first 5 feels like a micro aggression, because at least it's pleasant and they're not being outright awful.  Then, nSis takes a drink of water but the way she does it looks so ridiculous that I make a face, and she says ""What's that face for?"" and I demonstrate what she did to the best of my ability, as a joke, and she immediately starts in on a high class meltdown, saying all I ever think about is making her feel like crap and can't she just drink water without being made fun of for it and I'm a terrible person and going to be a terrible therapist.  She ends this rant by saying ""I'm a good person.  At least I work.""  A comment which I found hilarious in general, because I've been frustrated by the fact that since she graduated last year with her bachelor's degree, she has not even looked for work.  She sits on nMom's couch all day ""writing a book""...however when I walk past she's always playing online poker...hmmmm.  While I am all for writing as an eventual career path, it makes no sense as an initial job choice, because life isn't free as I'm reminded at every turn by my parents.  I've had jobs steadily since I was 16, due to nMom's desire to never have to pay for a thing of mine, with the time period I've been at internship being the only exception because my hours there are unpredictable and often reach 55-60 hours/wk.  nSis has never had a job.  So I ask her, ""You work?"" and she clarifies that she contributes to the household on a regular basis by doing her dishes and cleaning up after herself.  She sounds like a child.  So I say, ""Show me the pay stubs and then we'll talk.""  At which point nMom begins to defend her precious GC baby, saying ""Oh are you working at internship?  You getting paid?""  Which is just a ridiculous argument.  The whole thing was ridiculous.  My family of origin is one who will get in arguments over stupid little things like this.  I can't stand it.  nMom also agreed with nSis at one point during this argument that to be a therapist you should be a good person, and I am not a good person.  According to nMom and nSis, that is.  My family, ladies and gentlemen.


This is such a big frustration for me right now because this in general is how they respond to me as a person.  After doing so much hard work in the earlier part of this year in therapy to put myself back together and really make something of myself, and coming out on the other side so much more vibrant and amazing at what I do (according to not only supervisors evaluations, but patient's statements), to come home to this?  Not ok.  Super invalidating.  It feels like the twilight zone, because who I am and who they're making me out to be just are not congruent.  At all.  


I was reading something online the other day where the author was talking about their life using the metaphor of having built a house.  Basically, they were saying, I've spent my whole life building this house, and now it's finally done and I'm sitting in my big arm chair in front of my fireplace and I'm drinking a hot cocoa and all I want is for someone to walk in the door.  But they won't.  They won't even acknowledge the house.  That resonated with me so much.  I wish I could remember where I read it, because I would link it, but I don't.  But that is totally how I feel right now.  Having come home from this extremely fascinating clinical internship, I have tons of stories that I'd love to share with whoever asked, but what I come home to is not a family who is curious about my life.  I've felt invalidated many times before in my life, but for some reason, this one just takes the cake.

And it started me thinking, all these times they've refused to acknowledge my ""house""...truly makes it harder for me to believe that anyone else will ever want to either.  In a typical romantic relationship sense.  I've started to realize that I just feel like I'm completely incapable of having a healthy one of those.  Ever.  I feel like my family history damages me too much.  Why would anyone want to deal with not only my emotional baggage/issues but also my completely screwed up family?  Not only that, but would I ever trust that anyone actually wanted me including all of that?


It's been a terrible week of terrible thoughts and loneliness and invalidation just like I'm sure it was for most of you.  My questions are basically:


1: How do you deal with explosions like my sister's coming from the N in your life?  These happen all too often and I need to learn how to better deal with them.
2: Have any of you ever had feelings similar to mine about relationships?  Am I alone?  If you're in a successful relationship, how did you overcome these things?  Were they even that big a deal at all?


Any advice or support you could give would be great.  I'm feeling pretty down on myself/this whole situation right now."
3yroki,18,2015-12-30,"My hopeful, positive post-Christianity sex story",laurambp,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/3yroki/my_hopeful_positive_postchristianity_sex_story/,"I wanted to take a moment to share my sex story because I know a lot of us grew up in the ""true love waits"" movement, which has affected our sex lives even after marriage and definitely affects a lot of us as we deconvert. 

I've been making a lot of progress in mine over the past 13 months, and wanted to share in case some of the things that have been helping me can help you. Warning, it's a bit long - there's a TL;DR summary at the bottom. 

Background: grew up Catholic, became evangelical at age 15 in 2002. Was first exposed to ""true love waits"" within the next year. Never officially made the pledge in church because I had to work that day, but made it in my heart. 

Went away to college and stayed pure until after my on-again, off-again boyfriend of 2 years died  from epilepsy at age 20 (we were both going on 21 - it happened in 2008). Was emotional wreck; had lots of sex with multiple partners over the next 1.5-2 years. It was a terrible cycle of desiring sex to feel less lonely on Saturday night, then going to church on Sunday morning with guilt that I enjoyed it and praying for forgiveness. Graduated at 21 (going on 22 in 2009), moved home, and spiritually became a ""born again virgin"" for the next four years at the end of 2009. 

Waited until after marriage at age 26 to have any kind of sex beyond second base. The honeymoon week was awful - sex was incredibly painful and I didn't know why, because it was never painful before. Also, I felt guilty the whole time, because I lived and breathed sexual purity for almost four years (3.5 of those with my now husband) and I felt like I couldn't flip the switch to be a sexual vixen. 

Went to my gynecologist that fall, who told me that I had vaginismus and told me to order dilators to solve the problem and gave me no further advice other than ""this is not uncommon"" and ""it takes time"". Out of the set of 5 dilators, I could only get up to the third one and not go further. It was heartbreaking. I now understood why sex was painful - my vagina wouldn't stretch to fit him comfortably, no matter how turned on I was. 

My husband and I got married in August 2013; stopped attempting intercourse by October 2013. In the meantime, we still engaged in a lot of play, which was critical for intimacy, but I struggled with the idea that I was ""broken"" and assumed it  was punishment for the wild premarital sex I had between ages 20-22. Fortunately, my husband was really supportive and said he didn't marry me for my vagina, and that one day this would resolve somehow. 

I began deconverting in November 2014 and was open to reading a lot of progressive Christian material. At the beginning of February 2015, I started reading a book called ""Damaged Goods"" by Dianne E. Anderson. I found out about it from Rachel Held Evans's blog. It's written from a progressive Christian view and it radically changed my view on sex. She goes into detail about how harmful purity movement is, and goes into a solution for how to change the harmful mindset. She advocates for full comprehensive sex Ed and emphasizes sexual ethics built around respect and consent. If teens are empowered to do what's right for them, which can include abstinence, then we equip them to make the choice to have sex when it makes sense for them and not feel guilty. She also addresses LGBTQ sex and how a pledge at 15 might make sense at that point in life, but with people staying single longer and marrying later, sexual ethics can different for single 30 year olds. This book changed my life. Once I finished it, I felt hope that I wasn't trapped in guilt forever. We attempted intercourse for the first time since October 2013 after I finished the book on Feb 11, 2015. It didn't work, but I felt empowered to make the steps to make it work. 

All of the advice I had gotten previously when I confided in people about my issue was worthless - drink some wine, relax, subscribe to Cosmo for sex tips (thanks, pastor). Even my psychologist thought I was just trying too hard because of my perfectionism OCD. I knew there had to be another answer - so I researched on my own. I discovered through the r/vaginismus subreddit (as well as other online forums) that such a thing called pelvic floor physical therapy existed. I decided I would try it out after I finished the spring semester of school. 

On June 29, the day before my 28th birthday, I went to my first appointment. The physical therapist did an exam and as she expected, my muscles down there were tender and tight. She reassured me that with massage, biofeedback, external stimulation, and gym exercises in the office, with daily dilation at home with the set I already had, with my case I could likely have intercourse in 6-8 weeks. I sobbed in her office I was so happy. This was such a wonderful birthday gift, and the idea that we could have sex around our 2nd wedding anniversary brought me so much joy and hope. 

So it turns out that I somehow subconsciously trained my vagina to clinch down there, and if I broke the habit, that would be half the battle. Also, it's possible that when I fell and sprained my knee in 2010 (during my ""born again virgin"" phase) that I bruised my pelvic muscles in the process and started clinching to relieve the pain and never stopped. It was amazing to me that the problem wasn't ""all in my head"" or a ""punishment from God"" - it was a true physiological problem that I just happened to develop. Funny how if I needed physical therapy in the muscles in my wrist I would have never related it to anything spiritual, but because it was in my vagina I demonized it. This revelation furthered my deconversion. 

I was able to have mostly pain free intercourse with my husband for the first time on our second anniversary, 6 weeks after the beginning of treatment. I was stumped that it was fine on the inside but hurt really bad at the opening, particularly in two muscles there. Nonetheless, this was incredible progress, even if the intercourse wasn't particularly enjoyable for me. 

The physical therapist kept working with those two muscles, but unfortunately, they were not getting better. Conveniently, she had recently purchased a cold laser, and using that helped, but they weren't getting much better. So she referred me to a gynecologist that specializes in pelvic floor issues. I first had the chance to see her in October. She diagnosed me with vulvodynia. At first, we tried non invasive numbing creams, then the removal of skin tags, and now I am getting steroid injections into those two muscles. The progress is slow but steadily working - I've had two injections so far and it's making a difference down there by helping the muscles relax. unfortunately the stress of full time grad school as a second year student while working a part time internship caused me to relapse a bit - we went without intercourse (and I went without dilation) for a month and now I am slightly too small to fit him, but hope to be able to remedy that over the next couple of weeks. 

I have been incredibly open about my journey to family and friends in real life because there's a lot of shame in sexual dysfunction as well as false information floating around. (Heck, even my normal gynecologist admitted at my annual exam in late July 2015 that she didn't know as much as she should about it and was glad I found physical therapy helpful! I hope she takes my advice to push for physical therapy in tandem with dilating for other patients with vaginismus.) My problem turned out to be both mental and most importantly physiological. I know a lot of us struggle with relationships and sex post conversion, so I hope my story at the very least provides comfort that this can and will get better. 

TL;DR: bought into ""true love waits"" as a teen, had sex in my early 20s, became a ""born again virgin"" for 4 years, was unable to have sex after marriage due to being unable to flip the mental switch as well as my husband's penis not fitting in my vagina. Turns out that reading ""Damaged Goods"" by Dianne E. Anderson (a progressive Christian) helped my mental mindset, and getting pelvic floor physical therapy and specialized gynecological care has helped my vaginismus and vulvodynia. "
3yrps7,5,2015-12-30,Getting an internship / entry level engineering job post graduation?,Blazikant,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3yrps7/getting_an_internship_entry_level_engineering_job/,"Hey,

I'd like to know what it takes to get an internship or an entry level engineering job. I've seen a couple other threads on the subject and I was what things I'd have to adjust differently than from being a student. Some things:

I graduated in 2012 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering (3.40 GPA).  I never found an internship or an entry level engineering job during the time or since.  During college, I was part of a couple engineering clubs (design build fly, a 3D printing club where we had to design a printer / boat for a race, etc.) and did research senior year.  I volunteered during my Fr. year Summer mentoring high school students on an aerospace project at a museum, and Jr. year took a Summer course on LabVIEW.  Basically, I wasn't just attending class and doing nothing and tried to be actively involved when I could.  

Post graduation, I spent about 2 years unemployed, but spent that time on projects and skill development including:

- taking CFD classes through the AIAA (and made a sub-sonic wind tunnel sim. as a post-project)
- made a complex assembly (Metal Gear RAY) in Solidworks.  Earlier in the year I helped my cousin who is creating a space startup CAD with Autodesk Inventor the product he's trying to make.  
- taught myself some Java, Android development (through TheNewBoston), and made a complimentary color app
- designed a 2 directional optimized solar panel rotator controller 
- made a couple programming toys (simple blackjack program, a Pokemon damage calculator, a 2 player puzzle game based on the trick in the ""COMPLETED"" puzzle in Virtue's Last Reward)

I eventually got a job a coating company disposing hazardous waste in May 2014.  My achievements were designing a can crusher with a mechanic using a modified wood splitter with parts onsite that has worked for over a year and coming up with techniques for simplifying how waste is disposed including creating metal stash points so the painters can dispose of metal separate from the garbage and coming up with a plan with safety lead to dispose of wheel dust during non-weekend times.

The point above is that I'm not just sitting around waiting.  I'm actively trying to keep learning and making new things and show my passion for engineering.  

Job-hunting-wise, I've tried revamping my resume multiple times and have visited my college career center, local unemployment office, and have spoken with recruiters, engineers, former classmates, and HR to get my materials checked and any advice on how to go forward.  I check r/jobs regularly and have been on sites like Ask A Manger reading many of the blog posts and comments on resumes and networking.

Networking.  I actually have a good time with people (LinkedIn, neighbors, career fairs, classmates, etc.), but the biggest roadblock I've run into is that my lack of experience hurts me when I'm suggested jobs.  Example: my former high school principal helped me look at his brother's company, but his company wanted people with a lot of experience.  At a conference the other day, I met a guy who offered to show my materials to a client he knew was hiring for positions that fit my skill set, but they wanted people with at least 2 years engineering experience.  It's been a problem and I don't really know how to get around it.

Grad School:  I'm going to try apply this year.  I haven't in the past for various reasons (tl;dr I really didn't like the ""grade competitiveness"" in college that seemed to overtake the environment).  And I'll take the EIT as well.  

This is a long story.  If this comes off as ""bragging,"" I apologize in advance.  About a year ago, I asked for help on a different subreddit, and some comments were about how ""I came off as bragging,"" which I'm fine knowing as constructive criticism.  But... some comments were, hurtfully, how ""my story couldn't be real""or how I was ""clearly lying.""  ...I was depressed for awhile after that...  I just want to enforce that I'm going to continue to as I have more ideas I'd like to see realized this next year.  

If anyone has any ideas on what steps I need to take to get an internship or an entry level engineering job, I'm all ears.  

Thank you in advance.

3yrqr1,5,2015-12-30,I got my revenge on the girl that crushed my idea of love,starts_arguements,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3yrqr1/i_got_my_revenge_on_the_girl_that_crushed_my_idea/,"The story of how I got my revenge on a girl I thought I loved is a long and emotionally exhausting tale. 


I was raised in a conservative household and therefore had unrealistic and fantastical ideals of love and relationships. I genuinely wanted my life to play out like a disney fantasy. 


She was raised in a broken home, shafted from home to home and grew up with deep daddy and mommy emotional issues. I obviously only found this out too late - only after her issues had sucked me in and destroyed me along with her. 


Growing up I idolised her - our interests were similar and the fact I would only see her once or a twice a month depending on which relative she was staying with - made her even more alluring to my young heart. While I was being raised up in a loving home, getting good results, graduating from high school to entering law school - she dropped out of high school and demonstrated typical behaviours of a damaged girl - sleeping around, dating much older men, no career ambitions, financial difficulties etc. 


Obviously, I know all of this now - at the time though, I thought she was just this sweet girl who was dealt an unfortunate hand - I told myself I didn't need to know the details - I would still 'save' her. 


By the age of 22 everything was going great in my life - I was on a good future path. However, one piece was missing. Her. 

I pursued her and eventually ended up in the back seat of a car having our first kiss together. While that was all great, my unrealistic idea of love implored me to seek a sign that she was in fact the 'one', that she was special. Believe it or not, the very next day I am in the city and I walk past her having a coffee with a friend. She sees me and calls me over and all three of us have a great time together. For me, this chance coincidence fucked up my life. I was now convinced she was the girl for me. I had to have her. 

You can imagine the shock and despair that I felt then, when only a week later while on a late night phone call with her - she tells me she doesn't picture herself with me and that she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with me. From my point of view, I was perfect. What was wrong with me for her to reject me! What had I done wrong! What was missing from me as a person! Did I not deserve her love! What about this sign from above! 

To my sheltered and naive existence, this rejection destroyed me to my core. I had never been rejected before, I was always happy and never suffered from depression or anxiety. This rejection changed it all. I suffered a breakdown. I cried for nights on end picturing our lives together and how it could never be. I analysed everything about myself and critiqued every flaw searching for an answer as to why - when I was so sure this was right - this relationship failed. 


Thankfully, I reached out to the right resources and followed the rules. I cut all contact with her. While this saved face with her, I was still hurting inside, privately. I told no one about this experience. I was extremely bitter and angry, not just at her anymore, but at life and love. I started to resent women and without realising it started to passively aggressively react to them negatively. 

It just so happens that about 3 months after cutting contact, I had a planned internship overseas. It was organised through my University and I would be staying at a local families house. This was a fantastic situation to take my mind off of everything that happened and move on. It was to my unbelief (and now, looking back, unfortunate timing) that the family I was staying with had the most beautiful daughter I had ever seen in my life. One look at this woman made me forget about everything else wrong in my life. During my stay we got closer and closer and I learned that she had all the characteristics that I wanted in a partner. She was everything the other girl was not. Unfortunately, my bitterness and suspiciousness of women because of this past experience took a hold of me and I did something to this girl that destroyed any potential relationship I could hope for. 

I blamed the original girl for this failed relationship. If I wasn't so emotionally damaged and crippled by my experience with her, I would have treated the overseas girl differently and maybe developed something - but no - even thousands of miles away - this girl was still ruining my life. It was now time to get my revenge. 
 

Another year past with no contact - when through our social circle we finally met each other on a night out. By this time, I had improved myself considerably. I had addressed what I thought were my flaws to ensure she could never reject me again. That night we kissed again. She seemed so impressed with me now. 

We slowly reconnected and started hanging out more. All the while, I was subtly getting her to fall in love with me. During the years of no contact, I had been in other short term relationships, I had slept with women and started to understand how to get them to click. It was exactly the opposite of what I was taught growing up. Respecting women, appreciating them, giving compliments - none of that worked. You had to be a man. You had to give off the impression that you were with three or four women on the side for them to respect you. I hated everything about this - but it worked. 

I eventually managed to get so close with this girl that she finally let me sleep with her. Immediately after she told me that no other man had ever made her cum that fast. This is the beginning of getting her attached to me emotionally and physically. She opened up to me and started to pour out her past. This is where I began to learn about her troubled past - it shocked me how little I knew of this girl. I had fallen in love with an idea of her - she was nothing like what I had pictured originally. 

The more I learned about her, the more I despised her past. The more I despised her as a worthless person. I felt ashamed I had let someone so weak affect me like she had. She was now in my hands to do with her as I will - and I wanted to make her feel the pain she had made me feel all those years ago. 

As months past, our relationship grew stronger and stronger. I got her to open up to me sexually, making her do things she had refused to do with previous partners. She was now wanting to please me. She was now seeing everything she had missed all those years ago. She was proud of me. 

This all culminated in a conversation where she wanted us to take the next step. During all of this - knowing I had no intention of having a real relationship with her, I had not told any of our friends or family about our relationship. She was now putting pressure on me - wanting to make it official to the world - wanting to tell her parents that we were now serious. Wanting to flaunt me to all her friends. Isn't it funny how things change.  

It was during this conversation that I told her I wanted nothing to do with her. I told her she shouldn't tell anybody about us because there wasn't an 'us'. I left her crying and cut all contact with her. That was over 9 months ago. We have not spoken a word or even seen each other in 9 months now. 

I only bring this story up because we have a mutual friends wedding coming up in the next week, and I am sure we will run into each other. I don't know how either of us will react or what will happen. 

All I know is that I wish I never kissed her in the back of that car.

3yrygg,2,2015-12-30,Semi-target school graduate. What now?,Financejobs101,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3yrygg/semitarget_school_graduate_what_now/,"So, a little about me. I've just graduated from a semi-target school. A 3.65 GPA cumulative with a degree in finance. Im now applying for entry-level positions and i am having trouble finding any that don't require work experience (something i knew, dont bash me). I wasn't able to secure a paying internship during my school years, sadly, which was my only option because of financial difficulties and having to come up with the funds to pay for the cost of college. Therefore, as of right now i have no direct financial industry experience at all. I do although have no gaps in my resume and have at one time worked 2 jobs at once. I did my best to try and show the relevance of my skills from my current job as best as i could.

My question basically is: what now? Do i continue to apply for entry level positions and hope i get accepted to one of them? Are BB's out of the question even though i did make some BB superday final day interviews for a couple of internships (which i ended up not getting). I feel as if i am an attractive candidate based on my work ethic displayed on my resume but the lack of financial experience i feel will ultimately deter someone away.

Any advice?"

For some reason getting the student software from their website hasn't worked for me, perhaps cause I'm not in the states but do have access to other software cad software (autocad rino and a few others I think) through college or from their student versions, so if anyone knows what's most similar that would be a great help.

3ysnio,11,2015-12-30,"Here's my six month story, I'm posting it maybe to help others.",dylang92,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/3ysnio/heres_my_six_month_story_im_posting_it_maybe_to/,"Alright, here we go. Six months ago the girl of my dreams and I broke up. She was going away to a different country indefinitely, and there'd be no way to determine if we'd talk or when we'd see each other. A couple of weeks of arguing we realized we'd break up separated by countries anyway and it'd hurt us both. So we ended it, and wanted to remain friends because we were kind of each other's best friends. Of course next day I decided to say that we could try long distance and she wasn't having it. She was afraid that she couldn't ""immerse"" herself there and would just want to come back as fast as she could. Somehow I understood this, and while I was angry and hurt, I left. I never wanted to do the friends thing with my ex, mostly because I had a feeling it would end bad for me. But something about this seemed different. ""It was mutual, it's not like we broke up because she was done with me."" After about a week I opened the contact again and we were friends. My biggest mistake ever, but I'll get into that. 

For 4 months it was nice to talk to her. I had my friend and could still laugh at the inside jokes. In fact it felt like business as usual, nothing changed. Well except she wasn't my girlfriend, but overall it didn't bother me all that much. But I noticed I wasn't moving on. I wasn't finding interest in other girls, but I couldn't figure it out. Anyway a couple of weeks later i decided to boot up my Tumblr, because ya know for the lels, I was still following her because it had been a long time since I used it. And there it was. Her posts were popping up and all about someone else. Then it all came to me, I was still quite in love with her and her moving on was like a stab to the heart. It really freaking hurt and she didn't have the audacity to even tell me. So here I was, drunk at a basement show and depressed because the love of my life had moved on. The only reason I was friends was to hope that we'd get back together. 

The next day I messaged her. I told her that I no longer wanted to be friends. I said  that I missed her and us and I was still in love with her. I told her I couldn't truly be her friend and I wasn't happy and I wasn't moving on. I didn't blame her for this fact because it wasn't her fault, it was mine. She was pissed at me because it was while she was there and was happy and that I surprised her. Either way she hurried the convo and that was it. I erased all the photos I had. Deleted the messaging app, my tumblr, my Instagram app and blocked her on Facebook. I still looked at her tumblr page a lot because I love being hurt I guess. 

For a couple weeks I was severely depressed. More depressed and self destructive than I had been in the 4 and a half months prior. I was drunk and/or high on something for that time. It finally all built up to being drunk at my friend's house the night before thanksgiving and screaming on the ground about how much I hated her and was hurt. My friend stayed outside with me while I screamed and cried and I got up. I drunkingly messaged her, she read it, didn't respond, and that was it. Probably showed it to people, and laughed. Whatever. 

I still had gifts of hers that she made me in my house. I gave them to my friend to do ""something"" with. No idea what he did with him, we don't talk about it. I had my friends password block all of her pages on my phone. I had a really good web page blocker on chrome and used that for my laptop. No more looking at her social media. 

Anyway another month went by and slowly but surely things were getting better. I started working out again, I started writing again, I started being less of a nuisance again to people. 6 months to the day I found a picture of her in my wallet, I completely missed it. I looked at it, I remembered the fond times and when the picture was taken. I actually smiled when I thought about us, something I hadn't done in months. I decided to do something I guess was a bit crazy, but whatever I didn't have anything to prove anymore. I used to go to her house a lot, no i didn't go to her house. There was a bar in her town that we'd go to a lot. I sat in the same spot I used to with her, but without her, and I had a drink. Then I left and there was trash can, I took the picture I had, the last real tangible piece of our relationship, and I threw it in the garbage. 

Today I feel decently good. Life's looking up and I have some awesome internship interviews coming up. I have my friends still, I have my ever supportive family and of course I have my health. I work out more and sing and do what makes me happy. Perhaps I shouldn't've kept in contact with her because it's obvious it was just a bandaid. I knew that but I did it anyway, we all make mistakes and this was a result of it. I have no idea what the future holds, but if I know one thing is that the last six months have been basically a long list of self destruction and pain. I hope the best for her, I do. But I think I can say that I'm moving on.

What I want you guys and gals to know is that whenever it seems hopeless and sad and that you'll always be sucked into this person. Know this, it's not forever. I thought it was, but things are improving. If you ever have a situation with an ex, whether it be friends or whatever, and you know you don't want to do it, **DON'T**. You'll be much better off and remember that at the end of the day you need to make yourself happy. Find your hobbies, find your happiness and it will be okay for you. And who knows? There's someone better out there and you may meet them some day soon, make sure you're emotionally ready for it, but take your time. It's not a race to find them, just a crazy journey. "

Since I've been in an accelerated program, I was not prepared at all for an internship last summer.  While I'm graduating this spring, I'm ready for an internship, but not a junior position.

That said, many companies seem to disqualify applicants that have graduated from their internships.  However, given my situation, it seems that an internship is the most viable path, and not an immediate full-time job.  Considering that, I still want to apply for internships.

Anyhow, here's the resume - http://i.imgur.com/qzFFMJT.png

Next semester, I'll be working on a group project; certainly something of more sophistication than I've written thus far.  Consequently, I should have a better project to add to my resume during (or after) this final semester.

As for my GPA, since I'm going for a second bachelors, I only need to take in-major courses.  I have a 4.0 in computer science classes, but about a B average in the math classes required for the major, which makes the cumulative about 3.6.  I would rather list the 4.0, simply because it's a 4.0, and I don't believe it's deceptive since it's explicitly labeled as ""computer science"".  By contrast, were it listed as ""Major GPA"", I think it would be deceptive.

As for the work experience, it's certainly unimpressive, and that's one reason I opted for CS in the first place.  However, I don't figure that I should just omit it.  At least it demonstrates some interpersonal skills.

Any thoughts/comments would be appreciated!"

3yu3j7,676,2015-12-30,A New Year's PSA: Please do not seek validation from this sub,NotARandomNumber,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3yu3j7/a_new_years_psa_please_do_not_seek_validation/,"As many of you start your last semester or seek out summer internships, I can't help but notice this sub turning in questions about the 'prestige' of certain job, whether or not they should forgo any social/fun aspects of college to focus on studies/side projects, or other questions that mostly involve how they will somehow gain the validation and admiration of their peers.

 All these questions, as well as answers coming from the undergrads who have yet to venture out into the real world, are honestly disappointing. The prevalent attitude on this sub is becoming more and more treating this profession as a means to end to be prestigious or gain some lofty standing in some City Upon a Hill (Working at a 'Big 4' company in SF). The future is becoming binary in that you're either living that dream or you're a failure in life. Why? Quit looking to this sub with the question that boils down to 'Should I be happy in this situation?' The only person who can tell you that is you. 

One of the easiest examples is the multitude of 'Which internship would look better if I want to apply to XYZ later'. Suppose some anonymous person on the internet tells you 'Oh, definitely take Option A because I heard Company XYZ likes that better', are you really going to base a few months/a year of your life on the possibility that this person is right and you MIGHT increase your chance?  Any experience is good experience, as long as you can talk enthusiastically about your internship/projects, an interviewer is going to be impressed. 

The further extreme is obviously 'Would taking an internship at A hurt me later on' when the post clearly doesn't have any other options. Please, for the love of god, lets not have any of this in 2016. Stop putting the cart before the horse and enjoy yourself.  As I, along with any other poster who has graduated, has said, any experience is truly good experience. You can spin anything into being a positive work experience. Working at any internship will only help you in the end. 

The same advice goes to full time jobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to work at any of the buzzword companies that are discussed on this sub. They are great companies with some truly great engineers working there. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the companies not frequently or never mentioned on this sub. If you can meet all your bills and live a lifestyle that makes you happy, what else is there? It doesn't matter if it's working at a small dev shop in a non-tech hub city or working in downtown of a major city for a top 10 company. Do what makes you happy, the validation of the people on this sub shouldn't matter. 

There is also nothing wrong with working at a company that might not be your dream job. Treat it as though it was though, gain as much experience as you can and at least open up to the possibility that you might be happy there. You can always apply to other companies later on and who knows what the future might hold, but do not treat it as a dead end or a road block to your future life, treat it as an opportunity and take full advantage of it. 

**tl;dr** The only person you need to be concerned about is you. If you're happy, who cares what anyone else thinks?"

Does this seem like a workload that could be completed aptly in two or three terms? I'm planning on studying 20+ hours a week with a possible job or internship on the side. If I do decide to commit solely to studying, I'm looking at 40+ hours. It goes without saying that I won't be too familiar with a lot of the material in some of the courses and that's what is leaving me hesitant in applying for a job or internship right now; I don't want to bite off more than I can handle.

Any input is appreciated."
3yuumk,9,2015-12-30,Please help me figure out where I would be happy living?,Dukedomb,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3yuumk/please_help_me_figure_out_where_i_would_be_happy/,"I'm 26 and I've lived in the same San Francisco East Bay Area suburban house since 1995. Before that, my family lived literally ten minutes down the road in another suburban house. Never moved out, even for university, which I attended as a commuter student. There's no question that this immediate area feels like home, and I know it very well, but I know I can't spend the rest of my life here. I just can't. Maybe in a different suburb of the Bay Area, but so many problems would seem to remain. Can you guys help me work through my numerous (and almost surely conflicting) preferences and hangups and find a new place I might like to live?

This whole situation is clouded by the fact that I'm way behind life's natural rhythm of moving out and discovering what I like and want to do for work and fun, who I want to be around, etc.

Please don't down-vote me because you don't like me or my hang-ups. I know I'm probably too closed-minded, but I'm just really unhappy, having a hard time with change and I beseech my fellow Redditors for help changing my situation and by extension myself. A big part of this is I don't know where the hell I want to live. What situation will be ""good enough?"" Where's my tribe? Where do I fit in? I'm very lonely and isolated and don't feel much common ground with the Bay Area and California.

About me:
I'm 26, male, currently unemployed. I guess I'm in a long-distance relationship now?? (my gf just moved back to belgium after her internship lapsed, and I'm dubious it will last long term but I don't want to give her up and break up, at least not before visiting Belgium on my brand new passport) Got fed up after working four years as a bottom-of-the-totem-pole mechanical engineer at a local small aerospace company and quit with no replacement job. I figure I probably want to continue my engineering career, but I don't even know if I can be happy or not as an engineer. I don't believe I want to work in aerospace anymore, it feels too niche.

**What do I like/want?**
* I regularly go to the gym  
* I want an interesting job, whatever the hell that is.  
* I like shooting sports  
* I love my pickup truck and my muscle car  
* I want to find a happy lifelong relationship that will give me kids before too long, don't want casual hookups in nightclubs, don't want to delay kids until biological clocks are screaming.  
*I've never really had many friends, and I want to branch out and have a life for once. I fear that this means living in a city center, where young people tend to gravitate. I've never lived in one, so I can't say for certain, but the crush of people/noise/no yards/apartment living/bums in the doorstep seems like a real turn-off.  
*I like my parent's suburban house because its easy to park my cars in front of the house. Plenty of street parking. If I lived in an apartment, what would I do with my two cars and my motorcycle?  
*If I had my own house, I'd really want to clean it up and remodel to make it look nice, but I don't want to spend my entire life doing that. It's just important to me to someday have a single-family home I can remodel with good size front and back yards I can do beautiful landscaping projects in and someday have children play in. I'd also have lots of room for woodworking and tools and stuff. But all of that is probably off in the distant future anyway.  

**What do I like about my area?**
*Even if I'm not really utilizing any of it, it seems like there's lots of stuff in the broader metro area.  Entertainment, businesses, services, schools, religion, nature areas, city centers, suburbs, (some) mass transit, general things to do.  
*There's water, flat land, hills, trees, interesting terrain.  
*It never snows, seldom breaks triple digit heat, and isn't humid as fuck.  
*No huge scorpions, killer bees, mammoth spiders  
*I'll take earthquakes over hurricanes and tornadoes any day, thank you.  
*Plenty of restaurants, even though I'm not frequently eating out.  
*It's not isolated as fuck, agricultural, or ""redneck."" (sorry rednecks, you guys are cool but I'm just not one of you, even though I'm white, shoot shotguns, and burn lots of gasoline.)  

**Things I hate about the area:**
*People can be very rude and hostile.  
*Traffic is an absolute nightmare, especially if a bridge crossing is involved.  
*Decent schools are either costly and private or located where the phenomenally wealthy live  
*Housing prices are intolerable  
*State firearms laws are restrictive  
*I know it's not just my area but I don't enjoy tattoos at all.  
*Cant install many performance parts on my cars  
*Drought  
*I'm attracted to Caucasian girls and there just aren't that many around here. I've dated outside my race, dated a European, darn near married a multi-racial girl, but white bread is my thing. Pretty open and shut case there.  
*Complete political hegemony. No one here thinks like I do and it really wreaks havoc on finding compatible dating partners. Is a nice balance in either direction too much to ask for?  
*Where are all the ""normal"" people? Everyone's a tech startup millionaire, a financial district snob, gentrification-causing loft-dwelling artist hipster, unstable white trash, ethnic gang member, or yoga-posing, gender-fluid, militaristically pro-marijuana pronoun Nazi who's going to key my car because it's not a Nissan Leaf. Not that these people are inherently bad or anything, but God, how I long to just find some people who are like me somehow. My tribe, whatever the fuck it is, it sure isn't any of that.  

I HATE LA and have absolutely no interest in New York. Countries other than the USA are probably going to prohibit the guns I want to have, and I'm having a really hard time learning Dutch or Italian, so I need my English and my guns.

I've briefly visited Boise and liked the downtown vibe on a summer evening. Briefly visited Albuquerque and it was too dry and grungy. Briefly visited Flagstaff, which was just confusing. I didn't see much of Denver besides the airport area, though the summer lightning and rain was cool. Nevada is too hot and empty, and fuck Las Vegas and its gambling and artificial bullshit anyway. I loved how friendly Missouri was, for a three day business trip I've never seen so many courteous people in my life. Salt Lake had the most annoying street naming convention ever but at least they had good Indian food. Wyoming was deserted. That's about the extent of my travel experience.

Finally... If I leave CA, and I want to return, am I fucked?"

3yva80,0,2015-12-30,Reason why I have Opie and Anthony's back,InputAboutEverything,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3yva80/reason_why_i_have_opie_and_anthonys_back/,"I will always defend Opie and Anthony. They are great people who get a bad rap and who are not really understood(even by the most hardcore fans it seems).

So I grew up in Philadelphia, and grew up very poor. The reason why I mention where I am from is because when I visited the studios in 2007, I was looking to attend college in a few months but I had trouble getting college aid. While telling my story to Sam and some interns, it was sort of a joke around the studio how I wasn't going to be able to attend a college -- at least not a respectable one.

Opie and Ant somewhat knew the running joke, and I guess asked questions about me and found out my story. Opie then knew I was from Philly, and I guess took a liking to me because by the end of the day both he and Anthony had set up some payment plan for me to attend college that THEY were paying for.

Growing up I didn't ask for much, or expect much, so I am not afraid to say I started crying right then and there. Opie and Anthony were walking through the halls and saw me crying and told me to fellow them into a room that looked like a closet. Once we got in there, they both were like...cum hair you big fukin babey and suk on our peckas.you thught uz waz gunna go to collage for fre? get sukin poor boi. I must say Anthony was well hung. So this is why I will always stick up for them as they were great people.

I hope I changed at least some minds today, and if not oh well. I know what great guys they are."

We are both in college, He is involved in a lot of clubs, and I am not. I am on a sports team, I have friends I spend time with every week, and I am happy with the amount that I am busy. He, lets call him James, has meetings almost every night and only has time to see me briefly once or twice a week. 

James and I went from seeing each other 3-4 times a week to once or twice. This has caused a lot of problems for us. He loves everything he does, and I would never ask him to quit any of his activities, but I am unhappy with the level that I see him. He is perfectly happy with seeing me less. 

He has to reschedule and cancel dates on me about twice a month. He gets angry whenever I act upset about him canceling, saying that I am not being flexible enough. I used to be okay with the occasional cancel, but not that I barely see him it hurts much more when he cancels. 

On the night of our third anniversary he went out with co-workers from his internship to drink before our big anniversary date. Yes he did have about an hour between work and having to meet me, but going out and drinking, not even changing from what he wore to work or getting ready, coming home just in time to meet me to go out, that doesn't seem cool. I was so upset because I left my internship an hour early that day so that I would have time to do my hair nice and look good for our big date. And he decided to use his time to drink at a bar.

One week my friends I was supposed to hang out with on Friday canceled, and I knew he was free because we had previously talked about hanging out that night before I made plans with friends. I had not seem him all week, so I texted him all excited that we would actually get to see each other. He then told me that he didn't want to see me even though he was free. I was very hurt and upset. We had a big argument. He told me that he doesn't feel sad when he doesn't see me for a while. He then preceded to tell me that he thought I had nothing going on in my life and that I just spend all my time waiting around for him to be free. That hurt a lot. He later apologized, but I still think about it often, and his face as he looked into my eyes and told it to me. 

Right now James and I are at our respective homes for christmas break. I am having a very tough week. We just had to put down my dog two days ago. She was my dog for 16 years, and I am very upset about it. I also am sad that I haven't been able to re-connect with any high school friends while I've been home, so I have basically been alone all break. I tried to talk to him today about how depressed I feel right now. He told me that "" I just want you to handle it yourself"" and then stopped answering my text messages. I feel so hurt because I always go to him for emotional support, and I really need it right now. I just feel like he isn't being there for me. All I asked him for was a phone call. 

We had a lot of fights since he has become so busy. And we have always talked it out and tried to work through it. He has written me two very nice and thoughtful letters about how much he loves me and how much my support means to him. But I still find myself constantly feeling unimportant and second rate in his life. He claims that things will be better next semester, but I don't see how anything will change when he has the exact same busy schedule as last semester. I just don't know what to think anymore. I know I should be flexible to his schedule and understanding that he cant spend time with me because he is busy for legitimate reasons. I also know that I can't always use him as an emotional crutch and that I should be able to handle problems without him. But I keep feeling hurt by him. Am I crazy? Should I not be so emotional about all of this? Or are my concerns legitimate?


**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is too busy for me and not emotionally supporting me. He acts like he isn't doing anything wrong. Am I being overly emotional or are my concerns are legitimate?"

I have a GPA of 3.3, with the GPA being dragged down mostly by my terrible freshman year. I've taken classes in Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Systems, Cryptography, Multi-variable Calculus, and Linear Algebra, and I've aced most of them (not that that means much anymore. I feel like these classes were heavily curved or dumbed down sometimes). I've programmed mostly in Python and Java throughout this time, but I wouldn't consider myself good at either of those languages. 


Right now I work part-time at a drug store while living with my family. I keep applying to jobs online, but I'm losing hope. I've gotten three interviews, and all of them failed. Everywhere I applied simply rejects me. I am being honest when I say I'd be happy with anything-- I just want to get my foot into the door in this industry. I am willing to work unpaid internships, or minimum wage on days where I am feeling greedy. I just want something to put on my resume that is more than ""worked at a deli for a year"", and I want to learn some practical development skills. I am very bad at teaching myself. 


I don't contribute anything to github, mainly because looking at the code of other projects simply overwhelms me. I seriously don't even know where to begin when working on such big projects. I can't network since I don't even have any real life friends, so my only option is to hand out resumes to anyone who is willing to take it. I am a terrible interviewer. I don't think I can ever hide the fact that I am shy, submissive, awkward, and not that passionate about the field, so don't give me any interview tips.


My resume...is lame, but it's probably as good as it can be. I have my name and contact info, a list of courses I've taken, and my meager work experience (working minimum wage at a deli, and working minimum wage at a drugstore).


I'd like a job in the Chicago-land area, since I don't want to move away from my family. Is that the flaw in my search?


Should I even bother searching for a CS job, or should I just resign myself to a life working in retail, to the anger of my father for wasting so much of his hard-earned money?"

I've been involved with cannabis for the last 3 years or so and it has been an invaluable relationship. It helped me in so many ways: with depression, becoming more creative and falling in love with more hobbies, getting the most out of my friendships, relaxing and rewarding myself after a rough day, etc. 

Well, I'm studying engineering in school and I'm (fingers crossed) just about to land an internship with a local natural gas company. It seems as though my love affair with the plant must come to an end eventually and not by my own choice. With the career I wish to pursue, I know that this upcoming drug test is only the beginning. 

It sucks that people are able to drink a beer or smoke a cigarette at the end of the day (which is completely unhealthy) but I can't vaporize a plant in the comfort of my own home because society has deemed it an evil deed, a dangerous drug that should be feared and that characterizes people with no goals nor ambition to succeed. 

Well fuck man I get good grades, study my ass off with a difficult major, have worked a lot in the past, and I can't even enjoy myself by relaxing a bit with cannabis. FFS my family smokes pot, my friends smoke pot, a ton of people do but just because I want to pursue a particular career path it is something I will probably never be able to do in MY *free time*. 

Drug testing for and the illegal status of marijuana is completely insane. What I want to do on my own time (as long as it doesn't interfere with my ability to do what I have to do) is my business and I should be able to do what I want, especially concerning something as harmless as a bit of weed. 

For people who are in certain careers or fields that prevent them from consuming cannabis due to pre-employment/random drug testing, how do you deal with it? If I had to choose recreational use or my career aspirations I would obviously choose the career but it seems a bit unfair that the two can't coexist.

3yvyl8,6,2015-12-31,Love is complicated. How do I [28F] re-date an old BF [27M]? I'd love some insights. [Long],mscrapants,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3yvyl8/love_is_complicated_how_do_i_28f_redate_an_old_bf/,"Tom and I dated for 2 years. It was a good relationship, and healthy and meaningful to me in a lot of ways; however, we didn't really seem to fall in love. We loved each other deeply and got along really well, but amicably broke up when he got an opportunity to go abroad. 



Tom and I are both uni students. When we first dated, we were together for about 4 months before we moved in together. We shared a room and had roommates the majority of our relationship (which I think says something for our maturity and our dynamic). We moved in together not because our relationship was going in that direction (though we were rarely apart most nights, my place or his all the time gets old) - but because we were broke students. We saved some money by moving in together, but really, it just made our lives easier. We got to share our lives together more completely and it was awesome.



Also, we are both very independent from our families, and so don't have a ""home"" outside of where-ever we live. We both wanted to do a study abroad, and so ideally one person would stay in the room while the other left, and then have a place, at the very least, to crash whenever they returned.



Thats exactly what happened, and we decided to break up when he got the call he was going to Europe. We were kind of rocky a few months before he left (even before finding out), and were pretty much FWB those last 2 months. At this point, we loved each other deeply but I could see it turning more plationic. 



I think it was a good relationship, and it didn't really even end ""badly"", but he acted like a bit of a cocky dickhead in the weeks and months before he left. He was open about his excitement to leave and meet other girls (wtf, don't say that in front of me?!), and we overall just didn't get along in little ways. Sex was a big issue for us soon after we moved in together; he was often too aggressive for me, didn't take my feedback well, and we rarely ever ""clicked"". Basically, he had such a big ego that he wasn't comfortable with me not loving everything he did. I think he blamed our sexual incompatibility on me, and I didn't want to keep fighting him. I'd voice things I did and didn't like, and he rarely took any pointers to heart. It was lousy. It's sensitive and complicated so I hope you get the gist of what i'm trying to say. It was never awful, but it just became less and less frequent - which sucked and made us both cranky, because we both seem to have high sex drives. 



So by the time he left, I was convinced we were not meant to be, and comfortably embraced staying friends and supporting each other once he was gone.



I also embraced my solitude, shook off the relationship, and moved on. I dated a bit and worked on myself, and got pumped about meeting someone better suited.



But of course, we stayed good friends. His ego did not work well for him in France, and he did not get to live out that fantasy of hooking up with hot ladies while abroad. *eyeroll* 
He ended up getting upset/frustrated/ disappointed and then sad, that he couldn't seem to connect with anyone. This lead to a lot of introspection and he grew a lot in the first few months abroad. Our sex issues/ his maturity was by far are biggest and one of the only issues we had; otherwise, he seemed pretty perfect. 



So 4 months after he leaves, I go for a visit him. I've never been abroad and he encouraged me to visit before he had left. He helped me arrange my flights, I stayed with him for the 3 weeks I was out there, and we traveled to a few countries with some other friends during the that time. 



I figured he might want to hook up, and I wasn;t sure what it was going to be like, seeing an ex under these circumstances - but it ended up being pretty amazing.



We had a ton of fun and got along like never before. It was refreshing. As soon as I got in, he took the first opportunity he got to say something really important (the morning after I arrived): he apologized, a lot, for random issues in our past. I wasn't mad and didn't hold a grudge about things, but he felt it was important to explain he realized the error of his ways. I appreciated his words, and he continued to apologize casually throughout the trip - I always said thanks and I appreciate it - but you don't have to keep apologizing. He clearly had been thinking about this a lot and apologized for many little things that I had forgotten about. He had definitely been a jackass at times. :P 
... He was trying to hint towards something more, but I didn't realize at the time. 



About halfway through the trip, we were alone for the first time (travelled with friends the 1st half), in a super romanic beach town, with a nice hotel room. Here, he brought up mistakes from the past again, and reiterated how nice it would be to ""re-connect"". We had been flirting and having fun, but I had brushed it off. He got more serious. He felt really bad for blowing off my needs through our relationship, and really want to do better, to share something better. I was impressed with what he said, we went for it, and it was incredible.



Absolutely earth shattering wonderful. (We both agree this was some of the best of our relationship).



So throughout the trip, he hinted towards getting back together (I brushed it off mostly as flirting?), talked up all the fun we were having, how he felt like he had a new perspective on life, etc. He asked a lot of hypothetical situations about ""us"", and by the end of the trip he spelled it out for me:
He realized how great I was, how much he loved me, and where things had gone wrong. He wanted to get back together, when we returned.



The trouble was: I wasn't sure how I felt about him now.
And I had just started seeing someone back home.
And Tom could be abroad for another 2 months or 12 months (it ended up being 14 months, which was his goal.)



I didn't know what say? This was entirely unexpected prior to leaving for this trip - we stayed in touch and talked every few days and it definitely was not indicative that he had feelings like this. He said he came to this realization ~1 month before I got out there.



So long story short - I told him I loved him and that we should stay in touch, and see what happens. Neither of us wanted a TDR and we agreed we cared about each other a lot. 



I went back home, and casually dated (mostly 1 guy, Jared) for the next year. 



Tom and I stayed in touch, almost daily. We were best friends before he left, and stayed in close contact the whole time he gone. Jared knew 90% of everything: that we chatted almost daily, that he was one of my best friends, and even that Tom had confessed to wanting to get back together (someday). I just didn't tell him any details of my time in Europe with Tom, because I really just didn't know what to make of it. I totally had feelings for him, but he was too far away to do anything about it. I had to live my life. Kind of complicated... Jared and I essentially dated on and off. We got along great but had some weird differences, and I mostly pulled away. I didn't want a serious relationship with Jared without some changes to his lifestyle, and so... I eventually broke things off for good this summer. (Though I felt like a lot was left unsaid.)



I had planned another Euro trip to visit Tom that summer, only this time he would be returning back to the states with me! We met up and travelled Europe and Asia for 2 months before heading home for good.



When we planned this trip, we agreed we would date and ""see how things go - no expectations."" 



But of course, there were expectations. We both wanted to fall in love (finally), and both of us anticipated this to be an unforgettable trip together. We were excited for what could be.



A lot had happened to me in the year since I had seen him last; among a few things, I was in a bad accident. My health was rocky for months (bad back, disc &amp; nerve issues) and my life was flipped upside down. I barely healed up in time to go on this trip, and had been under a lot of stress. Tom knew about all of this, but I left out a lot of the harder moments from our chats; I didn't want our time together to be all about me and all these bad things that kept happening. It would drag him down, drain him, and probably make him not wanna chat with me. I shared things with him, and by all means, I called him crying a few times - but, I was optimistic and tried to sound strong. 


We planned this trip hoping I would feel great by the time summer came, I worked to regain my health, and we agreed we'd make the best of it regardless. He anticipated and was very mindful of my physical needs and limits. 


But he was expecting the girl from last summer. The happy, **healthy**, carefree, sexy girl who blew him away. I was a shell of that person. I thought I would be happier and more excited, but I was drained. His expectations made me feel bad and well, its complicated. We both dated other people for the year we were separate - I was happy to date Tom now and be with him in that moment, but he was eager for me to be declared his girlfriend RIGHT when I got there. That came as a surprise. That started things off on an awkward foot, and while we had an AMAZING time together, we had a lot of hard talks about how I felt he was moving too fast. 



When we got ""home"", the plan was always to have him crash back at our old apt (now totally my apartment, with all his stuff in storage). *He* was hoping to move back in and basically back into a relationship. Its a 2bd place, and we discussed him taking the other room. (We had always had a roommate before, and we both agreed it would be awesome but also necessary to not have a roommate again, if we ever did end up living together.)



Throughout our travels, we discussed our living situation when we got home. I didn't want to say that he could move in, but it seemed likely he would, so long as things progressed that way by the end of the trip. It was a maybe, but probably - lets see how we feel throughout the trip. 



He kept pushing these topics, and it made me feel pressured, and I was honest - I didn't have an answer. Worst case scenario, he would stay there while he found his own place. No problem.



--- So! We got back in September. The morning after we arrive, he asked ""so are we moving back in together then?!"" and I was like "".. umm, ... no? I think it would best if we had more space."" I'd like to think that I was open to discussing things, and it was definitely really hard to actually let him leave. 


He was really hurt that I had him go. I explained he had pressured me throughout the trip to define our relationship, and that I felt I needed more space than this after spending 2 months being inseparable. He felt like I wasn't living up to the promise of ""always being there for him,"" althought he only left once he had found another place (with a great friend. Best end result. ever.) 


So since October when he moved out, things has been totally complicated and weird. 


We are trying to date each other, but we've hurt each other so much recently. He's dated other girls and slept with a mutual friend casually. I've seen Jared a few times (unresolved feelings that are now resolved). Tom moving out was rough for both of us: he was upset and disappointed, but I was also upset that I felt backed into this corner, and felt I was only making the healthiest choice for us. 


I made a mistake, and firmly broke things off with him right after we got back, and before he moved out. I just felt too pressued and worried if we tried to ""work through"" our issues, we'd implode and ever recover. I was so stressed and overwhelmed in life outside of Tom, and didn't want to get into this serious, committed relationship while all of my being seemed compromised. (I am financially ruined from this accident - I afforded the trip because it was a travel internship for me, and Tom actually fronted 90% of the costs in the end.) My emotional health is a wreck, and I just needed a little space. 


Tom wanted to work through it, but I didn't quite feel up to the challenge. Does that make sense? I absolutely loved him, but was not sure about ""us"" still, and didn't want to take the risk of losing him for good - I needed a teeny bit more space, and now a little me time to recollect myself.



We have spent a few weeks not talking, but maybe we still just need more time. 



We started really dating again about 3 weeks ago. My life is still as wacky and stressful as ever, and it clearly drags him down. He doesn't want a girlfriend who is in this state, and I don't want to be someones GF quite yet either. 


But I've gotten some time and space, we've come a long way, had a lot of good talks, and I would love to date him, as best as I can. I feel open and ready now. 


Maybe it's too late though? Because he's not ready to date me. He doesn't know what he wants. We talked (lightly) about getting married and a long term life together. He's reevaluated all of that in the last few months. 


I'm still a little overwhelmed with life and the aftermath (lawsuit) of this accident. We both graduate uni next year, and are in our final semester in school. We are so busy. Life is so crazy. 


We are still best friends, more than ever. We want to be there for one another and we clearly love each other a ton. 


So, advice time: I just want take it really slow. I've never done this before, but we have both changed so much; it's kind of tricky dating you already know so well. I want to be this bright, seductive side of myself, but it can be hard to reconnect after a stress-filled day, and especially after a hard talk with Tom. 


I think it should be low-expectation, there should be a time-frame, and we should be very honest and with open with our feelings. 


How do we go back to dating? How do I handle this crippling fear of love and intimacy with someone who has hurt me? How do I manage his fears and insecurities knowing how badly I've hurt him? 


**TL;DR: Tom and I have a long history, and its mostly filled with love and good times. We want to start again, but we're still sifting through the dust of pains from the past. We have hurt each other pretty equally, but love each other immensely and want to be together. I didn't feel ready at first, and he doesn't feel ready now. How can we do this? Where do we begin? We've distance ourselves, worked on ourselves, and have been taking things lightly and casually right now - easy does it lol. We have got something special and do not want to let each other go or mess this up - what are we doing? How can we make this work?

3yw0a1,2,2015-12-31,Help with upcoming internship interview,squarecompass,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/3yw0a1/help_with_upcoming_internship_interview/,"I'm a non-traditional (25-yr old) student in university studying software engineering, and I have been applying to various internships. I've had two interviews with this one company so far - and despite feeling like I blew the second interview, they've asked me to come in for a face-to-face meeting. I would go to the career center at my university for a mock interview, but they are closed for the holidays until the day before my interview...So, I was hoping to get some advice here.

I have always felt like I do poorly in interviews. I remember showing up to an interview for a temp job at wal-mart in a suit. I over-dressed in a couple of other interviews and eventually realized I should go with something a little more casual yet still dressy - but I digress. I just don't know how to talk about myself. In the last interview, the guy asked me to, then remarked that I was ""very thorough."" I don't know if that was a good thing or if I was too verbose.

Anyway, the recruiter told me to be prepared to talk about my skill set, group projects, extra-curricular projects, and what I want out of the internship. The thing is, I could go on and on about my personal projects and skills - that's easier than talking about myself. However, I'm afraid of coming off as arrogant or starting up a monologue and lose them in a very detailed explanation of my projects. I can't talk about those things *and* monitor social cues. It's too much to process.

Any ideas? One thing I thought of is bringing my laptop and asking if I could demonstrate some of my personal projects. What else could I do to prepare? What do I do when they inevitably ask if I have any questions for them?"
3yw5yk,2001,2015-12-31,"4 1/2 years ago I was 20k in debt, living off food stamps and couldn't even get a secured CC. Then I found /r/personalfinance and you changed everything. Today, my net worth passed 100k.",CreditScorePoor,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yw5yk/4_12_years_ago_i_was_20k_in_debt_living_off_food/,"Hey /r/personalfinance!

Its a little long down there sooooo lets start with the readers digest version...Also throwaway account because finance talk ;)

**TLDR:** In 4 1/2 years I went from being 20k in debt to [surpassing 100k net worth](http://imgur.com/aRQi970) thanks to /r/personalfinance by:

1. Increasing my income from $0 to $100k per year without increasing lifestyle/expenses
2. Living well below my means 
3. Eliminating Debt
4. Not taking on new debt
5. Saving and Investing in Retirement
6. Being proactive and positive in my career

I cannot believe I actually hit 100k net worth today...its seriously surreal. Words can't describe how grateful I am... both for the financial security I have today and the help /r/personalfinance has given me along the way. Without you guys I have no idea where I would be. I had zero financial knowledge before... like nothing.  

In the past 4 1/2 years the financial advice and expertise you've provided has opened my eyes to a future I couldn't have dreamed of before. I wanted to share my success and offer my story/help to anyone else struggling financially this year. I promise things can and will get better with patience, a little perseverance and of course hard work :)

**My Life Before PF (2011)**

In the interest of keeping things clear and concise... i'll just give you the key bullet points. 

* $20k of Debt (Student Loans - BA in Sociology)
* Unemployed (Lost Social Work Job during the recession) 
* Credit score - Around 350-450? (BoA would not give secured CC to me)
* Broke and on food stamps  
* Only income was selling T-shirts on the street

**Moment of Revelation**

The moment that pushed me to take control of my financial destiny was being denied a secured line of credit and needing to sell my favorite surfboard for rent on the same day. I had never had a credit card before, knew nothing of credit scores and didn't understand why I was denied. I also had no money in the bank and $20 in food stamps for a week of food. 

I realized I needed to understand the financial forces in the world to live the life I dreamed of having. I also realized that those forces were already working against me.  If I didn't learn to make them work for me I realized I would be destined to a life of insecurity, doubt and fear at every unexpected expense. 

I was 27 years old. 

**Creating a Plan**

1. I started reading and learning as much as I could about personal finance, credit, loans, debt, etc.  
2. I discovered /r/personalfinance and immediately posted about my financial situation and asked for advice. 
3. Based on that advice I did the following:
       * Decided to transition careers and started applying for                               internships and entry level positions in new fields. 
       * Requested my free credit report and created a game plan to tackle outstanding debt/negative marks    
       * Organized student loans according to interest rate and created a plan to aggressively highest interest loans and work my way down. 
       * Once I had steady income, resolved to establish an Emergency Fund that would give me a 3-month cushion should I lose my job. 
       * When all of the above was completed...start saving for retirement and building credit

**Step #1**:***Increase Income and Career Potential***

Increasing my income potential and career prospects longterm were of utmost importance to get my finances under control. As such, **I resolved to start from the bottom and work tirelessly develop my skill set.** No matter how much pride/sacrifice it might take... I decided I would find and excel at a new career. I jumped right in and...

* Identified my transferable skills and polished my resume 
* Decided that I wanted to work with startups/companies developing exciting new technology 
* Immediately started applying and interviews. 
* NO JOB WAS ABOVE OR BELOW ME...If it seemed interesting and like I had even a few relevant skills I would apply. 
*  This process was essential in refining my personal pitch and honing in on the positions/areas that interested me the most.
* Not to mention all of the phone interviews/in-person interviews we invaluable training for future job searches 

After a few weeks I was offered an internship and a great company for 20-hours a week at $10 an hour.  All of the other interns were still in college, most couldn't even drink and despite feeling like an OLD ASS MAN at 27... I knew this was a great opportunity and jumped at the offer. 

**Step #2** : ***Work Hard, Move Up***

From the interview my internship it was explicitly stated that no interns would be hired. I decided my new goal would be to change their minds. My performance would convince them to keep me around.  **SO I PROCEEDED TO WORK MY ASS OFF!** By the end of the internship:

* I'd learned more than I could have imagined
* I had two full-time offers on the table from companies I'd applied to over the internship 
* When I told my intern supervisor, he said ""Do not accept another offer... we want you here."" 
* The next day I signed an offer letter at the company I interned with starting at $50k a year. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

I've continued working with the same zeal and dedication. As a result, I've been promoted several times and my salary has increased from 50k a year to 100k a year. I believe a strong work ethic can make anything a reality. 

**Step #3** : ***DONT LET MONEY CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE. LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS***

My new salary allowed me to immediately start saving and tackling debt...BUT ONLY BECAUSE I DIDNT SPEND THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE. If I was living on food stamps before... I should be able to keep my expenses low right? 

I continued to live well below my means and put all of my extra money into paying down debt, then saving. **This meant no new cars, no new debt, and no frivolous spending sprees.** I had to keep my eye on the prize even if I wasn't under such intense financial pressure. 

Within 1-year I had:

* Paid off ALL OF MY STUDENT LOANS

* Increased my credit score by over 100 points

* Established an emergency fund of $1000

* Begun utilizing my companies 401k match

* Promoted and given a pay raise   

**Other Essentials**
1. I have found that YOU HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE to increase your income, salary and position. 
 * I initiate salary reviews on a yearly basis with my superiors
 * Jump at the opportunity to take on new responsibilities
 * Being proactive doesn't mean forcing you're way on others
 * I always look for the right and appropriate moments to further my career goals while remaining teachable
 * I NEVER FORGET THAT EVERYONE IS REPLACEABLE and work hard to be an asset to my company 

2. Pay CC off in full every month and don't take on new debt
 * If I want a car... I buy used and wait until I have the cash on hand
 * Same goes for any consumer product 

3. I now MAX OUT ALL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS THAT I CAN
 * 401k
 * ROTH IRA

4. I maintain a liquid emergency fund that will cover EVERYTHING AT MY CURRENT LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE for 6-months  
 * I dont touch it

There is so, so much more I could add... so if you have any questions at all please ask away... I love helping people with this stuff since it the advice I was freely given here literally changed my life. Anyone can do it! I swear! 

Last but not least... THANK YOU ALL AGAIN. If it wasn't for /r/personalfinance I'd still be lost in life!

EDIT: WOW..the skeptics are strong... I didn't immediately respond to comments with questions because i posted this at 2am... then went to bed. I am going to go through today after work and respond to everyones questions one by one.... even if it takes me till 4am.

EDIT #2: I did not win the lotto or inherit any money

EDIT #3: Job progression and salary information ... 

* Assistant Community Manager: $50,000 K
* Community Manager: $66,000 K
* Operations Manager: $80,000 K
* Head of Operations $100,000 K

NEW YEARS EVE EDIT #4: 
I just realized its new years eve so I just wanted to let you all know that I plan on hammering through comments tomorrow afternoon/evening... I have not forgotten about you. You all are my first priority for the new year.

How can I do this?,planningforthefuture,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ywt4n/can_im_a_20_year_old_international_student_in/,"I'm an international student in Canada at the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science. 

My program has 8 study terms, each of them costs $14k (CAD) + 3-4k for living expenses. My parents have paid for the first two terms. 

I'm in the co-op program which means that I have a work term (4-month paid internship) after each study term except for the first and last one. So 8 study terms + 6 work terms which most people do back to back (4 years and 8 months, including summers).

I've had some experience in programming before so I managed to get a good position and got paid 4k/mo. I saved 8k but then I spent 2k for a flight back home and some purchases ($1800 for the flight because I was starting to feel extremely homesick). This term my parents paid 11k and I'll hopefully take care of the rest. 

My parents are by no means super rich, they're just making huge sacrifices because they know that staying in my home country is really bad for my future. They may run out of ways to pay for my education soon due to the messed up situation of my home country and I really need to find ways to pay for my tuition on my own.

Are there any ideas you can suggest?"

I'm the one with the higher income since she just started an internship.
Our problems are basically related the way she perceives our relationship.

I see myself working hard for this family: I found her the internship, I helped with her job the first days (while doing mine). I clean the house and cook when needed.
She does the same, not less.

However, in most of arguments, she doesn't lose chance to label me. For example, I introduce her to Internet/banking security to persuade her to improve her safety measures and labels me paranoid (e.g who is going to mess with your accounts?).
I get frustrated from work and I nag about politics or colleagues  and I get called nagger (now that she has started working is done similar things). 
Finally, I told her I wanted to buy a PS4 (we've restricted budget) and I got called childish because husbands don't play video games (we have no kids) and I should invest my time in gym (currently I'm muscular fat).

I mean it's alright arguing about my fault since I'm not exactly an example of perfection. What I found annoying is being labelled all the time.
I don't feel a fair relationship. And it's like being alone in a courtroom.

Apparently is very difficult for her to understand my perspective since she is convinced that her discussions are for improving our relationship.

I work on a team that maintains the software for a storage array system. My job is to fix bugs in our codebase. Sometimes it's easy but sometimes it's hard. A lot of my job involves reading through dense, confusing code, and figuring out why it isn't working properly. It's not fun.

So I was wondering, what other kinds of jobs are there that would be easier? I want a job where I can just come in and sit down and do it without trying too hard. I'm tired of having to push myself so hard to focus and get my work done. I guess I could do web development, but I haven't enjoyed the web development I've done in the past because it's really finicky. But maybe that's just cause I'm bad at it. Maybe I could look into network stuff or sysadmin stuff? Although I don't have any experience with that.

I mean I am quite satisfied. I have picked up a few new hobbies, got nice internship in a well known engineering company and I am propably going to spend few months abroad as an exchange student this year. Doesnt sound bad, does it? 

Another change I made was cutting all meaningless activities. I used to go clubbing ~ every second week, because I hoped to finally meet ""the one"" girl. I dont seek the approval anymore I just do whatever I want. Turns out sometimes I just want to watch my favourite tv series instead of clubbing or hanging out. When I think about it, I feel like I am missing something...

  So its NYE and Im just sitting home with my younger brother and dog - not like its bad or something.

3yxhkn,0,2015-12-31,Should I take out a student loan for a new computer?,Tomminator95,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yxhkn/should_i_take_out_a_student_loan_for_a_new/,"I am a 21 year old college student, I'm in my junior year of an engineering degree. I intend to get my masters as well, so I am looking at a good 3.5 years of school still to go.
My current computer is 4 years old and starting to fall apart (cd player cover has fallen off, hinge is getting unstable, ect.), but still runs ok for now. There is no way that it will last all the way through my education, so I will definitely need a new computer at some point.

I have been able to stay out of debt thus far. I have scholarships that have covered my tuition and I live at home in order to avoid paying for housing/rent. I have always had a job while in school, but usually with very few overall hours. After my normal expenses (gas, food, phone bill, ect.) I usually have very little money left over, so I have pretty much no money in savings. I would have to cut a lot of expenses for a long period of time to save enough money for a new computer.

So my question: Is it worth taking out my first (and hopefully only) student loan in order to get a new computer? In engineering I use my computer a lot and I need something relatively powerful to run some of the software I use. I would ideally like to get something like the Surface Book ($1700) or maybe even the Surface Pro 4 ($1300).

TL;DR - I am an engineering student, I need a new computer, I have no debt but also no savings. Is it worth taking out $1500ish in student loans to invest in a good computer?



EDIT: Thanks for the comments, let me clarify one thing: I have looked at building a pc, but I definitely need a laptop more than anything right now. It does me no good to have a powerful computer at home when 90% of the time I use it will be at school. I know building a pc is the best way to get bang for your buck, but its just not what I need right now.
The impression I am getting is that regardless of whether or not I get a student loan to pay for it or get an internship or something, I should be looking for something cheaper. I guess there is no need to get something that nice when something cheaper would do all that I need it to do.
Thanks for the input y'all!

EDIT 2: My school does have labs with computers, but there are computer classes that use those labs during the day so I can't consistently rely on them."

I just got into UH and will be starting in January. However that means the tutoring job I have out in Tomball is no longer feasible. I am willing to do light traveling.

As mentioned earlier, I am currently a tutor for math and science courses as well as SAT and ACT prep. I am also willing to housesit and babysit. I am also a creative person that likes to paint pottery and do other art related projects.

A little about myself.

 I am 22 and going to UH starting in January. I have two engineering internships under my belt with a 3rd coming this summer. The reason why I need extra cash, is because I am a student on the GI BILL. The Winter months are the hardest since you only get paid for when you go to school. I won't be able to renew my benefits of UH until mid January, and not seeing them until late Feb or even March. 

I am a hard worker and punctual. If you have any questions about my work or myself. Please feel free to PM me. I can send a resume if necessary. 

Thank you for your time and Happy New Year!"

We're becoming one of the largest distributors and retailers in the country and yet most of the work we do is still done by hand. We currently have an extremely old IBM system that the managers pick through to make calculations and decisions.

I've been an intern web developer here for 2 years with only a beginner's knowledge of networking and server management. With our initial quoted price to start integrating the system at over 100 grand, they're asking me a lot of questions. I don't know a damn thing about integrating an ERP.

Do you guys have any experience to share? Insights, tips, or advice? 

I am the best person with technology in the company, which is very sad....and I'm no genius. The old IBM system we have currently receives information from our warehouses over very expensive T1 lines in real time. I have no idea how any of these companies we get quotes from are planning to migrate that data to a new system. Any light you guys could shed on the situation would be veeeeery much appreciated.

Thanks everyone :)"

der Jahreswechsel ist für und alle der Zeitpunkt, auf das abgelaufene Jahr zurückzublicken, Bilanz zu ziehen, Erfolge zu feiern, und zu versuchen, Fehler zu erkennen und zu beheben. Und wenn ich so zurückblicke, sowohl auf meine Amtszeit als Kanzler als auch auf den MBundestag im Allgemeinen, muss ich sagen, dass meine Bilanz dabei sehr positiv ausfällt. Mein Kabinett und ich haben uns inzwischen gut in die Regierungsgeschäfte eingearbeitet, und blicken zuversichtlich auf den Rest der Legislatur. Wir sind uns bewusst, dass wir große Teile unseres Programms noch nicht bearbeitet haben und viele Fragen noch intern zu verhandeln sind, aber so ich kann versichern, dass uns die Themen nicht ausgehen werden. Besonders glücklich bin ich über die Zukunftsperspektiven in der Außenpolitik, wo wir jetzt durch unserer gute Arbeit im MBundestag in der Lage sind, auch international verstärkt aufzutreten. Nicht nur unser Engagement in der RMUN, sondern auch die Mitarbeit und Abstimmung auf anderen, auch bilateralen Zusammenkünften sehe ich als Zeichen unserer neuen außenpolitischen Rolle. Ich hoffe, dass ich in diesen Fragen auch weiter auf die Unterstützung aller Parteien und meines Kabinetts vertrauen zu können, und auch, dass sich dieses Engagement auch in einer Bereicherung der Arbeit auszahlen wird.

Unser Subreddit sehe ich auf einem guten Weg, auch wenn wir im internationalen Vergleich nicht durch eine besondere Größe beeindrucken, so doch um so mehr durch unsere Stabilität und Qualität, die wirklich ihresgleichen sucht. Natürlich ist weiteres Wachstum begrüßenswert und sogar  notwendig, um neue Aufgaben schultern zu können, aber die Arbeit dieses und des letzten Parlamentes spricht doch für sich. Durch die Hilfe und den Einsatz so vieler Menschen, die mit Spaß, Anspruch, Kreativität und Witz dabei sind, haben wir es geschafft, eine Gemeinschaft und Regeln für diese Gemeinschaft zu schaffen, auf die wir stolz sein können. In diesem Sinne freue ich mich aus ganzem Herzen auf die weitere Zusammenarbeit mit Ihnen und allen weiteren Menschen, die sich uns anschließen wollen, und wünsche ihnen ein gesundes, glückliches und erfolgreiches Jahr 2016.

Ihr Bundeskanzler Quillsandsofas"

I have degrees in the social sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level. I consider the scientific method to be my trade. I have done data science/ analytics consulting for one high profile NGO, and one smaller operation as well. When it comes to inferential statistical methods etc., and the principles of data, I consider myself an expert.
I have had a difficult time finding permanent full time work in this field (of course many of us have). I do however have a permanent fulltime job in sales/banking/finance that pays OK, but of course it is an extremely challenging job and requires some shitty hours.  
At any rate, I have high functioning autism/ autism spectrum disorder, and my poor social skills have certainly been a barrier for me finding fulfilling employment in a job that matches my education and intellect.

I am currently studying programming languages and the principles of computing, non-stop. My intention is to compliment my research/data/analytical skills with programming and computer science skills. 
My theory is, that armed with this knowledge, I can pursue a career as a data scientist/ analyst and circumvent the barrier presented by poor social skills. As soon as I am confident in my ability with C programming and SQL I am going to pursue an unpaid internship if I have to in order to start building a solid reputation etc.
Am I correct in thinking that Data Scientist/ Analyst is a good field for people who are socially awkward? And honestly I’m not the type who is going to do a whole ton of nutty inappropriate shit in the office. But I desperately need an environment where I can be a quiet person who keeps to themselves, and is allowed to sound a bit awkward or odd when I give a presentation to co-workers or discuss some findings with my manager.  
Or perhaps you people out there have some different advice for me? Perhaps I should pursue a different field where social skills are not as imperative, or maybe you think I should invest in improving those skills.

3yy060,5,2015-12-31,Need help deciding between internships next summer,Mechanism_Builder,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3yy060/need_help_deciding_between_internships_next_summer/,"Last summer I interned at Company A which creates products and works with processes that I'm technically interested in. I've learned much about engineering from my coworkers last summer and I overall enjoyed the entire experience. 

This fall I began interning at Company B. This internship turned out to be a part-time job in that it didn't end after the semester and has no future end point like summer internships. This is good  in that I am able to rely on a part-time income to cover some personal expenses. 

I am not particularly interested in what Company B does and furthermore they work more in the civil engineering discipline whereas I am a mechanical engineering major. My boss at Company B has hinted that this job may turn into a full-time position once I graduate. Some issues I have with this internship are as follows:  

In the four months I've been there I haven't been given one engineering project. My main project has been setting up customer relationship management software for the sales staff and generating sales reports for the sales managers.

Recently I was contacted by Company A asking if I would like to intern with them again next summer. This would conflict with my current internship and I probably would have to quit. This could also be problematic in that for this Fall I wouldn't have a part-time job and would have to rely on my savings for about 4 months (I graduate in December).

I'm having trouble deciding which company to intern with over the summer. A part of me wants to go back to Company A because I learned a lot last summer and I feel I could learn much more. But staying with Company B would be the much safer option.

What path should I take?
Thanks in advanced for any and all advice!"

The name's Mike. For starters, I'm 21. I'm in the Eastern Time Zone, and I work day shift. I enjoy story-driven roleplay that's heavy on the smut. I like 1 or 2 paragraph-length responses, at least once a day if possible. I'm posting here in hopes that I can find someone interested in one of my prompts. I'm flexible on most if not all of these, and I'm happy to include any kinks that you're into as well. Characters and such are negotiable, just let me know which of them, if any, grab you!

Please put your name, age, and your favorite color in the title of your reply so I know you read the above. 

Kinks: Noncon/Dubcon, Blackmail, Anal, Rough Sex, Light BDSM, Taboo/Forbidden Roles, Sci-fi/Fantasy, Celebrities/Rule34, Bimbofication, Cuckold/Cheating (As a bull) And just about anything else, really. I'm not too picky. I'm dominant, though I've never really explored my submissive side.

Limits: Scat, Extreme Ageplay, Snuff, Excessive Violence, Futa, not too many others.

Without further delay, my prompts:

**Let's talk about your man...**
We both know he doesn't satisfy you anymore. Maybe he's too vanilla, too gentle, or even, well, too small. Who we are, setting, and characters, is up for discussion. Am I your boss? Your coworker? Your friend, or your man's friend? Maybe I'm a stranger that you meet one day. However it happens, you give in to your urges and give yourself to me.

**1985/Stacy's Mom**

Like the songs. You're an older woman (Anything older than me is fine) looking for what she missed out on in life. You're unsure, self-conscious, and a bit skittish. I'm confident, young, and headstrong. I lead you down a path of lust and depravity, letting you relive your teenage fantasies.

*Blackmail*

Blackmail. However you want it. Maybe I'm your coach or teacher and I find some weed or cigarettes in your locker? Perhaps I'm your boss, and you've been messing up at work. Maybe you just need an extra buck, and I'm a rich dick who couldn't care less? However you please, as long as you've got no other choice.

**Naive Model and Sleazy Photographer**

WANTED: Models for a photoshoot!

EXPERIENCE: None Required. I am an established photographer and I will guide you through every step of the process, including helping you set up an online portfolio and page. I will walk you through basic outfits and poses and give you essential guidance and tips to make it in the industry. Who to work with, what names to look for, what brands to wear, how to negotiate for a bid, the works!

WORK: As described above, we will shoot several different outfits in many poses. Glamour, Action, Fun, and anything else we decide on.

PAYMENT: All will be worked out between you and I at our first shoot. Accepting trades, work for photos, etc.

CONTACT: Submit your work history, a photo of yourself, and your measurements and physical description to this Email address. If I think you fit my needs, I'll be in contact with you soon.

DON'T MISS THIS CHANCE TO CATCH YOUR BIG BREAK!

**Kidnapped Celebrity(ies?)**

I'm a shadowy, powerful media mogul. You're a celebrity who's been enjoying too much time in the spotlight lately, and it's time I reminded you of your place. Nonconsent and roughness to be found here. I'd love it if you were capable of playing multiple women. Favorites include: Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson, Christina Hendricks, and Jennifer Lawrence.

**Doctors Office**

*All ages to be discussed in PM*. It's your first time at the doctor's by yourself. Why are you here? Maybe your period just came, and your mother is either too busy or too anxious to explain it to you herself. Maybe you're constipated, and your poor parents are at a loss. Maybe it's just a routine checkup, but regardless, this is all new to you.
Tell me about yourself. Why you're in my waiting room today. Ideally, you're innocent, if not completely naive. Describe yourself and list any kinks and limits you might have. Everything is negotiable.

**Xiylux Corporation: Corporate Administrative Assistant**

Position: Corporate Administrative Assistant - Executive Level

Hours: 40 Hours per week. Overtime common. Late nights. Travel required.

Pay: Performance Based. Bonuses available.

Description: Xiylux Corporation is in need of an Administrative Assistant for a Senior Level Executive. Applicants must be professional, discreet, intelligent, and know how to fulfill requests typical of this job. Experience recommended, but not necessary. Will be expected to maintain corporate and personal confidentiality and to sign a Nondisclosure Agreement. Applicants must be hardworking, with a good work ethic. Must take pride in one's position. Must be able to handle large packages and loads during the course of office work. Must be willing and capable to travel and to represent Xiylux Corporation in the company of your assigned executive.

Application: Name, Age, Credentials, Height, Weight, Measurements, Picture.

Followup: If interested, Xiylux Corporation will contact you at our convenience for an in person, oral interview.

Student Internships also available, inquire if interested.

**Ravishing an older woman**

I'm looking for an older woman. I have the fantasy of being really rough, dominant, and degrading with her, fucking her senseless and making her do all sorts of nasty things that she has never done with her husband.

I could play as your son's old high-school bully, come to pick on him one more time, only to find you home instead. I could be the intern at your husband's office, looking to get back at him for the way he treats me at work. You could be my professor, and I'm a student you don't get along with. Maybe I'm a complete stranger who invades your home, or watches you get too drunk at the local bar?

We'll find a set of characters and a scene to play together, I'm sure.

Bonus points for: Busty, thick, curvy women with plump asses. Redheads. ""Good, Christian Housewives"" who haven't been kinky in the bedroom at all, and would be embarrassed by any of the things I make her do. Reluctance. Doggy Style.

**Send me a PM with the prompt you like, and some information, and we'll figure things out!**

So, I'm going to graduate in Spring 2017. My issue is that the final semester will only consist of 1 class. Ideally I would want to have a full time job during that semester, but that would be very difficult since I would technically still be a student and many companies want degrees.

I already have a couple of side projects to show off and am constantly working on more. Hopefully by the end of 2016, they'll be sophisticated enough to land me a full time position. But in the event that doesn't happen, what should I do?

At the moment I'm applying to tons of internships, but I had a really late start (started applying mid December) and a significant amount of companies are rejecting me due to their positions already being filled. Of course I'm not giving up and still applying, but it's a scary thought that I won't have an internship this summer.

I also heard that some internships being offered in the fall or spring, but I can't imagine those being very common. So I can't really depend on those.

So... what's my plan?

What do I do now?,TangerineX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3yyr4w/rejected_from_everywhere_i_applied_to_so_far_what/,"Some background: I going to graduate in May with a CS bachelors degree from a top 20 school in the US. I started CS a bit late, midway through my Sophomore year. CS experience so far has been some research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and an internship at Facebook last summer (I did not receive a return offer). I have a 3.1 GPA (CS GPA should be slightly higher). My CS courses have focused on Networks and Machine Learning, and I will be TAing an advanced Machine learning course this term.

I've had first round interviews at Asana, Microsoft. I've had first round interviews, and onsites at Google, Snapchat, and Redfin. I felt like I didn't exactly do my best on the snapchat, asana, Microsoft interviews, but I felt that I had done well at Google and Redfin. For Snapchat, I was definitely not expecting an offer because I was not a good cultural fit for the company at all.

I'm a little bit lost right now and need help figuring out what I should do. I feel quite demotivated right now, and need to pick myself up. A couple of questions.

What's the best way to find good companies that are smaller and lesser known? Is it better for me to simply ""apply everywhere"" and not so much worry about whether or not the company is a good company? How do you get to know startups, especially ones with potential?

Companies do not give any feedback on interviews. I have a pretty high rate of applying to being selected for an interview, which makes me think that my resume isn't my weakest point. Besides, at this point the material that is going on the resume is not going to be changing anytime soon. I was wondering if someone could give me a mock interview and point out things that you feel could be my weak points and what I can work on. 

Thanks a lot!"
