I just finished college [22M], she just finished college (has one more semester left) [23F].  We have been together for a bit, no sex, but talking and hanging out it is basically monogamous for about 2-3 months.  We met at school this semester in one of our classes and totally hit it off with eachother.  Seeing each other non-stop, texting, calling everyday.  We are really like a thing together.  Thing is she is leaving for her Disney internship from May 16-January 4th.  

We finished classes today in which we attend together.  After class she broke down and began crying.  She gave me a big hug and rushed out of the room.  I hugged her tried to follow but she was far gone.  She had texted me in class that she will pick me up when she gets her belongings from a friends room so we will get lunch.  

I texted her about ten minutes after class saying I hope everything is okay and for her to let me know when she will be back on campus.  She said okay she will.  She picked me up and we went out to eat lunch as planned.

She basically told me she likes me a lot, but is very nervous with her going away.  She told me she wouldnt be mad if I found another girl while she was gone, and that she hopes she will still stay in contact with me.  I told her 7months is a very long time no seeing each other, especially since I will be looking for jobs, and starting my career.  But I assured her distance and time was not a problem with me.  I really really like this girl a lot.  

We left lunch after our little talk and she dropped me off but not without giving me a kiss.  I could tell she is really caught up in this whole situation as she is texting me about it this very moment still.

To me, I do not think distance is an issue.  I mean it is seven months without seeing her, but I told her I would wait for her (which is the truth.)  

Okay so to my question:
Has anyone been in a similar situation as this?  I do not know how to approach this when the time comes around.  Do I take this slow?  Is distance really an issue?  Am I over thinking this whole situation?  I do not want to get hurt while waiting for her but she finds someone down in Florida... Do I tell her that?  I am just very confused about this situation and do not know how to really approach it just looking for some great advice.

I feel it hurts my chances since I'm not in a university yet or that I may be over my head.

I have plenty of non-CS job experience to offer too. 


My question is did anyone have an internship while &lt;2 years of college courses or attending a community college? If you were accepted, was it overwhelming or did you feel you could get the worked required done in a timely fashion?"

I'm a junior in CS and kinda applied late to the game for summer internships. Despite that, I was able to land a phone interview for an internship position next Monday and really don't want to blow it as it could be my last chance for getting an internship for this upcoming summer. What should I do to prepare for the phone interview over the weekend? Below is the job description and qualifications for this internship.

I am a bonafide caffeine addict, a regular loser of car keys and an aspiring foreign correspondent.  I am coming to the end of my second year of journalism school at a small liberal arts college in Southeastern Tennessee. 

Last summer, I had the privledge of interning at Tennessee's largest newspaper, The Tennessean.  While working at The Tennessean, I worked a story that changed my life forever. President Obama had just announced plans to forge ahead with immigration reform sans the support of congress, and my asssignment was simple: Make it local. By mid-afternoon I found myself sitting on a downtown stoop with the Nashville sun beating down at a humid 90 degrees. Across from me sat a girl named Diana. Diana was a 19-year-old college student, just like me. She pulled all-nighters, ate crappy dining hall food and pursued procrastination like an extreme sport, just like me. But she was also the child of ""illegal immigrants."" Diana knew a fear I will never know. She daily asked a question that sheer luck as spared me from ever uttering: ""What if today is the day my parents get deported?""

That is when I knew. That is when I decided that this profession, this passion is worth all of me. I want to go to the countries that people flee. I want to find out why, I want to see it with my own eyes. And I want to tell the world. I believe knowledge begets change, and I desperately desire to play a role in that education.

Summer ended and I head back to my college campus. I took a job as the manging editor of my school's news publication, and I am slated to take over as editor-in-chief in August. I have never been more excited to start down any other path, to engage any other adventure. 

With finals the only thing standing between me and freedom, I am being forced to face the reality of my situation: I may not get to come back next year. I may not get to serve as the editor-in-chief of this publication that has become so dear to me.

I will be starting a internship at an alt newspaper in just 18 days, and I am honored and excited and thrilled to see how my skills develop over the next couple of months. The problem is that this internship is unpaid. 

I have taken a minimum wage job to help keep my lights on and my car insured, but I do not currently have the money to return to school in the fall. 

Desperate for a way to fund the gap between my financial aid and my tuitition, I am appealing to you. Please, if you can, help me follow this dream. If you cannot, I would so appreciate a share and a prayer.

Yours kindly,
Ashley

I have recently created a Go Fund Me page, which you can donate to here: http://www.gofundme.com/tg9468z

I have capitalized on all my financial aid, maxed out my federal loans and am not eligible for private loans. I have been saving money as proactively as I can, but I don't have the resources to completely bridge the gap. Any and all help – whether in the form of good vibes or money – is much appreciated.  "
34h8ax,2,2015-04-30,Internship at a startup?,sil222,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34h8ax/internship_at_a_startup/,"I'm a student that has an opportunity to join a start-up for the summer. I would be working on the business product, and am essentially the sole developer. The technology surrounding the product really interests me, and I may have an opportunity to stay with the company long term if the project is a success. The product has a deadline to be reached, since it will be demo'd to the primary investor. If the investor is satisfied, then there will be much more funding. To me, it seems like an awesome opportunity , which will satisfy my desires to learn about start-ups and work with the cool hardware. Furthermore, the boss seems like a nice person. He presented the situation nicely, hyped up the high growth potential. He also told me it would be a risk, because if the project doesn't go well, I might be looking for a job, rather than extending the contract for the fall term. He also addressed my concerns nicely. He didn't bash big corporations, even saying they are great places for students to grow. Hence, I do not thing he would screw me in any way. Also I am being paid for this, more than the average co-op in the city he said.

However, I am hesitant on accepting because I will be required to build something from scratch and am nervous I won't be able to finish. Furthermore, I am the main developer and won't have co-developers helping me out, nor software veteran mentors to learn from. I feel like as a student, I should be aiming to join large corporations, where there is an infrastructure in place to enable interns to thrive in. Being mentored, learning proper software development, etc. 

I just want some input on whether this is a great opportunity for a student, or a waste of time. Is it normal for start-ups to ask students to help build a working demo of a product? I feel like trusting a student with responsibility like this indicates something bad, however the boss did say my resume was exactly the type of person he was looking for.

Please ask me for any clarifications. Thanks!"

For months my parents have been hounding me about getting an internship, accusing me of not trying hard enough. Well two days ago I got an offer for a pretty good gig at a startup doing some embedded work. I am happy. I sent my dad the offer letter and he emailed me congrats. However, he called be today and asked me how much it paid, a respectable amount for a startup, and stated that it wasn't a reputable company after doing his research. I could sense the disappointment in his voice that I didn't get any offers.
In my head I'm thinking that he has a lot of nerve. He has been scolding me for months stating that how I'm not trying hard enough and as soon I get an offer its not good enough.

Does anyone else experience this constant lack of satisfaction from their parents even from pretty major accomplishments? Sorry for the rantiness of this post, I'm kind of ticked off."

34hpb2,4,2015-05-01,Diagnosed today- need input,DPD1995,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/34hpb2/diagnosed_today_need_input/,"Howdy reddit, its 12:40 in the morning but I have to study &amp; everyone is asleep. Today, after a session with my Psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Severe Depression Disorder last August, and ADHD 2 years ago, after having a rough couple of months, she said shes thinks I have Bi-Polar disorder, and is going to order some tests to further diagnose the situation. It wasn't until she told me this today, that I guess it made sense. I have had some pretty drastic change in moods this year, but I thought when I was sad it was just my depression and the other times I was just happy. I am 19 years old, a college student, but after reading through a lot personal testimonies/ DSM II, I am a little confused. 

My emotions have been ambivalent as fuck since January, there have been weeks were I feel like a walking zombie, but my anti-depressant allows me to get up and I go a week or two like this. On the other hand, there are moments when I feel happy, but I don't think either ""Manic"" or "" Depression"" are as intense as some of y'all seem to experience. 

I've never hurt myself, or felt so euphoric I could do anything. However throughout my life, I have been cocky, confident and I know I am more intelligent than the ""average "" person. I also have been suffering from Insomnia since around 8 years old (I moved from Mexico to Florida).


My insomnia has been a recurring thing in my life, but I had never thought about it as an episode, now it makes sense since it's not always there. As a freshman in college, I have struggled with my depression, but again not to the extent I see some people experience. Are there different levels of intensity of episodes? I guess you could say I always felt I have a ""special purpose"" mostly due to the fact, that I see that I often leave a lasting impression on people. Nearly every-time I walk in a room, or area, some heads always turn to look at me. I've never thought I am like a god, or a prodigy, but I always have believed I will do some good in life. 
During school I had a lot of ""acquantinces"" and few people I truly call friends. I played a lot of sports, orchestra, clubs, so I was always ""social"" however I was never super well liked. Those who I call my friends, have been my friends through rough times, especially supporting me through depression. I have never really cared much for being liked however, and have ended ""friendships"" over someone telling me about something that they hated about my personality. I feel like being so involved in high school helped me make a lot more friends than I would've have otherwise. I am well aware of some of my controlling, stubborn &amp; annoying tendencies, that tends to irritate the general public. A friend has described me as ""not giving a fuck in a good way"" but there has been times I feel I should be a little nicer to people. 

I am a freshman in college, and have made 0 true friends, but never alone, always someone who wants to hangout, or party. I was going to join a frat, but agreed with my parents it would be best to wait a year since I was diagnosed with depression at the beginning of  the semester. Since this semester started, on my own I began to lost interest in drinking and partying. I was really into in high school, but I was also on the football team, and didn't really start til Senior year. I'll still go out when I see old friends, or occasionally (1-2 a month), but I rarely drink like I used to, no longer smoke weed ( 2-3x a week for 2 years prior to Feb) 

As a kid I was a huge nerd, but being bullied for it, and just my natural love of playing sports, kind of pushed me away from it during high school. I don't remember ever actually studying for a test, or doing homework. I'd generally copy or not do it all, thinking ""I can intuitively figure this out""  each time I had a test of quiz. For the most part this worked had a 3.5 GPA then, but I rarely found stuff interest like I did in elementary school. I was in the gifted program, fascinated by computers, NASA, read 3-4 books a week, but that stopped when I moved to Seattle 5th grade. My sophomore year I moved to Austin, TX, and once again always had a group to hangout with, plus my football teammates, so I never really felt sad, or lonely. Like I said I wasn't disliked, but I wasn't ""Popular"" either. Never really bothered me, and I was kind of the kid who hangouts with ""the popular kids"" and partied, simply because football bonds people in a weird way. In college, I regained my curiosity for academics, taught myself differential &amp; integral calculus, (finance major no math req) and have begun studying to a point where I get 4-5 hours of sleep daily. There's been times I don't have school work, but I like to learn about trading &amp; investment, programming, math, or just read good literature. This Dec I fell in love with a girl from MIT, shes mostly the reason I regained this ""curiosity"" in academics, and was really happy for about a month. We decided it wasn't going to work out since we lived far away, and that sent me into a depression. I dived into studying, and here we are today, I really enjoy studying so that's good, but there are times where I can't focus (depression episodes??) and don't feel like doing anything, and other moments where I want to write a book, learn coding, learn more calculus or finance. These come and go, but I never thought to think of them as ""Manic"" episodes. I'm still sad about this girl, but I am doing ok moving, on, hooked up with other girls, but really lost interest in your average college hookup. I have had an increase in sexual drive, usually just watch porn, but nothing too crazy or extreme. 

I am a little scared, I reached out to my psychiatric about how my moods were changing a lot, for sustainble periods of time. I wasn't expecting her to tell me she had been thinking I had bi-polar tendencies, and now that the symptoms were getting worse, she wanted to diagnose me and do some tests. Those will be next week, I am scared, because I don't know how much of my life I have been living thinking my actions were normal (I am a little different than others, but I figured that came w/ moving around so much/intelligence/adhd) 
I've always envisioned being a CEO or CFO at a start up, I want to work at wall st, and eventually open up a private school for gifted poor kids in Mexico. I've had a job since I was 12 (even though I am blessed to be well off) , back then just typical yard work, at 15 I began my job at Mcdonalds, and have since had 3 jobs (each one I changed for higher pay) 2 internships, and I am currently working as a finance intern at a university engineering research station. I never really thought there was something wrong with me, I always thought I was unique, but lately it became clear that my emotions weren't normal and they weren't letting me study or be social, or excited about life in general. I also grew up in a predominantly rich place in Austin, so there has always been periods of my life where I'll feel euphoric, but I always thought it was because I was partying in penthouses, or taking trips around the world, and not because of my disease. 

This began to weigh on me however, since I was born in Mexico, and we were very poor despite my mom being a doctor and dad CS Engineer w/ MBA in marketing. (Mexico sucks) So i remember moments where we couldn't eat, lights went out, money was always a worry. I have been lucky to be where I am today, in that sense, but feel guilt since my family is still very poor, and mexico fucked up.
 
I was wondering if anyone had any comments, or advice as I move towards this era of my life, I am not sure how/I should adjust any goals I have had or aspects that were ""delusions."" Again, I don't seem to be delusional towards where someone has ever said I was living out reality, or euphoric to the ways I've read others. I have had really bad crippling depressions however. I will join a frat in the fall (couple of kids I hangout with really want me to &amp; so do I) and spend the summer studying, my parents are very aware and very supportive (1.5 hours away from college) &amp; we see each other weekly, so I am blessed to have their support. 
THanks! "

One company I noticed was Flex-It/2Xcel who was supposedly recruiting CS majors for what I thought was their company (at least according to the career fair site they were). 

I went over to the booth and the woman introduced herself and was nice enough. However, when I inquired about possible internships at their company she just pointed towards a large sign with some companies names on it, and told me they could help me find an internship with them. 

I asked if **they** had internships at their company and once again I was told that they could help me find an internship at a company on the sign. The woman showed me the site which was like a modified LinkedIn. She then asked me to put my info in and they would look at my resume, so I did. She then gave me an envelope and I left.

I went back to my car and opened the envelope to find a sort of ""congratulations for joining our site"" letter. Overall, it seemed like they were giving everyone a false impression that you could intern with them, but instead were just using your information to boost the companies registration numbers.

Did anyone else have the same experience? Or am I completely wrong and this is legit? Just thought it was weird compared to the way other companies who actually wanted interns were acting."

My original intention was to go to university right away at one of my local state universities and major in computer science. However I want to be a Marine for four years first and would enter as a communications MOS (I got a 98 AFQT and 126 GT so I'd likely be a data network specialist, but not guaranteed). 

Since housing, food, and medical in the Marines is free I was planning on saving the majority of my salary (80%ish) to have a bunch of money upon finishing that could start accruing gains toward retirement/in general early on and while attending university later. I'd then go to university on the GI Bill meaning free tuition, money for books, and money equal to about what you'd get in housing/food allowance if you were stationed as a Marine in the place you're attending school. This would mean I'd obviously be able to save even more money while in university since I could still do jobs/paid internships, etc. and even get scholarships/pell grants still on top of it. I value financial independence so having money saved building money would be nice. Especially since I'm hoping to have the ability to retire prior to 40, even if I choose to continue working on interesting stuff just because.

Not only this, but I'd be entering university just as I turn 23, meaning I'd have four years to get very built physically, have a bunch more life experience/travel (the 6 weeks of vacation a year would allow time to travel on my own too outside of just deployments/Marine Expeditionary Units, which is something I enjoy doing) under my belt, and obviously wouldn't be quite as tight financially. This would possibly not only help with life in general but could probably help with girls I'm thinking. I assume going to university from 23-26 wouldn't be too old if you're just a regular college student who can even take part in sports and various activities, etc. right?

Raspberry Pi,Jeffrey_Forbes,GiftIdeas,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/34if41/gift_for_16_year_old_hs_brother_raspberry_pi/,"So I'm going to be working 2 internships this summer, one in India, and then one in Arkansas (I'm a North Carolina native). My 16 year old brother will be spending the summer mostly alone, as both of our parents work full time. While I realize he will likely get into the same trouble I did at his age, I want to be as good of an influence as possible. One of my majors is computer science and he has over several occasions sat behind me to watch and asked questions while I code/process data/etc. He doesn't do particularly well in school, but I know with 100% certainty that he is actually very bright, just struggles with motivation and attention span like most 16 year olds that are asked to sit in class for 8 hours a day. I was debating getting him a Raspberry Pi shown here

The idea being that he would learn some cool techy stuff and have something to do besides smoke weed and play call of duty. If anyone has had any success giving someone this as gift please let me know. If he would be interested I would be happy to get it, but if not I'd rather find something else for the roughly 100$ that the start kit would cost.

I have a pretty decent understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript aswell as proficient knowledge of other non-web based programming languages particularly Java and C++. However I really don't know where to start. My experience in coding I would say is 'fair' I know the languages but there are some holes and I have not yet learned PHP or other SQL as well as having no experience in a business setting or such. I was wondering whether it is worth taking a class in professional web development or any online courses you could recommend before going into he field as well as where to start with web development as a career. Internships, apprenticeships and other things of the sorts. I prefer front end stuff and I am not asking for recommendations as of specific courses but they are always helpful. Honestly any help is appreciated and an optional question, did any of you go/not go to uni and if so did either party regret their decision.

34inc8,34,2015-05-01,I finally sent the correct complaint to the social worker's licensing board.,MommyDearestHoldout,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/34inc8/i_finally_sent_the_correct_complaint_to_the/,"Nmom., mommydearest &amp; Nboyfriend had set a move out date I cannot meet. Therefore I get another threatening email:

[email] am hoping this will give you some support and options.
Tomorrow is Thursday.
Mom

[/email]

Yesterday I found out the Nboyfriend calls Nmom. at work to 'counsel' her to push a singular objective. Then he calls back as soon as as Nmom. gets home to make sure he does as he told her to. 

This was the original post when Nmom. delivered the forged mental health referrals:

www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2sl1k2/yup_they_did_it_again_mommy_dearest_and_the/

Because Nmom. decided to force Nboyfriend's agenda as the only 'support' or 'option' she is willing to offer I filed a complaint.

Here is the body of the complaint:

[complaint]

Hi Social Worker Licensing Board person,

Its become imperative to move forward on this complaint.  

2014 thanksgiving I refused to join my mother for a family holiday get together weekend in North Wisconsin.  As payback she went to [unnamed social worker intern] social work intern at [unnamed HMO] clinic where I had never been a patient before, to request a referral for SSI advocacy.  Mother then waited until January of 2015 to hand me the referral and told me to sign the paper.  [named Nmom.] my mother is a 42 year RN and a clinic division manager at [named HMO]  [named Nmom ]also allowed me to stay in her home after I lost a housing court case and was evicted.  I am thankful for her caving in to let me live with her, but her reoccurring insistence that I work for specific jobs and live in a group home wears me down.  Literally for days afterwards I am traumatized by her bullying. 

There are two factors here that encourage me to file the complaint. [named Nmom ] my mother, has a Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde personality.   [named Nmom ] is highly manipulative and claims herself as a victim of my alleged mental illness then harass me for most of my adult life to find a group home to live in and get SSI.   

Secondly [named Nmom ] has carried on an adulterous affair with [unnamed Nboyfriend] for the last 23 years, he is 14 years her junior and has spent most of the last 23 years unemployed himself, battling not only alcohol addiction but addiction to narcotics with a lengthy yet expunged felony conviction record.  According to [unnamed Nboyfriend]  he feels unable to continue his adulterous relationship with [named Nmom ] unless I am hospitalized and committed as mentally ill. [unnamed Nboyfriend]  feels I will confront his wife and family over the affair.  Which isn't even the truth.  Its actually a reprieve that [named Nmom ] is dating and financially supporting [unnamed Nboyfriend] , because after 23 years it makes her look delusion and crazy for putting up with it.  People I have known for almost 30 years who very much was a supporter of my mother's insistence I spend the rest of my life under the state's direction now actually find her efforts to have me committed to be, well like her relationship with [unnamed Nboyfriend] , to be a delusion.

Needless to say I don't fit the legal criteria for civil commitment, and during a mediation session last July 2014 I brought the print outs from the Minnesota court website that outlines the requirements for civil commitment and handed copies to both [unnamed Nboyfriend] , [named Nmom ] . Instead now  [named Nmom ] sends me frequent emails and texts telling me my only option she is willing to support is hospitalization and SSI.   [unnamed Nboyfriend] grinds [named Nmom ] to make these demands as much as [named Nmom ] dogmatically harasses me about it. 

[named Nmom ] wants me out of her house now, not just out of her house but in psychiatric care and is willing to deceive and lie to accomplish that.  Partially to prove to acquaintances she was right about me all along, partially to prove to [unnamed Nboyfriend] that their adulterous 23 year relationship is safe. 

For the record I am interviewing and trying to find a job &amp; a place to live.  I just insist that  [named Nmom ] not know where I apply or interview for jobs nor where I work and live, because she will and has always told [unnamed Nboyfriend] everything I tell her.  After I accomplish moving out I will have to choose between structured contact or no contact.  If [named Nmom ] doesn't know for certain nor require proof where [unnamed Nboyfriend] lives and works, then  [named Nmom ] doesn't need to know where I live and work.  Unequivocally I am frightened and traumatized by [named Nmom ] s and [unnamed Nboyfriend] 's efforts to control where I work and where I live.  

I do have print outs from  health records of my complete medical records history, none of which is at creekside and none of which is for mental health services.  Naturally there is a very long text messaging history of [named Nmom ] harassing me before job interviews to get SSI and live in a group home. I can supply those text messages if you request them.  Plentiful email demands of a similar nature, its her main interest and prerogative in regards to me which is very stressful.
 
[/complaint]

The email evidence takes time to search through, a free email account, anything over a year takes a PC with huge RAM and a effing T3 data thorough put (meaning a near infinite internet connection). That I have to work on. The recorded audio of Nmom. chasing me around the house harassing me to commit myself is all over a collection of possibly 30 data DVDs.  Its that much stuff.  

I hope this complaint will cool Nmom. off for a bit so I can focus on the interviews I have lined up and get ready to move out.  Hopefully within 4 months of having this crazy witch and her paid companion out of my life I can have a solid chunk of text, email and audio evidence in case the licensing board takes this complaint seriously.

I am also considering filing a complaint with the nursing licensing board when I am out of the house.

I'm from NYC and only here temporarily for an internship, so I don't have a stand.. and I'd really rather have my chain adjusted before the 1700 mile trip back home soon. I know I can probably just go ahead and adjust the chain slack without a stand, but I figured I'd give this one last shot, particularly since I'd like to spin the wheel around a few times to make sure I'm actually finding the tightest spot to make the adjustment.

I'm specifically near the Clear Lake area, and would be willing to drop by sometime over the weekend and use the stand for half an hour or so. Beer/lunch can be on me, and I'd be happy to have a fellow rider to chat with. Thanks in advance!"

This was my first IT intern interview and I am proud to say I nailed it! 

I'd say the key thing here was confidence and preparation. Almost every post that I reviewed had an up most comment of confidence and just being plain friendly. In my internship I'll be working with the IT team helping them develop exciting new projects. However, I think the team was looking for someone with a friendly personality that will be easy to work with. By no means do I think I got the job because of my technical skills. But also experience as a help desk assistant did give me an advantage. 

Thus, I encourage anyone who is an IT major to try and get a help desk job within their school. It really stands out on your resume if you are looking for internships. 

Again, thanks to everyone on this subreddit. And keep the tips coming. But remember, personality is everything when interviewing. 

**Side note I forgot to mention that during my skype interview I had a firedrill! Yeah, I know!"
34iwej,0,2015-05-01,I am being really underpaid. How can I ask for a raise ?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34iwej/i_am_being_really_underpaid_how_can_i_ask_for_a/,"Hi guys, sorry for the long question.

Here is some background story to this: I am 22 years old, just graduated last year in Computer science in a not really famous university (I am not in the US). After graduated, I have stayed at home and being an indie game dev for about half a year with 3 released game on Google Play using Unity game engine. None of my games make money, so last month, I went out job searching, are a few companies, few tests and some interviews, I got hired by this company, let's call them company A.

First, please be noted that company A is not the only one who offer me a job, there are 2 other wanted to hire me as well but I choose company A in the end because it seems like the best deal.

As of now, I am currently working (still in trial) as Unity developer in their game department. The company is a Japanese owned company, but set in Vietnam with the current size of 120 employees. Only 4 people know how to use Unity. My salary is 8 millions in Vietnam dong, which is considered a fairly good salary for a freshman like me.

So, what's the problem ? Well, there is this guy, an internship at the company. He is one year older than me, in his last year at a more famous university than mine. He started the contract the same day as mine, and even though we have a secret salary policy, I managed to take a glanced at his contract, and saw that his ""intern"" salary was way larger than mine, 10 millions in Vietnam dong. It is NOT technically 10 millions in the paper, it is actually 56 thousands per hour, in which, if I do the math, lead to 10 millions. He doesn't come to work everyday, only 3 to 4 days on a 5 days week, so his salary should be around 7 or 8 millions, but still, if he works as much as I do, he will have that much salary.

Now, normally, I would be fine with the salary like currently, but now, knowing this intern makes way more than I do, I want to get the strike on him. If the company is able to pay that much to this intern guy, this makes no sense to pay me that little.

As of now, I have only been working there for 2 weeks. My trial contract ends in June 20th. If things go well, I will have a one year contract with them after that. I think I will negotiate the salary with them there. But I don't know how. I mean, a small jump from 8 to 9 is OK, I guess, but a jump from current 8 to 12 (my intended salary) seem too big and will most likely to make my lose my job. What should I do ? 

Here is some information about me, the company and the guys.

The company is Japanese owned, mostly do out-source job for Japanese companies and the mother company in Japan. The company was found 1.5 years ago and beside outsourcing jobs, I don't think they have ever released a game on their own name. The company currently has 120 employees, but they plan to expand it to 400. They have the biggest (and most expensive) office compare to all the company I have gone to before, and they treat their employee really nice.

The intern guy. He is one year older than mine, is currently in his last year of a 5 years undergraduate program in the most famous university in this country in Computer Science. He also has a national prize in a quite famous competition so he is pretty good I think. His works here. Currently, he is doing a mobile chat application, just working on the core, where if multiple users are connected to the same wifi network, they can discover each other and send messages to each other.

About me and the works. Well, as off now, I am assigned to to a game for a Japanese client. Just me, since the client asks the game to be made using Unity engine, and all the other unity guys are busy doing other projects. Still, I already impressed my project manager in my art skill (they only have 2 artists here and both are really busy), and I am already under his term, creating a game for the company. I can do music as well.

That's about it. The company, myself and the other guys.

What you guys think should I do ? I really like the company, because of their office, their attitude towards employees, but at the same time, I can not stand working really underpaid like that.

So, what should should I go. All advice and comments are welcome. 

Thanks"

Help!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34jixa/capstone_client_asked_for_salary_requirements_help/,"So I'm finishing up my Associate's in CSIT this semester and have been working w/ a team on a capstone project.

I've been considering asking somewhere between 35k-40k, but I'm not sure if that's too low.

34jjks,5,2015-05-01,Tired every day after switching to new sleep schedule,[deleted],sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/34jjks/tired_every_day_after_switching_to_new_sleep/,"Hi all,

I'm having a lot of problems adjusting to a new sleeping schedule and I could really use some advice on how to attempt to fix this. hopefully this post isn't really long but there's a lot of details that led up to where I am now.

A little bit about my situation: I'm 25 years old and currently a computer engineering student (went back to school at 22 after taking a few years off) and I'm working a part time software development internship. I keep very busy during my week, as I work about 22 to 24 hours a week, I'm taking 14 hours of junior level engineering courses, and I workout for roughly an hour and a half 6 days a week.

I got my internship this semester, and I have to be at work at 8 am every morning which means I have to wake up at around 7 to 715 every day. last semester I wasn't working, and my earliest responsibility was at around 945 on campus, so I typically slept from about 1230 to 845 or 9. on my new schedule, I'm always either asleep or laying in bed trying to sleep by 1045 at the latest, and I very consistently get more than 8 hours of sleep every night aside from probably 1 night every 2 weeks.

I started this new schedule last January and it has been extremely rough. I figured at first I wasn't used to it and it would take a couple weeks to shift my body clock back a few hours, but it's been close to 4 months and I basically feel extremely tired all day and it causes me to have almost daily headaches. 

I would also like to add that I've had trouble with sleep and headaches my entire life. I'm currently taking a prescription medicine called ""amitriptyline"" every night, along with melatonin, that helps me sleep. I've been to literally dozens of doctors throughout my life trying to figure out how I can get my sleeping problem under control, and the only condition that I've been told I have is ""chronic insomnia"". to put it in perspective, without amitriptyline, if I try to go to sleep I will lay in bed for around 5 to 7 hours before actually falling asleep. I've had everything from sleep studies to MRIs done and no one seems to be able to give me a solid diagnosis or solution. I do also want to point out that I typically read for atleast 30 minutes directly prior to trying to sleep, partly because it relaxes me and partly because I enjoy it, so I am not often looking at a tv or computer screen before I sleep.

prior to starting this semester my daily fatigue and infrequent headaches were a very minor issue, but ever since I started my early morning routine it's becoming a huge issue, to the point where it is affecting my ability to function towards the end of the day. after the amount of doctors I have visited over the years I really feel like I'm slamming my head against a wall and getting no where.

any advice or suggestions would help tremendously because I'm tired of living off advil and feeling tired every day."
34jjog,2,2015-05-01,Am I being paid legally?,Klatelbat,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34jjog/am_i_being_paid_legally/,"So, for a little over a year now I have been working with my father. He schedules all of my hours for me, which helps a lot as I do a lot of stuff for college and often have to ask for time off. For the first 9 months everything functioned perfectly fine, but then my dad had nothing for me to do, and kept saying ""Don't come in today, I have nothing for you to do"". However, their company's policy (at least i think it's a policy) is that if you are scheduled and are asked not to come in, you will get paid regardless. At first it was like maybe twice a month where I wouldn't work and I would still get paid. Now, it's really bad. I have worked twice in the past 2 months, and yet have still been paid as if I worked every single hour that was scheduled for me. 

Now I know my dad is just looking out for me in this, as he wants to ensure I still have income, especially right now when I have payments on a loan to make and am doing 2 unpaid internships 50 miles away, so I need to have as flexible a schedule as possible. However, I feel weird. It doesn't feel right to me to not work and get paid for it. But, even more than that, I don't even know if what we are doing is even legal. He doesn't own the company, it's given it's funding from the state, so that makes me feel as if he's stealing money from the state, or I am stealing money from the state even.

I don't want to get into any legal trouble, and if it comes down to it I will leave there to get another job. The only issue is flexibility. If I could find a job that was equally as flexible as the one I am working now, I would take it, but it's not easy."

One is at a fast food company doing some work with databases using their own software and potentially other small development projects. This really interests me since its dealing with databases and I just took a course in database but I am not sure how much actual development I will be doing. Also they told me if I didn't take the internship, they won't have it this summer which suggests its not that big of a role. Plus the pay is only $10 per hour.

On the otherhand I got an offer from a major Insurance company for a Engineering Internship but the actual job is more on the IT side related with infrastructure and Business solutions for the company. The pay is great $23 per hour and at a big company I'll have alot of opportunities and experiences but just doesn't seem to apply much to my current studies.

Can you guys offer me some help?

34jmk6,41,2015-05-01,Does being overcompensated make it difficult to move on with other opportunities?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34jmk6/does_being_overcompensated_make_it_difficult_to/,"Sorry for the wall of text :flushed:

I'm a recent grad with a BS in CS. Received an offer for $110,000/yr in SF. A few months later in January, key senior engineers left after their retention bonuses were up (company previously acquired).

As a result, I got bumped up to $150,000/yr. I've enjoyed the autonomy and making money, but I'm ready to move on after a year. 

I don't agree with the direction the eng org is heading. I feel like I have SO much to learn, and my biggest fear is to plateau. Isn't there a phrase that says, ""if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room""?

Anyways, I've been talking to serious tech companies now. Most are willing to bring me in around $125,000/yr and up. Sign on bonuses, equity, etc. are all factors, but base is clearly the most important. This seems much more reasonable considering my experience: 1 yr full-time, 1 internship, BS in CS, and 2 projects in production (plus github contribs).

I think it speaks volumes of my current employer that I'm willing to leave for $135,000-$140,000. I'm really curious to hear how others have handled similar situations? Did you sell yourself out for the paycheck or opt for long-term happiness instead? I think I care more about working at a SaaS provider with really smart people that can challenge me.

Also, I think it goes without saying that I'm clearly grateful for my position given that some recent grads aren't so fortunate. Not sure if anyone made it this far down the wall of text, but please feel free to leave your thoughts. Thanks!

This summer will be my second summer internship at one particular major international car manufacturer, and my SO's first summer with the same company. Currently, I expect both of us to be working for that company upon graduation, with an estimated annual gross income of $100,000 between the two of us.
For some time now we have planned on buying a house immediately out of school that was well below our ""means"". We would put 30% of our monthly income (after taxes) towards the house, regardless of the minimum payment. After the house was paid off, we buy another to do the same thing, and begin renting out the previous house. The plan was to continually do this over time, leaving behind a trail of rental properties. 

However, there are many others that advocate not paying mortgages off early, or not becoming a landlord. Originally I had even planned on using a property management company to handle the rentals, but I have heard they are often too expensive to be viable. So I just want to hear from others whether they think our original plan is a good one, or whether I would be better off with a different goal. The main topics I hope to get assistance with are:

1. Is buying a house ""below your means"" or ""at your means"" a better idea, and how should one determine what is properly ""below"" or ""at"" their means. ?

2. Is acquiring rental property starting at a young age a good idea, and is using property management companies a good idea?

3. Finally, is it better to rush paying a mortgage off, or only make the minimum monthly payments as to not tie up as much capital?

My hopes are that this discussion will show me whether or not my original plan is worth sticking to, as well as help others in answering some of these important questions. Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

34k4vi,1,2015-05-01,Should I be concerned that they only extended a verbal offer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34k4vi/should_i_be_concerned_that_they_only_extended_a/,"Hi all,

I'm currently a sophomore in college, CS major. I interned at a fairly prestigious software company last summer. A few months after I got back to college, I got an offer for a summer internship from a company out in California for the upcoming summer, which I wasn't too sure about. I had until May 1st to decide whether I would be taking the offer or not, and I also started interviewing at other places.

I applied back at the company I interned at last summer, for a different position. Unfortunately, I totally bombed my interview and got a rejection pretty quickly after.

A few weeks ago, I got an email from my manager (at the same company) saying they wanted me back as an intern (in the same department I interned in last summer). I was really excited because I would absolutely love to go back, so I confirmed saying I'd be interested in going back, but that I had the decision deadline coming up really quickly.

I was supposed to have a written offer for my return internship by early this week, but they never sent it. I called my manager yesterday because I needed a written offer before I turned down the other places, and he said I would have an offer by the end of the day yesterday, which never happened. I got a verbal offer from my manager today, and he said the letter would be sent by the end of the day, or I should contact him.

End of the day is here, no offer letter, contacted my manager (no word from his end), and I have to say something to the other companies. If I turn them down and my return offer never comes, I'm screwed for the summer.

What do I do and how worried should I be?"
34k8rz,2,2015-05-01,Tough decisions,danksinatrasmkr,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/34k8rz/tough_decisions/,So I'm 18 and starting college during the fall semester of 2015. My parents hate each other and are splitting up. My mom wants to move to Charlotte which is four hours away from where I've lived my whole life. I want to stay with my dad and work at a summer computer programming internship but my mom is completely against me staying with him. Hes a great guy and theres no reason for her to feel that way. I also don't have any other close family members who I could stay with. Who should I stay with? What would you guys do? Neither are bad people but they are opposites. Dads laidback and moms pretty controlling. Also I would almost certainly have to make my mom hate me if I wanted to stay. I dont really like confrontations. Help!
34kcgw,0,2015-05-01,What I learned from pressing charges against my father - some wisdom I can share with you all.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/34kcgw/what_i_learned_from_pressing_charges_against_my/,"Hey guys. I posted this in r/PTSD, but I was re-reading it and thought it would DEFINITELY help some of the people I've talked to in here as well, so I decided to cross post it. I know a lot of you are struggling really hard (I'm still getting there, too) but I wanted to share a victory with you all, because it isn't just my victory, it's yours, too.

On Monday, I got the call from the DA that my father had finally agreed to plead guilty and take the deal for 30 years. I decided to press charges back in 2011. In the summer of 2012, my father was arrested as a result of a recorded phone call I was able to get without his knowledge. I got him to admit to what happened, how many times each act happened, how old I was, etc. He threw in lies with the truth the entire way through, vastly underestimated the number of times on things, made it all about him, and gave me a list of excuses for why he did it ranging from ""I was molested by a priest when I was a kid,"" to ""I wanted to be the first one to love you.""

In February of 2013, my mother and I had to go to the preliminary hearing and face my father, because he had pleaded not guilty and was going to drag us through court despite ALL the overwhelming evidence, as I had more than just the tape. I had to get on the witness stand and recount everything, things my mother didn't know. It was fucking awful. After that, I was told the next step was the actual trial and it would take a year or two because of schedules having to be synced, evidence gathered, statements prepared, etc. Well 2 years passed and with every month, I got sicker and sicker and sicker. I felt pounds added to me every day (both literally and figuratively), lost jobs because I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. Finally in September of 2014, I lost my job and I was finally hospitalized after cutting myself up pretty badly. I put every guy I was with through the fucking meat grinder with my panic attacks, the depression, the nightmares, the flashbacks, the sudden mood swings, the emotional issues, the insecurity, the attachment issues, the fear of abandonment. It was destroying and eating every part of me and my life and everyone I loved. And I was unemployed until 3 weeks ago, so I had nothing to do but sit around and think about it.

I was so sure he was going to be the sadistic animal he had always been and make me go back up on that witness stand and do it all over again, except in front of more people. The DA told me that a lot of times, the defense in these kind of cases will just keep pushing and pushing and pushing the date in hopes that the victim will succumb to the pressure and drop the charges. She said she suspected that was why it was being dragged on forever. Every month a new subpoena came in the mail with a new date and every month it just got pushed. I felt like I couldn't do it anymore.

And then I got the call on Monday. I don't ever have to see him again. It's over. I have closure. And what's more, it's not that he plead not guilty and I won, I feel like for the first time in my life, I have a real father. I have never been angry, only heartbroken. When I think of this man, I think of building sand castles on the beach and dancing to Kenny Chesney until I fell asleep first, not the abuse. I was daddy's girl, and I WANTED to be daddy's girl, so so so fucking much. I worshipped the ground he walked on. Sure, he may be taking the deal in hopes that he'll still be alive in 30 years to get out, but he's also inadvertently doing something else for me in the process: admitting his guilt to the world and not making me go through this anymore. In a way, he's taking care of his daughter, letting me have closure, and accepting the consequences of betraying me and hurting me all the way to my bones and soul. I still love him. I don't wish him pain, thinking of him being raped in prison or all those other horror stories you hear about happening to pedophiles makes me want to break down and cry. But he worked hard to be where he is.

Now that I've had a few days to process and reflect, I've been able to start forming a hindsight. I posted something about my victory on Monday in r/AdviceAnimals and it blew up. Suddenly, I got about a dozen messages in my inbox from people from all walks of life all asking for advice, for help, for an ear. One boy whose girlfriend had been abused asked me how he could take care of her. Another boy had been abused himself and asked how I had coped all that time. Another boy was abused, but didn't speak out, and then his attacker, his father, also abused his brother, it all came out, and now they're pressing charges - but he asked me how I dealt with the terrible guilt I felt for pressing charges against someone I love. Another girl had a perfect opportunity very similar to mine where she might be able to get a recorded conversation. Another man confessed to me he had had awful sexist views from growing up in a country that is extremely oppressive to women, but had come to see the error of his ways and wanted to apologize to me for ignorant men who might have offended me with their intolerant, uneducated views and what he could do to help other women and make up for it.

And I had a good answer for ALL of them. They all thanked me, that what I said was exactly what they needed to hear. I have never been so fucking happy in all my life. I feel like I'm flying. What made me infinitely happier than it finally being over was being able to answer difficult questions that nobody could answer for me while I was in my darkest days. I felt so fucking alone. I realized I have real wisdom, real experience to help others like me. Yes, I'm still recovering, I'm not suddenly ""cured"" of my PTSD/depression issues now that the legal process is over, but I know enough now that I think I can give insight into very complex feelings and issues. So I wanted to share a few EXTREMELY important things that in hindsight were things that got me through all this insanity and pain and bullshit and losing family. I hope maybe my experience can help at least one of you.

1) Find something you love doing and do it just to express yourself. I don't care if that's music, writing, gardening, judo, yoga, hell, even video games. Just something that is just for you. Something you're passionate about. I found that when I just sat around, lethargic and depressed doing nothing but smoking pot and binge watching shit on Netflix, I was so overwhelming to other people because I needed social interaction and support so badly. All of this negative energy was just building and building, and if you know anything about science and physics, energy has to go somewhere. I realize now where it needed to go - just out. Out of my body, out of my head. I love writing, singing, and dancing. A couple months ago, I just started to make myself write again. And the more I wrote, the happier I became. I spent 9 hours one day just working on a screenplay. And I felt like someone was flushing some of the toxins out of my body while doing so. I wasn't writing about any of the trauma, I was writing a romance. Extremely good decision. If you're having a bad day and just don't feel like it, don't beat yourself up. Tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow. Tell yourself you'll do it for 5 minutes. Watch how fast you get sucked into whatever it is.

2) Get a pet. Any pet. Literally. A snake, a ferret, a chicken, a dog, a cat, anything. In the summer of 2010, I was so sick, so miserable and near suicidal. Then a friend from work had a death in the family and needed to leave the country very suddenly, but her cat had just given birth to kittens and they had one left they needed to find a home for, so she asked me for help. Obviously I said yes because I'm a sucker and arranged a home for the kitten. On the day she brought her over to my place, she showed up instead with TWO kittens. Apparently, one of the people who had adopted a kitten had to bring it back suddenly that day because their dog was trying to attack her, so could I please find a home for her too? I'm thinking, ugh, great. I've always been a dog person, my family bred and trained rottweilers growing up. Kitties are adorable, but I would've never in a million years have gotten myself a cat.

Then she lifted up the carrier and I locked eyes with the poor kitten who had been returned and that was it. I had never seen a tortoise shelled colored cat, let alone with brilliant green eyes like that. I told her I had already found her a home. Maybe it was partly the state of mind I was in, maybe I was lonely (I was in a strange city for an internship), but something about this cat fucking healed me. I named her Maggie like I already knew her name and she became my fucking hero. Having something depend on you like that, needing you gives you motivation to get up and go to work, because you need money to feed her. You love it so much and she enriches your life. You get home from work feeling like you want to die, and then here comes a kitten running at me, mewing, crying for mommy, missing me. There is nothing more pure than an animal's love. I can't hurt myself, kill myself, what would happen to her? She depends on me. She loves me. When I cry, she'll hang out next to me or my chest. I've read some articles online about how petting cats specifically help reduce stress. I got her registered as an emotional support animal with the help of my psychiatrist so I can live anywhere with her, even apartment complexes that don't allow pets.

A pet can't and would never abandon you. An animal that loves you is forever. Last summer, my serious boyfriend just up and broke up with me after a year of living together and then MOVED across the country back to his parents' house, leaving me with an apartment I couldn't afford. (Part of why the hospital stay ended up happening, the scumbag....ugh) so 4 years later, she got a kitty brother named Oberyn right before I was hospitalized. Maggie was happier to have a friend and I was happier to have a new family member and a MAN WHO WOULDN'T ABANDON ME. (lol) But seriously, he became my second hero. He's the only man I need. It's funny, I have different relationships with both of them. I never used to think cats had real personalities besides somewhere between cool-ish to awful, but my cats are both SO different, and each heal me in different ways. Maggie is my princess, she's soooo loving and social to every person who walks through the door, she likes to climb everywhere, but is very independent. She's my baby. But Oberyn is my little man. He is SUCH a mama's boy, my roommates tell me he does nothing but sit in my closet and cry when I'm gone. He doesn't come out and socialize with them unless I'm there. He's a sweetheart to them, loves to play, chases the laser pointer like he's on crack, he's hilarious. Maggie has her own bed and sleeps on her own, but my little man wakes up next to me every morning, every nap, every time I'm sitting watching TV. He's just glued to me. And having his love and such ardent affection from this animal has gotten me through my 7 months of unemployment, recovering after the hospital, and just in general made life better. When they both start to fight/play, it cheers me up just to watch them be silly. They make me smile when I otherwise would never have even shown my teeth that day. And I will always be grateful.

3) Don't jump into a relationship because it feels good to not be alone, for someone to love you, to take care of you, and if you do, don't let them be your entire support system. It's too much for one person to carry, the weight of the knowledge of what happened to me has weighed on every man that has loved me. They all want to ""fix"" me only to find that only I can truly fix myself. And while we're on that word - ""fixed"" implies you're broken. You're not broken. You're out of order. You need maintenance. Your friends, your family, your boyfriend/girlfriend, loved ones HAVE to be a support system for you, but ultimately, you will never be happy in any relationship unless you're happy by yourself first.

4) Help others. While it's true that in order to take care of others, you have to take care of yourself first - I call it the oxygen mask rule - being there for someone else, helping someone in their time of need will make you feel self-worth and realize you matter, you're loved, and you're needed. Just because you have depression/bi-polar/PTSD, what have you, does not mean you are unable to be someone else's rock sometimes too. In fact, the exact opposite. We have thicker skins than a lot of people. We're sometimes desensitized to it all, numb, and we forget that there are normal, every day problems. Listen to your friend vent about her boyfriend. Cook a meal for yourself and a friend who's been having a bad day. Make cookies for someone. Listen. Once you start to learn what makes others happy and how to take care of them, you'll start to learn what YOU need, too. People give love the way they want to receive love - if you need words, more often than not, you'll be telling your lover wordy, long-winded speeches about why they're wonderful. If you're less of a talker and need actions, hugs, then you'll try to comfort others by hugging them, by doing something for them. And however you feel is the best way to take care of someone is often the best way to also take care of yourself.

I'm sorry if this is long and rambly, but I had a lot to say. I love you all. Stay strong, be positive, remember to smile, get outside and get some fresh air, smell the spring air. Learn to enjoy the tiny little things that make a day go from average to lovely.

Im an intern for a very small power electronics company. We design and build power inverters (on the scale of 500KW-1.5MW). We've been looking to implement a PLM tool to organize and manage all of our design data. Ive been lurking for a bit and noticed many aren't too fond of PTC Winchill, but we need something that can integrate well with ProEngineer and Altium.  Our main hope is to find a Cloud based PLM or something of the SaaS (software as a service) type with solid integration for ProE and Altium, so we wont need to go through the costly process of setting up servers and hiring someone to manage it. 

The cloud PLM systems we have been considering are: PTC PLM Cloud, Arena PLM, and Autodesk PLM 360. 

I would say that PTC PLM cloud would be the clear front runner due to the sure integration with ProE, but Im having second thoughts when hearing of what a pain PTC windchill can be. Especially when we don't have a dedicated PLM manager. 

Arena PLM seems to integrate with Altium, but we worry about ProE. 

Does anyone have any experience using or implementing Cloud based PLM? 

I appreciate any help you all can give me :)"

Little about me: I go to UWaterloo and have 3 internships under my belt (IT, Java Dev, QA). I would ultimately like to be a software engineer in the bay area.


My goal is to get an internship at a top SV company (FB, MS, AMZN, GOOGLE, DB, Uber, etc) for my 6th and 7th coop. 


What path should I choose to make myself more marketable to top tier Bay area companies.


I know their are other top notch companies not in SV, but getting to work there is a personal goal of mine and would like to achieve just that.

34lphg,209,2015-05-02,I [19F] am getting scared of my neighbour [25?M] but he is my landlady's son...what to do?,aFunnyWorldWeLiveIn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34lphg/i_19f_am_getting_scared_of_my_neighbour_25m_but/,"Hi /r/relationships, thanks in advance for your help and apologies for any typos.


So I'm a 19 years old female and moved into a small bedsit last September when I moved to a foreign country for an internship. The bedsit is one of two on the last floor of a house which my landlady owns, and she explained to me when I moved in that her son lived in the other bedsit, and was very nice and quiet.


I realised soon enough we probably wouldn't be the best of friends but did my best to be friendly. Not sure if this is relevant but the reasons that I do not really like him are that in the first conversation we had I felt that he crossed several boundaries and had some ""pick up artist"" manners that weren't really my cup of tea. For example commenting my outfits saying what I should change about them, hinting about his girlfriends and one night stands, and talking derisively/patronisingly about his mom (my landlady). 





I figured it didn't matter since we just needed to coexist, not be friends. But he is very extraverted/friendly and was always making conversation or inviting me in his place to share dinner (no thanks) and sometimes when I unlock my door I could hear him rush to his own door to get out and then we would be making conversation while walking down the five floors of the house



It only bothered me minimally, and altough I humorously complained to my colleagues about the cloud of cheap cologne that he is surrounded by at all times or the fact that he blamed me in front of his mom for the overconsumption of internet (when I'm pretty sure it's due to his porn consumption or something), I figured it was not a problem. I mean fair enough, I am more introverted and he wants to make conversation, why not and I just have to kinda avoid him.




But lately some strange things have happened.



1) Yesterday morning, i get out of my apartment, hear him rush to the door, prepare myself for small talk...and then he kinda walks past me without saying anything. I know this makes me sound self-important but I assure you this is very unusual for him.


2) This morning, I heard repeated shouting and at first thought it was the old lady downstairs but it was actually him, shouting and imitating my voice. I did not understand everything that he said but some of it was saying ""Hello I am OP and I sing in the shower with my stupid fucking voice"" and other thhings like that. He was shouting for like 10-20 minutes and I did not catch everything he was saying.




So my question is, bearing in mind he is my landlady's son and the apple of her eyes (superspoiled, doesn't pay rent, she comes sometimes to clean his studio etc.) what should I do?



I am thinking I should text him that I am sorry about being loud in the shower, that I didn't realise I could be heard through the wall and to text me if I was making too much noise in the future. But if another part of his monologue was super rude or new information that I didn't hear it might not be such a good idea. Like if he was insulting me the rest of the time and I just lay there it is a bit of a bad idea no? There was also a girl over at his place last night so maybe I misheard and he was just trying to amuse her? 


What should I do?
   
**tl;dr**: Neighbour was shouting at me (I think) through the wall for 10-20 minutes this morning, didn't catch everything but some of it was about my singing in the shower - should I ignore it or text him apologies for the noise? Also his mom is my landlady so if he creates a hostile living environment I can't do anything about it.


EDIT: Fixed formatting from my computer.



EDIT **My mom thinks she should call the landlady/mom of the guy but I think it's a terrible idea.... HELP**"

34lwnm,2,2015-05-02,I [21/M] am still having this post break-up voice telling me I shouldn't have let her go [21/F]. Please help with some perspective guys.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/34lwnm/i_21m_am_still_having_this_post_breakup_voice/,"Hi guys, 

I met my ex last summer at an internship we were both doing and we hit it off near the end of our time at the firm. And we really hit it off. We got chatting properly for the first time (there were near a hundred interns in total) at a night out for the interns and got to know each other a bit. From the day after, and till the last day of the job we were passionately involved with each other. We were controlled and mature, so no-one at work had a clue, but in our spare time we realised more and more just how well we clicked, and how quickly we enjoyed each others company so much. 

I'll just add that actually she had had a boyfriend for the previous 3 years, and as it was her first and now long-distance relationship, they had gotten fairly cold over the past year. She meets me and realises it was time to finally end it. She leaves back home a day after the end of the internship for a couple weeks to see family, sorts out her stuff with the guy (who I was very sympathetic to) and comes back to uni over here. I pick her up from the airport, we start our relationship fully, with the freedom of our last year at university - no longer working 8-6 everyday. It sounds cold and it affected both of us, but we felt very strongly for each other. 

Fast-forward 7 months and we are everything to each other. Despite being at different universities, we've integrated our friend groups, got to meet with each other often, and even got to travel abroad a few times in just a few months. She met some of my family and I hers. 

But after 6 months or so, she starts getting distant and I feel her being a bit colder. We are both having to study more and there was the stress of job-searching so we couldn't see each other as often. She stopped the lovey-dovey texts and I didn't. She stopped calling me at random times in the day to say hi, and I didn't. I was also getting her a lot of smaller gifts whenever I saw her just to show her affection, and I was the one now making all the effort to see her - travelling from outside of the city to her uni. She would say that she was just past the initial head-over-heels in love stage and that this was how she was... She had been called cold by even her family at times and she would explain this was just who she was. 

I still can't reconcile the thoughts in my head of whether she was truly that (cold/relaxed/unaffected/comfortable/apathetic) or whether I had turned her off by being so involved and perhaps needy. I just wanted to show her my love, but I guess even deep in to a relationship, you need to keep up some kind of excitement. Maybe the energy was gone from my side. Or perhaps that transition for her was normal, even though it seemed to switch quickly. The change from passion and lust to relaxed and homely. I still don't know, although knowing her to be such an honest and open person, I would have expected her to express some lack of excitement in the relationship if it was the case. But I don't know women that well I guess and this has been hard to read in her - maybe shes afraid to say something like that. 

We went travelling about 6 weeks ago for Easter with some friends, and as had been usual, I just wasn't getting the attention I would expect from my girlfriend. She wouldn't hug me as much as we walked around the city, or playfully kiss me or talk excitedly with me. I either turned her off, or I was seeing the true, relaxed her. We land back in our country, and I take her out to dinner and tell her we should break up. I feel awful and can hardly contain my tears. She tells me she expected it and doesn't show much emotion...

We see each other a couple times after as I had gotten us ballet tickets and her friend had a bday party. They go well and we even kiss several times when at the ballet, saying it would just feel weird not to. Such kids. 

Anyway its been a few weeks since we've seen each other, and I gave her a quick call a few days ago to wish her well in the exams. At this point I feel I am over her and genuinely wanted to wish luck to one of the best friends I've ever had. She starts texting me after and now we're back to talking. I would say it were a bad thing, but honestly we were very well matched for each other. I have been with a few girls since breaking up and I could have started flings with a couple more, but I very honestly can't see any of them being on her level. I'm not talking about great ass and tits or ""knows how to party""; but she was truly everything I would want in a woman, with the one downside of her being more cold and impartial to affection / unable to show love. Noone can be perfect. But being such a perfectionist/probably FOMO kind of guy, I jumped straight to breaking up. I need to live with my actions, but this voice won't go away - and to be honest, I find myself often secretly wishing she feels the same. She was too stubborn to explain herself when we broke up, and I was too stubborn and emotional to love her as she should have been loved so I'm not sure either of us will every say anything... 

The main preocupation from her side was: ""Ive had a boyfriend for 4 years, and we said so much to each other - that we would live and die together etc. Then that dies down and I meet you. I allowed myself to express the same to you for so long because I truly felt it for you, but recently something has switched. I now know feelings can change, Love may not be true, and that it would be irresponsible to continue getting deeper with you right now."" She wanted to protect herself. She's a strong girl. I wish I learnt to love her as she wanted to be loved. But it's all so fucking hard. If we weren't so young I would have been mature enough to keep this girl and make her my life partner. That one feeling is really hurting me and I would like advice. 

Anyway this has turned more in to a /r/offmychest kind of post - but if anyone has been through this and can steer my thoughts in a positive way, please comment. By the way, I'd rather not hear about lust or young love or stupid love as I think we are both  straightforward and strong enough people to avoid starting such a relationship...but interpret this as you will. I am biased anyway...

TL;DR - Read the last couple paragraphs.

34m1at,4,2015-05-02,I'm considering reneging on a Big 4 internship offer in favor of continuing with the company I'm currently with. Am I making a huge mistake?,purplemudkip,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34m1at/im_considering_reneging_on_a_big_4_internship/,"I started working for my current company in February as an intern. I've really, really enjoyed my time here. I love my team. The mentorship is wonderful. The office environment is top notch. I couldn't ask for a better experience.

I signed an offer for the summer with a Big 4 almost a year ago now (early bird, I know). They just got back with our team placements last week, and I was severely disappointed. I filled out the survey in great detail, but the team I was assigned to wasn't even in my top *half* of my team rankings. The project is, honestly, laughable. (As in, I actually lol'd when I read the description.) It doesn't interest me at all, and I don't see much potential for learning or growth.

I talked to my recruiter about swapping teams. They said they'll let me move if I'm really unhappy, but they did seem reluctant. Internships are just so short - my guess is by the time I'm successfully switched, it'll be half over, and I'll end up with two half-assed experiences.

My current company is small but growing. There is so much potential for learning. I am treated like an equal, and I'm not being given work ""for the intern"". Another huge factor is that I can work on whatever team I want. I'm a frontend developer right now, but I could switch to data science! Or database stuff! Or other backend stuff that I don't have much experience in, but want to learn...

The opportunity to continue building rapport with one company I love, having the autonomy to do whatever the heck I want, and the slightly better pay and location make this seem like a great choice.

That being said, I don't want to burn a Big 4 bridge. I also think that having their name in my employment history will boost my resume (not that this is a huge concern, I've had no problem getting calls back for even fulltime positions, though I'm still in school).

Am I totally insane for declining a Big 4? The crappy project is a major turnoff for me.

Is it worth it to try to delay the internship, rather than outright rejecting it? If I do decline, will I have a shot at getting an opportunity there in the future? I'd imagine it will either be really positive (""Oh, we already hired this one before, let's hire!"") or really negative (""Reneging is rude, BLACKLIST!"").

Please ask any questions or give whatever feedback you can. I have to decide very soon and I'm starting to panic. What's the best option here?"

For the past year I have been busy applying to several universities (MIT, Stanford, Toronto, TUM Asia and Cornell) to follow their MSc program in Aerospace Engineering. I visited Hong Kong last summer and am really attracted to being abroad and the experience and friends you get from it. 

Unfortunately I was only accepted into TUM Asia in Singapore. The other option for me is to study at TU Delft in my own country. Studying in Singapore for 2 years would cost me around 52.000 euros (which I will need to lend), studying in The Netherlands would be around 15.000 euros. 
The universities are of similar quality, however the program courses of TU Delft are slightly more interesting to me. 

So here is the choice. I always thought I knew for sure I wanted to be abroad for 2 years, however now I have to make a choice things are getting a bit more complicated. I am afraid for leaving everything I have here behind. Going to Singapore, I would need to build everything up from scratch again and leave that behind again after 2 years. Moreover, in the past months I met a girl that now is my girlfriend, which I also would have to leave behind. 
If I would stay in my own country, I would still be able to study at an excellent university and go abroad via for example an internship or backpacking during holidays, however this would be a bit of a different experience from really living somewhere else for 2 years.
What would you choose?

It's hard to know whether to criticize Nicholas Sparks or admire him. The author has found what works, and he doesn't deviate from it. His stories are all largely the same, with only the specific details changed from one to the next. They all involve star-crossed lovers facing some kind of obstacle (illness, war, severe weather conditions, etc.) that impedes their romance. Someone usually dies at the end. This tearjerker formula has brought him untold success in the book world, and almost as much in the film world. The Longest Ride is the latest movie adapted from one of his works. Does it shake up the formula? Nope!

-------------

 Britt Robertson plays Sophia Danko, a college student in North Carolina. She's planning to move to New York City for a big internship in the art world that she hopes will jump start her career. Coerced by her sorority sisters, she attends a bull riding competition one night. It is here that she meets Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood), a champion rider. They start a flirtation, eventually falling madly in love with each other. One rainy night as they drive home from a date, they pass a car that has run off the road. Luke rescues the man inside, Ira Levinson (Alan Alda), while Sophia salvages the box of letters in his front seat. She shows up to the hospital every day to read Ira's letters, which recount his love affair with his late wife. Meanwhile, Luke wonders how he and Sophia will make their own relationship work, given that they come from such different worlds.

The Longest Ride is really two stories in one. The first story isn't too bad. It's about a college girl with cosmopolitan dreams who falls for a cowboy who doesn't want to leave the ranch. Robertson and Eastwood have nice chemistry together, and there are some interesting developments in the characters' romance. One of the best scenes finds Luke putting on a suit and tie to attend an upscale art exhibit, only to realize that he really doesn't fit into this scene. There's nothing earthshaking here, but it's a fairly sweet and compelling look at how, as one person puts it, love requires sacrifice.

The second story is the one that causes problems. It keeps intruding on the story of Sophia and Luke. Every time their tale really starts to generate steam, The Longest Ride switches over to flashbacks showing the history of young Ira (Jack Huston) and the life he shared with his beloved Ruth (Oona Chaplin). The film tries to draw certain parallels between Sophia/Luke and Ira/Ruth, but the latter story is presented merely as highlights (or lowlights) from their time together. For that reason, the bond between them never feels as authentic as the one taking place in present day. It's distractingly disjointed because it jumps around over the course of several years. So you have one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.

There are some pleasures to be found, for sure. All the performances are good, with Britt Robertson (Cake) once again proving herself a promising young actress. Eastwood, who looks like a younger version of his father Clint, is believable as a good ol' country boy, and Alan Alda classes everything up, as he always does. Although it's a bit of an inhumane sport, the scenes showing what it's like in the world of professional bull riding are fascinating, as well.

The Longest Ride has some quality stuff, but it also has that annoying second story that doesn't deliver much, outside of a laughably hard-to-swallow twist in the final ten minutes. There's enough going on in the tale of Sophia and Luke that we really don't need to hear about Ira and Ruth. Then again, Sparks knows his formula, and he's sticking to it, no matter what. 

 Writer Nicholas Sparks has already had nine of his novels make it to the big screen and his tenth book will also be viewed by millions in the romance drama, The Longest Ride. Former rodeo star, Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood) is trying to make a comeback in bull riding when he meets college art student, Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson). The two begin to fall in love but Sophia is just about to move to New York to complete her internship at an art museum and Luke’s life is all about bull riding. (I don’t know what Sophia looks like but she has to look better then a bull.) On the way home from one of their dates, Luke and Sophia come across a car crash with an old man named Ira Ledinson (Alan Alda) trapped in the car. There was a box of love letters in the backseat, so they put the box in their car and took the man to the hospital. After Ira is checked into the hospital, Sophia begins to read the love letters to him while the audience sees the whole story about love and sacrifice in flashbacks. In the meantime, Luke is hurt again while bull riding and he has to decide if he is going to quit for good while Sophia has to make a decision if she wants to go to New York and never see Luke again. This film may be Nicholas Sparks’s best movie since his blockbuster, The Notebook. Surprisingly, the addition of Alan Alda to the cast really added a spark, a lot of heart and made it an even better film. Scott Eastwood is fantastic in a romantic role and I have to admit I was waiting to see if he would borrow the notorious one-liner from his dad, Clint Eastwood, “Do you feel lucky?” (He could have easily used it as a pick-up line.) Of course, this movie wouldn’t work if it weren’t for the chemistry between Eastwood and Robertson. The parallel love stories from different times brought depth to the story and reminded me of The Notebook. Yes, it’s predictable, but that doesn’t take anything from the film. There were some small surprises – okay, very, very small. The ladies will love this film and even the guys might enjoy It and I’m giving it a B+ rating.

Now what?",someexpatoranotherin,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/34m8wm/started_freelance_work_for_consulting_company_in/,"As a disclaimer this is a throwaway for what should be obvious reasons.

I am a US citizen living in DE for the next two years or so doing my graduate degree. I was hired as a freelancer by a consulting company for work that requires a native English speaker.

I found out when looking at starting an internship, that according to daad.de website students are not allowed to work as a freelancer/self employed, and risk deportation from the country.

The company I worked for knew I was a student, and offered me this work. They also have my tax number on the two invoices I sent them. They seem to be unaware (or ignoring and didnt tell me) that its illegal for me to work as a freelancing student.  
  
My impulse is to immediately tell the company I have been working for, and see if they can change the contract to be part time or werkstudent or something.   
  
I am curious if the fault lies entirely on me, or if a company can be penalized for hiring someone illegally? I am also wondering if its even legally possible or grey area at a minimum to anull the two old service contracts and make a new one for me to be ""part time"" or whatever. 

Anyone have any suggestions about how to go around this without getting screwed up the ass and potentially kicked out of the country (I assume getting kickd out of DE means I am super boned for entering a lot of countries including all EU countries, and I know others like new zeland and canada and stuff too will not let you in if you were ever deported, I travel a ton so this would be super fucked for me).

Thanks guys so much!

STARFISH! and other stuff you didn't know you should put on your face.",goosegoosegoosegoose,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/34mcea/may_2_2015_rasianbeauty_snails_starfish_and_other/,"#/r/AsianBeauty

**19,750** followers for **2 years!**

As I wrote this feature, I prepared myself for the collective sigh of disappointment from men across reddit. No gentleman, you won’t find thread after thread of Japanese Schoolgirls, exposed Geishas, or tentacles.  As mod SnowWhitePear says, “they scroll through pages of sheet masks, face serums, snails, and discussions of pH testing and they quickly lose interest.”

That’s right, I’m talking about /r/AsianBeauty, a subreddit dedicated to the seemingly endless lines of skin care and cosmetics that roll out of the Far East.  As the middle class has emerged in places like China, Japan and South Korea, cosmetics companies have experienced meteoric sales growth, leading to a battleground of competition. In the opinion of the /r/AsianBeauty mods, this has caused the quality and innovation to skyrocket, while driving the prices down. The folks at “AB”, as they affectionately call it, have created a great community that capitalizes on the seemingly endless variety of products and cult-like following of them. 

As you browse through AB, you see users rave about ingredients that might give you a bit of an ‘ick’ factor at first, not unlike browsing an Asian market for the first time and seeing the chicken feet, slabs of fish, and smelling the fermented vegetables. It can also have the same delicious outcome of trying something new, that you can’t even pronounce, then falling in love. The community at AB has a great sense of self-awareness, and are quick to poke fun about their “hype train”. http://i.imgur.com/yT2yP0f.jpg (image commissioned from AB user /u/skindy) 

I know what you’re thinking.. Snail mucus? Starfish goo? Snake oil? On my face?

At /r/AsianBeauty, it is an emphatic, “YES!”

After a different skin care subreddit plummeted from favor in the wake of reddit admins removing its mods for profiting, many users have found their home at /r/AsianBeauty. It is refreshingly devoid of judgment and pretension. I frequent many fashion and beauty subreddits, and it is often formulaic conversation and recommendation after another, (Who hasn’t seen a joke about MFA “uniform”) but AsianBeauty is different. They embrace the quirky and kawaii. I had an opportunity to chat with two of the mods from AB, /u/MissPicklesMeow and /u/SnowWhitePear about their love of saccharine cute packaging, zany ingredients, and their reputation for being so.damn.nice.


&gt;#Tell us a little about yourselves

&gt;&gt;**MissPicklesMeow:** Well, I'm from northern Canada (the real north) and studied Power Engineering and Natural Gas Processing 

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** I've been an Asian Beauty blogger since 2012; for the longest time there were not a lot of English-language blogs reviewing Asian cosmetics so it was a matter of Google Translate, finger-crossing on eBay, and trial and error. I had known about Reddit for a few years but I'd had a limited perception of it based off news coverage which was usually unflattering. Last year, someone recommended that I check out the /r/AsianBeauty subreddit as they were my kind of people, and they absolutely are. :) 

&gt;#Are you Asian?

&gt;&gt;**MissPicklesMeow:** I am not, of nordic background. 

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** /u/iamoshawott (another mod) is Asian, however. 


&gt;#What got you interested in Asian Beauty?

&gt;&gt;**MissPicklesMeow:** I got into Asian products while searching for a sunscreen that didn't make me look like a shining star 

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** It would definitely be moving to the desert in the US and suddenly facing down skin conditions that I'd never experienced back in Canada. I was looking for ways to deal with the harsh desert of the sun, because it was damaging my skin rapidly; I'm one of those 'burns-and-freckles' types that is lacking the ability to tan. :( 

&gt;#What sets /r/asianbeauty apart from other beauty subreddits?

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** I would say what sets us apart, although I don't think it's unusual in smaller subs, is our community. Specifically, we have a very unique demographic - in that it is very diverse. Not too long ago, a user posted an anonymous demographic survey. Unlike most of reddit (I believe?) the majority of users are not white, and not US based. I think that's unusual. 

&gt;&gt;**MissPicklesMeow:** For what sets us apart, we are blogger friendly. Most subreddits have strict rules against linking to personal blogs. 

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** The original founder deliberately set out to make this subreddit a friendly place for Asian Beauty bloggers, because bloggers are not universally welcomed on Reddit and online communities in general.

&gt;#What sets Asian beauty products apart from European and American cosmetics?

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** I think that really depends on the person, but one of the most common answers we see is definitely the price:quality ratio. 

&gt;&gt;**MissPicklesMeow:** Don't forget super kawaii packaging.

&gt;#What are some of the common phrases/slang we will encounter in Asian Beauty?

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** Snails and starfish. Literally, they are ingredients, but contextually, they're a metaphor. They are the stand-in for ""Crazy ingredients that have limited, if promising, scientific studies, but damn if they don't work."" But that takes too long to type, so we just say, ""SNAILS! STARFISH!""

&gt;#What are your favorite posts?

&gt;&gt;**http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2jcss2/asian_skincare_101_a_beginners_guide_faq/**

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** It was a collaboration between several long-time users and is really excellent.

&gt;#Is there anything else you'd like reddit to know about your sub? 

&gt;&gt;**SnowWhitePear:** ... that we are not a sub for gawking at Asian Beauties, MissPicklesMeow?
&gt;&gt;**MissPicklesMeow:** I would say to not let the CSS theme scare you. We're very friendly and open to all people 

 
I had a great time chatting with the mods of /r/AsianBeauty, and find it refreshing that they don't take themselves too seriously. Jump on the hype train and subscribe to an endless supply of mucus, venom, and K-pop.

I'm a new intern here at Subreddit of the Day, and am known on Reddit mostly as ""Roach Girl"". I'm a walking contradiction, and enjoy sniffing jet fuel, cleaning fire arms, making self-depreciating jokes, and nail art.

34mk97,1,2015-05-02,"I[20 M] am in a situation with a [22 F] that is more than just friends with benefits, but she is not ready for another relationship.",TomTomDumbDumb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34mk97/i20_m_am_in_a_situation_with_a_22_f_that_is_more/,"Good morning, everybody. So, I'm about to graduate from college and I'm currently involved with an amazing girl. She will be graduating next fall. The mutual physical attraction is through the roof and a little over a month ago (we met/started talking in October and she lives one floor above me) we started routinely having sex. We have been sleeping together in the same bed almost every night as well.


I have let her know multiple times that I love her but while she has  told me that she was happy to hear me say that, she avoided stating her feelings because she wanted to avoid a serious relationship. She feels this way due to the fact that she has been in a few long term relationships spanning over the last seven years or so, and at this point in her life she wants to have fun as a single for the first time (she wants me to also enjoy not being held down by one person).


Last night she let me know that she loves me back (which I knew in my heart). Regardless, she feels that she would be holding me back if I waited around to pursue a relationship with her while she was having fun. In the past week, she has let me know that she wants us to both have fun and I believed that by this she meant that no one else that she hooked up with would be important to her. 


However, last night, even though she said that she loves me she said that ""whatever happens happens"" in the sense that if she started talking to a guy she met, or if I started talking to a chick, then she'd be fine with things with that person growing into whatever they grew into. This has me fucked up in the sense that although we love each other and she doesn't want a relationship at this point in her life, which I understand, she'd be open to having other guys doing things with her and being with her like how I currently am (much more than friends with benefits but less than an actual relationship). She said the same should apply for me. 


It's just confusing to me because 1) I've never been in love before so that lack of experience probably caused me to end up in this situation. 2) We do things that one would think a bf/gf would do such as cuddling/sleeping together as well as kissing when we say bye to each other. She even said that if were to go out to a bar as a group, which we have (we danced together all night each time), that she would like for us to both dance, talk, get numbers and whatnot with others if the opportunity came up. 


I guess my main thing is that we do things as if we are in a relationship but my desire for exclusivity (I'd even be fine with non-serious hook ups on the side) that I would prefer, isn't being reciprocated. 


I think its also worth mentioning that after I asked what a hook up with a guy at a bar would mean to her, she said it could vary from her hooking up with him just for fun sometime after meeting (I guess non-serious, she is very sexual so making out, or potentially an eventual casual fuck, with someone who she doesn't know too well wouldn't mean too much her) to him, depending on how involved in her life I was at the time, eventually being in the position that I am with her. At this point I should mention that since I met her a few months after she just ended a relationship that lasted for years, she made me wait for months. I asked her why this was, even though she had hooked up with guys not long after meeting them before, and she said that it was because she had feelings for me. I presume she needed time to evaluate whether or not she wanted to get into a sexual relationship.


She cried yesterday when I told her that I didn't like this situation.  She said that she really doesn't want to hurt me. I know she cares about me and we have both stated that we consider each other to be amongst our best/closest friends. I comforted her by saying that I was wrong for just thinking about stuff that hasn't even happened as opposed to taking things one step at a time. 


In reality I know that while I can be free to go ahead and get with other chicks, I'm still gonna be jealous when she does her thing too. I should note that she's much more experienced than I am with the opposite sex, as I've never been involved in a legitimate relationship. I should also mention that she'll have an internship about an hour away from me this summer and as of right now I don't have a car so visiting her won't be that easy. We have made it clear that we want to keep what we have going as long as it is able to go, but she is obviously more mature and accepting of the unpredictable future. 


Feel free to give me all of your guys' opinions. I've got so much going on as far as figuring out want I want to do after college and finishing strong, but this is easily what I think about the most. All I know for sure is that she means the world to me. 


Thanks for the help. Sorry for the bad grammar too. By the way feel free to tell me if I'm just being a huge bitch.


   
TL;DR; In love with girl who loves me back but doesn't want a relationship; and even though we have what feels like an actual relationship and the feelings are strong, she still wants us to be open to hooking up with other people.

EDIT: she actually turns 22 tonight and we, a large group of her friends, and some of my friends are going to go out. I know that I want to spend time with her at the bar, but I know that I should tell myself that she and I should be fine doing our own things at times as well."

I got out due to injury and went to college.  I'm at the end of my junior year pursuing an Applied Mathematics and Comp sci degree.  I've been fortunate enough to make the cut and get selected for an internship (3 month interview) for the following.

Software Developer - Mainframe 

Interns will be responsible for analysis of real world problems; programming of production applications; testing with a team of fellow programmers and business analysts; implementation of technical and business requirements. Individuals are required to have a working knowledge of programming and data administration concepts. Training in RDz, COBOL, JCL, and DB2 (SQL) will be provided.

Experience with one or more of the following is desired : C, C++, C#, other .Net languages (Silverlight, VB, etc), Java, HTML, XML, ASP, JSP, XSLT, MQ, Unix/Linux.

So, for any long term COBOL devs out there.
 What would be the three top things you either wish an intern knew when he arrived and/or things i can do to prepare for this? 

What are good COBOL resources that would help familiarize my self with common industry conventions and practices? Are these conventions and practices unique to each company?

I'm using open-cobol / GNUCobol on my ubuntu netbook and working through some of my earlier comp sci class material again and reading what i can around the web. I still want to go the extra mile though."
34mp1k,31,2015-05-02,3 Stories,[deleted],hotpast,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotpast/comments/34mp1k/3_stories/,"My wife and I are fairly conservative.  When we first started dating, I found out that she decided to saved herself for marriage and even blowjobs were off limits.  So this may seem tame to some of the other stories, but it's still pretty hot to me.  We knew each other since Freshman year at College and she didn't date in high school, so I knew her dating history and all two of her boyfriends at the time.  I only have 3 stories to share.  

1) My now wife, myself, and a group of our mutual friends went out of state to a tech conference.  Being poor college students, we crammed 12 of us into two hotel rooms.  The three of us happened to share the same room.  There was no privacy, so I knew nothing would happen.  One day, right before my presentation, I had to run back up to the room to grab something.  When I entered, the shower was running, I thought everyone was downstairs prepping.  Being completely callous, I knocked on the door saying that whomever was showering needed to get ready.  Boyfriend #1 comes out of the shower with a towel on, apologizes, and said he'll be ready in 5 minutes.  I grab my things and leave.  About a year after my wife and I started dating, she told me that they were showering together when I came in.  When I knocked on the door, she was mid-blowjob desperately trying to finish him off so they could get ready.   And that's when I found out that her ""blowjob"" rule was implemented right when we started dating.  I'll spare you the logic behind that decision, but it was a decision that I respected.  (I did not receive any oral sex during the 4 years we dated.)

Some background on the next two stories:  My wife is Polish, her Boyfriend #2 was Nigerian.  They met during a college internship program when he tried pick her up for a one night stand but ended up dating her for 2 years.  At this point, I started to develop feelings for her and was sad to see her taken.  My wife is a strong minded individual and they use to have fights about their opposing view points.

2) After we all graduated, the first thing Boyfriend #2 did with his hiring bonus was buy an expensive and sporty car with leather seats.  She wasn't happy since he had huge amounts of student loans.  Also the car was in California, they were in Virginia at the time.  If he wanted the car, he needed to fly there and drive it back.  She hated the car, especially the leather seats because it gets sticky when it gets warms.  I cannot emphasize how much she hates leather touching her skin.  Somehow, he convinced her to flight out to California as well and do a road trip back.  This was in the summer so the entire trip was quite warm.  The second he got out of the city, he had her give him road head.  When I asked her how many times, she said she lost count but it was more than 4, because that's the only time she swallowed cum was the 4 times during that trip.  And that's how I found out my wife has swallowed, she has never repeated the act since.  She doesn't even let me cum on her mouth.  She said that she knew they drove through the Carolina's and Texas but she never saw those states.  The fact that she was giving BJs so frequently while I couldn't get any made it hotter.  They also stopped in the middle of the desert somewhere to fool around in the back.  The leather seats got quite hot and she was being burned while trying to do the 69 in the back.  It was quite an uncomfortable trip for her but she told me she did it because it was something he really wanted.  

3) This last story, I'm not proud of but it's one that I think about the most.  Early in our relationship, she mentioned that for a Christmas present, she gave Boyfriend #2 a professionally made photo album.  She said the photos were artsy.  When I asked to see it, she didn't want to show me because those pictures ""were for him"".  I was curious but wanted to respect her wishes.  A month later, I was on her computer randomly and saw a folder on the desktop named ""Random Name Photography"" and I couldn't resist opening it.  I was expecting to see some suggestive boudoir photos... you know ""artsy"", but she was straight up naked spread eagle.  (Before I get a bunch of requests, no I do not have these photos.  I didn't save them and now, don't know where they are since she got rid of that computer ages ago.)  There was one pic series named ""doggy"", which I assume was her on all fours showing everything she's got.  Instead, it was a bunch of photos where she pretended to be a dog (yes there was another dog in the photo and no, there was no bestiality or anything that came close to suggesting that).  There was several where her and the dog were playing tug of war with a piece of rope in her mouth, posed like a mirror image of the dog she was tugging against.  I guess that's artistic?   I had the weirdest boner.  

So what do I do next?  I searched her computer for more pictures and that's when I hit the mother lode.  She had an entire folder of pictures between her and Boyfriend #2.  (I do not have these pics either, so don't ask)  The one set of pics that I remember the most was that he was wearing a pair of boxer briefs labelled ""Wife's Name's Property"" and her taking selfies, beaming with pride, next to his very large junk.  The next several pictures quickly degrades to what I can only call cock worship, it was as if she was trying to swallow it whole.  (Even now, when I get BJs, she doesn't deepthroat.) I jerked off to these pics and came in like 10 seconds flat.  That's when I noticed a letter in the folder.  (She likes to type love letters and print them out on fancy stationary.)  The letter was post break up and she basically confesses that she needed to see him and his ""gorgeous cock"" so that she can ""taste his warmth"" one more time.  Since I knew both of them, I was specifically mentioned in the letter as well, saying that I was making a move on her and she's thinking about giving us a chance.  The last photo by date was her with cum all over her face with a big smile and a caption ""something to remember me by ;~)"".  I also knew that about a month before we started dating she had to fly out to Vegas for a work conference.  It wasn't a bit later that she told me there were still a bunch of unresolved feelings between her and Boyfriend #2 so she treated him to a Vegas vacation for closure.  She doesn't know that I read her letter and saw that photo.  At first I was jealous and a hurt, but now I find it a turn on and feel great that for all they had, she still chose me.

Possibly getting back together.. Is this just another ""dude, don't do it"" scenario that I am blind to? or is this, I'm hoping, unique.
***

After reading the whole deal [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34j3w6/update_my_20f_and_my_boyfriend_21f_of_4_years/), I've finally decided to share my very similar situation. I know most are quick to jump to the ""won't work out long run, break up, gym."" I feel like my story is the same, but hoping it is different (always a special snowflake right?).

Anyway:

We met in college &amp; things were beyond awesome. Cutest girl I could imagine, never tired of each other, took part in each others interests, etc. It was a dream. Also, it was both of ours' first real, actual relationship.

I graduated a year earlier than her &amp; accepted an intense masters program about 3 hrs away. Things were rough, but we made time for each other &amp; stayed together long distance. Year later, she gets an internship by me, and we finally got to finally live together after 4 long years - and it was awesome.

Fast forward, her internship was over &amp; she accepted a job back in our college town 3 hrs away. This time went quite differently.

Some issues we never really addressed during the relationship just exacerbated (I know, stupid). To name some, I was admittedly more closed off than her in not vocalizing my emotions. She's had self confidence issues since she was young. We were both always stubborn and neither of us let in. Eventually we both felt an underlying feeling like we were the only ones giving in to the relationship (selfish, dumb); leading us to start to essentially give up on things.

So she meets a guy at work who is very opposite to me personality-wise. Number one being very vocal about his emotions.  So.. things start to break down. This was about the time when we started addressing our bigger issues, I guess too late into the game, and it didn't really help. She kept getting more and more distant &amp; really was emotionally cheating at that point; I eventually made one last attempt to keep things going- we ended up splitting on sad, broken terms, but not hating each other.

Now it's been a little over a year since we split.  We talked maybe 2 or 3 times since, nothing beyond hows life etc.  She shows up on my door last week.. super upset, crying, she misses me, etc.  Says things never worked out with the other guy because she was always sad from not being with me.  They did still date for something like 9 months, so I'm thinking that's a long ass time for her to realize who she should be with. She said  she thought the feeling that she missed me would pass with time, but it just never did and she always felt horrible.  She says she knows it was a very bad case of the grass is greener and is extremely regretful about it.  Says she wants to do everything she can to make us work.

So.. tough.  I am not a relationship seeker and am fine being alone.  I do really care about this girl though, and honestly I feel like I could fall in love with her again.. we had an awesome past together and at the end of the day I have far more happy memories than unhappy ones.

Still, I just can't help but think she left me.  We definitely had some big problems we didn't address until too late- even so, she left me.  How can I know the same thing won't happen again?  Both of us are more experienced* now, just by being older and by now knowing how we could have fixed our relationship before, so I'm thinking we can avoid not heading down that path again?  All I have is her words, which are meaningless to me now. And another thing, I can just imagine her being with the other guy (from hanging out to sex), and it makes me sick every time we're together.

This is a very slim version and I will gladly give more info in comments.  I know it's tough to judge by this excerpt, but what do you all think?  Any advice is welcome, I'm tired to sitting here thinking about this myself."

I don't want to give out too much information but it's large enough that everyone knows about it (they also have many large, corporate sponsors and don't appear to be disappearing anytime soon).  Both positions are within the development (fundraising) departments, one in an expensive NYC suburb.  Both positions also ask for early to mid career experience, which hopefully fits me as someone two years out of college with a good amount of experience and internships.

I just applied and I don't even know if I'll get the interview, but I was wondering what I should expect salary-wise.  Is there anyone out there in a similar position who would like to share what they are making?  Any guesses based on past experiences?  Both positions didn't list salary or benefits but based on some research it might be 35-40K (hopefully more next to NYC).  I don't want to go into an interview unprepared if they ask, so hopefully someone out there in Reddit-land has an idea!  Thanks in advance!"

I'm looking for a buddy to play Space Engineers with (on my own server - perks of being an IT guy) and maybe to take part in my programming emporium: I've made Firefox add-ons, a little GIMP plugin and other misc. utilities, websites, Java web apps, etc.

I normally have a friend or two I can relate to well and play with, but events in their lives have kept them busy and they seem to not care about getting back to me. I'm alone, recovering from a depression thanks to my recent online girlfriend (first ever), about to graduate college after my internship, and on good days I'm a really fun guy who can keep talking forever and does tons of cool stuff.

34ned2,13,2015-05-02,"Graduating soon with a B.S. in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, worried the degree was a mistake. Any advice is appreciated.",PineappleTigers,xxstem,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxstem/comments/34ned2/graduating_soon_with_a_bs_in_biochemistry/,"**Tl;dr – Graduating in a month with Biochemistry/Biophysics B.S. and mediocre gpa (2.83). Looking for options to consider besides biotech companies. Currently considering adding a B.S. or M.S. in business/management, PharmD programs, and optometry programs. Looking for input on these ideas and additional suggestions of paths to consider. Also wondering if hiring a career counselor independent of my school might be worth it.**

I am about a month away from graduating with a B.S. in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, which I am now realizing may be completely useless. For various reasons, which I can go into more detail about if requested, I did not do well in school. I have a 2.83 gpa, which will likely increase after getting my grades this semester, but will also not rise to a 3.00 or above. Because of this, getting a PhD in biochemistry is basically out of the question. My advisor at school told me that getting a biochem Masters is not worth it, because all it says is that I’m not good enough to get a PhD. I don’t think I even want a PhD in the first place, but without one opportunities for career growth seem nonexistent.

I was not able to land any internships or research opportunities as an undergrad. I fear that this combined with my gpa makes me an undesirable job candidate. I do have lab experience from my coursework. The only work experience I have was a temporary administrative assistant position where I was needed for about a month. I do have a little bit of volunteer experience.

My dream job was working for a local pharmaceutical company in the manufacturing department. I got an interview but was just rejected for this job. I have sent out many applications to other companies and have heard nothing. I have a strong desire to stay in the Albany area but I am sending out applications to other areas regardless. 

At this point I am desperate for some suggestions as to what I can possibly do with this degree besides working for a biotech company. I am still open to biotech but this path doesn’t seem to be working out for me and I need to consider other options. I don’t mind if I end up with a job that is unrelated to my degree if I can qualify for it. I also don’t mind work that may be considered dull or boring. The only path I am against at this point is becoming a science teacher.

**Some things I am considering:**

Delaying my graduation to get a second Bachelor’s in business and management.

Attempting to get a management related Master’s from my current school, if possible with my low gpa. The school also offers an accelerated weekend MBA program.

Working as a pharmacy tech while taking some supplemental courses at a community college to eventually get into a PharmD program (my school does not offer some basic PharmD prerequisites like English). I think I’d enjoy working as a retail pharmacist, but I’ve heard a lot of people say the debt from pharmacy school isn’t worth it. I also don’t know if I even have a shot at getting into a PharmD program with my low gpa. If I stay in New York there is no certification required to be a pharmacy tech, which is a plus.

One of my professors said it would be worth looking into an optometry program, but again I’m not sure if my gpa will be good enough.

I could delay my graduation to try to retake courses and raise my gpa if my school would allow this.

I have an appointment with a career counselor at my school on Monday to discuss these options, but I don’t know how helpful this will be. I fear that they will just recommend I further my education here so the school will make more money. I have only ever been to them for resume critiques before. I am considering finding a career counselor independent of my school, so if anyone has experience with this I’d appreciate input on whether or not it could be worth the money.

**I know nobody can tell me what to do with my life.** I am looking for input on my ideas for moving forward and suggestions of any ideas I am missing. I’m worried that my ideas may not be sound because I did originally think getting a degree in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics was a good idea, and that did not turn out to be true. 

I’m aware this may not be the best subreddit to post this because I am considering leaving STEM, so any suggestions on where I might crosspost would be appreciated. Basically any advice at all. I feel incredibly lost and discouraged that I wasted four years of my life and a lot of money on a useless degree. I know job searches are never easy but there must be something I can do to improve my options.

34nfso,1,2015-05-02,Came here (first time on LDR) for some expert LDR advice please help,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/34nfso/came_here_first_time_on_ldr_for_some_expert_ldr/,"This is going to be extremely long as I want my whole background information out there about the situation.  Huge venting session I really needed this. and it fits to the LDR so please read.  :) So please bare with me if you can I would seriously appreciate it redditors!!!  I will supply a TL;DR at the end.

I am a [22M] she is a [23F].  We met in class 4 months ago at the beginning of the semester.  Started off as just friends, but I told her I was interested in her about 2 months ago and to my surprise she was interested in me.  This past week has been absolutely amazing.  We have kissed, we went to the beach, dinner dates.  Everything is so perfect.

Earlier this semester she had told me she applied for her Disney internship.  She ended up getting accepted about a month ago and I was nothing but happy for her.  I told her what a great opportunity it was and that this will be the best experience ever for her in her life.  Doing something she loves.  

About a week after getting accepted she told me her parents and her got into a fight about leaving.  She said she regretted applying and did not want to leave for 7 months.  She came to me for advice.  I know I liked her and she liked me, but I did not want to be the reason she did not leave.  So I assured her everything will be okay and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for her and to enhance her career. (I will not be the reason a girl stops her goals and dreams, it is how I am no matter how much I like her.)

So weeks go by, and we continue talking, hanging out, all that jazz. (no sex, I only do this with woman I am in relationships with.)  We head to a bar together.  Everything is fine she showed up first, I was about ten minutes late.  We went with different parties of people.  At the bar my insecurity shows and I regret it.  

She is flirting with another guy (or really she was getting hit on and I am just dumb.)  But this annoyed me so I avoided her.  Skipping to when I leave (nothing happened in between.)  I say bye to my friends who are sitting with her at a table and I casually say goodbye to her, no hug, nothing, cause at the time I was annoyed and it probably was not even her fault.  It was mine for being insecure which was dumb.  

She asks, ""Why are you being this way?""
I respond,"" You were flrting with mad guys and I am not about that so im leaving goodbye.""
She grabs my arm and follows me to the door.
She explains to me that she does not care about anyone at the bar besides me and that I distanced myself for no reason.  To which I accepted and gave in and apologized.   She also said she really liked me.  I grabbed the back of her head and said if you like me kiss me.  I grabbed the back her head and gave her a kiss (first one we had.)  I leave and the night for me ends.

Next day we have class.  Last class of the semester.  class ends (nothing important happened in class.)  She begins crying.  She gives me a big hug and I tell her not to cry then leave.  (we had plans for lunch after class after she went and picked up her belongings at her friends.)  She texts me that she is on her way to come pick me up.  We go to Red Robin and chat a bit, I tell her do not be sad, the semester is over and we are graduating its a celebration.  She opens up and tells me that she is sad she won't see anyone.  And that she wants me to keep in contact when she leaves for Disney.  She said if I find another girl she would not be mad at me.  She got teary eyed and I assured jher everything will be okay.  The day ends and I get two kisses goodbye as I leave her car.  (This made me so happy, but I can not help but feel helpless right now in my head.)

Next day comes which was yesterday, and I surprise her at her house.  She was ecstatic that I stopped over to see her even though it was for about 35 minutes.  We kissed numerous times, she told me how much she liked me and i told her the same.  We shared some laughs and had a great time together in those 35 minutes.

This week is going to be a struggle because it is senior week, where all the seniors astay on campus and party,.  I am seeing her tomorrow and most of next week as well.

Now to my problem.  We are basically monogamous without saying it.  I need to find this out (I am 99% sure we are.)  She leaves for Disney from May16-Jan4.  I am worried she will find someone else in Florida, or stay in Florida for her career.  I really want to talk to her and express my feelings towards her about this subject,  I am very worried about the things I have just posted, because I am a genuine guy and really would wait for this girl, but is trust an issue, infidelity, lying....  I have never been in this situation and it is literally eating me alive.  I need to talkj to her tomorrow when I see her, do I just let out the truth?  How do i approach the situation.  I do want to have a great week, but if I feel i need to end this I feel like i should.  My head is leave.  But my heart is saying stay,. make this work, you are a great guy and she is a great girl.

Thank you for everyone who ended up reading this whole thing.  I feel its a good little story, and I need some advice.

Thanks Reddit!!! you guys are the best.

TL;DR:  Girl I basically have fallen in love with is leaving for Disney for 7 months and do not know how to approach feelings of this situation.  How to make it work, ect...  I would really like to try and make it work, but I feel like I cant do this... But I want someone with experience to convince me otherwise....

Have you ever had an event coming up and there's an outfit you want to wear but you don't fit in it yet? For me that's my old suit. It was my most expensive suit and I'm 10 pounds ish from fitting into it, but I would look like a champ if I lost 15-20.

I do keto with about 3-4 hours of exercise per week. Some weeks I do 0, my internship is very demanding (but rewarding). I started keto on March 1st, and as of today, I'm 32 pounds down, and 18 away from my goal.

---
I will begin intermittent fasting keto as of tomorrow, which means I will fast from 9PM to 2PM regularly. That gives me a 7 hour eating window which is great because I don't like to eat in the morning anyway. Bulletproof coffee is allowed in said IF period. And water. Nothing else. My keto calculator says I should eat about 1300 calories, which I already do. The motto I've read on here is ""Hit your protein, fat is to satiate"" (or something like that, you catch ma drift).

Exercise. Gym, everyday. 4 days heavy lifting, 3 days cardio. 

Sleep. 7 hours minimum.

Water. 3-4L daily.

Dairy. Cut down to heavy cream and some cheese. 

It's summer and I wanna get into the best shape as possible. Wish me luck as I ramp up my keto!"

Everything is fine she showed up first, I was about ten minutes late. We went with different parties of people. At the bar my insecurity shows and I regret it.

She is flirting with another guy (or really she was getting hit on and I am just dumb.) But this annoyed me so I avoided her. Skipping to when I leave (nothing happened in between.) I say bye to my friends who are sitting with her at a table and I casually say goodbye to her, no hug, nothing, cause at the time I was annoyed and it probably was not even her fault. It was mine for being insecure which was dumb.

She asks, ""Why are you being this way?"" I respond,"" You were flrting with mad guys and I am not about that so im leaving goodbye."" She grabs my arm and follows me to the door. She explains to me that she does not care about anyone at the bar besides me and that I distanced myself for no reason. To which I accepted and gave in and apologized. She also said she really liked me. I grabbed the back of her head and said if you like me kiss me. I grabbed the back her head and gave her a kiss (first one we had.) I leave and the night for me ends.

Next day we have class. Last class of the semester. class ends (nothing important happened in class.) She begins crying. She gives me a big hug and I tell her not to cry then leave. (we had plans for lunch after class after she went and picked up her belongings at her friends.) She texts me that she is on her way to come pick me up. We go to Red Robin and chat a bit, I tell her do not be sad, the semester is over and we are graduating its a celebration. She opens up and tells me that she is sad she won't see anyone. And that she wants me to keep in contact when she leaves for Disney. She said if I find another girl she would not be mad at me. She got teary eyed and I assured jher everything will be okay. The day ends and I get two kisses goodbye as I leave her car. (This made me so happy, but I can not help but feel helpless right now in my head.)

Next day comes which was yesterday, and I surprise her at her house. She was ecstatic that I stopped over to see her even though it was for about 35 minutes. We kissed numerous times, she told me how much she liked me and i told her the same. We shared some laughs and had a great time together in those 35 minutes.

This week is going to be a struggle because it is senior week, where all the seniors astay on campus and party,. I am seeing her tomorrow and most of next week as well.

Now to my problem. We are basically monogamous without saying it. I need to find this out (I am 99% sure we are.) She leaves for Disney from May16-Jan4. I am worried she will find someone else in Florida, or stay in Florida for her career. I really want to talk to her and express my feelings towards her about this subject, I am very worried about the things I have just posted, because I am a genuine guy and really would wait for this girl, but is trust an issue, infidelity, lying.... I have never been in this situation and it is literally eating me alive. I need to talkj to her tomorrow when I see her, do I just let out the truth? How do i approach the situation. I do want to have a great week, but if I feel i need to end this I feel like i should. My head is leave. But my heart is saying stay,. make this work, you are a great guy and she is a great girl.

Thank you for everyone who ended up reading this whole thing. I feel its a good little story, and I need some advice.

Thanks Reddit!!! you guys are the best.

TL;DR: Girl I basically have fallen in love with is leaving for Disney for 7 months and do not know how to approach feelings of this situation. How to make it work, ect... I would really like to try and make it work, but I feel like I cant do this... But I want someone with experience to convince me otherwise....

34npjb,15,2015-05-02,"Graduating soon with a B.S. in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, worried the degree was a mistake. Any advice is appreciated. (xpost xxstem)",PineappleTigers,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/34npjb/graduating_soon_with_a_bs_in_biochemistry/,"**Tl;dr – Graduating in a month with Biochemistry/Biophysics B.S. and mediocre gpa (2.83). Looking for options to consider besides biotech companies. Currently considering adding a B.S. or M.S. in business/management, PharmD programs, and optometry programs. Looking for input on these ideas and additional suggestions of paths to consider. Also wondering if hiring a career counselor independent of my school might be worth it.**

I am about a month away from graduating with a B.S. in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, which I am now realizing may be completely useless. For various reasons, which I can go into more detail about if requested, I did not do well in school. I have a 2.83 gpa, which will likely increase after getting my grades this semester, but will also not rise to a 3.00 or above. Because of this, getting a PhD in biochemistry is basically out of the question. My advisor at school told me that getting a biochem Masters is not worth it, because all it says is that I’m not good enough to get a PhD. I don’t think I even want a PhD in the first place, but without one opportunities for career growth seem nonexistent.

I was not able to land any internships or research opportunities as an undergrad. I fear that this combined with my gpa makes me an undesirable job candidate. I do have lab experience from my coursework. The only work experience I have was a temporary administrative assistant position where I was needed for about a month. I do have a little bit of volunteer experience.

My dream job was working for a local pharmaceutical company in the manufacturing department. I got an interview but was just rejected for this job. I have sent out many applications to other companies and have heard nothing. I have a strong desire to stay in the Albany area but I am sending out applications to other areas regardless. 

At this point I am desperate for some suggestions as to what I can possibly do with this degree besides working for a biotech company. I am still open to biotech but this path doesn’t seem to be working out for me and I need to consider other options. I don’t mind if I end up with a job that is unrelated to my degree if I can qualify for it. I also don’t mind work that may be considered dull or boring. The only path I am against at this point is becoming a science teacher.

**Some things I am considering:**

Delaying my graduation to get a second Bachelor’s in business and management.

Attempting to get a management related Master’s from my current school, if possible with my low gpa. The school also offers an accelerated weekend MBA program.

Working as a pharmacy tech while taking some supplemental courses at a community college to eventually get into a PharmD program (my school does not offer some basic PharmD prerequisites like English). I think I’d enjoy working as a retail pharmacist, but I’ve heard a lot of people say the debt from pharmacy school isn’t worth it. I also don’t know if I even have a shot at getting into a PharmD program with my low gpa. If I stay in New York there is no certification required to be a pharmacy tech, which is a plus.

One of my professors said it would be worth looking into an optometry program, but again I’m not sure if my gpa will be good enough.

I could delay my graduation to try to retake courses and raise my gpa if my school would allow this.

I have an appointment with a career counselor at my school on Monday to discuss these options, but I don’t know how helpful this will be. I fear that they will just recommend I further my education here so the school will make more money. I have only ever been to them for resume critiques before. I am considering finding a career counselor independent of my school, so if anyone has experience with this I’d appreciate input on whether or not it could be worth the money.

**I know nobody can tell me what to do with my life.** I am looking for input on my ideas for moving forward and suggestions of any ideas I am missing. I’m worried that my ideas may not be sound because I did originally think getting a degree in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics was a good idea, and that did not turn out to be true. 

I’m aware this may not be the best subreddit to post this because I am considering leaving STEM, so any suggestions on where I might crosspost would be appreciated. Basically any advice at all. I feel incredibly lost and discouraged that I wasted four years of my life and a lot of money on a useless degree. I know job searches are never easy but there must be something I can do to improve my options."

I am a [22M] she is a [23F]. We met in class 4 months ago at the beginning of the semester. Started off as just friends, but I told her I was interested in her about 2 months ago and to my surprise she was interested in me. This past week has been absolutely amazing. We have kissed, we went to the beach, dinner dates. Everything is so perfect.

Earlier this semester she had told me she applied for her Disney internship. She ended up getting accepted about a month ago and I was nothing but happy for her. I told her what a great opportunity it was and that this will be the best experience ever for her in her life. Doing something she loves.

About a week after getting accepted she told me her parents and her got into a fight about leaving. She said she regretted applying and did not want to leave for 7 months. She came to me for advice. I know I liked her and she liked me, but I did not want to be the reason she did not leave. So I assured her everything will be okay and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for her and to enhance her career. (I will not be the reason a girl stops her goals and dreams, it is how I am no matter how much I like her.)

Update:  So we talked...  It kinda went as planned, but we are both still in the we are confused as to what to do stages.  I told her she is great, and we should try.  She agreed, but we continued talking and it started to fade away.  I am starting to have doubts myself and am just going to tell her that whatever she decides to do I am there for her, and support her.  I do not just want to be friends its either we try and make it work or its over.  Thats how I am.  She said I still want to be friends and close.  I am nearly about to cut everything off right now.  Idk what to do at this point in time.  Minds still spinning around

I just need it for university and general usage, like using the browser, netflix, movies, shows, etc., although I'm going to be on an internship until next year so no need for school stuff there and won't really need my laptop for work. I don't need it for any intense graphics/video processing, and I don't play games on PC (Mac, I guess?). I don't use any specific software, besides the Microsoft Office suite - and I don't deal with enormous spreadsheets. 

Would the lowest end model of the 13"" mbpr be more than enough for me? The biggest thing is that I just want it to last long. I don't want to face freezes here and there after a year or two. And also, I live in Canada... damn weak CAD, all the prices were jacked up.

Extra info: I currently use a Toshiba ultrabook I got almost three years ago and it's been slowing down quite a bit. I did clean reinstall of Windows and after a few days I still notice it to be freezing up here and there. As a matter of fact, yesterday I restarted my laptop, logged in, and everything was stuck trying to load, not even ctrl+alt+del did anything.

Tl;dr: buy 13"" mbpr for word/excel stuff and using the browser? Last a long time before replacing it?"
34o202,1,2015-05-02,Any other graduating seniors here?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/34o202/any_other_graduating_seniors_here/,"I just graduated college today with an engineering degree. At the ceremony, everyone was laughing and happy, and telling each other congratulations. I of course had to pretend to be happy as well, but inside I felt like I wanted to die.

My parents, both PhDs, have always had very high expectations. I was always pushed hard to be a good student. And although I hated how they pushed school and academics on me, my self-worth became based on academic success. I wasn't popular or athletic or funny, and I didn’t have many friends, but I was smart, in high school at least. I graduated high school ranked in the top 3 of my class, full ride to a college, 45 college credit hours from AP, and lots of various awards. I was the model student, the guy other parents compared their children to. 

I didn't get along with my parents though, and decided to attend a school far away from home. I didn't know anyone there, and I was too shy to make friends. I picked a rather difficult major, and started taking sophomore/junior level classes freshman year due to coming in with lots of AP credit. I planned on either getting an MD or PhD, with engineering as a backup. My advisers told me to take it easy and slowly adjust to college life, but I was arrogant. I'm smart, I thought, and I can handle it. 

Turned out I was wrong. Without my parents, I lacked motivation. I skipped classes, didn't study, and failed tests. I also found out that a good chunk of the other students in my major were also on scholarship, and were just as smart as or smarter than me. My first two years, I ended up failing 4 classes and almost lost my scholarship. I couldn't find an internship, professors told me to raise my GPA before trying to do undergraduate research.  I didn't make any friends, never joined any clubs. Just hid in my room all day and played video games or thought about life. I was depressed and lost. I never told my parents anything; they assumed I was enjoying college. 

Since I couldn't find an internship, I ended up spending summer after sophomore year at home. During this time, I had to lie to my parents about how college was going, hid mailed notices the school sent about my academic probation, etc. all while maintaining my facade. 

Turned out the threat of losing your scholarship and having to come clean to your parents is a great motivational force. I got a 3.6 average my junior year and an internship for the summer. I managed to turn myself around on the brink of being a college dropout. Although I still lacked true motivation, I had enough self-discipline to attend class most of the time, and ended up with a final GPA of 3.18 and a job offer last semester. For the first time in a long time, I felt hope for myself. 

Today, however, was graduation. I saw my smart classmates graduating with magna/summa cum laude, wearing various honor cords, honor societies, etc over their robes. Many of them are going on to law school, med school, graduate school, or great jobs at large companies. Some of them are nationally recognized scholars. I had nothing other than the default cap and gown everyone was given. I had to tell my parents the truth before the ceremony, and I could tell they were disappointed in me, although they said it doesn’t matter. I was reminded of how little I accomplished compared to what I could have accomplished over the past 4 years. 

I honestly wish for a chance to redo everything. 
I’m thankful for my job offer, but honestly it’s a pretty low tier job. From what I’ve heard, it’s repetitive and not very challenging. I don’t think I’ll ever be content working a job like that knowing the opportunities I missed or what I could have been. The past 4 years, although miserable, have passed so quickly. I’m terrified that life post-graduation will pass by even faster. My worst nightmare is waking up in my 50s, having worked a boring office job my entire life, and realizing I’ve wasted all my potential.

I would love any feedback r/entrepreneur has :)",kobyc,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34o44r/we_just_raised_195000_launched_our_website_mvp_i/,"A few months ago I got hired as the marketing director to a really cool startup in my city called Basedin. We just finished raising over $195,000. I was hoping to go over our business strategy going forwards and get some feedback. :) 

*If any of you have any questions about anything like raising $$ feel free to ask!*

So...

**Description:** We are a big data company. What we do is scrape all of a businesses information and collect reviews on it through API's and then we evaluate the business on a 1-10 scale - we're basically like the ultimate review website accurately evaluating businesses online reputation. We focus on services similarly to Angies list. 

**Getting More Money:** We raised $195,000 by participating in a startup incubator in Boise, Idaho. Through the incubator we were able to network with investors and basically raise a ton of money. We want more though. We've applied to a second incubator that's ranked #15 in the nation called Boom Startup down in Utah, its graduates have a 60% fund rate averaging $300K-$600K so we're hoping to be able to finish raising money to the tune of $500K-$800k. 

**Building The Product:** We have a pretty big development team that consists of 2 people on the management team and 9 interns. We are also working with 2 outside programmers and an outside development firm down in Utah. We *just* relaunched our [website](http://www.basedin.com) &amp; so far we are in 4 cities - we hope to be able to be in over 100 cities by the end of the summer. I would absolutely *love* any feedback you guys have on the website (Sorry about the backend, we are still working on it a little bit). 

**Marketing The Product:** So what we sell is adspace at $100 a month - you get a premium listing &amp; your name will show up next to your competitors pages (and your competitors will no longer show up on your page). What we don't have is traffic. What we're doing to fix this is offering a 100% cospend on when people sign up. What that means is that if you sign up for our $100/mo package, we will spend $100/mo advertising your business on Facebook, driving traffic to your BasedIn profile page. 

We've been going after agencies offering them a 15% commission on the ads instead of directly to businesses to try and get people to sign up. So far we met with one agency that had 200 clients, 25 of which were interested in hopping on board once we launch (which is today!). 

I would love any feedback you guys have on this ""cospend"" package. Positive or negative I just want to hear what business owners &amp; entrepreneurs think about it.

Thanks so much for any feedback you guys leave me we really appreciate it. I'm super excited for this project it's the largest startup I've been a part of and I can't wait to see how this summer ends once we are finished raising money. :)"

If you have the time, I would greatly appreciate answers to any of the questions posed below.
&amp;nbsp;

Hello all,

I have been browsing this sub for the past few months and I am now posting with the hope of gaining some advice regarding a possible career change into the field of web development. A little background for context: I am approaching the age of 30, have no dependents, reside in the U.S., possess a doctor of pharmacy degree, and have worked as a pharmacist for a number of years. Through my education and work experience, I have had sufficient exposure to my current career options to conclude that I made a huge mistake by pursuing a degree in pharmacy.

I was afforded the opportunity in high school (early 2000s) to take a web development / design course which I absolutely loved. This was the one subject matter in high school that sparked a genuine interest and desire to take learning outside of the classroom. Unfortunately, I followed the advice of others which resulted in me pursuing a college degree in pharmacy rather than a web-related career. I spent countless years in college studying around the clock followed by a number of years working as a pharmacist in a variety of high-stress and mind-numbing settings. I consider myself to be a creative person who enjoys solving problems and the world of pharmacy seems to be suffocating me in this regard. I honestly feel as if my career choice has destroyed me as a person and resulted in my loss of interest in most facets of life. Knowing that life is too short to spend doing things that make you miserable, I opted to leave the profession a month ago which brings us to my current predicament: where do I go from here?

Deciding on a new career path has not been easy (mainly because I am afraid of making another poor investment of time just as I did when settling on pharmacy). Looking back on the last decade has made me realize that my interest of learning how to create and develop web sites has remained constant. Unfortunately, I never had the time or energy to convert my interest into actual practice and I now feel overwhelmed with how much technology has changed and continues to change in regards to web development. I have started to re-learn HTML, learn CSS, and plan on following suit by learning JavaScript. I also have a small amount of experience with C and Python. With all of that being said, I would appreciate it if you guys wouldn’t mind answering the questions (or some of the questions) below.

**Education**

1. Will my doctor of pharmacy degree be of any benefit to me the field of web development (even if it may just help me get my foot in the door for interviews after I establish a portfolio)?

2. I feel under qualified without a technology related degree. Has anyone had experience with U.S. universities who offer online web development degrees?

3. Would a degree in web development be beneficial or is there another degree that would be of more benefit towards becoming a web developer? (I am a bit wary of a computer science degree - mainly because of the math courses required since I haven’t taken a math course in over 10 years)

**General / Lifestyle / Work environment**

4. Are you a front end developer, back end developer, or both?

5. Are you happy working as a web developer? Why or why not?

6. What do you wish others had told you before going into web development?

8. Would you say that you enjoy a good work-life balance? (ex: How many hours do you work during the week? How many hours outside of work do you use to educate yourself on new technologies? Is it normal to have to work on the weekend? Do deadlines cause you to frequently work long hours?)

9. Is your annual compensation enough to live without constantly worrying about financial crisis?

10. Do you ever worry about a surplus of web developers leading to a lack of employment opportunities in the future?

**Web Development / Technology**

11. What technologies should front end developers be comfortable working with?

12. What technologies should back end developers be comfortable working with?

13. What makes a good web developer?

14. What makes a web developer employable / desirable to hire?

15. Do you encounter bad web developers on a common basis? What can someone do to avoid becoming a bad developer?

16. Did you feel overwhelmed when you first started down the path of web development?

17. Besides creating web sites on my own, what other skillsets should I work on developing to become a respected web developer?

18. From the time that you started learning the basics of web development, how long did it take you to land your first job as a web developer (including intern or junior developer positions)?

Thanks!"
34o8lv,1,2015-05-02,Does anyone know what's happening to me?,solitary_marmoset,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/34o8lv/does_anyone_know_whats_happening_to_me/,"I'm a student in the UK and I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything. I have always been an anxious person who prefers solitude to large groups. I have always seen the world from a pessimistic viewpoint which is negative at best. I never thought that I would suffer from a mental health disorder but there is a history of it in my family. I was there for my long term girlfriend throughout her depression, which has since subsided.

My life has been pretty decent and I have no reason to complain. Yet in the last year my negative views and nervousness changed. I now feel that there is no point in anything anymore. Why bother? Life is hard and it doesn't get any easier, why not hide away from everything? 

My anxiety has lead to panic attacks and night terrors... I rarely sleep for more than two hours at a time anymore...

I have had suicidal thoughts but I never would.

I found myself locked away in my room for days because I didn't want to see anyone, I didn't want to go anywhere and I didn't want to do anything. I rarely attended university and lived off of what scraps of food I had in my room.

It was at this point I sought help. I spoke to my GP who gave me a number for my county wellbeing service. I went as far as an assessment but they halted halfway through stating that they couldn't help due to my moving between home and university. I got in contact with my university wellbeing service who have contacted NHS therapists, however, these appointments may have to be cancelled as I will be undergoing an internship elsewhere in the country.

Throughout this experience, after 3 lots of assessments, nobody has told me if I have a mental health illness. Nobody has told me what is wrong with me. My demon does not have a name and it makes me fear it more. Nobody seems to know what's going on or how to help me. I've been told to try various things but they don't help. It seems that everyone who should be helping is being lackadaisical about how they should help me.

I never asked for this... Whatever this is! I don't want it! I have no idea what is happening to me and I'm loosing my mind... It consumes me and rarely lets go... I'm a shell of my former self... The worst thing? The people put in place to help me have sent me from place to place offering no answers and little in the way of help... I don't know why I bothered..."

**COMMUNITYSTUCK, YEAR 2, DAY 9; 196 DAYS POST-CONDESCENSION**

I had gone down for a smoke and looked at my watch and realized ""Good Lord! I'm late for Communitystuck!"" 

You all have my sincerest apologies for this infraction.

I went ahead and put the full term ""Communitystuck"" in the title, as you may have noticed. I think this will be more inviting or eyecatching to newcomers who may not be informed as to what this is. If you *are* one of those people, see below.

My, but it's nice to have time to enjoy these for a change. It feels like busy season is so far behind me. I've done literally nothing all day. Well, I cleaned all of the nasty drink receptaples out of my room. It looks marginally better. 

This spring cleaning was triggered (hue hue) when I noticed that someone had come in to replace my towels and toilet paper. I was mortified that a stranger had seen my room in that condition, and my best homie is coming in in a week anyway.

I asked him what he was up to and he said he was at Memphis in May. Finals begin on Monday, the cheeky scrub! Still, I suppose it's best to let him do him. It's too late to scold him now; he's already bought the tickets.

I think I use too many semicolons. I just love them so much! And one of the rules of the writing is to [put semicolons everywhere.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR7uaIFVFiM) 

I think I'll start looking up showtimes for the new avengers flick. It's about time I saw that ol' thing. Don't spoil it for me! I almost let that happen when I noticed that Wikipedia had a plot summary up! God forbid!

[Most of us should know by now but others may not be informed that Communitystuck is a friendly place where we all gather to talk about our days and converse with one another, engaging in jolly socialization as we do! Take a minute to admire that run-on sentence and post a comment talking about your day, and then take another to start a conversation with someone else; that's the most important part of Communitystuck is talking to folks.](/kv)

Questions of the Day can be a valuable springboard into conversation, even if it just means you have a question to ask someone about their answer.

A german startup who is looking for a intern web developer seemed interested and I got an interview today. It went well and they said that tomorrow their current software developer is gonna test my PHP familiarity, that is the language that I'll be using during the intern. He said they are gonna give me 1 hour and a half to complete but if I encountered the problem before in the past I would take minutes. He called it php unit test.

34ohoq,6,2015-05-02,got denied. score went up. time to apply?,_class_,churning,https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/34ohoq/got_denied_score_went_up_time_to_apply/,"a follow up on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/32nowm/easy_cards_that_offer_primary_rental_insurance/).  soon after posting i realized that i had about 6 weeks before my internship started so i needed a credit card fast.  i applied for the AmEx BCE and surprise surprise, i got denied because:  ""The Profile report does not contain any tradelines that have been open for at least six (6) months. (Experian)""

&amp;nbsp;

plan A didn't work but i still had plan B...temporarily become an authorized user on one of my parents' credit cards.  i was added hassle free to their united mileageplus explorer and the next week when the card came in i realized that my CK score went up to 72x, and my oldest tradeline was now open for 2.25 years

&amp;nbsp;

so now i'm wondering...should i try signing up for the BCE again (or another credit card)?  there's a couple reasons why i'm thinking about this:

&amp;nbsp; 
1. i eventually need to apply for a new credit card.  after the summer i will no longer be an authorized user and my credit score will go back down.  at that point my only card would be my secured card which i need to get rid of ASAP due to its annual fee

&amp;nbsp; 
2. i will have to pay for a rental car and other expenses this summer.  in the fall semester my expenses will total less than $1000 across 6 months.  if i got a card with a ""spend x in y timeframe"" deal then i could take advantage of that over the summer.  i definitely would not be able to take advantage of that during the school year

&amp;nbsp; 

please let me know if this is/isn't reasonable.  thank you

&amp;nbsp; 

edit: didn't get anyone telling me that i shouldn't apply for a new card.  decided to check a few pre-approval links and the chase freedom was one of the few that came up.  got approved instantly!

edit2: i applied for the freedom instead of going to recon for the BCE because i was afraid that they would ignore the AU tradeline.  also, i was pre-approved for the CSP, freedom, and slate while AmEx hadn't pre-approved me for anything, so i felt like i had a better chance there"
34ov8k,5,2015-05-03,"Originally applied for Geek Squad Consulation Agent, was strangely offered Computer Sales. I wasn't entirely happy with it, but I took it anyway.",bestestbuy1,Bestbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bestbuy/comments/34ov8k/originally_applied_for_geek_squad_consulation/,"So... I'm majoring in network admin from a trade school and was taking two classes this semester regarding microcomputer maintenance and windows command line (not important for job, really). My IT professor for microcomp maint is actually a Geek Squad agent (only works to keep his certs). I figured I would surely get the job since I have a huge customer service background at call centers and the like with an excellent professional reference. Additionally, I could milk out the fact that I was being taught by a Geek Squad agent.

I worked on my resume and CL like crazy, and it must have been good because I got called in to interview by the manager of Geek Squad. The GS manager said he had 2 to interview the next day and one more the following (don't know how many he already interviewed). I got a little upset because I wanted to impress him with my technical troubleshooting knowledge, but he didn't ask me ANY technical questions (I studied for hours reading and re-reading my A+ book). 

It must've gone really well because I got called in for an interview with the GM three days later on Friday. Went in today (sat), and I thought the interview went really well. I think I made a fatal error when he asked what my greatest weakness is, and I said I only just started working hands on with computer troubleshooting in the past 3 semesters of college. 

At the end he said he wanted to offer me a job in Computer Sales (never applied for it) and said he thought I would be really good at it. He said I didn't have enough hands on troubleshooting experience and that I might be able to move into the position in the future. I guess what was nice is that he kept the pay rate the same ($11/hr) for the position, which is cool.

**tl;dr** read title

Questions:

*Do you think he went into the interview knowing what he wanted to do with me?*

 I feel really terrible at the thought I might have killed the GS job because I said I needed to work on my hands on experience. In my eyes I had everything BB would want in an employee... excellent references, great CS background, majoring in  IT, taught by a Geek Squad employee, etc. On the other hand, I think a lot of people applied so chances are someone might've already had their A+ or something, so maybe I'm being too hard on myself.

*Should I reasonably expect that I can move my way into Geek Squad?*

He never gave me any sort of time frame, which I can understand. He has no idea what kind of employee I am. But honestly, I'm an IT student. I don't have enough schooling in to snag a real internship, but I truly want to get my foot in the door!"

(I made this as short as I could),levismorbiform,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/34ox9p/am_i_wrong_i_made_this_as_short_as_i_could/,"I've never posted here before but I've been subscribed to this sub for a long time. I've just felt like I'm blowing things out of proportion here. I feel like maybe I've been the narcissist all along. This story is really long so I'll try to keep it as short as possible. I just need to know if I'm in the wrong here or not. 

After I got out of high school, I wanted to look for a job to support myself so I could go to college.

I was living with my mother and her live-in boyfriend at the time. Things started out normal. I would spend about four hours going to businesses and asking for applications and filling them out and handing them in. Then I'd go home and do whatever. But things slowly started getting more and more strict. I was supposed to start early and not quit until five pm. That was reasonable to me, but then soon five pm became nine pm and then nine pm became every waking hour. If I was home, I was filling out applications online and cleaning the whole house but I was only allowed home early mornings and in the evenings. When I was out, I was going to businesses. I had to walk for miles. One time I got lost after my mother drove me miles from home and I was made to walk back. It was my fault for getting lost. I was told I didn't pay enough attention. 

Even though I was waking up early and going to bed late, working to find a job all day, every day, it wasn't enough. I was never doing enough. I walked until my feet were swollen and bleeding. I even had to walk fourteen miles in one day in 110 degree heat. When I was sick, my mother and Les pushed me to keep looking for work. They would yell at me every night until I cried for not doing enough. Everything I was doing was wrong. Everything that went wrong in their lives seemed to be my fault. My mom broke a glass because she slammed the dishwasher in anger and it was my fault for not loading the dishwasher correctly. They would talk behind my back constantly, to the point where I developed paranoia about OTHER people. I thought everyone thought I was failure. I thought I was a failure. I began to have suicidal thoughts.

I have sever social phobia. I wanted so bad to get a job but every interview I got I barely managed to stutter through. I practiced interviewing all the time, but I just couldn't do it. On top of that, I had quite serious depression. I also have Asperger's, so it's hard for me to emote and smile and understand what people are trying to say to me. 

However, I did manage to get two part time jobs. I didn't have to interview for them, they were both basically automatic hire. I was so proud when I got them but my mom didn't even ask how my first day went. She and Les told me because they weren't full time jobs, they didn't count. So it was back to job searching in between my work days.

But I stopped looking. I moved in with my boyfriend at the time and supported myself with my two jobs. Eventually though, I broke up with him and was forced to quit work to move back in with my father, because my jobs weren't making enough to pay what other people were asking from roommates. 

After moving again, I went to vocational school. Pharmacy Tech program. I struggled immensely with the work and my suicidal thoughts worsened but I made it through until the mandatory internship. I didn't do very well at even dead end jobs. Being a pharmacy tech was impossible. I tried so hard but I wasn't learning fast enough. It was too much for me to understand. It was too much for me to do. I ended up having a complete emotional break down in the middle of the pharmacy. I was moved to a different one by my school. I tried to lessen the stress by doing less hours every day than I had been doing but eventually I had another breakdown and quit. My first thought in the morning and my last thought at night was about killing myself. I did eventually go back and finish the program and graduated, but I was fighting with my dad almost every day about getting a paying job and I attempted to take my own life on April 18th 2013. 

My dad called me in the mental ward to tell me I couldn't come home. I moved in with someone I met at the ward. That's another long story but suffice to say it didn't work out and two years after I had walked out of my mom's home promising myself I'd never go back, I moved back in with my mother. 

Things were exactly the same as before. Clean the house, no free time, do as we say and don't ask questions, find a job quickly. I had an SSI case almost a year in the making at that point. I decided I wasn't going to be treated the same way I was last time. I looked for work but I decided what a reasonable amount of job searching was and I did that, and I spent the rest of my time hiding from my mother and her boyfriend in Starbucks with my laptop. Things went down about as well as last time. They screamed at me all the time. I tried to make them understand how I was feeling. How I was trying to deal with severe depression and anxiety. How I tried to commit suicide. But they brushed it off. I hadn't tried hard enough to kill myself so it was obviously just a cry for help, whatever that means, and because I could talk to my friend on the phone, then that meant I didn't have social anxiety. Eventually my sister convinced my mother to kick me out during the holidays and I moved back in with my dad. My life is better now. My doctor is looking for meds to help me, I'm close to getting SSI, and I have some inheritance money I'm using to support myself. I want to work eventually but I know that I need some mental help before I can work again, lest I end up really killing myself. I just want to be normal, and I feel like I've been trying my best but I can't help but think my mother was just giving me tough love. After all, she did at least let me stay with her twice. Am I wrong? Am I being selfish? "
34oxy4,0,2015-05-03,Repost looking for more opinions please: Girl [23F] whom I [22M] have been dating is leaving for 7 months. Warning: Long Post,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/34oxy4/repost_looking_for_more_opinions_please_girl_23f/,"This is going to be extremely long as I want my whole background information out there about the situation. Need advice as well as huge venting session I really needed this. So please bare with me if you can I would seriously appreciate it redditors!!! I will supply a TL;DR at the end.

I am a [22M] she is a [23F]. We met in class 4 months ago at the beginning of the semester. Started off as just friends, but I told her I was interested in her about 2 months ago and to my surprise she was interested in me. This past week has been absolutely amazing. We have kissed, we went to the beach, dinner dates. Everything is so perfect.

Earlier this semester she had told me she applied for her Disney internship. She ended up getting accepted about a month ago and I was nothing but happy for her. I told her what a great opportunity it was and that this will be the best experience ever for her in her life. Doing something she loves.

About a week after getting accepted she told me her parents and her got into a fight about leaving. She said she regretted applying and did not want to leave for 7 months. She came to me for advice. I know I liked her and she liked me, but I did not want to be the reason she did not leave. So I assured her everything will be okay and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for her and to enhance her career. (I will not be the reason a girl stops her goals and dreams, it is how I am no matter how much I like her.)

So weeks go by, and we continue talking, hanging out, all that jazz. (no sex, I only do this with woman I am in relationships with.) We head to a bar together. Everything is fine she showed up first, I was about ten minutes late. We went with different parties of people. At the bar my insecurity shows and I regret it.

She is flirting with another guy (or really she was getting hit on and I am just dumb.) But this annoyed me so I avoided her. Skipping to when I leave (nothing happened in between.) I say bye to my friends who are sitting with her at a table and I casually say goodbye to her, no hug, nothing, cause at the time I was annoyed and it probably was not even her fault. It was mine for being insecure which was dumb.

She asks, ""Why are you being this way?"" I respond,"" You were flrting with mad guys and I am not about that so im leaving goodbye."" She grabs my arm and follows me to the door. She explains to me that she does not care about anyone at the bar besides me and that I distanced myself for no reason. To which I accepted and gave in and apologized. She also said she really liked me. I grabbed the back of her head and said if you like me kiss me. I grabbed the back her head and gave her a kiss (first one we had.) I leave and the night for me ends.

Next day we have class. Last class of the semester. class ends (nothing important happened in class.) She begins crying. She gives me a big hug and I tell her not to cry then leave. (we had plans for lunch after class after she went and picked up her belongings at her friends.) She texts me that she is on her way to come pick me up. We go to Red Robin and chat a bit, I tell her do not be sad, the semester is over and we are graduating its a celebration. She opens up and tells me that she is sad she won't see anyone. And that she wants me to keep in contact when she leaves for Disney. She said if I find another girl she would not be mad at me. She got teary eyed and I assured jher everything will be okay. The day ends and I get two kisses goodbye as I leave her car. (This made me so happy, but I can not help but feel helpless right now in my head.)

Next day comes which was yesterday, and I surprise her at her house. She was ecstatic that I stopped over to see her even though it was for about 35 minutes. We kissed numerous times, she told me how much she liked me and i told her the same. We shared some laughs and had a great time together in those 35 minutes.

This week is going to be a struggle because it is senior week, where all the seniors astay on campus and party,. I am seeing her tomorrow and most of next week as well.

Now to my problem. We are basically monogamous without saying it. I need to find this out (I am 99% sure we are.) She leaves for Disney from May16-Jan4. I am worried she will find someone else in Florida, or stay in Florida for her career. I really want to talk to her and express my feelings towards her about this subject, I am very worried about the things I have just posted, because I am a genuine guy and really would wait for this girl, but is trust an issue, infidelity, lying.... I have never been in this situation and it is literally eating me alive. I need to talkj to her tomorrow when I see her, do I just let out the truth? How do i approach the situation. I do want to have a great week, but if I feel i need to end this I feel like i should. My head is leave. But my heart is saying stay,. make this work, you are a great guy and she is a great girl.

Thank you for everyone who ended up reading this whole thing. I feel its a good little story, and I need some advice.

Thanks Reddit!!! you guys are the best.

TL;DR: Girl I basically have fallen in love with is leaving for Disney for 7 months and do not know how to approach feelings of this situation. How to make it work, ect... I would really like to try and make it work, but I feel like I cant do this... But I want someone with experience to convince me otherwise....

I have a low GPA: 2.6~

Have had aerospace internship experience (fortune 50 company) and held student jobs throughout college such as Information Technology Lab Assistant.

Late bloomer, decided that I want to work in tech/silicon valley after all. Initially, wanted to be a pilot/astronaut blah blah and so stayed committed my whole life and finished aerospace engineering. back then, i used to think: my mom is a software engineer, I don't want her job/life sitting at a desk/computer all day. Turns out, that's pretty much aerospace and most engineering jobs and most jobs as general.

Culture sucks in Aerospace industy, very old, very traditional, low pay, lots of bureaucracy and in terrible locations. I love the West Coast like Seattle and Bay Area.

So anyway, have decent programming experience and turns out that at companies likes SpaceX and Tesla, they hire a lot more software engineers anyway.

So, have been considering doing all sorts of things like a seconds bachelors in CS or CE but most good universities won't let you do a 2nd bachelors. Some smaller ones do let you. Now, I'm thinking a 2nd BS would just be a waste of time. I know theoretically, Masters CS programs do consider applications from non CS background but given GPA, programming experience and University attended, I don't think I have a good shot at regular Masters programs. This is where a degree like this from Georgia Tech comes in. Do all of you agree with my line of reasoning? Feel free to comment.

So reddit, can I get in? what are my chances as unpredictable as they are, if you had to say yes or no, what would you say? thanks! "

A run down of the relationship; 
Meet her in summer when coming back from an internship in order to finish my degree. All goes very quick and I discover she is a virgin (she was 20 at the time, me being 2 years older).

In order to avoid unnecessary drama I tell her straight up our relationship would most likely not survive graduation. She seems to agree and I feel relieved to have found such a seemingly understanding woman. Me focusing on school and generally being busy keeps her around as she lingers for attention like all females.

To my great surprise she never shit-tested me back then even though this school was a breeding ground for spoiled chads and the like. Come graduation (Christmas 2013), I let go in the kindest way possible as at this point I grew to like her for not being a bitch, becoming very kinky and generally being a great gal to have around. Might add she is from Venezuela and a solid upper 8 on my scale of preference and I admit it gave me a nice boost in confidence which I enjoyed.

Start work straight away January '14 (Pastry chef), have no time and no friends back in my home country as everybody else is still abroad. She decides to let me know how miserable she is without me and the usual story. Following my urges I agree to meet her in March as I head down anyways to participate in some post-graduation ceremony, 3 days of great sex and reconciliation follow. Back together this is now a LDR, something I dread since I have been there before.

She craves attention and needs me to talk to her and I readily comply as at this point I didn't mind some like minded and intimate conversation to relieve stress from work.

We meet on holidays and I allow her to spend two weeks at my place after she had to drop out of college due to financial problems (see Venezuelan economy). 

This is where I entirely fucked up and had no frame whatsoever as I ignored major red flags all along the route.    

*Her staying in bed all day watching useless shit.    

*Her clearly having lost direction and bringing up major plans to change (going from Hospitality management to Event management to Economics).    

*Her coming back from a trip to Venezuela with prescription antidepressants.    

*Her going from wanting daily sex and being submissive to having no sex drive whatsoever.    

*And finally the good old ""New haircut and color""    

At this point she had found a new university to attend in **Australia** while I was contractually obliged to stay in **Luxembourg** (go figure).    

I bid her farewell and offered her my friendship while secretly thinking ""Good riddance"" as my ROI was negative at this point and I didn't recognize her as the girl I first met. The reason I let go softly was because I had no intent on ruining her for other guys since I was **her** first intimate relationship and I sincerely believe more guys should have a slice of that cake since it was delicious cake.    

The response came within the first week of being apart and me not calling/texting her at all. Hate mail and the full program. **AWALT** :)

 [TL;DR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G4uYZF1IG4)   

After the final break up I stumbled upon TheRedPill and I am happier than ever before, my lifestyle improved greatly and I am very thankful to the community for all the content and discussions. Her e-mail was just a cherry on top of the cake of my recent success.

34pugw,0,2015-05-03,23 [M4A] - 10+ scenarios for you to choose from!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/34pugw/23_m4a_10_scenarios_for_you_to_choose_from/,"Pick a fantasy, any fantasy, or even a combination of some of them and send me a message with your kinks, limits, and what you'd want to include!

**Fairy in the Woods** - One day, you wandered a little too far outside the fairy lands and into the humans' part of the jungle...and that's where you saw me. As a fairy less than 100 years old, you haven't quite developed the resistance to humans that some of my kind have...so it turns out you have to grant you almost any wish I ask. Your powers are sexual in nature, and every spell you cast makes you more aroused...so the more wishes I make, the hornier and more uncontrollable you get too.

**The Real Magician** - I’ve just hired you, my new assistant, to aid in my performance. Little do you know that I actually practice *real* magic! I can hypnotize you, make your breasts swell or shrink, and make you grow a giant cock between your legs among other things. We can do this on stage in front of a large audience, or, if you prefer, it can be a practice run before we do the show.   

**Alien Orgy** - Exactly what it sounds like. Pick a universe, a set of aliens you’d like to use, and let the huge cocks, tentacles, giant breasts, antennae and whatever else go crazy in a hot, steamy orgy. I’m quite partial to the Star Wars universe for this, I’ve always wanted to have fun with a Twi’lek or a Togruta. Something about those tail-heads… WoW universe is also something I’d like to try!

**Goo Girl Made of Cum** - Yup, you read right! A girl made entirely out of cum. Sticky, slimy, and able to change shapes, you must consume cum in order to stay alive. Fortunately for you, you find me, a young man who is able to keep up with your needs. My loads are particularly massive, enough to satiate your desires. And if you ever get too much cum, your belly swells and, well, you can guess what happens next.

**Futa Fantasy** - Ever wanted to pound a girl with your huge cock? Well then this one is for you! I, a mad scientist, have created a serum which causes you to grow an enormous dick. In order to complete the experiment I let you try your new cock out on my young, tight intern. Watching makes me so horny I might just have to join in too.

**Bimbo Bonanza** - You could be a co-worker, neighbor, or just about anyone you like in this one. With one spray from a special chemical I’ve purchased your hair turns platinum blonde, your breasts grow ridiculously large, your clothes shrink, and you develop an insatiable craving for cock. You feel yourself becoming vapid, but the whole time, somewhere in the back of your mind, you are all there but unable to control yourself. 

**Sex Island** - Your boat is destroyed in a storm in the middle of the Pacific. As you come to consciousness you find yourself on a tropical island. As you explore the island you come across it’s inhabitants. Since it doesn’t seem like you’re getting off the island any time soon, you better get to know them. Just hope that the initiation ritual that all women must complete to be allowed into their tribe isn’t too crazy…

**Public Fuckpuppet** - As the mayor of a wealthy town I’m celebrating the opening of a new public square with the purchase of a fuck slave. You are to be strapped down on your back, completely naked with your legs and arms spread apart, in the middle of the square. Anyone may use you as they please, and if you survive the initial crowd you will be fed and your positions changed daily. We can start this one with you in a line up of slaves, and me looking for one to pick out for this job.

**Gym Milf** - I’ve always fantasized about that fucking hot, in shape woman who’s at my gym. She’s always wearing tight clothes that show off her curves and toned body. She’s always bending over in front of me, giving me smiles, I wonder if she has any idea how much I want to tear her clothes off and fuck her in the mens locker room. A place where she’d soon find herself with more cock and more cum than she could handle.

**Incest Extravaganza** - Sisters and mothers please enquire with a pm! I have a bunch of scenarios just for you!"
34pz3f,3,2015-05-03,"I [26 M] was broken up with by my 6 month [25F] girlfriend, and I don't know why",throwaway12423534532,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34pz3f/i_26_m_was_broken_up_with_by_my_6_month_25f/,"We met 6.5 months ago. She had been single for the past 2 years. I had been in another relationship that had ended some 6 months prior. She had been studying for some medical exams full time for 2 years (which you have to do, as a foreign graduate of a medical program, in order to be licensed in the US). So I was funding our dating the entire time, and actually never asked her for anything, though she made clear she was more than happy to help.

She later told me that she was looking for a way to hurt herself, and that that was why chose to start dating again. She would do things like smoke, eat a ton of donuts, stop exercising and writing in her journal, cut people out of her life for relatively minimal reasons (things that were fixable, which could have been worked on). We got in to some bdsm stuff. She took to it... very heartily. She started calling me her owner and got really excited about me piercing her clit, and about orgasm denial. 

She would later go on to deciding that the bdsm was too energy intensive, and she stopped it. Aside from the bdsm, we had a great relationship, and had many similar values, perspectives, drive, interests etc. We would go on hikes, spend days together (and occasionally nights). We had made many plans for the future. That said, I do believe that she was as close to a soulmate as I've ever experienced. Our connection was incredible. 

She decided she wanted to break up some 2 months ago, but we talked about it and I talked her out of it. Her reasoning was, to the best of my knowledge, the bdsm, and the amount of energy it took. She also reasoned that she would never be able to make me happy, as I'd expressed that I'd want a couple of things, specifically, to get married and have kids and live together. She felt that she would never want to have kids, as she did not want to pass on her depression. She also felt that she would never get married if not for kids, and that she would want to have 2 apartments/houses, even if we were married. In order for her to keep at it though, she made me agree to one condition: if she ever wanted to leave the relationship, at any point, for any or no reason, I would have to accept it no questions asked.

As I mentioned, we talked through the breakup 2 months ago and went on. She has been doing an internship for the past few weeks. She has been expressing recently that she would be more ok with living together if she had alone time, and a room to herself, if we got a 2 bedroom apt. Over the past few weeks, she'd been expressing that shed been working so much that she didn't have time for herself. We hardly talked for days on end. I've been working hard as well, and have been lonely. She told me over the past week that initially, we could spend the weekend together. Then it was down to one day. Then, maybe one day. Then she was still tired yesterday and I told her we could just see each other next weekend.

She said I'd been making her feel guilty, and like she was constantly disappointing me, and that I've been being too needy. She said I'd pressured her on living together, though she'd made clear that she was open to it. She said I'd broken many things in her. She said she'd secretly met up with 6 people who she did some bdsm stuff with, getting beaten up and slapped, after she'd stopped doing it with me, saying that I was the one who stopped and that I was to blame for the fact that she needed a more intense form of sex. She also said that the past 2 months had been worse than before, and a nightmare. I think that this was because I had been hoping for a future still. 

I brought her flowers and a letter explaining myself and why I felt we were better together than apart, and left her last night, leaving them by her door without seeing her. She said it was proof that I was pressuring her, and that I never let her make decisions. To be clear, I feel that I've changed my perspective and shifted towards what she's wanted on at least as many important topics while we've been together. 

I'm in shambles. I feel that I've lost the real love of my life, and that maybe it couldve gone differently if I'd acted differently throughout. She says she can be friends now, but I don't want that. I love her too much.

**tl;dr**: Love of my life flip flops, tells me I'm needy for wanting to have a date once a week, she cheats on me, tells me I am asking too much of her and made me promise to not ask questions if she wanted to leave the relationship at any time for any or no reason at all."

I'm doing an internship where I want to determine the costs per customer. The company i'm doing my internship at delivers cloud services to other businesses. Services they provide are: server virtualization, SAN storage/backup, firewall protection, anti-virus/mallware, e-mail security, token authentication etc. It's pretty hard for me to explain in English since I live the Netherlands and my study is business administration, so I don't really have any experience with the entire ICT/cloud computing subject.

As I see it now, customers can buy combination of services where they login on their thin clients to make use of their business applications and storage etc. provided by our datacenters. The first step of my plan is to make an inventarisation of our current hardware/software. The next step would be to describe all the services provided by our company and make a list of all the customers and their contracts. Then I'd try to make the link between the hardware/software and the specific customers to determine the costs per customer.

Is there anyone who has experience with chargeback models or Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) within the cloud computing sector?"

-My dad

Hello, I'm an 18 year old with a need for some advice. My dad has been pulling stuff like this on me for as long as I can remember and I'm fed up with it. I'm wrapping up my freshman year of college with a 3.0 in a computer science major and a job as a student intern in IT at my local EMS. I've been considering moving away and finding an apartment with my friends near my university. Is that a good idea? I'm just so tired of dealing with him. My mom is the nicest, most caring person on Earth and I have no clue why she married this man. I realize there's a point where he is just trying to encourage me to be my best, but I think he's taking it too far. What should I do? Any and all help would be most appreciated."

Firstly, there's TL;DR at the bottom of this text for those who don't have much time to read.

I'm an international student studying in the UK, first year undergraduate engineering, who is yet to be 100% sure about what career path to take.

To explain the context why I am considering to take 2 masters in similar area, I must go back to my secondary school period. My secondary school was rated one of the best in the UK and I had high expectations in my academic performance that I was aiming for Cambridge and Oxford, but due to family circumstances I had totally missed my study period-got into somewhat a few levels lower graded university by clearing (clearing is just like begging to get in).

I managed my first year course pretty well that I AM already offered a MEng in the university that I currently am. The advantage of taking this MEng course over MSci is that:
1.it's a lot cheaper than MSci, MAst and MPhil etc.
2.the course contains a year out in industry placement. One thing important here is that I cannot take a voluntary year out for a year in placement like others, because I am currently preparing for a permenant VISA application and also my home country is under conscription. This is probably the only opportunity for an internship longer than 6 months during my education.

However, I am concerned that this university is not well recognised in my home country; which may affect my career path. Therefore I am also considering about taking another master's degree, preferably research, in other universities that are rated higher, like Cambridge or Oxford (Of course, only if I get in), so that I 

Enough with explaining the background. I am in process of decision making of which path to take, listed below; I cannot judge which one may be considered the best. I have been researching on this subject a lot, but also advices from who had experiences will greatly help me!
1.Do MEng only
2.Don't do MEng, and just go for other masters in other universities
3.Do MEng first, then do another masters in other universities.


TL;DR: 
Concerned with the choices right above this TL;DR. MEng offers me industrial placement which is a very good opportunity for me. However, I also want to do other masters at better university, because they are rated higher.


Thank you guys!"

First, the only reason I'm allowing myself to post this question though it's been asked before, is that it's the time of year when I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking it. 

I'm a month away from finishing college (taking advanced Web Dev and Programming)  It signals a huge career change for me.  I was the head chef in a restaurant prior to returning to school.  

I have made a portfolio site, am currently developing a blog site from scratch, have a fully(mostly) functioning android app - with a companion web app that will be finished this week.  
I have attended industry social events, and even presented at one. 

I have a one month internship with a start-up that I am dying to work for. *Everything* that I have seen from the group and what they stand for, is something I can wholeheartedly get behind. The lead architect asked me to brush up on JavaScript and DOM manipulation prior to the internship.  I have done my best (and am continuing to ) to work on JS as much as I can while finishing up school - though I feel pretty weak with it still.  I know that the start-up is looking to expand by a few programmers this year, so it's not *impossible* that they would keep me on. 

**So the question is**  
All things considered, what can/should I do/be doing, to help increases my chances of getting hired on at the end of the internship?    Grab your sculptors tools and mould me.

Thanks in advance folks!  Know that I will find a way to apply all of your advice.

34q8im,0,2015-05-03,How do I [32/M] Leave My GF of 5 Years [31F] for my crush [24F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34q8im/how_do_i_32m_leave_my_gf_of_5_years_31f_for_my/,"When I write that title out it makes me feel like a complete and total scumbag, but I promise this isn’t the case. First thing first some background for context: 

I will spare you the details but we drifted apart and never broke up. She has expressed a desire to get married, have kids, and we have had many painful conversations about our next step. She wants to move back to our home state, but a different city. I do not. I know I would not be happy. I am aware of what I need to do but I just haven’t done it. The last year has been especially brutal. No sex, minimal intimacy otherwise, we go to bed separately, we watch TV separately; we don’t go out together except to run errands or get dinner. I am over this relationship. I want to end it but I won’t since I feel responsible for her moving here and would feel immense guilt for abandoning her. 

Now for the next part: We took a trip home to see her family about two months ago where it began PAINFULLY clear to both of us that we couldn’t be happy living there together. I think something finally clicked in her mind and mine. The weekend after that I went out with a large group of coworkers for the first time in a very long time and I basically remembered what it was like to enjoy myself. Over the course of the next month something happened. She made plans out of town for 3 out of 4 weekends without me. She went to visit friends in another city, went to a wedding without me, and went home to see her family. 

Over the past two months I began talking to a coworker [24/F] I have always thought was cute. Now, when I say coworker I don’t mean that in the typical sense. We both work in a very professional atmosphere (not to denigrate any other profession) as consultants with a common client. She doesn’t work for me, I don’t work for her, and we don’t share bosses or anything like that. Basically we collaborate on common projects and are housed in the same office. We have technically known each other for almost two years but never communicated with anything other than a hello in passing. During this one particular project about 2 months ago I began to defend her work to very critical coworker for no other reason than she was right and he was wrong and I was the person in the position to correct him, so I did. She then started to email me to say things like “thanks for sticking up for me” whenever I would do something similar. This led to an occasional gchat conversation about work, then about a month ago everyone in the office was invited to play on an out-of-office sports league. We both had a mutual interest in playing so we started chatting about the team, why we like the sport and so on. 

Next next step: after we had been gchatting for a couple weeks I casually (and intentionally) mentioned my gf was going to be out of town (visiting friends in another city after our disastrous trip home). She mentioned how she really wanted to practice but couldn’t do where she lived. I took the bait and invited her out to my part of town and she eagerly accepted. I chickened out of actually making plans and texted her some story about why, we ended up texting the entire night. So the next day I got the courage to ask her again to come out for practice and she did. We ended up hanging out for a few hours before I went home. One thing led to another and in the past two weeks since we first met outside of work we have texted each other like whoa (though not daily or at any time other than on the weekend). After the first game on the sort of office sports team she and I went to get dinner. Basically she blew me away, we were at this café for several hours, had dinner, a couple drinks and some really deep and meaningful conversation. After I got home she texted me some more and we had even more conversation until falling asleep. 

A couple days later we went to a happy hour together with work people. She was giving me CLEAR signals that she was into me (subtle touching, putting her leg against mine under the table). She is very aware of the possible inappropriate nature of any sort of office relationship and has made an effort to not be obvious around coworkers. So when another coworker needed someone to walk home with she left. She made sure to tell me she would come back if I wanted her to (which obviously I did). She ended up taking way longer and I was the only one left so I texted and told her I would go home. She wrote back and said she could still come back if I wanted her to (I did but I told her wouldn’t smart, she agreed but told me she wanted to). After all this we have snuck out of work for afternoon coffee twice, gone to lunch together, and made plans to go to a movie screening two weeks from now.  

I am telling you ALL of this to give you the full context of my unfulfilled relationship and my excitement about the possibility of a new one. I wanted to get out the full story for my own sake (feels good to write it out) and also to show that I am not thinking about leaving the love of my life for a young intern that smiled at me once. 

What I really need advice on is how do I do it? How do I actually do it?

TLDR: How do I actually leave my gf, whom I live with in a loveless relationship, to pursue someone I am sure is interested in me?

34qbrp,1,2015-05-03,[18/m]needs helps with girl[18'f],Jjsmith_throw_away,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/34qbrp/18mneeds_helps_with_girl18f/,"So, let me give you a little background. Two weeks ago was my senior class trip. This is a tradition at our school where any seniors can go with the entire class to Washington d.c. for a week. On the trip, the girl I had asked to our senior prom, (who I had asked simply as friends), and I got very close. We started doing everything together during the trip, often going off by ourselves, and I, (and all of both mine and her friends) definitely thought we had something special going on. Now this girl, is a girl I have known for a very long time, I met her in the sixth grade, and we have always been very close friends. She could always tell me what was going on in her life, and I was always so comfortable around her. And the best part is we connected intellectually. Were both high level A.P. students, and we both often find it hard to connect to people who don't see eye to eye with us intellectually

The day we got back from the trip, I asked her out to dinner, she enthusiastically said yes. So we went on a dinner date. It was literally amazing, we ate at a restaurant attached to the mall, and then we just walked around the mall talking. We just talked for a good couple hours, we were connecting even better than we ever had. I know that we both felt something then that night, and all of her friends who I have been talking too tell me I’m right. So we leave the mall, and we just decide to drive around and we talk some more, eventually we stop at a local dam with a nice park around it and campsite. Its actually a really cool place. We go sit on a bench overlooking the roaring water coming out from the dam, and I kiss her. She kisses me back, and we just sit there for a while hugging. I kissed her twice and then we got back in my truck and left. After that we went back to her house and were going to watch a movie. We bring Netflix up and start watching her movie, when her best friend, (who is also one of my best friends), who she had been texting decided to come over with her boyfriend. I’m not mad, they’re both really good friends of mine, and we all sit there talking and watch the movie together. Well finally I have to leave, so she walks me out to my car, we have a really long hug, then she looks up into my eyes and I kiss her goodbye. 

All the next week were texting every day. We don’t get a chance to hang out again or see each other very much during the week due to us both being in sports. We have a class together and I talk to her then a little when I get the chance. But the first time we spend any real time together since that night was last night, at our senior prom. Pictures and dinner go well, but I could tell she was a little distant, I didn’t know what it was. I just brush it off and don’t think too much about it. At dinner I’m looking at her Instagram, and I notice a picture of a letter she received and posted. I ask her about it, and she tells me she got a letter from a friend of hers this week who was off at basic training. I didn’t enquire more into it. 

Another large thing I should probably mention now, is that she has a summer internship in India. She leaves at the end of june and doesn’t get back until late august. Also she then moves into college six days later. She is going to a college that is about three hours away from the one in going too. 

So we get to the dance and do the grand march and stuff, for a little bit were back like we were before, joking around a lot and talking. At the dance, she just seemed distant. She really wasn’t into dancing at all with me, (we did slow dance and that was fine). Finally during one of the slow dances, as were dancing, I pull her off from the main crowd to talk. At this point we haven’t had any conversation as to what was between the two of us. I ask her what she saw between us. And she starts going off on how she’s scared to start something so soon before basically going to India, where she’ll have very limited communication with the outside world (essentially only email every few days for a short amount of time.) I told her I understood, but I would wait for her to come back. She then went about how in college we would be far away, as she’s going to college about five hours from home, and about two hours from where I’m going. I told her we could easily make it work. We went on talking about it for a few more minutes, and at one point I even asked her to be my girlfriend. It wasn’t weird or even out of place because when I said it, it was at a point in the conversation where it would have made sense. I leave it at that, as it was time to take the class picture, and I talk to one of her best friends about it. She then proceeds to tell me about the letter she got that week. The letter is from an old boyfriend, who she dated over a year ago, he had gone off to basic, and apparently they had been writing letters every week while he was there. After the picture was done, I go talk to her again, I ask him about this guy. They had dated a year ago, but had broken up. They broke up because they lived a couple hours away, and when school started up they couldn’t see each other regularly. He was ok with this as he wanted to drive several hours one way every weekend to see her, this kind of freaked her out, as she has sorta has commitment issues. It wasn’t that she didn’t like him, it was that she gets freaked out by stuff like that, she feels as if she can’t handle it because she would be worrying about someone else’s feelings from a distance. 

I leave it at that. To me it wasn’t a definite no, but defiantly not a yes. After post prom, I’m driving her home, I bring it up again and we talk really as to what happened between those two and how she felt again. When he went to basic, they had been broken up for six months, but they had remained close friends. For some reason or another, his parents were unable to see him off at the gate, so she waited with him. Right before he left he told her that he still had feelings for her, and left it at that. Didn’t say more or less.  They began writing while he was at basic, but it wasn’t flirty or anything of the sorts, they simply wrote about stuff that was happening, nothing really romantic, according to her. Well he gets back in ten days. I blatantly told her that I won’t be her second choice, so telling her she would have to pick.   She doesn’t know what she wants, she definatly  doesn’t know if she wants to be with him, because they want two very different things in life, he wants to take over the family farm right out of college, and she wants to go off and save the world. During college I would be closer to her, and my life goals are more aligned with hers. 

I’m pretty sure I love this girl, and I would do anything to be with her. She really is different than anything I have ever felt before. I really believe that she could feel the same way, if only there wasn’t all of this life b.s. going on. So, my question to you reddit is, how should I fight for this girl. I cant pressure her, because that will scare her, but I will fight for her, all I need to know reddit is how?

tl;dr: too long go read it.

Looking for intense 3 month program,99Dilemmas,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/34qmgt/what_would_you_do_if_you_had_2_hours_a_day_to/,"I will have 3 months this summer away from family, friends, and school work while I intern away from home.

I want to dedicate this 3 months to making as much progress as I can on strength and fitness in general.

I have been doing the beginner routine for 4 months now and really like it.

To give you an idea of where I am now, here are some stats:  

* 5'11 / 157 pounds
* 3x8 Pseudo Planche with small lean
* 3x6 inclined row (15 degree angle maybe? near horizontal)
* 3x3 chin up, (3x6 if I use resistance band assist)
* 3x8 deep dips
* 3x8 box pistol (sit on a box around 8 inches high)
* 3x30s tucked l sit

I was wondering if I could add / change anything now that I will have a lot more time.

My goals are to get rid of remaining body fat (I still have a bit left) and put on muscle in my upper body (muscular legs and scrawny arms looks strange)"
34qmyh,230,2015-05-03,I hereby declare Summer 2015 the Summer of Gainz,mslighthouse,gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/34qmyh/i_hereby_declare_summer_2015_the_summer_of_gainz/,"Edit: I've received a lot of really good feedback in regards to the spreadsheet. Relatively positive and I'm surprised by how many people are committing themselves and writing down their intents!

That being said, one recommendation I had was to put dedicated check days in. You'll find them after the Goals columns. They're every two weeks starting with May 16 coming right up all the way until August 22. My end goal is to then make some awesome statistics on how the summer for gainit goes! I'll take any more awesome suggestions for the spreadsheet

- TODO: I'm going to work on a lbs and kg columns for each, so you can input into whichever unit one you wish and have the result for others to see (so KGs can be seen as LBS and vice versa). I have finals this week but when I have a chance I'll implement them.

Edit: Fear not. I have a script that auto-saves versions before massive changes. And will be doing regular saves / checking to make sure nobody fucks with the spreadsheet too much during the summer. Hence why I advise also keeping personal spreadsheets. Y'all can do it!

Edit: Looks like this is gaining some awesome traction.

It seems a lot of us have summer goals (whether to bulk, cut, or improve shape and whatnot).

So I've created a spreadsheet to help with everybody organizing their goals, and show that we as a community can encourage each other. I feel more inclined to try and keep with something knowing that others are doing it too. It can be a huge motivator. 

Anybody is free to access and edit the spreadsheet here: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qSJ9z0qo3FTyK-PrUyIZ7g6VKeBfnvqWjkMGRcseo-8/edit?usp=sharing

I'll keep the spreadsheet on and save it at the end. I also encourage everyone to keep their own spreadsheets with more specific improvements (bench, squats, deadlift, personal goals, etc). Keep it classy, gainit. Let's go Summer 2015!

ORIGINAL POST:

Alright gainit, so here's the deal. I'm tired of being small. I'm in shape, but most of what I do is more cardio intensive. I'm no stranger to the gym or weights, but I've never fully stuck with a bulking program and diet. Longest I tried was 3 weeks total before going back to what I normally do. 


This summer, I have the opportunity to stay in my college town to work full time (well, a part time job and another part time internship that makes for full time job total) rather than go back 12 hours away to my home state (now in AL, but from VA). My college has a full Rec center not even 5 minutes away that I'm able to use while back in Va I have the closest gym a 25 minute drive way. 


So, my first summer away from home, my first full time job (the two are in the same field), my first time to have a true self-improvement couple of months. No better time for me to try and stay with a true bulk. 


Here's where I am now, or at least as of recent (bout a month ago):

Age: 20

5'11""

144 Pounds

Bench : 3x5 115

Squat : 3x5 185

DeadLift : 1x5 245


I have looked into my TDEE and counting calories but I recently got into slow cooking (Amazing!!) and have been on a see-food-eat-food style diet. I can't say I sit down and calculate calories but I'm sure I hit what I need every day and am looking into protein supplements to help with going over my recommended TDEE.


I'm relatively skinny and not aesthetic, so I'm planning to bulk for now and work on my physical aesthetics. My ultimate goal is to be somewhere around 170-185. I know this won't happen over just a summer, but this is where I declare my intent and purpose to stick with it to the end of the summer, and then beyond when classes start back up again. 


Here's to the Summer of Gainz 2k15, dudes. Anybody else in?"

I would like to thank you in advance for reading this wall of text.

---

I’m not exactly sure why I created a throwaway as this post is going to be revealing, but I feel as if you would need some of the specifics to get a good idea. I will try to keep it as short as possible. If you need any additional details, please ask.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 ½ years. We have been living together for the last 2 ½ years. We met online and were in a long distance relationship until we graduated high school and moved in together in a city three hours from my family, five hours from his, and attended different universities. I graduated last year as I did my first two years of college when I was in high school. I was fortunate enough to get a job with the same company I did my senior internship with immediately after graduating.  Maybe this has something to do with my feelings of wanting to end things. I am only 22 and have started my career, but subconsciously might translate to me wanting some freedom to not feel like my life is already beginning to come to an end. 

My boyfriend still has two years of university left after this quarter ends. His advisor in community college advised him to go for the wrong AA, even though my boyfriend had informed him of his chosen major. Because of this, my boyfriend had to tack on an extra year to his schooling. I’m telling you all this because it pertains to why I feel we need to break up.

Also – this is the first serious relationship both of us have had. We have only ever had sex with each other. We were each other’s firsts on a lot of things. 

Before I continue,  I do want to say that my boyfriend is a good person. He is very, very smart and loving. I learn something new from him every day. His parents are the most kind people I have ever met and I love them as much as I do him (which makes this even harder). Although we live a tightly budgeted life, we still manage to make the most of things and play a lot of games together, try to go see movies when they are cheaper on Tuesdays, etc. He says a lot how much he loves me and how much he knows he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and how I make him so amazingly happy that he doesn't need anyone else.

Which makes me feel guilty about writing this.

Although things have been pretty steady throughout our relationship and continue to be, I am not happy. I am not exactly sure why, but last night we got in a big fight that led into a lot of crying and me saying that as much as I love and care about him, I can’t help but feel I want my own space and to become my own person.

We have been together since we were 17 years old, I told him. We never got the chance to establish ourselves as individuals. We have never experienced anyone else, both relationship wise and sexually. I got out every couple weekends and nothing happens, not even grinding/dancing with other men, but I also see all of these other people my age, free to do as they please in the single life, and I can’t help but be jealous about that.

Because of my boyfriend’s inexperience in relationships, there are things that he is neglectful about. Such as small gestures (surprising me with a clean house, taking me out to dinner, buying me chocolates) which I completely understand as he is still in university, working part time a couple days a week due to an all day school schedule, and we’re pretty tight on money.

However, I am at a different point in my life than he is. I can’t help but wish that if the world was rainbows and cotton candy, we can reconnect after he’s finished his schooling and experienced more in relationships, then we can try again.

But I know him – there is a high chance that I won’t talk to nor see him again if we were to break up and move on our separate ways.  This saddens me because I want the best for him and to see him grow into his own person; mature. We also have a dog together, that we have established as my dog as I bought her and pay for all her medical expense such as shots, flea medicine, etc. He occasionally pays for a hair cut, food, and toys but we both know she will be coming with me if we move on.  I just don’t want no-contact forever (the first couple months, I understand) especially because I know he’s going to miss her, he loves her, and she will miss him, I would like her to see him, even if it’s a random day at a time. I know this is the norm, but I care and love him. But I also can’t help but feel this urge to experience some things on my own while I am still in my 20’s. 

I don’t know why I posted this. I have a feeling that this is really the end. It’s not mutual, I’m the one who has vocalized that it may be time for a break up. He left this morning while I was still sleeping, assuming to go see his best friend and get a better idea on what to do. And here I am, looking for some advice. 

I guess what I’m asking is if it’s really as scary as it feels. If there’s any possible way to make my feelings of wanting to be socially and sexually free go away (like, reassessing the relationship and fixing things?) or will that only happen after we have had space and I have had time to experience what I feel I am missing out on. I’ve been on and off crying all night and this morning because I’m scared. I’m scared that if we break up, with a high chance of never talking again. We have been through so much together and grew so much together. I don’t know what it’s going to be like when I am by myself. It’s even harder because my family is three hours away. I have friends down here, but I cannot move home as I have established my career down here. 

Is this really the end? Or am I making a big mistake throwing away something good just so I can experience things I feel I am missing out on? 

This got really long, so I am ending it here. Please keep it kind, I’m an emotional wreck. I would really like some solid advice, especially from those who are older than me with more experience or even those my age who have experienced the same thing.

TL;DR – After 4.5 years together, my boyfriend and I are on the verge of a break-up which is completely my doing as I have this strong desire to be single and experience things I haven’t yet while I am still in my twenties. "

I posted here for advice when I began my programming course, and you were all so helpful.  I took it all to heart and apply every chance I have. 

First, the only reason I'm allowing myself to post this question though it's been asked before, is that it's the time of year when I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking it.
I'm a month away from finishing college (taking advanced Web Dev and Programming) It signals a huge career change for me. I was the head chef in a restaurant prior to returning to school.

I have made a portfolio site, am currently developing a blog site from scratch, have a fully(mostly) functioning android app - with a companion web app that will be finished this week.

I have attended industry social events, and even presented at one.

I have a one month internship with a start-up that I am dying to work for. Everything that I have seen from the group and what they stand for, is something I can wholeheartedly get behind. The lead architect asked me to brush up on JavaScript and DOM manipulation prior to the internship. I have done my best (and am continuing to ) to work on JS as much as I can while finishing up school - though I feel pretty weak with it still. I know that the start-up is looking to expand by a few programmers this year, so it's not *impossible* that they would keep me on.

**So the question is:**
All things considered, what can/should I do/be doing, to help increases my chances of getting hired on at the end of the internship? Grab your sculptors tools and mould me.

34qs4u,1,2015-05-03,I need help Desperately!,FJSMITTY_THROW_AWAY,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/34qs4u/i_need_help_desperately/,"So, let me give you a little background. Two weeks ago was my senior class trip. This is a tradition at our school where any seniors can go with the entire class to Washington d.c. for a week. On the trip, the girl I had asked to our senior prom, (who I had asked simply as friends), and I got very close. We started doing everything together during the trip, often going off by ourselves, and I, (and all of both mine and her friends) definitely thought we had something special going on. Now this girl, is a girl I have known for a very long time, I met her in the sixth grade, and we have always been very close friends. She could always tell me what was going on in her life, and I was always so comfortable around her. And the best part is we connected intellectually. Were both high level A.P. students, and we both often find it hard to connect to people who don't see eye to eye with us intellectually.

The day we got back from the trip, I asked her out to dinner, she enthusiastically said yes. So we went on a dinner date. It was literally amazing, we ate at a restaurant attached to the mall, and then we just walked around the mall talking. We just talked for a good couple hours, we were connecting even better than we ever had. I know that we both felt something then that night, and all of her friends who I have been talking too tell me I’m right. So we leave the mall, and we just decide to drive around and we talk some more, eventually we stop at a local dam with a nice park around it and campsite. Its actually a really cool place. We go sit on a bench overlooking the roaring water coming out from the dam, and I kiss her. She kisses me back, and we just sit there for a while hugging. I kissed her twice and then we got back in my truck and left. After that we went back to her house and were going to watch a movie. We bring Netflix up and start watching her movie, when her best friend, (who is also one of my best friends), who she had been texting decided to come over with her boyfriend. I’m not mad, they’re both really good friends of mine, and we all sit there talking and watch the movie together. Well finally I have to leave, so she walks me out to my car, we have a really long hug, then she looks up into my eyes and I kiss her goodbye. 

All the next week were texting every day. We don’t get a chance to hang out again or see each other very much during the week due to us both being in sports. We have a class together and I talk to her then a little when I get the chance. But the first time we spend any real time together since that night was last night, at our senior prom. Pictures and dinner go well, but I could tell she was a little distant, I didn’t know what it was. I just brush it off and don’t think too much about it. At dinner I’m looking at her Instagram, and I notice a picture of a letter she received and posted. I ask her about it, and she tells me she got a letter from a friend of hers this week who was off at basic training. I didn’t enquire more into it. 

Another large thing I should probably mention now, is that she has a summer internship in India. She leaves at the end of june and doesn’t get back until late august. Also she then moves into college six days later. She is going to a college that is about three hours away from the one i'm going too. 

So we get to the dance and do the grand march and stuff, for a little bit were back like we were before, joking around a lot and talking. At the dance, she just seemed distant. She really wasn’t into dancing at all with me, (we did slow dance and that was fine). Finally during one of the slow dances, as were dancing, I pull her off from the main crowd to talk. At this point we haven’t had any conversation as to what was between the two of us. I ask her what she saw between us. And she starts going off on how she’s scared to start something so soon before basically going to India, where she’ll have very limited communication with the outside world (essentially only email every few days for a short amount of time.) I told her I understood, but I would wait for her to come back. She then went about how in college we would be far away, as she’s going to college about five hours from home, and about two hours from where I’m going. I told her we could easily make it work. We went on talking about it for a few more minutes, and at one point I even asked her to be my girlfriend. It wasn’t weird or even out of place because when I said it, it was at a point in the conversation where it would have made sense. I leave it at that, as it was time to take the class picture, and I talk to one of her best friends about it. She then proceeds to tell me about the letter she got that week. The letter is from an old boyfriend, who she dated over a year ago, he had gone off to basic, and apparently they had been writing letters every week while he was there. After the picture was done, I go talk to her again, I ask him about this guy. They had dated a year ago, but had broken up. They broke up because they lived a couple hours away, and when school started up they couldn’t see each other regularly. He was ok with this as he wanted to drive several hours one way every weekend to see her, this kind of freaked her out, as she has sorta has commitment issues. It wasn’t that she didn’t like him, it was that she gets freaked out by stuff like that, she feels as if she can’t handle it because she would be worrying about someone else’s feelings from a distance. 

I leave it at that. To me it wasn’t a definite no, but defiantly not a yes. After post prom, I’m driving her home, I bring it up again and we talk really as to what happened between those two and how she felt again. When he went to basic, they had been broken up for six months, but they had remained close friends. For some reason or another, his parents were unable to see him off at the gate, so she waited with him. Right before he left he told her that he still had feelings for her, and left it at that. Didn’t say more or less.  They began writing while he was at basic, but it wasn’t flirty or anything of the sorts, they simply wrote about stuff that was happening, nothing really romantic, according to her. Well he gets back in ten days. I blatantly told her that I won’t be her second choice, so telling her she would have to pick.   She doesn’t know what she wants, she definatly  doesn’t know if she wants to be with him, because they want two very different things in life, he wants to take over the family farm right out of college, and she wants to go off and save the world. During college I would be closer to her, and my life goals are more aligned with hers. 

I’m pretty sure I love this girl, and I would do anything to be with her. She really is different than anything I have ever felt before. I really believe that she could feel the same way, if only there wasn’t all of this life b.s. going on. So, my question to you reddit is, how should I fight for this girl. I cant pressure her, because that will scare her, but I will fight for her, all I need to know reddit is how?

A requirement of my independent study is that I do so under the supervision/direction of an individual or company - either as an intern or just a mentor-ee.

Now the down side is that it's very poorly paid - 300 euros per month - compared to American standards (13-20$/h).

I did a follow up with the few leads I have, but nothing yet.

Is it worth taking such a low paid internship or just do projects on my own this year, like an app, and work at some grocery store?

34rj50,78,2015-05-03,The girl behind the counter,imbackagainbros4,DarkFuturology,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkFuturology/comments/34rj50/the_girl_behind_the_counter/,"This summer, she’ll be 23. She’s working hard, much harder than I am. I’m not quite sure how she manages to put up with my lazy ass. You might say she deserves better. Not an investment banker perhaps, because the ones who haven’t been replaced by computer algorithms are in their 60s now, about the same age as the last journalists, computer programmers and taxi drivers. Nonetheless, I’d imagine she’d like me to spend my time more productively.

Growing up as a teenager, I didn’t expect there would be any taxi drivers left in the country by the year 2027, but an entire generation of tourists who grew up watching American movies expects to have the privilege of commandeering these old men when they visit New York city. This is what these Indian tourists associate with American culture, the privilege of getting to yell at men who have less prestigious jobs. I blame the outsourcing of help desk jobs. Most taxi drivers in practice just press a few buttons on their dashboard and pretend to operate the steering wheel, while the tourists repeat some lines they remember from movies.

Admittedly, I didn’t expect there to be cashiers anymore either by now, so when my sweetheart told me she was going to pursue a master’s degree in retail, I advised her against it. It led to a big argument. “What do you want me to do then, work at Hooters?” She yelled at me. I wasn’t impressed by her empty threat, because Hooters wouldn’t hire anyone who hadn’t graduated with a four year degree in consumer psychology, after an incident caught on video a few years ago where a man, later revealed to be suffering Huntington’s disease, squeezed a waitress in her bum and she responded with punching his teeth out.

Back as an 18-year-old, faced with the difficult decision of whether to go to college or not, she decided to pursue a double-major, one in retail, the other in history. Neither degree is extraordinarily challenging and the college classes barely overlap. When they do overlap she would watch the recordings at home. She could have saved a lot of money by signing up for a digital college instead, but employers seem to prefer graduates who actually had to go to classes and do group projects the old fashioned way.

Officially the master’s degree is called “retail management,” just as a cleaning lady is now called a “sanitary hygiene specialist.” In practice however, rather than “managing” anything, she will stock shelves, pretend to check the storage room for people who desire products they stopped selling but forgot to remove from the website, or explain to them why they’re not allowed to combine their coupon with a bonus card.

That is, if she ever gets a job with the degree. It’s quite likely that she will apply for a volunteer position or another unpaid internship after finishing her degree. If this were to happen we won’t die of hunger, rather; she will receive gift cards that can be redeemed for food at a number of fast food restaurants that suffer from a loss of customers.

Her biggest dream is to operate the counter. There’s a dying demographic, of old people in their 80s and 90s, who are too senile by now to learn how to operate the self-checkout machine or order food from the internet, but by virtue of the mercy of their neighbours haven’t been deported to a nursing home yet.

It’s obviously a highly competitive career track to try to enter. I remember how I begged her to be realistic and look for something with more opportunity. One out of every 15,000 pistachio nuts contains a little worm, but as a result of some sort of subconscious human intuition, humans are still better at recognizing the nuts that might contain a worm than computers are. You have to do a series of reflex and hand-eye coordination tests to become a worm-picker, pardon me, a “product quality control specialist,” tests that 95% of people never get through. Had I read the fine print on their website I would have seen that.

After what we now refer to as the “pistachio incident” she stopped listening to my advice and I must admit I can’t blame her. She had wasted 150 dollars purchasing training material from a website that claimed it could “guarantee you’ll pass the test” and 250 dollars on attending a “worm pick specialist training weekend.” She then had to spent a total of 360 dollars for the privilege of participating in the first three tests, after which she failed and was left with nothing.

I did everything I could to help her after that incident. When she had to write her progress reports on her unpaid internship at Costco, I helped her think of skills she could still improve and things she had learned. “I should remove wine stains on the floor with ammonia instead of bleach, when the floor is made of linoleum.” “I should be more patient with customers.” You can never be too patient with customers.

Now she’s finishing her master’s thesis. I’ve never been more proud of her. Her working title is “systematic discrimination of African American citizens by retail specialists in coupon acceptance rates.” We downloaded 75.3 gigabytes of leaked video camera footage from some of the nation’s largest supermarket chain stores. We carefully went through every video to check for instances where people paid using coupons.

So far we have found that after adjusting for confounding variables, African Americans are 22% more likely to have their attempt at using multiple coupons rejected than white Americans. A shocking conclusion, in a country where people like to think that racism is just a thing of the past. When I close my eyes at night, I still dream about the obese lady who argued with the cashier about whether or not pickled cucumbers still qualify as a vegetable. I fear that I will one day die in my sleep and this is what eternity will be."

Thanks in advance for reading this. Any advice is appreciated. I'm not sure how to fix this situation. I made some unintelligent decisions in college and didn't have any side projects and didn't have any internships. I graduated in 2011. Couldn't find work because I didn't have any experience so I joined up with a skilled trade union.

They gave me a full time job and training. To that I'm extremely grateful. Unfortunately, while this would be a pretty decent career path, it's not what I want to do with my life. After a while they learned that I knew computers and moved me into the office and made me a Revit Operator. While in the office I've managed to write a few macros and programs for different departments but nothing serious.

Recently I've started applying to different positions. Here comes the catch, I often get told that I don't have enough experience for a junior level position. When I apply to internships I get told that I'm too far out of college to be an intern.

I've built a website with a couple simple games in JavaScript and HTML5. I'm in the process of re-reading a design pattern book I saved from college and Cracking the Coding Interview. I'm designing the back end of a financial app. I've picked out a github repo that sounds interesting but when I try to browse the code I get hopelessly lost in a matter of minutes (any help on this in particular would be extremely welcome).

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vgyx38pvcrrsg99/Alridrin.pdf?dl=0) is my resume. I've spent a lot of time on it but any advice here would be great. To my main question. Am I not doing enough to break into the field? Have I waited too long and am now stuck in this path? If not how can I get past being too 'old' for an internship but too inexperienced for a junior position? Thank you for your time. 

TL;DR Too 'old' for an internship. Too inexperienced for a junior position. What do? "

I'm looking for a hatchback or sedan.

After looking at some lots in the area, I'm looking at a 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer, a 2013 Hyundai Elantra, and a 2012 Ford Fiesta. All of them are around 40,000 miles and $12,000-13,000.

What would you recommend? How is the reliability on them? This is a car that I'm hoping to have for at least 6-7 years, so the fewer and cheaper the repairs, the better.

Any other suggestions are welcome, but I need a car in a week so I don't have a ton of time to shop around Indiana for used cars. My search is really limited to just my home (Lafayette).

Edit: This is really for commuting, plus occasional roadtrips as I may be moving across the country in a year or two. Again, reliability is really key.

2013 Hyundai Elantra -- 43,763 miles -- $12187

2012 Mazda Mazda3 -- 41,462 miles -- $11599

2014 Mitsubishi Lancer -- 36,095 miles -- $12,999

I'm currently a second year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics, with a minor in Computer Science. I want to go into data science and analytics because simply put - it is freaking awesome, and I can't see myself as a developer typing lines and lines of pure software code the whole day.  However, I do love writing code and statistics, so thought this would be a great path for me. 

Right now, I do research in machine learning and am comfortable programming with R, Python (scipy, numpy, sci-kit learn), and MATLAB. I am also familiar with Java, Bash, and to a lesser extent, C++. I have done some network analysis and representations for exploratory data analysis. The exploratory data analysis has been represented in graphs such as clustergrams, dendrograms and spectrograms. I have taken classes in time series, applied regression analysis in R, bayesian statistics, models of applied statistics, mathematical statistics, intro to CS, data structures, and discrete structures. 

In order to get into analytics/data science, and ace interviews for internships next summer, what do you guys think I should be devoting my time to now? Should I start learning tools like Hadoop, Scala, SQL, MapReduce, etc? Also, what are some good university level courses I should look into taking?

Also, I want to do a data science oriented project over the summer to learn more and to showcase my talents to recruiters next year. Any ideas on what I could do, or where I could go to find a suitable topic?  "

i am just feeling super frustrated maybe becasue i have a final tomorrow but just about where i am in my life compared to what i think i deserve.... was an anxious kid far before i ever touched weed or alcohol. and now am just surrounded by (all my friends including those from childhood like to drink and most smoke) the party lifestyle. and i just dont see the point in all of it (life)
__________________________________________________________
havent smoked weed in 21 days? had been slowing down beforehand.... but not quite able to stop, and am only certainly stopping because I have a great internship in medical innovations this summer (i would feel more accomplished if my dad wasn't the main reason why i got it). i am a neuro major with a decent GPA (3.55) and wanted to go to med school, but idk.
when i started smoking heavy was freshman yr of college (now a senior, with one extra semester, went abroad, kinda hated it / was stil depressed and missed home). i joined a frat frehsman, a jewish one, because of family friends in it and i needed a sense of belonging. i have made a couple (one i am still close with today, others who are good guys for the most part and show love, but live with 11 of them which is way too much and has been pretty bad for me) good friends in the frat, but most of the relationships have fallen off as i was never that involved, and have had to fight with anxiety and depression for years. i had one best friend, not a jewish kid, not in the frat, that i lived with previously and he got me into smoking even heavier / nice bongs / loved drugs, but wwas nicest kid deep down, but our relationship went to shit over some fights and me having problems and him going psycho and raging too hard, so i havent talked to him since new years even tho he still goes to this school. i am just in a party environment, all my friends like to drink and most of them like to smoke.

i'm a big dreams typa person. have an idea for an app that could be huge, that i have been working on for a couple years. i cant program so all i can do and am doing now is trying to contact computer science professors and get them to help me recruit students / coders to make an app development team. earlier i was working on it with friends, bright ones, but it kinda fucked up our relationship / my psych prescribed me concerta and i was speeding, thought i was gonna get rich and be succesful and not need college. and then i was put on Depakote (they said i had a hypomanic episode and speculated whether i was bipolar) and my cognition went down, and i kept ripping moles (tobacco and weed) and selling on a low level to girls and my friends just to break even and prolly to boost my self-esteem, and the app idea fell apart. its coming back together now with meeting with professors and having some asians who want to work on the coding, but realistically i think it will never work out.

also big dreams with girls (i have never done anything sexually). was basically in my mind in love with or obsessed with a girl i dealt too, baddest (nicest looking and sweetest) girl at our school. we were good friends, but when i got really depressed early this semester, and i opened up to her, she was hardly to be heard from again. distanced herself it seems. i dont blame her. it just made me lose faith in humanity, as another friend from the frat i confided in also didnt do anything much to help me, not even checking in which would be so easy.

and i just feel like i am the nicest person, would do anything for a friend or family member. and i deserve better

and i have one semester left at this school, and had a good (decent) housing plan, 3 kids, one in the frat who no one likes cus he has anxiety and tries too hard, one who was transferring here but people say good things about, and another awesome kid who was good friends with the transfer and was going to take my spot 2nd semester.... but it just fell apart, because one of the kids we were gonna sign with, in the frat no one likes him, so the other kid said he can't live with him. and i cannot live with that kid alone, but dont want to live alone. i just dont know, feel like my college experience has been ruined, and they are the formative years / the ones you remember (reminisince bump)

have been on many antidepressants and some benzos, am currently on cymbalta and klonopin. fuck it tho klonopin and ativan are the only things that have helped. i feel pretty defective, i want to have hope in my future but idk its hard when the formative years have been so tough even tho i have been given everything by my family i could ask for--support thru depression, material comfortability / ability to buy anything i want within reason. and i just cant figure it out. i know i have hope in my career and academically, but i just want to be happy and enjoy the moment, life shouldnt be about getting to the next level and best jobs and best grades, it just really has been tough living in this house, losing touch with my old best friend, not knowing where i am living next year, and opening up to that girl i liked so much and her not being there for me. and feeling isolated

and weed was a big factor in me opening up from the shy kid i used to be and seeing the world differently, becoming more liberal and open minded, making friends and connections... but it just turned sour maybe when i started dealing a little bit, maybe when i lost touch with what made it fun (communal, social) and started ripping moles alone or snaps with friends... so now it has negative valience
fuck i need to be studying now but just wanted to get some of this shit out

34rv6j,0,2015-05-03,Should I transfer to UIC's engineering CS or UIUC's liberal arts &amp; sciences Math + CS?,hikzero,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/34rv6j/should_i_transfer_to_uics_engineering_cs_or_uiucs/,"I'm about to finish up my 2 years at Oakton Community College in Skokie, IL and have been accepted to those two programs.

While at Oakton I built a pretty tightly-knit circle of friends who are going to do engineering as well. I did not think I would actually get admitted to UIUC, so we all planned to get an apartment in the city together and tackle engineering at UIC together. 

Now that I got accepted to UIUC, despite it not being full blown engineering, I'm still finding that the curriculum is nearly identical. 

Given the following facts:

-They are both Bachelor of Science degrees

-The amount of financial would likely be a ton at both schools (not 100% sure on that, because I haven't received the award letter at from UIUC yet, but they want me to fill out the Illinois Promise Verification form -- only for students who need serious aid. So I think I'm going to get a ton of aid)

-I would still be able to get internships no matter which school I choose because every summer I'd come back to Chicago

-I would get a significant amount of additional job opportunities if I stay in Chicago, just because it is a major city

-The curriculums between the two programs are nearly identical, except UIUC's major seems like it requires a couple of bullshit LAS requirements, such as a foreign language class, as well as about 3 or so more math classes to satisfy the math portion of the major.

-I would have to provide/work for myself to support my share of an apartment at UIC if I go there (It's a commuter school, the dorms are mostly shit).


Should I leave my engineering buddies, who have also become some of my best personal friends, and pursue UIUC, or should I try to make working while going to UIC in Chicago work and let the opportunity go?"

I [25/F] have been in a relationship with my long-term partner [27/M] for a little over four years.  We have always been so compatible, loving and supportive of each other and had great communication throughout our relationship.  I proposed an open relationship when we first got together and he felt uncomfortable with the idea of me sleeping with other people, but he said it was something he would consider in the future when our relationship was more established.

We moved together to a new city last year, and he started pursuing a degree while I worked on building my career.  I started having feelings for a coworker and admitted this to my partner.  He was surprisingly accepting and we agreed to open our relationship but go at a pace that he set.  Everything was wonderful for a few months – I was so happy to be living in a way that was more closely aligned with my values and my partner said he enjoyed seeing me so happy and loved that I was being open with him.  I developed a relationship with my coworker [23/M] with the consent of my partner that has turned out to be very loving and healthy as well.  They even hung out a few times which was really enjoyable. :)

However, when we all got hit with uber-busy schedules at once, we ran into conflicts over time.  He felt like any time I spent with my OSO was at his expense, and he needed that time with me to feel that I was providing the support he values in a relationship.  I ran myself ragged for a while trying to spend time with both, but anytime I was with my OSO, my partner would become extremely depressed regardless of whether I had spent time with him that week as well.  He would blow up at me for not caring about him or being there for him.  I became resentful as I wasn't getting any time to myself, and I felt like the time we spent together was not quality time (often it was me hanging out while he did homework).  The more emotionally dependent and controlling he became, the more anxious I got around him and it has been killing our sex life which I know is affecting his perspective on my other relationship.  He sent unkind messages to my OSO which put a strain on things between us all for a while.

After a few months of conflict over scheduling and me and my OSO constantly canceling/moving our dates to appease my partner, he admitted that he was uncomfortable whenever I visited OSO because he felt he pushed himself to accept our relationship too quickly out of fear of losing me. He could not handle the current structure anymore, and wanted me to break off things with my OSO until he finished school in a year so that he has time and room to process a new relationship structure.  I was feeling extremely guilty but also uncomfortable with what he asked.  My OSO has been so understanding of the situation, giving up our time together whenever there is a conflict and stating that he knows my partner is important to me and he wants us to be able to stay together.

My partner's new solution is that my OSO and I can spend time together but should stop the sexual component of our relationship until he and I have had a chance to go through counseling together.  He says it will only be for a few weeks and if this doesn't work then we should break up.  I don't feel like OSO and I will suffer from not having sex for a few weeks – my concern is more that I don't see how this is going to help my partner's insecurities.  It seems like he's putting another time limit on himself to be okay with everything.  Also, my OSO was already feeling like he has little say in our relationship since my partner's blowups made us both defer to him during any scheduling conflict.  Now he is frustrated that our activities together are being controlled by my partner as well.  The final complicating factor is that my partner is leaving in a month for a summer internship that would make our already fragile relationship long-distance for a few months and would of course make counseling an issue.

I understand where both people are coming from and I'm really confused about how to proceed.  Our relationship seemed so solid but now it feels like I am always one step away from my partner leaving me.  I feel a lot of guilt as well for not seeing that he was pushing himself to be comfortable, and dragging him into a structure he is unhappy with.  Is it my responsibility to backtrack since we moved too quickly for him in the beginning?

I would really appreciate advice on whether there are steps we can take to rebuild trust and stability in our relationship, or whether our needs are too incompatible at this point to work through this.  I love my partner very much and the thought of not being together is heartbreaking. :(

**tl;dr: We opened our relationship but now he says it went too fast.  How do I repair the damage?**"
34s1k3,2,2015-05-03,Third-year ECE student: assessment of prospects for top CompSci grad programs?,ChairmanWow94,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/34s1k3/thirdyear_ece_student_assessment_of_prospects_for/,"Hi all,

I’ve just finished my third year of an honours program in electrical / computer engineering at a well-known Canadian university. Machine learning, particularly insofar as it relates to proteomics, is a field that I’ve had a small amount of exposure to in my work as a research assistant, and I think I’d like to pursue the topic seriously in grad school - and like everyone else asking similar questions, I’d like to do my studies at the best school I’m able to get into. For now, let’s say it’s a PhD I’m interested in. (The idea of a coursework-based MS has also occurred to me, but I'll leave that question for another post.)

Some “ideal” schools would be MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Cambridge, ETHZ, UCSD, University of Washington, UofT. (My inquiry into this whole issue is pretty preliminary at this point, so I realize these might not be 100% informed selections, but these are names I’ve heard come up in relation to my area of interest.)

I’d appreciate an honest assessment of my prospects with respect to the aforementioned schools based on what I’ve done so far - and if anyone has any suggestions towards what I could do over this upcoming work term and my fourth year to improve my chances, those would be much appreciated as well. (There’s a couple of areas that I’m concerned might be liabilities, and I’d like to know whether my concern is justified.)

1) My cumulative GPA is a 3.80 (out of 4). I’ve seen this number cited a few times as a cutoff for top-ranked schools, so on the one hand I’m not unduly worried. My marks have seen a slight decline from second to third year though - not much of one, but there are a couple of B’s on my transcript this year whereas last year was straight A’s. Rounding pessimistically, this would put my ‘major GPA’ (having technically specialized in electrical / computer only this past year) thus far at a 3.7. I also received an A- in my algorithms course, which constitutes one of the few ‘serious’ CompSci courses I’ve taken thus far - I feel like that might stick out on my transcript. Is this a (serious) liability?

2) I’ve worked for two years continuously (summers and during classes) in a ChemEng research group as a scientific programmer. My work has been tangentially related to machine learning, clustering algorithms being a particular area of focus. I’ve co-authored a handful of peer-reviewed papers in this capacity, and I’m working on my own study at present, which will hopefully culminate in a lead-authored journal article. I believe I’ve gained valuable skills as a researcher from this; but as far as I can gather, the particular field (atmospheric chemistry) is kind of behind the curve quantitatively - compared to, say, proteomics - and I’m concerned that my work in this context might not necessarily impress a CompSci admissions committee. I hope I’m just being pessimistic here - any thoughts?

3) I’ve managed to secure a year-long internship as a programmer in a well-established corporate research lab, where I'll be developing data reduction methodologies for high-throughput proteomics. I’ve heard industrial experience isn’t something grad schools care particularly much about - does the fact it’s research change anything? (Looking at the company’s track record, I’m going to say there’s a small but nonzero chance of getting my name on a patent or research paper, if that helps at all.)

That pretty much summarizes it for now. If my concerns are unjustified (and I have seen some posts on here exhibiting a lack of self-awareness in that regard), please be direct. But I’d like some external perspective regardless, as I haven’t had much exposure to any CompSci academics who I could ask about the whole issue. Apologies for the long-windedness, and thanks for your time."
34s6i7,2,2015-05-03,My genetics have ruined my life.,asdasdfdasf,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/34s6i7/my_genetics_have_ruined_my_life/," am a 5""4 ethnic basement dweller. I was bullied throughout elementary, middle, and high school. I was the last pick, I never had any friends, never had a girlfriend, and I was an underachiever. I thought there was something wrong with me. I started questioning myself thinking that maybe it was attitude, or perhaps maybe it was the way the interacted with people that pushed people away, maybe I didn't work hard enough. I pushed myself into academics and with a stroke of a combination of hard work and luck, I manage to enter into a prestigious university. My social life, if I ever had one, did not improve. I tried conforming to society standards by conditioning myself to show people respect and kindness expecting that people will treat me as an equal and as someone as whom they would consider as a friend. My efforts were largely ignored and at best I became a mere acquaintance; meaning that after class, work, or a group project I became invisible. Girls never paid attention to me. I have come to the point that I envy ugly men. At least when girls look at them, they would shriek and their face will twist in disgust when looking at them. I, however, do not even exist. I wasn't even a fly worth swatting. Last summer, I started sinking deeper and deeper into my depression as university continued. Last summer, I took on a two month research internship in Czech Republic thinking that my life would change. It didn't. My supervisor and my colleagues hated me. I never made any friends and lost my virginity. Worse, everyday, I was made to bare witness of the college lifestyle that I envied. Everyday I see a close group of friends, Caucasian, going out to parties, traveling, drinking, drugging and clubbing. At night, people are having amazing intense rough sex with sounds so loud that it is transmitted through the wall and into my dorm room. Slavic women, Czech women in particular were out of this world....8+/10 HBBs sluthate/misc standards face and body wise walking around everywhere. I am not talking about just 2 in every 10 girls...I am talking about at least 5-7 girls out of 10 that I see that are simply beautiful. The men facemogs and heightmogs the fuck out of me. Czech men are 5""11+ minimum and most of them have 7+/10 facial aesthetics and athletic physiques. It was maddening. All this was happening, while I was doing lab work on a shit topic that no one gives fuck all and STEMceling and studycel while people are having fun, sex and party. Alas, I finally came home.


While finishing my research paper, during the recesses of my mind, exploring deep interweb, I came across this called Sluthate. I read about the lookism, heightism, LMS, hypergamy, juggernaut theory, maxilla, gonial angles......and it all became clear. I don't know why it wasn't made obvious. The only reason people treated me such distaste and disrespect is because I am short, ugly, and ethnic. Plain and simple. People disrespect me and do not value my opinion because I look more child than man. I am a pain to look at and god awful ugly. I may have the same skill or maybe more qualified as 6""+ Caucasian Chad dom FWHR 2.0 slayer, but people would not hire me or consider me because I am physically repulsive. Everytime I try raising my voice, I am ignored and I am automatically labeled as someone with a complex. People have bullied me and called me ugly and repulsive routinely throughout the years to the point that I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I don't even use facebook because I am too ugly to post photos of my self.

I am at my breaking point and quit school earlier last year, just one year shy of finishing. My marks were plummeting and my life is falling apart. I became a NEET. I have been in social isolation for the past 10+ months and it is nothing but agony. You know how to punish a criminal? You punish him by putting into solitary confinement. Humans are social creatures and if they are deprived of social interaction, they will become insane. I am not a criminal. Never hurt anyone, never killed anyone, never cursed at anyone. I don't even have a weird fetish and I am not a delinquent. And yet, I am being judged and suffering from the same punishment as criminals. No, even criminals/thugs have friends and get laid. I am worse than an insect. Society has forsaken me."

I am a full time worker (working 1:30p-10p Mondays - Fridays), and while it's a bit of a juggle, it's been do-able. 

I'm more than likely going to be lacking the financial options to just not work or to even cut back on hours. I've been trying to do the math to find a way to make it work for over a year, and I can't find the answer to that part. 

The class times of Pitt seem like they will mesh nicely into my work schedule, with everything looking like it would be in the morning. But a few things concern me, such as ""capstone experiences"" and internships and the like. I'll really be locked down into a ""can only do school things that require me in person at a set time between 7am-1pm"".

I'm actually already here, staying in a hotel in San Mateo after a crappy couple night's stay in someone's shed via AirBnB, and I start the internship tomorrow. I don't have a car and am basically looking for something that's geographically close to where I'm going to work (I.E., in San Mateo) but for 4 month leases... there's very little here that's not sketchy or astronomical in pricing.

I have had essentially zero luck in finding... basically any housing arrangement that's both of sane pricing and sane conditions here. I've exhausted almost everything via craigslist, and all the apartment complexes within the area are ranging into the $3,000-4,000+ area for rent. Those rooms that I have found are either looking for a female tenant only, have creepy or strange stipulations (""Part time housing: live here on weekdays, find somewhere else to live on weekends"") or are just plain not returning my emails.

Are there any other avenues I should try for finding a simple, clean room starting now?"

    I have been exclusively dating a girl since October, now I'm not sure I want to be so exclusive anymore, and I don't know how to say it.  It's not that I want to stop seeing her completely, but I think I just want or need to take a step back from the relationship, and I want to do it breaking her heart as little as possible.
  I know she really likes me. I really like her, too, but really think she wants to be more serious and I  don't want that. I probably should have not asked her out exclusively, as we were seeing each other for a few months already, and I think we were both quite happy. I knew that she wanted to be exclusive with me, and at first I didn't, but the weather was getting colder and I was getting all lovey dovey, so I did.  
  We work together, which is a problem. More specifically, we are about to start working together full time, as she was only a summer intern at my job, I don't like to do the job-relationship thing, and I really had no idea she'd end up working here, as we get a lot of summer interns just come and gone. 
  When I asked her out, I was very comfortable because of the distance we had. She goes to school about 2 hours from me. I was dating and living with my ex for 3 years, and after a bitter breakup, I did not want to be ""close"" with anyone. So after being totally single for a while, the idea of having a girlfriend I can be emotionally close with, but have a little distance between us was very comfortable and inviting to me, as I was beginning to long for that kind of bond I had with my ex.
  Of course things are changing now, and my gf will be moving from school, back to my town, and start working with me full time. I know I am going to feel uncomfortable with the distance, I am kind of a wild guy and I like to be spontaneous and don't feel like baring the responsibilities of a relationship right now. She is incredibly sweet, and she wants more from me, and she deserves it. How can I do this without being a jerk?  
  I feel like I am doing something wrong. Am I doing something wrong?
  Any advice would be great.
  Thanks."
34sg8a,9,2015-05-04,I [25 F] got fired yesterday. It was my first job and I feel horrible and scared.,Artsydircy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34sg8a/i_25_f_got_fired_yesterday_it_was_my_first_job/,"Hello r/relationships. I'm posting from my phone so I'm sorry in advance for any errors.

As the title states I got my termination letter yesterday and it's left me feeling amazingly insecure and feeling like shit really.

To provide some background: I never studied the field I'm in. I just am really passionate about it. I did my own projects and freelanced to build a portfolio. I looked for a job at this company. They gave me a test that I did well on and decided to take me on as an intern for 6 months. After that I became a full-time junior. I was new and excited, very hopeful and full of ideas.

The team I worked directly with included five people. The main people I worked with were (Fake names): Guy was my boss but I dealt with him very rarely. Then there was James, who was responsible for picking me out and hiring me. He was my direct supervisor and if I had anything I would go to him. Claire was Guy's right hand and a really sweet person who I am on good terms with. And Peter, the senior who I was supposed to work closely with since he handled our major client and needed help. 

It was great when I started out. I realized I wanted to continue in this field and was pretty inspired. Then we got a new small client and majority of the work was given to me. The work was so dull, used extensive searching and took up all my time. It was exhausting but work is work.

Peter is a perfectionist or something. Working with him was not easy. He has years of experience with our major client and so knows more. I learned a lot from him but working with him was bad because he has a very specific vision in his mind and if I didn't do it exactly like that then he would either make me tweak my work for hours till I would get it exactly how he wanted or take it from me and do it himself. It got to the point where I didn't even know how to think on my own anymore. I would simply execute their thoughts.

James was fun to hang out with but was often busy with new business. I would try and get involved in the meetings. In fact, Claire told me to start pushing myself into the meetings. They wouldn't involve me and I would often be left alone doing searches after searches while they sat in meetings together. My motivation was dropping big time. The worst was when they wouldn't involve me from the beginning and then tell me that they needed me to work on the project that I had no idea about. I spoke to James about it but nothing was done and there was only so much I could do.

Guy is egotistical and I knew from the very beginning that I could not trust him. I would go to Claire to ask for help when I'd get stuck (I would be working with her) or sometimes just to chat which she always welcomed. James talked to me and told me that Guy told him that Claire told him that she's upset with me because I go to her a lot and it's disturbing her. I felt bad because if she had a problem she could have spoken to me directly. My friend suggested I don't fall for the whole he said/she said thing and speak to her directly. When I did she was absolutely shocked and upset. She told me that she would *never* say something like that. Helping me was her job and I should come to her more now! But why did he say what he did? An ex-colleague told me about a very similar thing that happened to her with Guy. Guy has told me on more than one occasion that he is ""the boss"" (not the CEO btw), he has the power (his words) and what he says is the law. I get he's the boss but the way he says it is really bad - like we should respect and fear him.

My work in general was accepted and liked. When James was absent I was able to work with Peter and we accomplished a lot together. The only time that happened because the work load was so much that instead of giving me one job at a time, he gave a list of jobs and I was able to manage my time around that better. He didn't even micro-manage which was great so a lot got done. I did mention all of this to James too. He acknowledged it but nothing was done.

I understood that the company was getting more clients and the work was getting more hectic. I would more often than not be done with my work on time but unable to submit because I needed approval from either James or Peter. They would disappear for long times or be too busy and I would waste a lot of time just waiting. I started getting pushy and Peter started getting annoyed about approving my work all the time - I couldn't help it, it was in my job description.

My work was not bad and my speed had improved but they stopped giving me major jobs though because they didn't think I could handle it. I lost my motivation because I didn't know what more to do. I could handle it (because I have in the past) but they didn't have the time to give me a chance. And with things moving forward and new hires in other departments, they're looking for people who are not juniors like me. 

I had a good relationship with everyone in the office and learned a lot but I guess I wasn't fitting in so well. My loss of motivation and inspiration had a lot to do with that, I think. Also, due to the fact that I don't have a formal education in this field which means I need a lot more experience and practice before I can be good at what I do is what held me back from doing as good as they needed. James still believes I have a lot of potential but the company is moving forward and they need someone who will move forward with them. I'm not doing that though so I'm being let go. 

Sorry this became a huge wall of text! But it does help writing it down. I'm scared about the future because I feel like I suck so much no one will hire me. The funny part is that I had started building up my portfolio so that I could leave and work at a better place with a more professional environment but they got to me first. 

I'm afraid that my insecurity will hinder my chances at another job. Am I really that bad? How can I build myself up? I still love what I do and really want to continue. But I'm feel like I'm a failure and not good at anything. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. Really!

TL;DR: I worked my first job for a bit more than a year, with 6 months as an intern. Good relationships with colleagues and work generally accepted. As a junior my team members didn't really want to handle me anymore, nor were they happy with the speed and quality of my work so I was let go. I feel horrible."
34sj8e,0,2015-05-04,Is this college's computer science curriculum acceptable?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34sj8e/is_this_colleges_computer_science_curriculum/,"I asked the head of the program some questions to get a feel for the program. Here are his answers. Can you please provide input on the strength of the curriculum?

1. What languages are the introductory CS classes taught in?

Our first-semester programming course is taught in javascript with the primary goal of teaching students how to program. The next two semesters are taught in Java, which forms the basis for our computer science degree.

2. What other languages does the department teach(Database languages included)?

The following languages are taught in required or elective CS courses regularly: SQL (in our database courses), VB.NET, php, asp, C, Android. In the Programming Languages course that some students take, a broad exposure to a variety of programs occurs.

3. What is the instructor to student ratio in the introductory CS classes?

The intro courses tend to have between 15 and 25 students. All of the courses in the department are capped at no more than 25 with most capped at no more than 22. All of our computer science courses are taught in a computer lab, and all but one of our labs has 24 machines. The largest lab has 27 machines. We always allow for problems with the computers, so we always try to keep the actual number of students in the room to be 2 under the number of machines, hence the 25 and 22 caps.

4. What technology companies actively recruit at your college?

Career and Employment Services handles most of the formal recruitment sessions, and I am unfamiliar with the list of companies that do formal recruitment visits to campus. However, I do receive a lot of job descriptions to share with the students, mostly from a variety of local companies, often sent in by alumni. See below for a list of where our students have ended up in recent times.

5. What technology companies have recent graduates from the program gone to work for?

Some of the companies that have hired multiple students from us over a period of years include Lockheed Martin, Vanguard, Accenture, Monetate, Department of Defense, and Sungard. Many other small local companies hire our students as well. 

6. What is the average salary for a graduate from this department for their first job?
We do not formally collect this information from students, but based on the few offers that have been shared with me in recent years, the range of starting salaries is between $50,000 and $70,000.

7. Do many students in the program work at development internships during the summer or part time during the school year?

Yes. Although it is not a requirement of the computer science students to do an internship, we do have a large number do internships. Often these occur in the summer. Occasionally, they receive academic credit for the internship. Some students are able to do development internships on campus with a variety of offices that need skilled developers. We have been working with a local start-up called Intern-U that helps our students find both internships and full-time jobs upon graduation. We also have a computer science advisory board comprised of IT and CS leaders from a variety of fields in the area, and this board has been very active over the last three years in helping students with career-related matters, including the providing of internships."
34sna4,0,2015-05-04,I'm not sure how angry I should be at my brother-in-law. But I am angry. (F/32),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/34sna4/im_not_sure_how_angry_i_should_be_at_my/,"My B-I-L originally moved in with us for a few months almost 18 months ago.  It was a difficult time for me as my father was dying of cancer (and then died), but he is my husband’s brother and the internship was a good opportunity for him, so I said of course he should come. 

After some months, B-I-L got a permanent job, but did not move out, instead staying and saving lots of money. B-I-L was largely very nice and tried to be helpful but did do a few small things that I didn't like. For example, he broke a fragile wooden figurine by putting his clothes on it. I glued it together and put it in storage. He broke it again putting things on it in the closet. While my husband and I were traveling, his guests stole my nice jacket, left behind a cheap jacket of a different design and stole/destroyed a giant throw pillow that was in my bedroom and too large to sneak out without being noticed. My B-I-L denied all knowledge of these incidents, and never took responsibility or apologized for them.  He hasn’t been exactly sympathetic after my father’s death either, which I found hurtful, but he is young and maybe didn’t know how.

Now he has crossed a line and I am simultaneous furious and miserable. Shortly before my husband and I travelled to handle an issue related to my father’s estate, my dog contracted a urinary tract infection. The vet gave me antibiotics for her though and by the time we were ready to leave, my dog was symptom free. There were a few more days of antibiotics go though, so I told my B-I-L to give them to her, as well as her allergy medicine.

While we were gone, B-I-L did not give her either. When we returned, the allergy medicine was unopened and there were antibiotics remaining. Also, my dog had peed on a rug in the house. She *never* does that, but my guess is that, without completing her antibiotics, it allowed the UTI to return and she couldn’t hold it while my B-I-L was out or didn’t notice that she wanted to go out.  I was angry and sad on behalf of my poor beastie – UTIs are not comfortable. She is fine now at least. 

I was also angry and sad about the rug. This peed-upon rug is no ordinary rug. I truly love this rug. It is my most beloved rug. I collect rugs. I bought this one at an auction after looking for months for one like it. I got an amazing, amazing deal. It was a significant cost to me.  It cost me a month’s salary, but I didn’t care I loved it so much and it was worth five times that. I truly love it. I invited people over to see it when it arrived. It is my most valued possession. Or rather, it was, until my B-I-L ruined it.

Dog pee is gross, but can be handled. My husband’s (now-dead) dog peed on that very same rug and it was cleaned fine. B-I-L ruined my rug through thoughtlessness. 

He started by pouring clothing detergent on it. Not even rug cleaner. You can’t do that on old rugs with natural dyes. A simple online search or calling me could have told him that. He then put the rug cleaner on the spot and walked away. He didn’t stay to do it manually or make sure it was OK. When he came back, the dye was gone and the pattern ruined, the wool wasn’t in great shape from the brush of the cleaner. He ruined my most treasured possession and cost me the value of a small car. 

When he realized what he’d done, he called my husband in a panic. My husband called an oriental rug cleaner and restorer. They took it and did some work (it took them a month!), but could not get it to a point where there was no obvious damage. It is ruined. The restoration effort cost $2000. 

There is also a pad under the rug. B-I-L did not even try to clean that. Instead, he folded it up and put it in our garage. When we got home, it was still there, waiting for us a piss-soaked, molding, stinking, totally ruined pad. My husband threw it away. That pad cost $800 (I bought the best trying to care for my dear rug). 

I am heartsick. That rug is over eighty years old. It is a treasure, made by many hands over many months, if not years. It lasted so long, travelled so wide and endured so much. And while it was in my possession that beauty and legacy is killed.

B-I-L has never even mentioned the rug to me. It is like it never happened, that there wasn’t a giant blank spot on the floor for a month while the restorers tried to save it, that he didn’t neglect my dog and carelessly destroy my most treasured possession and cost me thousands of dollars.. He never apologized. He never offered to make amends.  For him, with me, it is as if it never happened.  
 
My B-I-L knows that I am upset by this. I previously asked my husband to talk to him without result.  Today, the rug was delivered by the rug restorers . I was so horrified by seeing the damage that I had to leave the room to avoid bursting into tears in front of the rug people. 

After paying the restorers, my husband went up to talk to me, and then went to talk to my B-I-L. He explained that I am unhappy that my rug is destroyed, that I feel that my B-I-L is responsible and that I want at the very least the courtesy of acknowledging that it even happened and an apology.

My B-I-L has reacted by avoiding me. First when he saw me he did not look up or say a word, just stayed looking at his computer at my dining table.  I didn’t say anything to him to be fair – I wanted to see what he would say. Which was nothing. Then he left the house, and went up to his bedroom upon return. Even after having it all spelled out to him, he didn’t apologize. I get the idea that he thinks that he is blameless, that it isn’t his fault my dog peed and it is I who owe him for watching my dog while I was away.  But of course, since we've never actually talked about it, I could be wrong. 

I think that dog sitting is the least he could do for almost 18 months of free rent and support, and that not neglecting a living animal by giving a dog her medicine as agreed is a reasonable expectation.  I feel that being a considerate and responsible non-idiot once the dog did pee was also reasonable to expect. And once the damage was done, I wanted an apology and offer to help pay for at least the repair costs.

At this point, I want him to reimburse me for the cost of the restoration effort and the replacement pad.  He owes me 2800. At least. I also want to sell the rug. I am too sad and guilty to look at it. It is worth much less than it was before it was destroyed, but hopefully I can get something for it from someone who will value it as is.  Then I want the difference in the value pre-and post destruction from my B-I-L. This is at least $10,000. I know he has more than that saved while he’s been here not paying for rent, utilities, or even many groceries. He also has a descent income form his job. Paying that much would hurt, but he could afford to do it. My husband wants to be generous and let him keep all of his savings. 

I care less about that, because: 

1. It won't bankrupt him - he would e still have some money saved even after he reimburses me for the damage that he caused.
2.  He did cause damage and is responsible, regardless of the effect on his personal finances a
3. Most importantly, if he wanted this issue to be handled in a feeling of family togetherness and good faith, he could have cared for my living  dog in good faith, been considerate of my things in good faith and, once he ruined my treasured possession, shown me the courtesy and respect of at least recognizing that it happened.

I have to talk to him tomorrow. He is finally moving out in two weeks (after my husband told him that 18 months has been long enough and he should be this own place), but I can't let this remain as it is. He is my husband's brother and it isn't good for my husband if his wife thinks his brother is selfish and unthinking.  But I will not think differently, or be anything but sad and furious, without an apology and restitution. Even the full costs of trying ot fix it and the value of the rug can't give me back what I really want, my beloved rug, but it would make me feel at least that my B-I-L cares about me and takes responsibility for how his actions hurt me. 

**TL;DR B-I-L Got free rent for over a year during a difficult time, didn’t give my dog the medicine she needed while dog sitting, ruined my beloved and expensive most treasured  possession. I'm unhappy about it**"
34soj6,6,2015-05-04,Northwestern w/ 60k vs. Cornell w/ 45k,[deleted],lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/34soj6/northwestern_w_60k_vs_cornell_w_45k/,"Hey guys. So I've finally decided to annoy you with my own personal ""help me decide thread"". Frankly, after months of deliberating, I'm still absolutely split between the two. I'm going to try and be really thorough about me and my situation in the hopes that someone will offer some novel insight into why I should attend one over the other that'll make me completely confident of my choice. With that being said, let me jump in.

About me: I am a 24-year-old with no ties to either city or region. After graduating from undergrad, I worked for a year in finance and another year as an intern with a state judge. I'm not going to delude myself into thinking my current goals will remain stringent during law school, but currently, I'd like to shoot for a federal clerkship and if I can't do that, a few years in prestigious big-law.

My thoughts on Northwestern: First, some relevant data points on Northwestern (all Class of 2014 numbers):

LST employment score: **81.1%**

Large firm score (% who go to firms of 101 lawyers or more): **55.7%**

Federal Clerkship rate: **9.3%**

Total Fed Clerk + Big Law: **65%**

Northwestern, first of all, gave me more money, which is great. 15k isn't anything to scoff at, in my mind. Another huge plus that has made me lean towards NU is that it opens up the Chicago market, which Cornell would close off to me (If I went to Cornell, I would have no ties with Chicago, and Cornell does not feed into the Chicago market at all). I've spoken to several people who are familiar with both Big Law and the Chicago market and they've let me know that with Chicago Big Law, you have the opportunity of a much better cost of living (160k in Chicago is like 240k+ in NYC) and better quality of life (the 70-80 hour a week expectation in NYC is more the exception in Chicago). The idea that NU could open up a market where I could live much more comfortably and service my loans more effectively is very attractive, but also the possibility of avoiding burning out of Big Law too quickly by working in a less grueling environment (thus increasing both my earning potential and exit options) seems very, very attractive. As an aside, let me be clear that although Chicago may not have such a grueling expectation with hours like NYC, I doubt it's that much lower than 70-80... But any drop there is huge, I think.

My questions here are thus: **Does all this sound like a pipe dream?** Yes, NU opens up the Chicago market, but only ~36% of their 2014 went to the state of Illinois. I may not get Chicago even by going to NU, nullifying this whole line of thinking. 

**Also, am I putting the cart way before the horse?** I'm, unfortunately, prone to over-analyzing things, so if I'm ignoring some huge variables here, please tell me, in full detail, why I'm being an idiot. 

My thoughts on Cornell: 

LST employment score: **95.8%**

Large firm score: **64.4%**

Federal Clerkship rate: **9.9%**

Total Fed Clerk + Big Law: **74.3%**

Cornell's huge attraction point to me is its employment numbers. Despite its ranking, its percentages puts it in contention with schools like Chicago, Penn, NYU, Harvard, Stanford, and Columbia (they all put up a combined Fed Clerk + Big Law percentage of anywhere from 71-78%). It also doesn't seem like some fluke, as this is the second year running Cornell has been so successful in its placement. The common thinking is that Cornell benefits from its reputation as a NYC Big Law feeder. Corporations are making a lot of big moves, and as a result NYC is demanding a lot of corporate legal work, thus NYC Big Law hiring is booming. It seems like if I go to Cornell and don't shit the bed academically, I will be a shoe in for Big Law in NYC, while also having the potential to be competitive for Federal Clerkships (at a marginally higher rate than NU). Employment-wise, Cornell wins out. However, as I stated before, the cost of living in NYC would be such that I'd essentially have to live out of a ~~shoebox~~ studio if I wanted any chance of effectively servicing my loans and saving some money on the side. 

The major question for Cornell, and overall, is this: **Is the difference in employment numbers (9.3%) enough to walk away from the potential for Chicago Big Law?**

One thing you might say is that I'm not giving enough thought to the schools themselves. I'm an extremely malleable person and have lived in many different climates, so weather and city-life/isolation don't really rank high on my considerations. All things being equal, I'd imagine attending Cornell would be easier just because I'm used to living on an actual campus and not having to commute to class or deal with a city, but all that seems like secondary considerations (Again, if you feel they aren't, please feel free to tell me how stupid I'm being).

So, there it is. I tried to be as thorough as possible. Does anyone here have any advice to offer? Any and all insight would be greatly appreciated.

I'm going to tag /u/bl1nds1ght, /u/aelphabawest , /u/zhirzzh , /u/brikachuu , /u/czpczp , and /u/copyright_j in the hopes that I can entice someone to read this long thread of rambling and potentially even offer some advice. 

To anyone who takes the time to read this, thanks. To anyone who tries to offer some insight, thankser. And if one of you miraculously helps me pick one school over the other, thanksest. "

    I have been exclusively dating a girl since October, now I'm not sure I want to be so exclusive anymore, and I don't know how to say it.  It's not that I want to stop seeing her completely, but I think I just want or need to take a step back from the relationship, and I want to do it breaking her heart as little as possible. If she doesn't want to see me at all, I respect that, but I hope I didn't have to.  

  I know she really likes me. I really like her, too, but really think she wants to be more serious and I  don't want that. I probably should have not asked her out exclusively, as we were seeing each other for a few months already, and I think we were both quite happy. I knew that she wanted to be exclusive with me, though, and at first I didn't, but the weather was getting colder and I was getting all lovey dovey, so I did.  

  We work together, which is a problem. More specifically, we are about to start working together full time, as she was only a summer intern at my job, I don't like to do the job-relationship thing, and I really had no idea she'd end up working here, as we get a lot of summer interns just come and gone.  

  When I asked her out, I was very comfortable because of the distance we had. She goes to school about 2 hours from me. I was dating and living with my ex for 3 years, and after a bitter breakup, I did not want to be ""close"" with anyone. So after being totally single for a while, the idea of having a girlfriend I can be emotionally close with, but have a little distance between us was very comfortable and inviting to me, as I was beginning to long for that kind of bond I had with my ex.  

  Of course things are changing now, and my gf will be moving from school, back to my town, and start working with me full time. I know I am going to feel uncomfortable with the distance, I am kind of a wild guy and I like to be spontaneous and don't feel like baring the responsibilities of a relationship right now. She is incredibly sweet, and she wants more from me, and she deserves it. Her family likes me, and I was invited to her graduation dinner in a couple weeks. Should I wait until after then to tell her? How can I do this without being a jerk?  

  I feel like I am doing something wrong. Am I doing something wrong?
  Any advice would be great.
  Thanks."

Not realy sure if this is the right sub, but some advise or insight would be appreciated. I'm now in my second year of PhD. During this time, my SO has been actively looking for a PhD for himself, but unsuccessful so far.

He's applied to a lot of positions and sent so many mails, always showing interest and so, but they usually remain unanswered or come back saying no and good luck. He also tried asking not for a PhD but starting with smaller things such as internships and so, but yet the answers were not positive.

His field of expertise is Public Health and Epidemiology, in which he has 2 masters and some field work done. However, he started his studies as a physiotherapist, and maybe this is what is keeping him away of getting a PhD, I guess some people may consider medicine students more suitable for this?
Anyway, he's quite moody and down about this and is starting to think maybe he is not good enough or he should start considering a different future. I realy don't know what to tell him or how to cheer him up, considering there's little I can do regarding this matter, apart from helping him looking for options and writing mails and cover letters. 
So I was hoping maybe any of you guys could provide some different advice or perspective.

Thanks a lot!"

I recently finished taking certification classes in Photovoltaics (solar power). Im nearing the end of a paid internship at a small solar company and am about to begin working full time for them. I love the company and love how small and hungry they are to succeed. My internship currently only pays $12/hr. I was hired to learn just the installation aspect but the company realized i have a variety of skills and quickly bumped me up to project coordinator. I've been given my own office, i do estimates, draw up contracts, and handle other aspects of sales. I'm also going to be updating and managing their website as well as increasing their presence in the community with various marketing strategies. On top of that I handle any computer issues they have and also participate in the physical installation of the photovoltaic and solar thermal jobs we sign. In the next few days I'll be having a meeting with the owner and i want to be prepared to negotiate my salary and potential commission or bonus additions to that. The company is fairly small. The owner also has a hard cider business, a magnetic business, and a spray foam insulation business all located on the same company campus. I know they don't have alot of money coming in, but i also know that I'm going to change that fairly drastically in the coming months. What do you guys think would be a fair wage to ask for? I'm debating maybe asking for 40k a year which doesn't seem like much but i know they aren't currently a major player in the game. I'll be working ten to twelve hours a day so maybe an hourly wage with commission or something would be more beneficial to me. Everyone's input would be super  helpful. Also, is there any other subs i should ask this to? Thanks!

34swqg,4,2015-05-04,"My (24m) friends are getting more and more distant. I suspect jealousy, but that does not explain everything.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34swqg/my_24m_friends_are_getting_more_and_more_distant/,"Throwaway because my friends have reddit. Let's hope that they aren't subscribed to this subreddit.

Things are going downhill with me and my friends. Since we all started our internships (we are in our last year of college), they have become distant.

Especially towards me. I'm doing a special internship at a big company. Nothing special about that, if it was not for the fact that I'm working for my own startup with the guidance of that company. There are even some contracts that says that all the IP I create, belongs to me.

You could say that I'm seeing ghosts, but since previous year, when I announced that I'm working on a startup with help of our college and a few other companies, my friends didn't believe me and even ridiculed me. It was only when I got special privileges from college, like being able to skip classes, postpone exams and getting in special workshops and courses, that they understood that I'm serious.

And now my internship is halfway over, I'm getting ignored and don't even get invited to tag along to parties. I talked to one of my friends, who is doing his internship outside of the country, and he said that I might give them the feeling that I don't like to hang out with them. (I always come online to talk to them, but leave afterwards because I'm way too tired.) He wasn't sure if that was the reason, because he is abroad and didn't talk to them a lot either.

Right now there is this huge elephant in the room because I and 2 other friends were not invited for a party (we always go together) and no one wants to tell us why. They even went so far to send us drunk pictures from the place they were at. I tried talking about it and asked where they went and if there is something wrong but the question just gets ignored. 

This all sounds childish and trivial, but for me it is a big deal because I never had a lot of / zero friends and now when things get bad, I want to know why. And more importantly, how to deal with it.

Edit: I posted this with a different title a few minutes ago, but that one seemed to be a bit confusing.

**TLDR**: Things are going downhill since I do a special internship. I suspect jealousy, but that does not explain why some other friends are thrown under the bus as well."
34symg,1,2015-05-04,"Me [24F] with my coworkers [20s-40s M/F]of several months. Foreign intern uninvited to office retreat, how to address it in a culturally sensitive way?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34symg/me_24f_with_my_coworkers_20s40s_mfof_several/,"So this is a pretty petty situation but I want to approach it in a professional matter so I thought I’d turn to Reddit as a sounding board.


Tl;dr: I’m interning in another country, myself and the other intern in my division were uninvited to the company retreat at the end of the month, but no one has officially told us we're not invited. I feel disrespected as a professional by the lack of transparent communication. How to handle the situation, particularly in a culturally sensitive way?



Longer version:

I’m spending a few months interning at a small company in a European country. I feel very lucky have this opportunity, but there’s been a lack of transparent communication in the workplace and it’s really beginning to bother me.



Some background info:

-There are maybe 20 people in our office, split between two divisions. Co-workers range from 20s to 40s and are all from European countries. There is another office within this country that has roughly the same size and makeup. The language of business is English.


-In my office there is myself and another intern in the same division. We are both mid-20s and from English speaking but non-European countries. Our contracts both end May 31st.


-Our direct manager works out of the other office and we see him maybe once a week if that. He is very nice but when the other intern and I have expressed concerns before he generally just says “ok” and then does nothing about it.


-Both myself and the other intern were originally verbally offered longer contracts but when we received the paperwork we found the contracts had been shortened. Not a huge deal, but we were irritated that we weren’t told the contracts were shortened, we only found out by reading through our contracts when we received them. (Guess this should have been a sign of things to come…)


-The other intern and I do real work, not just photocopying or coffee runs. We create content (sometimes whole reports or presentations) that are given to clients with little-to-no contribution from other coworkers.


-All of our coworkers are generally very nice and we all have occasionally gone to happy hours and whatnot socially.


-In the few months I’ve been here there have been a few happy hours and team lunches paid for by the company that myself and the other intern have been invited to, and there seemed to be no issue with us being there.


-While there’s constant complaints about the budget, we have seen receipts left in the printer where are coworkers are spending the night in 700€ a night hotels on their business trips.


The current incident:
There is an annual company retreat scheduled for the final two work days of May. At the retreat, all of the employees from both offices within the country are taken to a hotel (which the company pays for) for bonding activities and work discussions. This retreat has been talked about in front of myself and the other intern, coworkers have spoken to us as if we were included, we were asked to fill out a survey of our availability when the dates were being decided, and we have been included on emails discussing the scheduling of the retreat. So all indications were that we were to be included. However, we never received an ‘official’ invite via the online calendar system. 


I was out of the office for a day last week due to a guest in town (something I had cleared with my manager weeks before) and I received a text from the other intern that she and I were not, in fact, invited to the retreat. Turns out one of our coworkers was speaking to the admin who let it slip that we interns were not included. This co-worker told the other intern because she felt we should know (since no one had officially told us). The other intern looked at the online company calendar and found that everyone else in the office was scheduled for this retreat except for the two of us. Even the 3 interns from the other division housed in our office (granted I think the other division has a separate budget and these interns from the other division have longer contracts that end in a few months, rather than the end of May) were included.


And while my feelings are rather hurt at not being included, I’m more upset that I feel professionally disrespected that I was not told to my face that I was not to be included. Because everyone will be on the retreat, myself and the other intern will actually finish mid-week the last week of May. I have already booked my flight home with the understanding that I had work commitments through the end of May (as that is how long my contract is for). If I had known I would have those 2 days off, I would have booked a different flight. 


The other intern and I have still not been ‘officially’ told that we’re not included on the retreat and that we have those two days off. We just heard it from a co-worker who was told by an admin, which really irritates me. The admin is the one who makes all the bookings though, so it is confirmed that we have not been booked for the retreat. This isn’t something we should hear through office gossip.


I want to speak to the manager but I’m not sure how to approach it because he is so passive (and is only at our office maybe once a week) and because I haven’t been officially told, I don’t want to be seen as jumping to conclusions (even though it has been confirmed). I suspect no one will actually tell me officially until the week of, which I find to be very awkward. I’m also a little wary because of cultural differences. While to myself and the other intern see this as blatantly rude (the not telling us part), we have been told that culturally communication in this country is quite passive. I’d like to approach it in a culturally sensitive way. 

Also, is it petty to recuse myself from any further office events? Obviously I would still attend work meetings, but there is a monthly team lunch (not a working lunch, just a bonding time) and I just don’t feel like going since it’s blatantly clear that I’m not seen as ‘part of the team’ but I don’t want to come off as dramatic.

34t2ih,3,2015-05-04,"The company has posted the pay range in the job ad. With my qualifications, how much can I realistically request?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/34t2ih/the_company_has_posted_the_pay_range_in_the_job/,"So I'm interviewing for a job as a web editor and social media/community manager tomorrow. A friend of my husband  posted a little job ad on her Facebook and Twitter account, so he put me in touch with her. She forwarded my CV, cover letter, and two writing examples to her boss and he has granted me an interview. 

Main details:

* I really want this freaking job, it sounds awesome and I love writing. I am a creative person and I think that I will thrive in this position and atmosphere, as it was described to me.

* I live in Paris and this company is searching for an American or British web editor to manage and write for the website, as well as manage the social media accounts, in English (specifically the Queen's English). 

* I am American and I have been teaching British English (ESL) for the past four years so I am very familiar with differences between American and British English, including expressions, idioms, and spelling. My connection at the company told me that there is a possibility they will launch an American version of the website in the future, so hiring me over a British candidate could benefit them, as they would not feel the need to hire an American in the future (saving money). 

* I am 27 and I have been living abroad (and out of college) for four years. 

* I studied theatre for five years at university in the U.S., but did take a lot of creative writing courses, playwriting, dramaturgy (research), etc. In high school I wrote for the yearbook, the school newspaper, and won some regional and national contests in writing. Although I do not feel that my high school accomplishments and experience ""count"" for much, it is worth noting that I have a history of loving to write. 

* I don't have a Twitter account. I do have a Facebook account and a lot of my FB friends and family follow my posts and photos, even the ones I haven't talked to in years. I feel like this says something about my ability to entertain people and keep ""followers"", but since they're friends and family it is probably not worth noting in my interview or I'll sound like a dope.

* I studied theatre for a few months here in Paris this past fall/winter, but I quit because I felt that it was a repetition of my previous studies in the U.S. and because I was unhappy with the curriculum. The professor did not allow enough time to create quality work, and this was very bothersome to me, especially as someone interested in writing.

* My only real experience in this field was a 3-month summer internship (2012) with a very hip and cute online magazine in Paris (it still exists today). I was hired to assist with the launch of the English version of the website. I wrote some original blog articles on subjects like DIY, cuisine, fashion, etc. and helped to translate the old French blog articles to English. I also did research to find bloggers and contact them to ask them if they'd like to be a contributor to our magazine. Note: I have scoured the website and can no longer find any of my original blog posts, so I don't have any proof of my writing now, but if he were to contact the magazine editor, she would certainly remember me in a positive light.

* My background says that my main passion is theatre, but I love writing. Unfortunately I put writing on the back-burner and it is obvious in my CV. One of the main reasons for that shift in college was that the English department and creative writing courses at my university were weak. It has also been affected by the fact that I moved to France without speaking the language, and for four years I have been building my language skills and the only jobs really available to me were: nanny, English teacher, or student. I feel that this has damaged my CV. 

I discovered that the company posted a few Craigslist ads over the past month and they listed the pay range between 20,000 - 30,000. I have done some research and I found that the average beginner salary for this position is around 18,000 euros annually, but that it can range up to 26,000 for an entry-level position. 

I know I am getting ahead of myself here because I haven't even had an interview, but I'd like to prepare myself in any way possible, especially since this is my first interview for a salaried position. 

**Considering my history and qualifications, how much should I realistically shoot for if they do make me an offer or ask me what I'd like to make?**

If I request 30,000 are they going to laugh in my face and escort me to the door? 

Any other general advice would be very welcome and I appreciate any information you can offer. Thank you!"

34t4de,1,2015-05-04,Parents want to buy back the car we bought together.,The_Incredible_Derp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34t4de/parents_want_to_buy_back_the_car_we_bought/,"About 4 years ago my parents and I bought a car for 7200€. My share of the payment was 2200€, leaving another 5000€ for my parents. 

The car is registered under my name and is considered mine at home. My parents will pay for all costs that come with the car until this September because the person that uses it the most is my mom.(including gas and insurance etc).

I myself don't have a big need for the car (although it comes in handy from time to time). So it could end up being not used for days on end.

My parents offered to completely return my share of the money to me, allowing them to sell the car and get back at least part of their investment.

On the one hand, keeping the car would mean i'd be able to travel to and from my place of employment (internship) more easily (if a car would even be needed for that) and should I ever need to travel a longer distance, i'd have a car. 

On the other hand, I'd get all of my money back. With cars losing 
about 10% value per year (something I read online) my original 2200€ would only be worth around €1450. So i'd be ""not losing"" 750€ by selling it back to my parents.

And so here's my problem: I'm not sure what i should do. Keep the car or get back my money. Perhaps there are some aspects of this i'm missing that would make the choice a lot easier to make. 

If anyone could give me some advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

34tjfo,132,2015-05-04,I [25F] saw my friend's [31F] husband [32M] on Tinder,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34tjfo/i_25f_saw_my_friends_31f_husband_32m_on_tinder/,"First, some context. Beth* has been my coworker for ~3 years and during this time we have developed a good friendship. I wouldn't by any means call her my best friend but she's close to my heart. She and her husband Joe* have been married for about 5 years now and we have often hung out together. Just to be clear I am not friends with Joe; he simply is the husband of my good friend.

Beth talks about Joe like he is the light of her life. Even though they both work full time jobs she makes sure to get home before him so she can make dinner and they can sit down and have a family meal. She prioritizes their relationships and has had to cancel plans with me in the past to take care of him when he's sick, to visit his family, etc. Beth is all about Joe. 

About 2 months ago I went to a local bar with another friend of mine. We sat down at the bar and just a few stools away was Joe with a strange woman who I hadn't seen before. At first I wasn't too worried but they seemed to be getting very cozy with one another. As we got up to leave Joe noticed us and we made eye contact. I didn't say anything and just left the bar. 

A week or so later Beth, Joe, and I had dinner together and while his wife was in the bathroom he explained that the woman I saw him with was an intern at his company and they were celebrating a job well done. He claims they had been part of a group but the others had left earlier and they were the only two left. I told him that as long as Beth knew about it I didn't mind plus it was none of my business anyway what he did on his free time. 

Fast forward to a week ago. I was browsing Tinder at home when I ran across a picture of Joe along with an active profile. I was shocked. I scrolled through the pictures and confirmed that it was him. He was even using a picture taken ON HIS HONEYMOON. I swiped left (of course) but took a screencap of his profile just in case. 

People of Reddit, I don't know what to do. On the one hand, I realize that it takes two to tango and if Joe is unhappy is may not be his fault. I don't obviously know what's going on in the confines of their marriage. On the other they are talking about buying a house and having children. Personally I would want to know if my SO had an active Tinder profile and was seen out at bars with a strange woman. I have been sitting on this information for a week now because I am afraid to possibly be the one to break up their marriage. 

*names have been changed to protect the innocent (and guilty)

tl;dr In addition to seeing a good friend's husband at the bar with another woman, I discovered his Tinder profile. I need to know if I should tell her that her husband is being shady.

I am a High School Junior from Singapore, and I really want to go to the U.S. For further studies, however while I have near perfect grades, I have almost no ECs.

I have spent half my life since 7th grade tinkering with software and learning programming, although I have no real projects to show for it. I am, currently working on a website.

Recently, I got the opportunity to go to CERN for a month between my Junior and Senior year and I grabbed it. Now, however that there is a month left for me to go, I am having second thought. Switzerland is expensive and I have to take care of all of my expenses myself. I'm not from a very rich family and this trip will put a little dent in my fathers finances. Besides money, I will also be wasting a lot of time, time that I could spend programming or something like that.

Will the internship help me with my admissions?

Please help me out!"
34tvu0,3,2015-05-04,Me (23F) with my ex(?) (24M) trying to figure out my next move.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34tvu0/me_23f_with_my_ex_24m_trying_to_figure_out_my/,"Ok, so this is going to be long.

I first met my ex in college when I was dating another guy. I'd been with him for 4 years, and never had been the kind of girl that liked another guy while being with someone. But I did on this guy. So, naturally I started to avoid him.

Well, that didn't work. We ended up having a class together the next semester and we needed partners. He ended partnering with me, and I was so afraid of my feelings that I ended up not going to classes to just avoid him, though that didn't work out since we were partners. Around that time, I could feel my boyfriend and me growing apart. He ended up telling me that if he moved for an internship, that we would break up.

I ended up telling the new guy who I will refer to as A from now on. A said that if my relationship had conditions like that, I shouldn't be in it. I ended up staying with my current bf, though I had suspicions A was into me after that. They were confirmed when I ran into A's roommate at a party, and he recognized me as the girl his roommate liked that was dating a douchebag.

After that, I stopped talking with A altogether, though we ended up hanging out a few times over the summer through chance encounters. Eventually we ended up talking, I realized I didn't want to be with my bf, and we broke up. A and I talked more, hung out more, and eventually he asked me out. We went on a date, it was great, and we ended up dating for a while.

About 5 months into dating, A broke up with me out of the blue. It came out of nowhere, as we had told each other we loved each other. It turned out that A had started going through clinical depression, and became an almost completely different person. I stayed with him as long as I could, because I truly loved him and he asked me to. But eventually it became too much and I left.

About six months after that, he came to me and told me he had recovered, and wanted to give us another shot. I was hesitant because of how much I had been hurt, and was dating someone new, but I told him I would think about it. We ended up talking almost every day and I felt I had a stronger connection to A than I did with the current guy. But for whatever reason, I stuck with the current guy and told A that that was my choice. 

After that we didn't talk. Things didn't work out with that guy, and I ended up seeing someone else on again off again for about 8 months. I don't want to get into details, but this guy was emotionally and physically abusive, and had a way of messing with me that no one else could. 

During one of the off again moments, around July of last year, I ran into A again. We talked and I explained everything that had been happening. We hung out for about a week, but I ended up blowing him off when we planned to go on a hike. I was still reeling about the abusive guy, who was constantly blowing my phone up, and I just couldn't handle it. A was upset, which I guess he had a right to be since I did blow him off with no explanation. He didn't try and talk to me after that.

I ended up feeling really guilty about the whole situation in October, and texted him an apology, but he never responded. I kept dating the abusive guy (I know, I know) until around January, when I got an email from A.

In it, he told me off for how upset he was at how I treated him, how mad he was that I would do that, and, for a few other things, how I was afraid. Afraid to go after what I wanted, and to stand up for myself, and other things.

I know it sounds weird, but that email was the wake up call I needed. I broke up with the abusive guy and ended up emailing A that I was glad he emailed me and tried to explain everything behind my reasoning and rationale. We we mailed for a while, and at the end of it, I told him that I'd always be there for him. He ended it telling me that he appreciated it, but that he wouldn't take me up on that, because he probably couldn't trust me.

After a week, I realized how much id done wrong with A, and emailed him a true apology. No excuses. Just owning up to my mistakes. His response was that he wanted to meet up with me. We did, and I felt like I was under a microscope to begin with, to see if my letter was sincere. As the night went on, it became more and more clear that both of us still had feelings for each other.

I was hesitant at first because I didn't want A to become a rebound, but we ended up seeing each other a lot in the coming weeks, and started going on dates. However, I was and am still mad about my abusive situation, and it showed with A.

A would say things that my abuser used to say, and it would make me feel really untrusting. I was angry and upset still, especially since the abuser kept hounding me and trying to talk after the fact. But I was happy with A, even if I didn't totally trust him.

After two months, around the end of March, A asked me how he thought things were going. I told him that I truly appreciated him and what he's done for me the past couple months (seriously, he's been a rock. Came over when I was sad, been there for me, given me space when I asked for it, etc.) that I didn't totally trust him. He told me that that hurt, and when I told him if he knew that I cared about him, he said honestly he didn't know sometimes. That not being trusted after all of this hurt and he didn't know what else he could do. I told him that it wasn't his fault, but that his actions showed that he did care about me and wanted my best interests.

The next day, he called me and asked to meet him in a park near my house. There, he told me that he really did care about me and wanted to be there for me, but that he didn't want to be in the way of recovering from my trust issues. That he didn't think I'd be able to overcome all that had happened with my abuser if I was constantly relying on him instead of myself. And that the mistrust that I had for him hurt, and he didn't want to end up resenting me.

I didn't want him out of my life. Even though I couldn't totally trust him, I still liked spending time with him. I still wanted him around. But I knew what he was doing was for my best interest, and I respected him for that. So we agreed to put thing on pause. No contact except for the end of the month.

Over the next month, he and I tried to contact each other despite the no contact rule. Because of my trust issues, I figured he was trying to reneg on the agreement and wanted more from me than I could give. He texted me one day after seeing me if I could pray for him, because his uncles had died and his family was going through really bad times. The whole time I thought he was just using that as an excuse to talk to me, so I barely responded. When we were supposed to get together at the end of the month, he called me on Sunday, but I didn't want to respond too quickly. I just ignored his call and text the next day.

He ended up showing up at my door, and asked what was going on. Why Id been distant with his family troubles and ignoring his calls. I told him I thought he was using those as excuses to talk to me, and showing up at my door confirmed that. That his actions showed someone that wanted more than what we agreed to. He just sat there stunned and tried to explain himself, but I couldn't believe what he was saying. He seemed emotional, but I knew that I had to stay strong for me. I told him that he was supposed to be giving me space for myself, and that he should honor that and his word. I told him that I can't hang out with him if he wants more. He told me that we shouldn't hang out soon then, considering we both know how we feel about each other, and that would be in our minds.

He hugged me, he left. So that's where we are now. But the thing is, I miss him still. I miss talking to him and having him be there for me. But since this he's blocked me on Facebook, which to be fair is what he said he'd do. But I don't know what to do with him. Right now I know I need to focus on getting myself better, but instill miss him. What should I do?

TL;DR: Me and my ex reconnected, but I can't get over what another abusive ex did to me, and couldn't trust him. We agreed to take time apart, but I miss him. What do I do?"

I'm 28 years old and went back to graduate school this year for 2 years. 


I left my job over the summer of 2014 and transferred the total amount of my 401k ($100k) into an IRA. My income for 2014 totaled ~$40k.


For 2015 I only have summer internship money and will be making ~$21k.


I want to transfer a significant portion of my IRA into a Roth IRA.


The tax brackets for a single filer in 2015 are:


10%	Up to $9,225

15%	$9,226 to $37,450

25%	$37,451 to $90,750

28%	$90,751 to $189,300

I want to transfer up to the limit of the 25% tax bracket and pay the tax to move about 68k from the IRA to a Roth IRA.

This will be an almost 15k tax bill. I also have the american education opportunity tax credit of 2k for 2014, 2015 and 2016 which is nice.


Why do I want to do this?
- Contributions into a Roth IRA can be withdrawn at any time without penalties, only gains in the Roth IRA accounts have penalties and protocols to follow.


- This will be the last time until I retire (fingers crossed) that I will be at this tax bracket.


- I will have close to 100k in contributions in a roth 401k that I can tap into penalty free for business opportunities in the future.



Additional info: 
- No credit card dept


- No student loans


- No debt period


- Emergency fund enough for 18 months, need to find additional investment vehicles this year to lower this to 6 months, thinking wealthfront


Any thoughts?

34ub85,1,2015-05-04,Big 4 auditing has made me want to seek other career opportunities. Looking for advice,RG788,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/34ub85/big_4_auditing_has_made_me_want_to_seek_other/,"Hi there,

**A little background**

* I completed a tax busy season at a small firm.

* I also did a 4 month all-around accounting internship including audit/tax/research/book-keeping (where I was actually doing real accounting work/research/etc - not like the big 4 copy and paste internship)
* I also did a big 4 3 month internship.

* I've just completed my first Big 4 busy season. 

* I also have a background of working as an independent contractor doing various things - mostly tech related. 

**Question 1**

After 1 year (and 4 months, I guess) at big 4 combined with my work at 2 other accounting firms equating to about 8 months of real accounting experience - could I consider myself to have 2 years of public accounting experience without being dishonest? I did a tax busy season (3 months), 4 months of various accounting work, a 3 month internship in audit, and will complete a year+4 months or so at big 4 in a few months. 


**Dilemma**

* I did my undergraduate in a foreign language, I speak the language conversationally. I worked/lived abroad/went to school abroad for 1 year.
* I completed my masters in accounting seeking job security / a real career. 
* I've always viewed accounting as a great business background to have when I was presented with the options when working in business as a whole.


I think the year at the big 4 has been really invaluable in terms of learning, getting my feet wet, and gaining some exposure. I work on private clients, they get messy, and I feel like I have learned a lot. One thing I am surprised about is that the difference between experienced seniors/managers and new staff mostly seems to be just that - Experience. I have a great understanding of accounting concepts and theory - for example a senior manager was explaining to 2nd year senior how functional currency was determined - I already knew that answer based on a project I worked on and my work during school. Accounting has always come fairly easily to me.

I feel like I am not being challenged enough - I am being challenged in all of the wrong ways -  dealing with stupid bullshit from management (tickmarks / fonts / presentation preferences) - but never in the interesting ways (testing approaches, accounting theory, -REAL- planning rather than just working around planning ) - I feel like seniors do most of this (for good reason, I understand) - but the senior lifestyle seems horrible (everyone is worked to death). 


Long story short - I've always found accounting intriguing, and it looks more interesting as I move up, but I want to have a life and I have other interests outside of accounting - entrepreneurial projects on the back-burner due to long hours - I'm big into computers but am falling behind on my online programming self-taught courses because of the long hours - etc..etc... 

In the last year I've learned that auditing in the Big 4 doesn't seem like a good path for me. I have no interest in becoming a partner. I barely have an interest in becoming a senior (only for the more interesting technical aspects), and I have no interest in becoming a controller or working in back-office accounting for the rest of my life - the last few weeks I have been wondering where everything is leading, and I don't know. All I seem to know is that it probably isn't ending up where I want to be.

I've always wanted to be an accountant that doesn't work in accounting - if that makes sense - A strong accounting background with other skills to add value for clients or to a business of my own. This has made me explore the options for where I want to eventually end up, and I was hoping to hear your opinions.

* Data analytics / Data analysis 
This seems interesting to me because it seems like a way to utilize (and develop) my knowledge of computers and programming in a way that ties to business - it sounds like using data to help companys make useful decisions is one reason I chose accounting - I've just found accounting (auditing) to be more about documentation and double-checking rather than value-add work I was hoping for. 
Does anyone have any experience with business/data analysis work? If so, where do you think I should get started in terms of skill development? Any opinions on the day to day? The hours and pay? 

* Advisory services
Various work in advisory seems more interesting simply due to the value add behind the work that would feel, but I fear it would be a little too much like audit for the departments I could likely transfer into (like, little mini-audits for due diligence)

* PHD/Accounting professor
This path has crossed my mind as I used to teach in a foreign country, thoroughly enjoyed teaching, tutored during school, and it feeds into my interest in the over-arching accounting theory itch - I do really like accounting - I've just felt like I don't like the day to day B/S I deal with in accounting. I guess it's hard to explain - I get overly excited when I explain someone outside of accounting how to develop an approach to gain comfort over the work we are doing - but I kinda despise getting the support and doing all the bitch work - which I realize would probably get better as moving up in Public - I just want to have a real life to and those values seem to not match up. Maybe a smaller firm would be better? (I enjoyed working in the small firm I worked at in a rural area). My obvious concern is that a PHD is about research, and a huge opportunity cost.

* Entrepreneurship 
I have a variety of interesting business ideas that I have been wanting to explore - but I just don't have the time as an auditor to go to monthly networking events, business incubator meetups, or even spend time developing some projects I have been researching because I get home and am wiped out from long public hours. In terms of entrepreneurship, I have considered looking at non-profit work to free up hours (seems like work weeks are 35-40  hours per most listing) so I can work on those projects, or I can try to do a flexible scheduling (ie; only work during busy season, get a cash infusion for start-up costs getting overtime, etc..)


If anybody would like to share their thoughts, experiences, etc, I would greatly appreciate it. I know the ""ideal time"" to leave public is 3-7 years depending, but I am concerned it's leading to a destination I'm not terribly interested in. I have 100% confidence in my abilities ( I am a top performer, I have skills outside of accounting, I am about 5 years older than my start class due to other experiences, etc). 


Thank you, sorry for the crazy long post.

In short I also want to add that I'm not super stressed out from the hours, I think it is a combination of things. It seems like the hours are long, the work is boring and tedious with lots of B/S, and the pay is pretty bad. I would think one of these 3 things needs to change (preferably the interesting work), because the combination is making me pretty miserable.

34upd8,3,2015-05-04,I'm not sure how angry I should be at my B-I-L. But I most certainly angry.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/34upd8/im_not_sure_how_angry_i_should_be_at_my_bil_but_i/,"My B-I-L has lived with us for almost a year and a half. He came for an internship and stayed after getting a job to save up. It was a hard time for me - he showed up while my father was dying and then stayed after his death. But he is my husband's brother and I liked him and so was glad to help him out. 

He has a pretty good deal - his own room and bathroom on his own floor, all utilities and costs paid, housekeepers even. In return he has to dog sit when my husband and I travel. That’s it. He has save thousands of dollars and had a pretty cushy lifestyle for the past 18 months. 

Most of the time, he is a pretty good houseguest. He is friendly and offers to help with things like carrying groceries. His room is a mess, but he cleans up after himself in the rest of the house. 

Still, he did do some things that I thought were inconsiderate. He broke a fragile wooden figuring by putting his stuff on it. I glued it together, put it in storage, and he broke it again putting stuff on it on there. While my husband was travelling, he had guests over who took my expensive jacket from a closet and a large throw pillow from my husband’s and my bedroom.  In all cases he denied any knowledge or responsibility (so thieves broke into our home, damaged nothing, and took only a throw pillow and a woman’s jacket?). 

The last time we travelled was a few weeks ago (to deal with things related to my father’s estate). Shortly before we left, my dog contracted a urinary tract infection. The vet prescribed antibiotics, and she appeared to be fully healed by the time we left. She still had some days of antibiotics though.  My B-I-L did not give her the complete antibiotics course. He also did not give my dog her allergy medicine.  He let her face the severe discomfort of a UTI and allergies (which in her case is itchy, inflamed paws that she then licks and makes worse) rather than deal with the hassle of giving her the medicine that keeps her symptom free. 

Then, my dog peed on a rug. She *never* does this. Never. I assume she did it because her UTI returned once my B-I-L stopped giving her the antibiotics she needed. 

The rug in question is my prized possession. It is a Persian rug from the 1930s. I looked for auctions and online for months until I found it. I bought it at an auction for a fifth of its true value. Even so, it cost me a month’s income. For me though, it was worth it.  It is a treasure. Or should I say was, because my B-I-L ruined it.

Dog pee is icky, but can be handled. My husband’s (now-dead) dog peed on that very same rug and it was cleaned fine. B-I-L ruined my rug through thoughtlessness. 

He started by pouring clothing detergent on it. Not even rug cleaner. You can’t do that on old rugs with natural dyes. A simple online search or calling me could have told him that. He then put the rug cleaner on the spot and walked away. He didn’t stay to do it manually or make sure it was OK. When he came back, the dye was gone and the pattern ruined, the wool wasn’t in great shape from the brush of the cleaner. He ruined my most treasured possession and cost me the value of a small car. 

There is also a pad under the rug. B-I-L did not even try to clean that. Instead, he folded it up and put it in our garage. When we got home, it was still there, waiting for us in the garage, a piss-soaked, molding, stinking, totally ruined pad. My husband threw it away. That pad cost $800 (I bought the best trying to care for my dear rug). 

Regarding the rug, when my B-I-L realized what he’d done, he called my husband in a panic. My husband called an oriental rug cleaner and restorer. They took it and did some work (it took them a month!), but could not get it to a point where there was no obvious damage. It is ruined. The restoration effort cost $2000. 

I am heartsick. That rug is over eighty years old. It is a treasure, made by many hands over many months, if not years. It lasted so long, travelled so wide and endured so much. And while it was in my possession that beauty and legacy is killed.

On top of the actual problem of failing to care for a living, feeling dog and destroying my treasured rug, B-I-L acts like it never happened. He discussed the rug damage once with my husband, when he called about it, but with me, it is if it never happened. He never mentioned the giant empty spot in the middle of the room for the past month while I waited to see what the restorers could do. He never apologized. He never acknowledged how much I love that rug. He never mentioned the pissed-on pad he left in our garage for us to find when we returned from our trip. For him, with me, it is as if it never happened.  

My B-I-L knows that I am upset by this. I previously asked my husband to talk to him without result.  Yesterday, the rug was delivered by the rug restorers. B-I-L was there too, but said nothing. I was so horrified by seeing the damage that I had to leave the room to avoid bursting into tears in front of the rug people. 

After paying the restorers, my husband went up to talk to me, and then went to talk to my B-I-L. He explained that I am unhappy that my rug is destroyed, and that B-I-L appears to care so little for the result of his actions or my feelings that he never apologized or offered to make amends. 

My B-I-L reacted by avoiding me. My B-I-L has reacted by avoiding me. First when he saw me he did not look up or say a word, just stayed looking at his computer at my dining table.  I didn’t say anything to him to be fair – I wanted to see what he would say. Which was nothing. Then he left the house, and went up to his bedroom upon return. Today, he left the house before I was up (and he usually doesn’t go to work until later, or works form home). He has my phone number as well. Even after having it all spelled out to him, he didn’t apologize.

When trying to think why he acts like this, I imagine that he thinks that he is blameless, that it isn’t his fault my dog peed and it is I who owe him for watching my dog while I was away. But of course, since we've never actually talked about it, I could be wrong. 

I think that dog sitting is the least he could do for almost 18 months of free rent and support, and that not neglecting a living animal by giving a dog her medicine as agreed is a reasonable expectation.  To do otherwise is cruel to the dog. 

I feel that being a considerate and responsible non-idiot once the dog did pee was also reasonable to expect. 

Once the damage was done, I wanted him to feel bad by how upset I was, to not think he didn’t have to even acknowledge what he did, and to feel bad enough himself that he wanted to apologize and make amends. If nothing else, to worry that his brother’s wife and host is unhappy with him and want to smooth things over.

But he is not that respectful, or that considerate. At this point then, I want money. I want the $2800 the restoration and replacement pad cost. Now. He has a huge amount saved over the past year of living cost-free and can pay to fix part of the damage he caused.

I then want to sell the rug, and he can repay me the difference in the value that it has now  and what it had before it was destroyed.

Yeah it would be nicer for him to move out into a new apartment and start life with thousands and thousands of dollars in savings. But if he wanted  feel familial care and pay for the damage he caused myself (and we are not so rich that we don’t feel the 2800 we paid already or the 10K in lost value), then he should have shown me familial care and acted like mistreating my dog and damaging my most treasured possession in the world concerned him, or even that it ever happened.  

He finally has a move-out date in two weeks. He didn't, because he wants to live with a friend of his who won't move to our city until he has a job, and thought that he would stay indefinitely with us until that point, but my husband finally told him to get a place. In a way I am glad, but I'm also concerned - if he moves out then he'll always be that selfish jerk who mistreated my dog and destroyed the thing I love most and didn't care about it. And he is my husband's brother - for my husband's sake, I don't want to have that much ill-will in the family.  But ooooo am I furious.

34v0qz,12,2015-05-04,"My lifetime fight against depression, loneliness, and social axiety",[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/34v0qz/my_lifetime_fight_against_depression_loneliness/,"So I made this as a post in an Askreddit thread (question was ""when did you realize you were depressed?""), and then when I realized I had basically written a life story about myself, I looked up and found this sub so I thought I'd share. Anyways, this is the account of my life dealing with depression:

It wasn't like a sudden switch that I could recognize immediately, it was just a process over time. I don't even know when I started becoming depressed, I mean I can remember being happy as a little child with my family but being so sad and upset when I was with other children because I was bullied a lot. And then I had times where my parents were more hostile and punishing towards me, so my emotions reacted negatively. Here and there though I still had happy moments. But then later on in my youth, I experienced grief for the first couple of times after losing my grandfather and my dog and that of course left a huge void in my life and sadness over realizing the reality of death. But I'm still not sure whether I'd say I was clinically depressed at that time.

My high school days is when I'd say I really came across depression, though I'm not sure if it crossed that line of clinical depression, it's kind of a fuzzy line from my perspective. I was very socially inept and faced a lot of rejection; I never once had a girlfriend in high school despite how many times I summoned the courage to ask a crush out. I faced constant arguments with my parents over my schoolwork and my future (they had big expectations of me and me not knowing any better, I just went along without truly knowing where I wanted to go after high school or what I could handle). I had always been a big gamer growing up, but I got into World of Warcraft for the first time then and didn't understand the concepts of time management at all so that led to even more arguments with my parents (I play WoW again these days but much more responsibly). My grandmother was experiencing a lot of difficulties with her health and my other dog I grew up with was getting very old, eventually they both died within months of each other during my senior year. So yeah, a lot of struggles and emotional issues for me at that time.

After high school, I actually made it into the Air Force Academy (something that my parents pushed me hard into because I naively said I wanted to do that) and went through that. I guess it was surprising to other people that I wanted to get into that at first and how I was able to deal with the pressure there, but I made it through basic training and stuff fine. But then getting into academics and later actually socializing with the upper class cadets, I was struggling once again and failed classes so I had to withdraw. After coming home, my parents blew up at me and yelled and screamed about my failures. This is the moment when I knew for sure that I was at rock bottom and my depression was at an all time high because that was the first time in my life that I seriously considered and even attempted suicide by choking myself (obviously I didn't finish since I'm typing this here). In the coming months after I withdrew heavily from the world, I didn't even want to contact friends because I was so depressed and ashamed at myself for being a complete fuck-up (in my mind), at one point I cut myself and I still have a scar from it, though thankfully it's not very noticeable. Other than that, I was just escaping from reality as much as I could by playing video games for practically the entire day.

I had a bit of therapy at the time, but since that wasn't working so well, I ended up going to a program across the country for 2 months to help get me better emotionally, a rehab if you will. During this time, I was officially diagnosed with mild Asperger's Syndrome and traits of ADD, so at least it helped explain why I had so much anxiety and struggle fitting in with society. And while it wasn't easy and at times I still felt depressed being there, I guess overall it was a step back in the right direction in my life.

After that, I got in contact with friends again, I got a job and got back into school at a community college. And during this time I was even lucky enough to start dating people, though my first two attempts only lasted a couple of weeks. A year later, I got into my first serious relationship, and honestly this was the period of my life where I felt happiest and things seemed to be looking up for me. Of course there were problems here and there, but I worked through them the best I could. I was able to graduate community college with an associates degree the following year and was accepted at another university. This is when things with my girlfriend at the time deteriorated. Basically, she became upset with my friends for stupid reasons, didn't like that I would have to leave to go to college and pretty much made an ultimatum, which I had to decline so she broke up with me before I left.

So I go to university and am on my own, and at this point I just feel lost in life. Here I was, older than my peers in classes, and I didn't find anyone I fit in with (again, go figure). And I caved quickly to this, I became a lot more introverted than usual and stayed cooped up in my room, missing class after class due to anxiety; I tried to make it work, but my emotions were in complete control over me. So as you'd expect, I failed out once again and was without direction in my life again. However, I was lucky. Months after leaving, I heard of a job opportunity at my mother's work that was looking to hire people on the autism spectrum, so I applied and got in last July thanks to having my associate's degree. I've been with the company (Capital One) since as a software IT intern, and this has been a positive step in my career path as it has helped me decide upon going into Computer Science whenever I get back to taking classes and looking into programming for my career in the future. I recently put in an actual application at my company and I think it's very likely to get accepted which should have me hired full time in August, which will be my first huge step towards getting my own apartment and living independently.

Is this making me happy? Well I can't complain, but honestly no. I'm still very much unsatisfied with my social life and feeling lonely, I only see one friend (who has been there for me for most all of my life and I'm grateful to have him as my best friend), I'm still facing a lot of social anxiety over joining groups and meeting new people and I've been unable to find a relationship where I can have a close connection with someone who cares about me like I did over two years ago. I've been using a dating site for the past 7 months and it's just been an even more depressing indicator of my social standing and general attractiveness (or lack of thereof, I'm a super passive guy who's way out of shape, yeah no way women are gonna be fighting over me). Like I said earlier, I was happiest in my life when I was with someone that cared for me as much as I for her. But I have nothing like that now, and my constant failures at even getting responses from women on dating sites hurts.

So yeah, I'm still feeling a lot of depression in my life. It's more stable than it was when I was suicidal of course, but now my life just seems so dull and empty. I guess the best I can do is just keep up with the career stuff. Maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel, but I'm skeptical and pessimistic given my track record."

34v3zu,1,2015-05-04,"Me [17 M] with my on-hold boyfriend [20 M] of four months, everything is so complicated and I need help.",Help_Me_Throwaway1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34v3zu/me_17_m_with_my_onhold_boyfriend_20_m_of_four/,"Please, please, please help. I don’t know what to do.


At the tail-end of January or so, I made a post on r/lgbteens saying I felt very alone and asked for people to talk with. Everyone I talked to pretty quickly stopped messaging except one. This guy was special to me- he was so great. The way our first conversation started was I asked what kind of movies he liked as a conversation starter, we discussed that for a while, and he asked mine. I said that I like romance, comedy, romcoms, and I like horror and paranormal mystery stuff but I’m too much of a scaredy cat to watch it alone and I had no one to watch them with.

Instead of making fun of me, he told me he would cuddle me and watch them with me so I wouldn’t get scared, if he was there.

As we kept talking over chat, my crush on him only grew. He was masculine and a touch older (which is really attractive to me, he was 19 so just a bit older than 16.5 year old me), but also a huge nerd and deeply, deeply kind. We pretty much instantly clicked, and within a week we told each other secrets we haven’t told anyone else before. I was so happy, I finally had the kind of friend I’d always wanted. I told him I liked him, and he told me he liked me too.

Then, we skyped. I saw him and I was blown away- he was amazingly out-of-my-league hot. I didn’t think I had a chance, until he told me how cute I was and that he “wished he was there to make me his”, because I was a little aversive to Long Distance. 

Eventually, I caved. Our nerdy conversations about politics and pokemon were so endearing and I… fell in love. Eventually, we were able to say things like I love you and officially entered a relationship. 

He told me his older brother was a (career), and he had been scouted when going to one of his brother’s shoots. He wasn’t sure he should do it, but one year of it was pretty much singlehandedly enough to put him through college, so I convinced him to do it.

Right now, I was so happy. We were both so in love and texted each other “I love you” several times a day. We skyped for hours and when we weren’t skyping we were either texting or sleeping- we even texted while falling asleep! We made life plans, and he was supposed to visit. For the first time in my life, I felt like me against the world had turned into us against the world. I have faced down bullying, medical problems, friendlessness, obesity, underweightness (to the point where I was hospitalized for it), and countless other shit. I was so glad I finally had a best friend and romantic partner to call mine, because ever since preschool I’ve dreamed about romance. My favorite recess activity was fake marriage. I’m not even kidding. Finally, I had someone who was literally my perfect dream guy, and he told me I was his.

Now, here’s why I’m posting on r/relationships.


On Valentine’s Day, he was hit by a semi truck. He went to the hospital and had a broken arm, leg, 3 ribs, and a fractured pelvis. Initially, it made us even closer- he told me whenever he was in a lot of pain he thought of me and it made him feel less bad. Then, he had so much shit to deal with. Between missed school (almost a missed month at Vanderbilt!), dealing with insurance, rehabilitation, and everything else he was still very loving, but only spoke to me on average once every 2 or 3 weeks, and by text or email. Then, he asked to go on hold for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, we texted and he said he would call me that night… and then didn’t respond to anything for a month. Apparently, that was probably faulty texting but he didn’t make much of an effort to talk to me because he was in a really bad place. I sent a letter asking him to pick up a phone and call me, and he didn’t. About a month later, I texted him from a friend’s phone and he replied. We started talking again, and skyping, and everything seemed good. We were a happy couple again. He’s going to visit, we texted and skyped, it was great.

Now here’s where shit gets messy.


He told me saturday he needed a long-term hold on our relationship. We will stay friends and talk throughout the hold this time, but not the level of communication a healthy long-distance relationship requires and he is too busy for He is so busy with his (career), and is about to be sent all around the country soon and he just doesn’t have time. He said we’d be back together when the contract ended, but between now and then he wasn’t sure if he could stay faithful for a year in a relationship that would be on hold for so long. He promised me he would try, but he said he was afraid of slipping up. He has a lot of shit in his past and he is addicted to sex as a way of venting. It’s really strange, but he actually sees a therapist about it, among other things and so I said if he promised he would try to not, if he slipped up a few times I could forgive him. However, I told him specifically not to fuck his best friend who recently (3 days ago) came out to him as gay, because that in particular was really upsetting to me. I said “one or two drunk slip-ups I can live with, but not with [best friend]”. He promised to try his best not to hook up, and that he would not fuck his best friend. However, his best friend is a manipulative asshole and he has problems saying no because of past abuse. He is also stressed and really needed sex and was literally falling apart.

Then, later, when he was over at his house he confessed by text that he kissed him but had told him that he didn’t want to go further. I told him that if his best friend was really a good friend, he would respect his wishes and not push. He started saying things like “anything could happen, but I don’t want it to” and “he didn’t want to try to keep sex bottled up” even though he promised me earlier he would try. 

We skyped the next day after I sent him a long message about how much him sleeping with other guys during our hold meant to me and that this should be about him not having not enough time.  I'll paste what I sent in the comments, but apparently I'm not allowed to pastebin it and try to make this already-long post shorter. After a lot of heart-to-heart emotional talk, he finally agreed to try his best, and my definition of try- maybe 1 or 2 drunk slip ups, hopefully none. He promised to get up and leave whenever he felt cornered and would talk to me to vent instead. In return, he wanted me to try other guys. He knows I live in too small a town, so he was going to give my number to some gay modeling buddies and he wanted me to honestly give them a shot, but I can choose him if I want when the contract is up. He thinks I might deprive myself of experimenting otherwise. We also discussed possibly getting back together this summer if things work out a certain way and we both can handle less communication than normal. He’s still coming in a week and a half, but I told him no sex because he kissed [best friend]. I also asked him to be honest and tell me on skype when he slips up

After we got off Skype, he confessed over text that he and [best friend] had sex last night. He apologized, and told me it was a mistake but he was telling me because he wanted to be honest. There is no doubt in my mind that [best friend] knows about how he has a hard time saying no and that he is an over-stressed wreck right now. He told me how he wanted to have a breakdown because he has so much shit to deal with and is so over-stressed. I know [best friend] knows too, and definitely manipulated him because he was so vulnerable. He went over to tell him why he ran away when he tried to kiss him last time he was over and that he couldn’t be with him. I wish he could see that [best friend] took advantage of him and is manipulating him, but he and [best friend go wayyy back. He is blind to [best friend]’s malice.


Now, I’m faced with a huge dilemma. He’s still coming to visit and I told him no sex after he confessed the kiss, because I deserve better than a first kiss with someone who can’t be faithful. If we’re not really committed, than I really don’t want to give away my virginity. However, we both agree what we have is really special and all this shit getting in the middle is hurting us but fundamentally we both think what we have is very special and we both love each other. However, after he told me he fucked [best friend] I really don’t even want to kiss him when he comes. I think maybe putting it off to when we hang out this summer and if he’s faithful until then maybe then we can kiss and maybe have sex, depending a lot on whether we’re also gonna start transitioning back off hold. My only problem is that I need to uphold my promise between now and then to try with a few other guys. I’m afraid that to try I might need to kiss one and I want him to be my first kiss because we kind of think we might be a forever couple, despite all that’s happened. Take all this shit out, our spark is still there. 


What do I do when he comes? How should I handle him and [best friend]’s hookup? I feel really hurt and betrayed, but I am mainly angry with [best friend] because he manipulated the guy I love when he was vulnerable. 

What should I do?

In addition, he’s still breaking down and stressed and I’m not going to stand by while he goes through this. I love him and he’s gonna do this alone. Together or not, I am here for him and I will help him through this.


However, I am also flawed. I can’t stand the idea of him fucking other guys even though it really helps him therapeutically, and this hold really is saddening to me. I could be fine with going right back on hold AGAIN if he could just be faithful. He knows he’s hurting me, but I don’t think he knows how much. I couldn’t eat for 24 hours, I have cried for hours and hours. He doesn’t need the added stress of me right now though so I’m hiding most of it from him. I have cried in front of him through skype but he didn’t see the hours after I spent crying. My life is no cakewalk either, since meeting him I lost everything that made me happy except him, and now I don’t really have him. School has gotten more stressful than it’s ever been before, I have no time at home for my hobbies because I have too much shit to do. My parents are strict and are making my life worse, and my family as a whole is always arguing and not pleasant at all. My friends are almost solely seniors and all but 3 of my friends are graduating soon. Because of no time, I lost a lot of my internet friends. This summer I will have an unpaid internship honestly he is the last bit of happiness I had.


Lastly, I will send this to him to be checked to make sure he agrees with all of it except the above paragraph, obviously. We need to get help for our relationship. Advice that is not wanted: anything along the lines of “your relationship isn’t real because you’re too young”, and “your age gap is too big” and “just go enjoy life”. Anything I deem not supportive or attacking or any of those three **will be reported**. I want support and advice, I didn’t come to be attacked or receive those 3 pieces of advice, because I said clearly I don’t want them. I am open to any other advice though, although I am very aversive to completely breaking it off.

Please help us. Please respond to the questions I put in here. I don’t know what to do and I want both of us to be happy and mentally healthy, and when possible, together.


TL;DR: boyfriend and I are having problems. Please carefully read the whole thing before commenting, everything is so complicated."

34vag4,0,2015-05-04,Tethering to wired network in-case of emergency,thibaultmol,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/34vag4/tethering_to_wired_network_incase_of_emergency/,"Hi,

So recently at my pharmacy where I do my internship, they had an internet outage. I'm pretty tech savvy but I wasn't sure how to make my Iphone's tethering give internet to the network.

I tried to plug my Iphone 5S into my laptop using a usb cable and turned on tethering on my phone. Then connected my laptop to their network using a normal LAN cable. Then in Windows I used a thing called 'ICS' Internet Connection Sharing. Which basically would allow my to share the internet connection of my phone via usb to the lan cable. But it still didn't work. I assume it has something to do with ip-addresses and the router being confused. But I'm not sure how to do this. 

The actual outage took about 30 minutes but I want to be able to be prepared in the future.

If you know a solution or just a better way to do this, please leave a comment.

PS. Please don't respond with ""just get a MiFi hotspot and use that"". I want to be able to use my phone.

Thanks in advance!"
34vibb,8,2015-05-04,"Should I teach myself Git, build an Android app, or learn C first this summer?",zep_man,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/34vibb/should_i_teach_myself_git_build_an_android_app_or/,"I'm a rising sophomore Computer Science major without any major commitments this summer, so I want to use this summer to learn something useful. I'm stuck between teaching myself about Git and version control in general, trying to build my own Android app, or learning C. Ideally I'd like to get as many of these done this summer as I can, but I have to start with one of them and then may not even get to the rest. Pros and cons of each:

**Git**

Pros:

It will be widely applicable. Any programming job I take will have some kind of version control. Furthermore, my college has an experiential learning model, basically meaning that after next year I'm going to start doing one six month internship every year, so learning practical skills now may pay dividends later.

Cons:

I personally anticipate it being the least interesting option of the three and will probably offer me little in terms of improving my actual programming skills, and will therefore be of the least use to me academically. 

**Android app**

Pros:

It'll probably be the most fun. Having something that I can point at and go ""look, I made this thing!"" by the end of it sounds very satisfying to me. Additionally, by  undertaking a large programming project like this one (which I have never done before), I'll learn a lot about how to handle these kind of large, real world projects.

Cons:

The working knowledge I acquire will be narrow in scope. Most jobs and internships I apply for probably won't require extensive knowledge of the Android app framework, and making apps will likely only ever be a hobbyist pursuit for me. Additonally, if I do make an app, I'll have to learn enough git to at least put it on github if I want to add it to my resume when applying for internships and jobs. Also, after a cursory look at the android tutorials, learning enough to be able to make an at all useful app seems really daunting

**C (programming language)**

Pros:

One of the classes I'm taking next year is taught in C, so having a working knowledge of the language before I go in would be nice. Additionally, I've never learned a low level language like C before, so learning C will allow me to understand how computers work on a baser level.

Cons:

Probably the poorest resume booster of the three options. While having a working knowledge of low-level computer stuff would definitely be nice, it probably isn't going to be something I need at any of my internships, and is a skill I can pick up later when I'm actually applying for jobs.

So, make my choice"
34vj8r,0,2015-05-04,I get the nagging feeling that I'm not smart enough to pass tech interviews at top companies.,Thounumber1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34vj8r/i_get_the_nagging_feeling_that_im_not_smart/,"My goal right now is to graduate and work for a software company in san francisco like twitter or airbnb (ideally one of these two) or dropbox, maybe square, etc. From what I have seen however, the hiring bar for these companies is extremely high (even higher than big 4 companies) and I feel like someone has to have some sort of natural innate ability to excel at algorithmic problem solving to pass these interviews, and I honestly don't know if I have such a thing. I failed a google intern interview several months ago cause I completely flubbed one of the phone interviews (even though the other two went well), and this sort of killed my confidence. I do decent in my CS classes and stuff but being good at interviews seems like a completely different thing. Is this a thing that I can improve at or is it just something I will always suck at? I have a decent head on my shoulders but I'm no genius. 


 I am interning at amazon this summer and hopefully that will boost my resume, and I want to also spend my time preparing for intern interviews at the aforementioned companies. I found CtCI to be useless quite frankly, cause the difficulty doesn't seem to match what a lot of top companies ask, so I will instead use Elements of Programming Interviews, and also look at geeksforgeeks questions and take the stanford algorithms course on coursera. Would this be overkill? Does anyone have any experience interviewing with the companies I mentioned, and are the interviews really extremely difficult, or am I just completely blowing this out of proportion? I have a tendency to make things seem a lot harder in my head than they really are. 

What I'm really afraid of is that I'll graduate with a job lined up that is not the job I really want that I will be unsatisfied with. From what I've read and seen, it seems that the hiring in this industry is kind of unpredictable, and that even if you do really well in an interview you may not be offered the job, and that kind of scares me knowing that whatever the hell I do, I still may not land the job I want.

34w0kj,40,2015-05-04,AWLOBY 0: Eyes Narrowed,taylorgbh,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/34w0kj/awloby_0_eyes_narrowed/,"Just because he knew why he needed to be here, didn't make him *want* to be there. As one of the premier archeologists of the Faran, he had been given the assignment of the millennia: excavating and investigating the ruins of a Schism-era human Planet-Breaker; a near mythic class of battleships that had been said to be able to annihilate entire star systems. He didn't believe such rumors of time; he knew how susceptible the truth was to embellishment with age. But that did not make the wreck any less powerful. If he could find even the smallest functional ship system, he could retire his children's children early on the proceeds from patents related to the hyper-advanced tech.

It was the potential riches that kept him going, deeper into the ship. His team had spent nearly a week cutting open an entrance at the closest spot to the bridge that was above ground so that he could reach the front of the ship quickly. The diagram of this ship's model he'd been provided confirmed his assumption that the front of the ship is where the controls would be found. Humans liked to face their ships forward.

Interns trailing behind him in their clunky suits and heavy equipment, he descended deeper, relying on the artificial light provided by his light intern. Reaching what his diagram indicated as the door to the bridge, he beckoned for his drill interns to step forward. Each second it took them to hack, pry and clamp at the door increased his excitement, and anxiety. His tail was writhing in anticipation as first a small hole into the next room appeared, followed by a crevice, and then a sizeable opening. Telling them to stop a moment, he stepped forward, squeezing himself through the hole with the help of the drill interns and landing gently on the other side. The drill interns went back to widening the gap to allow the equipment to get brought through which gave him the opportunity to search the room while he waited.

Despite literally colliding with the planet's surface at terminal velocity and burying itself under the ground, the ship's bridge at completely survived impact. It spoke to their architectural prowess that even the glass that allowed an observer to normally look out into the void with nothing more than their eyes could handle such a hit without so much as a scratch. But he wasn't interested in window panes. He hurried over to what looked like a control panel; it certainly had all the designs of the few human models he'd been able to work on. Like the others, the panel was very uniform, and his knowledge of the human's language allowed him to attempt to turn on the system. The harsh screeching of bending metal and his annoyed huffs filled the room as he unsuccessfully tried to turn the computer on. It was probably too much to hope for that a 300+ year shipwreck would have the iota of power needed to start up.

Activating his suit's light, he scanned the room for something, anything, that would be working. His eyes landed on a small pod, tucked into the corner of the room. As he stepped forward, he made out more details like the large cord plugged into a panel that emitted a soft glow from a few displays and the belts and bolts used to keep the pod in place, as if it had been moved to this room from somewhere else on the ship. Standing next to it, he brushed off the thin coat of dust on the pod's visor but saw nothing; the visor was an opaque black. Looking over the display, he tried to find a dial to open the lid. Hearts racing, he pressed a large, green button marked 'RISE'. It'd been years since he'd taken Human in language school but he thought it was similar to 'open' or 'up'.

The pod began to pulse with light as energy from what he decided was a power cable streamed in. The onyx visor began to change transparent and looking down into the pod, he saw the sleeping figure of a human. His mind raced at the possibility, the likelihood of a being, even a human, surviving cryogenically for this long. After all, the power must have gone out centuries ago.

As he pondered this, he noticed the incremental twitch of an eyelid and his breath froze. The humans eyes slowly opened, staring back at him, and all of the information he remembered, useless background details at the time, rushed back to him. This had been a Purge-aligned ship during the Schism, not a Steward. Cold feared gripped him as the eyes looked him over, surveyed him, without emotion.

The eyes narrowed.

1. How did you pick your specialty? Did it take you long?

2. Did the difficulty of your courses overwhelm you or build up gradually? 

3. How serious were your underclassmen peers? In study groups, labs, clubs, etc. By serious I mean competitive, focused, passionate about engineering and science.

4. Do you have a minor? If so, what? [I was thinking of doing a minor in computer science or math to be more competitive once graduated. If not a full minor, I would definitely like to learn a few programming languages.]

5. What school year did you get your first internship? Was the search long? [While in Tampa, I saw a couple industrial places but don't really know how much in demand engineers are in the area.]"

I'm an econ major/finance minor with a 3.7 (4.0 in finance) but that could go up to a 3.8 by the end of next year based on how I've been doing lately.

I'm writing this because I need advice about how to proceed after this summer. I want to eventually work in equity research/asset management, but I'm interning in PWM this summer and I understand those skills aren't really transferable to that type of role and it can be hard to make the switch. I'd be open to switching to IB when I graduate to get some skills that could transfer over to ER/AM later on (I attended a GS IBD superday this winter but didn't get the job), but I'm wondering if working in PWM will harm my chances at getting full-time analyst interviews in the fall. 

I guess my main question is - Should I just work on getting an offer at the PWM firm I'm working at this summer and plan on pursuing an MBA/CFA and transferring later, or should I work on securing a more applicable job for after I graduate that could lead into one of the roles I want? Is it feasible for me to switch to IB or ER with only a PWM internship on my resume?

Thanks for the help."

First time, long time. This past June (almost a year ago) an intern started working in my office. There was some chemistry between us and about a month into her internship, I worked up the courage make a move. There was clearly mutual feelings and we spent the summer dating and hooking up.

We got along great, I loved spending time with her. She was everything you look for in a woman. We shared a lot of laughs and she was a star. I am trying to keep this short, but there are so many things about her that I like. We started developing feelings for each other. At the time, I think she was more into it than I was, but it was clear that we were headed in the direction of a relationship. I didn't really want to be in a relationship. I have never really been a relationship guy, I like(d) my independence and the things that come with being single.  I was also hesitant because I didn't feel comfortable with the fact that she was still in college and I was a few years removed. It is also important to note some of it was because at the time I was entertaining the idea of moving out of state, and did not want to enter into a relationship knowing that I couldn't stay committed. All kind of shallow reasons I guess. 

We had a talk and using the reasons above, I broke it off. I told her no and I know I hurt her. This all ended in October. We stayed in touch for a little bit after that, but things kinda faded.

I started dating another girl about a month later and instantly realized that I had something special with the intern. Coincidentally, the intern reached out to me around the holidays wishing me well. I took this as a sign that maybe she was interested again.

I tried to ask her out again but she got kind of distant after a few attempts. She finally agreed to grab a drink with me at the beginning of February but while we were talking I got the feeling that she had moved on. I asked her out again soon after but she told me she in fact had moved on and wanted to focus on other things.

I understand and have respected the distance she wants. I keep thinking about her and have a lot of regret about how things ended back in October.  It's honestly driving me crazy. I have been on a few dates since then, but I always end up thinking about her.

I know I need to move on, but I think this girl is worth fighting for - I feel a bit of a void. I have never really been so persistent so this feels a bit uncomfortable to me. Has anyone been on either side of this and given/received another chance? I don't want to be ""that guy"" who doesn't know when to stop. 
   
**tl;dr**: Dated a girl who interned in my office. I said no once things got serious. She said no when I realized what I had done. Do I give it another shot? "
34wgwz,6,2015-05-04,I [22M] just broke up with GF [22F] of 1yr 10mo. Her childishness annoys me. I've got little time to self. Outgrowable?,anonyID,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34wgwz/i_22m_just_broke_up_with_gf_22f_of_1yr_10mo_her/,"Hi Reddit, anon account, but am a frequent reader and decent contributor on this Sub. Looking for a little perspective and/or guidance.


I broke up with my gf about 2 days ago, and I've been struggling with the decision. Are my reasons substantive or am I just a jackass?


In short, my reasons boil down to this:

1. I can't get enough space to do the things I want to do to grow career-wise.

2. She has some child-like behavior problems - daddy issues.

3. I'm not 100% sexually attracted to her. 


The Story and Back Story:

We are both engineers. She and I met at 18 in college - she a freshman, I a sophomore. We on/off dated for a year, and then dated seriously for 3 months before we “cuffed,” at age 20. The learning curve for me was steep. It was my first relationship and I had many qualities that I knew had to beat out of me. She made it happen, and forced me to stretch and grow in ways I am very grateful for -- things like washing the dishes, cooking, cleaning, folding clothes. She was good at ALWAYS doing them, as if she had no choice. She complained infrequently.


She and I were undoubtedly infatuated. Without that, I would not have grown as I did in those beginning months. Apart from the house cleaning/training, she held out on me sexually for 3 months of serious dating. We, informally, lived with each other for those 3 months (she was displaced for the summer and had no place to live. I took her in and worked my internship while she continued summer classes). She’d tell me I was too focused on sex, and that I was too selfish. Relationships are about “us, together.” I took those things to heart and worked my ass off on fixing them. It was frustrating as idk what, but I knew she was probably right.


Time goes on and we have sex, and it was fantastic. I really learned her body and could make her climax nearly on command.


Things are great effectively for the next 10/12 months. Episodes here and there primarily having to do with my quest for some “me” time, her feeling that I don’t make her feel special often enough, or a my-way-or-the-highway attitude about things. We’d argue out the different ways to skin cat, and convincing her of mine way was almost always a lost cause.


First Break Up

When I graduated is when things went south. Our move-in/move-out process was a debacle. What we argued over and how she handled it, was the first moment I ever doubted our compatibility. I realized we weren’t perfect and immune to all problems “other couples” had to go through. From that point forward I felt like I was slowly falling out of love. A month later, we almost broke up, for maybe 16 hours. I (by choice) took her back, even though my gut told me not to. It was hard for me to fake it at first, but I researched my ass off about love, stages of love, falling out of love, etc etc. How could something so perfect ever go sour? I convinced myself it was the right thing to do. Things did get better, and we were compatible again. I felt I made the mature, responsible choice - not giving up on love. It must be something every married couple goes through, I said.


I’m now a recent grad, working professional. She’s finishing up her last year of school. She has hopes to be a doctor. I have hopes to work in the car industry and start a global business. I’m not happy with where I work. It’s a great engineering company with international clout, but it’s not a name like Tesla/Apple/Lockheed. In short, I want more for myself and feel I’m capable of going far, but I feel constricted and held back by my gf -- which may or may not actually be true, it’s just how it feels.


I want to find a new job, concurrently build a business, and stay in shape. But with only 4-6hrs to do that at the end of every day there’s very little time (or energy) to give her the seemingly boundless attention she wants (or deserves). I’ll be honest cooking decent meals isn’t my forte but I do try. Once during the week and once during the weekend at best. Life gets in the way of a lot of intentions.


We’ve tried really hard to strike a balance. I never feel like I get enough time to myself, or enough time to focus on my goals, and she feels that I don’t show/give her enough affection. And really, I don’t think our lines actually intersect. What she wants seems unreasonable or outside the bounds of what (I think) a normal person would require. Our friends, also in relationships, don’t even sleep together in the same bed every night! We’ve been doing that for almost 2 years! I almost feel duped, as if she took advantage of me. I feel like I deserve a pat on the back for the things I’ve gone through with her -- for the patience I’ve shown.


But that’s when I start to feel selfish. She does in fact put a lot into the relationship. She cooks, admires me dearly (almost scarily), and has THEE busiest schedule known to man at school. 7 classes, 2 part-time jobs, president of student org, and me. She’s the ambitious one. She’s the hustler.



Second Break Up

We mutually broke up again 3 weeks ago (nearly a year after the first one), when I came home from work and gym, tired. She’d had a long day too, 6am to 9pm - work, classes, meetings/events, and she was enthused to see me. I wasn’t. I felt her excitement to see me as more of an annoyance and further thing to deal with than being relieved and happy to see her too. Typically, when she’s like that it’s her crawling all over me, tugging my head to kiss her, etc. It’s childish. It’s annoying. I’m all for being excited to see me, but not like that. Not when I have to fight you off of me to get to the kitchen for some water. And we’ve had that conversation countless times that I don’t really like it. But she’s combative, and deems that I’m not the affectionate one, and she is who she is, stop trying to change her. Fair point, but I can’t convince her that childish behavior can/should be outgrown. She doesn’t believe that she should. I wish I could get a third party to settle the dispute.


We got back together the next day after she called me. I couldn’t stomach not picking up.


Third Break Up

This time 3 weeks later, 2 weekends of going out with the frat brothers (2 big annual weekends), and 1 weekend I committed to something I shouldn’t have and killed a whole day. Sunday she was very busy and disappointed/hurt we couldn’t get some quality time. I was meaning to do something grand with her. It just never happened before we blew up again. What broke the camel's back was that i was coming late to a collective night out between her friends and mine. When she saw me (tipsy/drunk) she ignored everyone else in the group and threw herself at me, disallowing me to greet everyone else in the group. She was hanging from my neck, and i looked around embarrassed getting eyes from my own friends. I know her to be this way while drunk and I wasn't looking forward to it. This simply reaffirmed my reasoning. When we got far enough away from friends I told her to chill out, that it wasn't cool and lacked social skills. She flipped out. Was upset and said ""if I want to express my love for you this way then let me effing do it."" She expressed being tired in the relationship. Etc. I ended it for us that night. And then again the day after while sober.


What's sad is we were doing good. She was good, giving me space and time. I thought I was doing well too in showing more affection. But still in my head I didn't feel like I was ready or willing to continue putting in a lifetime of effort. I was tired too.


Typing this was cathartic, but inconclusive. I feel that she is good for me. We once thought about kids and marriage, though still in the picture for her, not for me unless things can change. I don’t know if I’ll find anyone with her list of positive qualities. And I wonder if the issues I have with her can be outgrown. I think she’s stubborn and childish about her affection. And she thinks I’m stubborn about my needing “me time.”


I feel like if I go back now, though, it’s the equivalent to marriage. Any long term relationship should be with someone you could see yourself marrying. But I just don’t know right now. I want us to work out. I love(d) us. I talked about us being the model couple. I just feel like we both need growth, and idk if we can do that together, although, she believes we can.



The Main Question

Asking/speaking to a couple that is indeed happily married, have you ever gone through this? Is this something EVERY married couple goes through? Personality incongruities? Where infatuation makes everything easy at first, but afterwards you really have to make the conscious choice to stay and continue to love? Or is it really supposed to be much easier than described above?


It may or may not be relevant to note, but both sides of the family love the other's respective partner. We’re both convinced my family likes her more than they like me, and vice versa. Also, all of our friends believe we were perfect for each other - a bit of a beacon for others to maybe aspire to.



tl;dr

Broke up with gf a third time after about 2 yrs. I can’t get time or space. She’s petulant. And I’m more sexually attracted to a different body type. I hurt because I think she deserves better, and believe there might be a chance we outgrow our differences. Does true love/marriage come with similar issues, or should it be easier/simpler? Am I the problem?"

Advice needed.",soulsearching413,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/34woq8/i_want_to_give_up_already_but_its_too_late_advice/,"*I apologize for the length of this, but I really need serious advice.  I'm about to lose my mind and I don't know who to turn to.*

I am in my fourth year of college studying Mechanical Engineering, but I'm still considered a Junior because I can't get through my math courses.  I took diffy &amp; calc 3 last semester and dropped both.  This semester I took diff, calc 3, &amp; stats and I'm honestly probably only going to pass diffy.  It's not that I'm stupid, because I've always been sharp, I just don't feel like doing anything at this point.

The thing is, I'm a bit lazy but I also don't know why I'm even studying to be an ME.  I kind of just thought I'd go to college, like everyone else, and do something I know I'm capable of so I can make bank.

Through college, being an only child who finally got freedom, I partied and hung out with my friends a lot, which it only got progressively worse, and just stopped doing my work and eventually stopped going to class.  I've been trying to find motivation every way possible; from reading articles, youtube videos, morning routines, meditating, writing, you name it.

I know all I have to do is get up and just start studying but I just simply don't want to.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I'm super sharp, a natural born leader, genuine yet able to be stern, have excellent communication skills, and I have so much experience working with people.  I even talked my way into my first internship with a huge company! (busted my ass for that one.) but my GPA is a 2.6, and I can't even pass my 4 classes this semester, two of which I am retaking.

I'm losing my mind at this point.  I feel like a complete joke, like I have all the tools, a great face, but no substance.  I feel like a failure, which my work shows, and I just want to quit.  I'm completely depressed.  Blah blah blah  I just really need some help.  I want to give up but I know it's too late and I think I can still do it.


**tl;dr:   4th year ME student, sharp &amp; excellent leader, 1st internship this summer with huge company, but I'm still a Junior, 2.6 GPA, can't get through math, failing all my classes this semester, and I just simply don't want to do the work anymore. Totally unmotivated, tried everything. Literally losing my fucking mind. I can't anymore. Help.**"

34wr7b,1,2015-05-05,Taking time off from school; Thoughts and Concerns.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34wr7b/taking_time_off_from_school_thoughts_and_concerns/,"**Background**

I'm a current college freshman, psychology major. I'm also 100% self-taught in Machine Learning and Computer Science including in algorithms, data structures and low-level workings. I've been doing this since I was a little kid starting with electronics and digital logic and eventually moving up to programming. I basically spent all of highschool pursuing this interest as well, not focusing *too much* on the actual highschool curriculum.

Long story short, after consulting for a few startups building recommendation systems, search engines, computer vision modules and other data-oriented projects I have a few long-term full-time offers on the table. All of them are in the six-figure range. Most of them want me to start straight after my summer internship this year.

____

* My thought was to take a year off of school and to go join one of these startups because I feel like I'd learn more than I would in the classroom at a faster rate. 

* I wanted to get people's opinions on taking time off of school and if pursuing a degree is even a logical move for someone in my situation. Being self-taught, I've had people in this industry frequently say ""You should just be looking for a job.""

* I'm the first person in my family to go to college, my background mostly being made up of dropout business owners so family doesn't have an informed viewpoint as to what the best course of action would be. Though they admit that they don't know this, they of course give the conservative answer. 


* The reason why I feel like it's a good idea to chase the job opportunities is because I'm not assembling WordPress templates or something, there's alot of CS Theory and practical engineering knowledge I'd be using and picking up from mentorship.

* I'm not looking to leave school because ""school sucks"", I feel like the classroom environment isn't where I excel though. I'm doing psychology and not CS because I feel like it will make me better rounded. I'm extremely reluctant to pursue a CS degree because I feel like I'm going to get stuck in Python 101. "
34wrwr,5,2015-05-05,I suck at everything,alayne_,depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/34wrwr/i_suck_at_everything/,"I can't find a job. I never worked before because I'm a student and for every fucking shit job you need experience. Almost no place I applied to even answered my mail. I can't work in service because during my last two internships (hospital and middle school) I was almost thrown out because people complained about me and that I look too unfriendly. During that time I also tried to kill myself because I can't handle strangers. But I need a job to finish school. I can't go back to my old school because of things that happened (for which I also tried to kill myself). I have to move to attend the other school for which I need money.

I'm a fucking mess. I don't know how I would ever survive in the world out there. I don't even have friends. I can't even *get along* with people because at some point, they will start to hate me (yes, hate... Not just dislike or ""you can't get along with everybody"". I don't know why.) I'm too stupid and frail for anything. I'm too chicken to kill myself even. I don't know what to do."
34ws2v,5,2015-05-05,"I'm a Geek Squad 'agent' and I want to get a real job, but I've hit a wall. Advice wanted (slightly long).",mySeraphy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/34ws2v/im_a_geek_squad_agent_and_i_want_to_get_a_real/,"**Should I post this in Career Guidance or another subreddit instead?**

I'd like some suggestions or recommendations from people who have been in a similar position because I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I'll never get out of. I don't have a degree. I don't have much money. I work at Geek Squad. I hate my job. I get yelled at by old people who say the same thing every single day: ""I'm computer illiterate!"" and ""I bought it here so fix it for free!"". I'm burned out on the customer-facing environment (really just the general public) and am looking for something in IT field but just different. I would love to do support for employees/co-workers.

I'm good with computers but I know nothing of programing, networking, coding, admin/systems stuff, etc. I know how to build them, I know windows, I think I'm pretty damn good at technical support (when not faced with an old man yelling at me because he didn't back up his pictures of his late wife after he got the CryptoLocker virus from an adult website).

I've been hunting for jobs for over a year now and everything, even the simplest entry level thing wants a 4-year degree in practically anything. However, I don't have the time or the money to go and get a bachelor's degree currently. I really want to, but my current job makes that nearly impossible. I've had multiple phone interviews but most places simply never call me back. I've turned down one position that was a sales call center with a company simply because it's not what I want to do.  I'm nearing thirty years old and I don't have a career. I have a job with a company who may go belly up at any point and it's becoming depressing. So...

Here's where I'd just like some help.

I want a new job. Badly. But I wont take just anything. I'm leaning towards technical support (or desktop support?) due to my level of patience and knowledge that has been built up over the past four years by the most unruly people who refuse to learn anything. I absolutely love it when I can fix something for someone and make them happy and feel like they learned something. I want a job that I can go back to school with, so I'm probably looking at something 9-5 (or maybe a night shift IT job?). I want to go to school, get my certificates (A+ and others?), get my degree and open up a thousand more doors. But I have to make the first step now. I don't think I can do an unpaid internship to learn things because I live alone and I'm just barely making ends meet. My work schedule is random and it makes things beyond difficult. There's tuition assitance/reimbursement via work but the pool of schools they support is incredibly tiny. I'm looking into financial aid and the reimbursement option currently.

Now that the backstory is out of the way, I have some questions:

* 1) Am I truly wasting my time trying to get/save up for an A+ Certification? People tell me A+ is a waste of time. I've been with Geek Squad for over 3 years as a Consultation Agent (sales/repair, very technical support and sales heavy). Would my job experience be a suitable replacement or should I try to get an A+ as well? I've seen some places request Certifications in MCSA, A+ Hardware/Software, N+ , CCNA, etc. I sometimes feel like listing my job when applying for a real IT job makes me seem like a joke, but maybe that's just the minor depression of never getting a call back most the time.

* 2) What skills (or even certifications) are absolutely *crucial* for getting an IT job? I know Windows, iOS, OSX, Android to an extent, I can build computers and have fairly extensive hardward and software knowledge. I'm just no engineer or coder. I feel like every job I've applied for wants someone who can build an entire medical database in MS Word.

* 3) Does a cover letter truly make the difference? I haven't supplied one with my resumes but after reading a lot of posts on here, it seems like most employers simply throw away any resume without a cover letter.

* 4) Based on my skills, what should I start with? I understand there's career guidance options but it doesn't hurt to ask. I hope there's someone who has been in my position with a success story who can give me a bit of hope to get out of this hole. Hell, how would I even list my skills? I'll list what I currently do...

I sell a lot. We have consultations where we sit down with the 'client' and look at their computer, discuss the problem and try to recreate it, we then diagnose it and recommend a 'solution' (sales package) and deal with collecting money, taking checks, processing credit card applications. I do a lot with education, teaching people and offering guidance/support. I remove viruses (via proprietary software)  I install hardware, software, dispatch field agents to homes, do a lot of correspondence between home, field, and remote agents, perform data backups/transfers and set up automated backups, etc.

How should I list these skills in a more...readable manner? Can I even call them skills? I unfortunately doubt myself a lot so I'm sure that'll be my downfall. I feel like with my job title 'Consultation Agent', Geek Squad, and my skills listed, that employers just look at my resume, laugh and throw it away and go 'Go try to be a REAL IT guy first'.

I'd just like a little help before I lose my mind. For anyone who actually bothered to read this and reply, thank you so very much for even bothering to help. I know I come off as jaded, cynical, upset and negative, but I truly appreciate even the smallest bit of advice.

**TL;DR - Work at Geek Squad (and previously as sales at best buy), need a new job, don't know how to list my skills (Item 4). Want to advance into the IT field but unsure where to start. Advice / Subreddits /  links are more than welcomed. I was going to post this in the repetitive questions thread but I had four separate questions that I felt would get no visibility whatsoever.**"
34wsss,8,2015-05-05,Career advice for someone looking into an academic career....,angerMD,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/34wsss/career_advice_for_someone_looking_into_an/,"Howdy,

   I'm an internal medicine resident moving into my critical care fellowship next year and I'm having a bit of an anxiety attack and was wondering if someone could help me out.  I initially went into medicine just interested in the clinical work but in working with some great academic clinicians who sit on review boards for things like ACLS guidelines and Sepsis guidelines I decided intern year that I wanted to be involved in research and guideline development.  I worked my butt off, wrote some manuscripts and nothing really worked out.  I have a paper coming out later this year that I'm excited about but I've been frustrated because I feel like I don't have the mentorship to achieve my goals and I have had a few disappointing things happen over the last year in terms of my career (didn't get a competitive research fellowship, fell on my rank list to a good program that I'm very happy with the clinical training but not as research strong after interviewing at  some nationally top places).

   I know that I want research and at least some small engagement in working with policies that drive my little corner of medicine to be part of my career but I'm feeling very distressed. All the people I know that do this have come from big fancy institutions throughout the US and have Ivy league education. I'm just some schmuck who was the first person to graduate from college in his family.  Anyone have career experience where they were a late bloomer or does the fact that I'm not triple Ivy league educated going to prevent me from having my dream career.  I'm ready to work hard but I just don't know where to direct my energy.  I've been depressed lately because I feel like there are a lot of barriers in my way and I'm going to be let down for the rest of my life."

34x041,3,2015-05-05,-HELP- i was just getting over depression when i remembered what was made to me as a child... WHY NOW?,[deleted],rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/34x041/help_i_was_just_getting_over_depression_when_i/,"this is a issue i haven't spoken with to anyone in this reality so i appologize in advance if its not well explained, the past weeks have been an emotional rollercoaster and i think im ready to start talking out loud about this issue, i hope this brings some peace after of the storm and i can find the way of telling this to my close ones.
First of all i'm a 24 year old male student in way of being a medical doctor, this story weirdly begins near the end, in the time between finals and the clinical practice working as an intern, i was dealing with tons of anxiety and panic attacks triggered from nothing -aparently-, I've always been an anxious kid but the last months of classes i was just invaded by this feeling, everyone has a breaking point and mine was at this time... to be short i was diagnosted with a mild depressive episode and medicated with a lot of shit, this wasn't the first time i felt this way but it was the first one to make me a complete and useless asshole (grumpy, explosive, volatile, crying out of nowhere, sleeping all day crying by the nights and within all the symptoms of depression i wasnt able to communicate efficiently, nor even think as you are expected if youre working in an emergency room or assisting in surgeries) i had an horrible working environment my boss was plainly an asshole who thought i was just a lazy person, so i told him to fuck himself, left the hospital and decided to work on my mental health and return later to medicine... since then i've been on and off of the medicine path, currently im planing to get my diploma and move on... as a teenager i thought that the career path i was choosen was the right one but after counseling, treating the depression and thinking seriously i came to the conclussion that im not that interested on being a doctor -- so, the past months ive been working on my artistic side, i was really happy and energized, finally found my purpose on earth, i was working hard on my art at the free time ive got from the hospital, making decent stuff, everything was shining back to me at last, maybe the depression was because i wasnt happy as a doctor?
i felt like the spark that lighted me was finally back, a ""no one can stop me"" mindset was on, everything was OK when the depression came back... i thought this is relapse because i never ingested the antidepressants as they were supposed to and because my misuse of alcohol and drugs, i was looking at my depression from an organic point of view but i never really digged on to it, since i've always been a depressive kind of guy, it wasnt that misterious ocurrence...
Which brings me to the biggest mistery of my life... since a kid i was having this crazy nightmares, dreams and blurred memories of something just weird, didnt knew what and actually never seemed to care about.. hours of meditation on the actual matter and crazy thinking the pieces started to appear, lots of explicit sexual scenes of me being with other kids of my age on my neighbours' house (a kid one or maybe two years older than me and his older brother, maybe he was 19 or so, who 'babysitted'us) my first response was: youre making this up, this never happened, this is something you saw in a movie maybe high and now you think it happened to you but it didnt; ever since the first scene came up, the flashbacks increased and became clearer to the point that i cant deny this and the damage it left on me...
the first time, after a pee break from mario kart walking to the living room, and im sorry for being explicit, i saw three naked childs in the brother's bed, one of them my dearest friend. Big shock, what the fuck is going on? Later i was invited to this fun games club that only few kids were allowed to join, the first and biggest secret ive shared, since that day and for many months i was introducted to sex which i just wasnt supposed to know or even enjoy yet, i have the crazy sense that i enjoyed so much of those days, this is so fucked up, it kills me remembering me enjoying my body being stimulated, i was the star of the group because no one could achieve an erection but me, i was proud of being the favorite, the best player and a good kisser, the last 8 years of 'active sexlife' i've been just with girls, ive been always told to be a good fuck partner and a great kisser -now i know this is because i was practicing since 5 and it gives me the chills- back then i felt like i was part of something really 'cool' but also deeply confused, those 'funny feelings', 'challenges' and 'games' needed to wait at least a decade!!!  i remember myself laying on the bed, unable to move, feeling 'funny' but also gone, like if my body was there, being abused, but the child was on some other planet, this dissociative shit still happens often enough...anyone knows how to deal with this??
later on my neighbours family moved out, everything blurred out and the bits of information flew through time. 
Now comes the aftermath... as child I was an A+ student, smart and creative, but introverted as shit, shy but this was not a trouble back then not even now, i just never cared much about social relations, what really confused me back then was my gender role and sexuality, there was the fact that i couldnt stablish many male relations, my male friends are almost nonexistent, on school i was the kind of gay guy and i was bullied because of this,sissy, faggot, without any serious girlfriend and just scaring every girl that showed to be into me, weird thing, a coincidence i hope, i've been atracted to guys just as girls but i've never been on any homosexual activity besides kissing because im repulsed to the idea of anal sex and homosexual relationships...was i gay? bisexual? was i just fucking crazy? --now im accepting fully my sexuality and i decided to label myself human for mental health reasons--
as a boyfriend i sabotaged every relationship i had as i dont deserve love or caring, i have been really promiscuous and compulsive, with girls im really superficial and only search for sex-based relations, most of their faces i cant even remember.
i cant trust in anyone, this was my whole life but since the discoveries this got worst... everyone seems to have bad intentions when they try to talk to me, i can't even hug my closest friends or parents without feeling odd and so on... 
as a pragmatist I'm trying to be in peace with this, before remembering this i was in fully acceptance of my psyche's flaws and depressive personality but now that everything makes sense and i'm putting all the pieces together i dont know who I am anymore, IM FUCKING LOST, i dont see any light in this hell hole, -im sure there will be better days but when??- the half of the time i just hate myself, been thinking of suicide although i dont think i could end my life. Im willing to be better, to move on, i dont know how! this is where i could use some help from other 'survivors' because i cant just go back in time to the early days, beat the shit out of this guy and put him in jail! right?
-why? why did i let this happen? why did i have to remember this shit just when im moving on to a fullfilled life?? is it possible or healthy to just barry those feelings as i was doing before? if so, how??
how can i stop those memories from appearing in the middle of sex? how can i have a decent sexual experience after this? since i can remember i am sexually inactive, cant be with any girl, paradoxically my sex drive is still at its full, is this normal?
am i able to produce decent art products with this soul injury? im sure i was when i was supressing this stuff... should i talk to my former friends about this? (they seem to have a normal life)
and the one million dollar question: how can i reconcile with my inner child? ive been trying to talk to him or write a letter but i end crying, he and i are just as confused as in those days and we need to be OK in order to have a fullfiling life.. how can i sepparate the vicious parts of my self, the parts that this idiot wrecked from my true self?  
ps.. my english is not my native thong so im sorry for the misuses of the language and if anyone knows something about time travel please let me know :)"
34x6j8,25,2015-05-05,"Purchased Office 2013; received counterfeit copies, need advice",icewewe,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/34x6j8/purchased_office_2013_received_counterfeit_copies/,"Hi all,

While I was on vacation someone in our office (SMB) ordered two copies of MS Office Home &amp; Business 2013 from Amazon (fulfilled by some marketplace seller) for the interns joining our office this summer. When I got back I was told that one of the copies wouldn't activate, and the individual had called Microsoft and had been informed that the license had already been activated.

I asked to see the copies and it was immediately clear to me that they were counterfeit. The COA stickers are fake, and the license key itself looks like someone took a cell phone photo of a real one and printed it on label printer, really bad quality.

Anyway, I have already contacted Amazon about sending the counterfeits back to them for a refund. I need advice on who to contact at Microsoft about the domain the counterfeiters are using to distribute a cracked version of Office 2013. It's a .com domain which is serving up version 15.0.4433.1508 of Office.

I uploaded setup.exe from the ISO to VirusTotal and it seems to be clean except for two false positives (or maybe that's the keygen code?). 

https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3ba59aa51f0eb241f4184d479cf59d121ff86324c09ac5d9415c0e0adc7fc7b5/analysis/1430733445/

I'm thinking that Microsoft might be interested in a .com domain distributing a cracked ISO of Office 2013, but I'm not sure who to talk to. I already called our Office 365 rep, but he didn't have any suggestions for me other than to call the general support line, which I figure won't put me in touch with the people empowered to seize the domain or send a DMCA, etc...

The domain is protected by WHOIS, and the actual server IP is some VPS in the Netherlands. I figure I could contact dynadot and their VPS host, but it would have a lot more clout coming from someone at Microsoft.

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone. It seems it mainly boils down to:

* You shouldn't be buying licenses, you should be using a VLA
* If you must buy licenses, buy from an authorized distributor, not from Amazon
* Don't chase this, just report it to Amazon and Microsoft and move on with life

My employer isn't a scumbag, we're just a small company and I'm one of a few people who knows anything about IT. I'm not a Windows admin, so I'll be looking for an MSP to handle this stuff for us in the future so I can go back to Linux development."
34x7z1,1,2015-05-05,That end of the semester depression. Long background so get your reading glasses ready.,efc4817,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/34x7z1/that_end_of_the_semester_depression_long/,"First time posting here and while my depression is not super serious it still hinders my appetite, focus, and motivation. This is because I can literally sit and be consumed by my running thoughts and not do anything but sit there. Basically I always get this way when I go back home for the summer. 

This time on the other hand the depression has been building throughout the year mostly because of my potential relationships with girls that I like.  Basically any girl meet I can get them but I can never keep them. This doesn't apply for girls that I have one night stands with because that happens when I would get too drunk and thinking it will get my mind off the girls I really like. (The drinking was just from social drinking; not drinking trying to suppress feelings. That doesn't work for me). I'm a senior but graduating in December. For one girl in particular the thought of me graduating soon is a turn off even though we like each other I can never take it to the next level to a relationship because it seems like she and the other girls just lost interest. This has happened about 3 times this year and its extremely demoralizing to waste 2-3 months liking somebody only to have wasted my time. For the most recent girl who is a sophomore and who is an amazing girl who is reserved and little shy just like me. We had been hanging out for a while and been on a lot of dates and I went to her Sorority formal. While at first she wouldn't let me sleep over she eventually did because she felt comfortable around me (Not having sex or anything though). That night I told her I liked her (I try never to do that because I have fucked myself over before saying that) and she said ""that's good"". I asked her if she liked me and she said ""you wouldn't be sleeping over if I didn't"". I smiled until she said... ""but it sucks you're graduating soon"". My heart dropped and just said yeah and we went to sleep. My depression picked up hard after that and I started over-thinking everything. She had never been the one to text first but I started becoming upset over it just waiting and having my thoughts run around my head while I sit on my phone hoping she texts me. I would text her and we would text back and forth but instead of not caring how long or what the text say, after that I would get super bothered about it for no reason. It's been getting close to exam time so I know that people are busy and she studies religiously but I would always feel upset since I haven't been seeing her as much.

These feelings only got amplified because My roommates both have girlfriends (One of them has a girlfriend for the first time in 8 years so now it sucks because we used to be the single bros) so basically I third wheel in my own apartment. Next week I go back home. Only thing is home with the parents is very boring and the town is like a retirement home type town so its all families with their young kids since there's no college in the town. So I'm not going to meet anybody new. What helped me last year's depression was going to the gym 5 times a week and my job was life-guarding so it was basically professional tanning and it was relaxing. This year I have a paid internship that works from 8-4 Monday though Friday. I know I will still work out sometimes but I know sometimes I'll be too tired. And I know that I will basically have a non-existant social life outside a computer. I just feel like my sadness will just become increased the more I work and especially if I don't workout. 

I know this is basically the first taste of the ""real world"" for me but it sucks going all summer thinking about kinds of things. Especially with my parents they are very in my business about things and my friends that I would usually hang with back at home are working in different towns now. I guess the reason why I really feel this kind of way especially with the girl situation is that I know the end of college is coming soon and guess I feel like I should already be in a long term relationship since the scene back home is basically not existent. (Tinder is all a bunch of high  schoolers claiming they're 20, believe me the app sucks now). Basically I felt like I shouldn't be alone coming out of college since I had 4 years to find someone but all there has been is just demoralizing situations. It feels like I should graduate with everything figured out including relationships

Whew sorry I just had to get that out. Basically I just want some kind of thoughts from you guys. It can be comments, advice, criticism, ect. It doesn't matter to be I just wanted someone to tell all this to. There really isn't one of my friends who would understand this kind of thing right now."
34xa77,1,2015-05-05,My lack of casual social interaction is negatively affecting my life.,Distressionn,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/34xa77/my_lack_of_casual_social_interaction_is/,"I know that I don't have any speech impediments or similar conditions. When I want to or need to talk well, I can. Some have even gone as far as calling me eloquent when I publicly speak. However, I have difficulty translating this to meaningful social interaction when our discussion is not strictly about work or school.

I have a very small circle of friends, and most of the people I do hang out with obviously put in a lot of effort to make the friendship work. I have trouble in the phase between casual acquaintance and regular friend - while I can interact with people, I don't feel like I am capable of actually becoming friends with somebody. I don't feel like I know what to talk about, how to keep them engaged, or *why we should be hanging out in the first place.* Furthermore, I don't even care much for it. I would much rather be at home by myself - the only issue is that I want to have friends, and I do genuinely enjoy hanging out with the few friends I have. I just want more, but at the same time, I don't.

I have an amazing GPA at my university but it really doesn't matter when my colleagues left and right are getting internships and jobs from friends and relatives. I have a small family and an even smaller friends circle. I have nobody to depend on for anything, and I always feel envious when I see how much fun other people are having going to concerts, events, and games together. The only issue is I don't really care much for many things other people like, its just that I feel like I'm missing out on that critical part of my life. I've never much cared for sports or music, and I feel like I'm always obsessing over work, which I feel nobody wants to talk about. 

I go to an engineering school in the Midwest. I often feel like an alien here; I don't relate at all to most of the other kids here and I am honestly not very happy with my life. I'm nearly 22 years old and I've never had a girlfriend. Hell, I barely know three total on the entire campus. When my current friends introduce me to new people, I always feel like I'm a third wheel and that there isn't much synergy between us. I'll see them around a lot, but never really engage with them - I'm incredibly slow when it comes to opening up to people, and I feel like I have absolutely no control over this. Every decision I have in my mind is like an executive order from the white house that is shot down by angry congressmen afraid of the repercussions of acting in a certain way. If a joke leaves my mouth, chances are it has gone through hundreds of congressional hearings where every element that could have possibly been funny has been replaced by more 'conservative' awkwardness. I'm afraid I'll be judged, which is funny, because I don't care all too much for what I look like or how I project myself - I'm more afraid that I'll offend somebody, bore them, or act too aggressively. What if I'm pushing this too hard (even though we've only texted maybe two times about a homework assignment), or what if I look like that guy on cringepics?

I guess you could say I'm overly analytical about things. Which is great for my engineering major, but absolutely terrible for every other aspect of my life. I'm afraid to text people or ask them for things, and sometimes, the nervousness I have in person actually causes me to stumble my thoughts. I have zero confidence because my brain treats everything as a probability simulation with particular consequences weighed out. And its easy enough for someone to say ""just do it"" but I can't with this brain I have, even if I'm thinking about it while I'm doing it. I just wish I could drink and drink until I could destroy this part of me. I didn't use to care about this - I could go home every day in high school and play single player video games for 6 hours straight. I've come to realize what an incredible waste this is, and what is truly possible in the world. I'm not depressed, I haven't given up hope, I see what can be done. On the other hand, I feel kind of hopeless sometimes because I know that I am at fault for everything I stress about. I have extreme anxiety, very little confidence, and am overly analytical about things.

 I know that this was an incredibly long rant, but I just had to get that offmychest. I know my rant was a little all over the place, but I've come to realize there is no one silver bullet that will fix all of my problems - they are a conglomeration of many smaller issues. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate any feedback, however harsh, you would like to provide."

I was recently offered an internship at a fortune 20 company and I am excited at the opportunity, but unfortunately it only lasts for the summer.  If the summer internship goes well they said almost all interns get a full time position after they graduate.  My only issue is as a commuter student I won't have a job from August- december(graduate in fall), and if I do it won't pay as much because I doubt my current job would take me back after leaving.  

Is sacrificing some pay and savings for an internship as a big corporation worth it in the long run, or should I try and maybe defer the offer to the spring time after I graduate.  Are big names really worth having on your resume

Additional info: current internship pays more, but new internship at big company is in desired field of data analytics"

All my friends and my girlfriend of 6 years are moving to the east coast after graduation, so in a week I'll see them much less frequently, if ever again. I agreed to work for my current internship until the end of May, but I was under the impression they would be understanding about me prioritizing time with my friends and family before graduation. Now it's the week before, and my request for time off was denied because they have a ton of work for me to do this week. 

I know it's considered bad form to walk out without giving 2 week notice, but I already have a job lined up and I think I'm going to look back and regret the time I spent sitting in a cube instead of enjoying my last week with the people I love. What should I do? 

Edit: This isn't PTO since the internship is paid hourly. 

Financially, this isn't a big deal for me. I could make some decent money in the time I'd be working, but I have enough savings for ~3 months of living expenses on top of a signing and relocation bonus from the new job. "

34xzra,0,2015-05-05,How would you rate my college's computer science program regionally?,xogradyx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34xzra/how_would_you_rate_my_colleges_computer_science/,"http://www.lasalle.edu/math-computer-science/computer-science/course-descriptions/
http://www.lasalle.edu/math-computer-science/computer-science/requirements/

I also asked the chair of the program's questions that I thought would help me get a feel for the program as a whole. I'll post them below.

1. What languages are the introductory CS classes taught in?

Our first-semester programming course is taught in javascript with the primary goal of teaching students how to program. The next two semesters are taught in Java, which forms the basis for our computer science degree.

2. What other languages does the department teach(Database languages included)?

The following languages are taught in required or elective CS courses regularly: SQL (in our database courses), VB.NET, php, asp, C, Android. In the Programming Languages course that some students take, a broad exposure to a variety of programs occurs.

3. What is the instructor to student ratio in the introductory CS classes?

The intro courses tend to have between 15 and 25 students. All of the courses in the department are capped at no more than 25 with most capped at no more than 22. All of our computer science courses are taught in a computer lab, and all but one of our labs has 24 machines. The largest lab has 27 machines. We always allow for problems with the computers, so we always try to keep the actual number of students in the room to be 2 under the number of machines, hence the 25 and 22 caps.

4. What technology companies actively recruit at La Salle?

Career and Employment Services handles most of the formal recruitment sessions, and I am unfamiliar with the list of companies that do formal recruitment visits to campus. However, I do receive a lot of job descriptions to share with the students, mostly from a variety of local companies, often sent in by alumni. See below for a list of where our students have ended up in recent times.

5. What technology companies have recent graduates from the program gone to work for?

Some of the companies that have hired multiple students from us over a period of years include Lockheed Martin, Vanguard, Accenture, Monetate, Department of Defense, and Sungard. Many other small local companies hire our students as well. 

6. What is the average salary for a graduate from this department for their first job?

We do not formally collect this information from students, but based on the few offers that have been shared with me in recent years, the range of starting salaries is between $50,000 and $70,000.

7. Do many students in the program work at development internships during the summer or part time during the school year?

Yes. Although it is not a requirement of the computer science students to do an internship, we do have a large number do internships. Often these occur in the summer. Occasionally, they receive academic credit for the internship. Some students are able to do development internships on campus with a variety of offices that need skilled developers. We have been working with a local start-up called Intern-U that helps our students find both internships and full-time jobs upon graduation. We also have a computer science advisory board comprised of IT and CS leaders from a variety of fields in the area, and this board has been very active over the last three years in helping students with career-related matters, including the providing of internships."

So, I am actually a Senior about to graduate from a liberal arts college in a couple weeks. I have a degree that has nothing to do with computer science, its a history degree. However, in the last couple years, I realized my interest in programming/IT and started taking programming classes at my school. I've taken Computer Science 101, Intro to Java, Android Application Development(Java), and am currently in Data Structures and Algorithm analysis in Java. I started applying to developer and IT jobs and internship a few months ago just hoping that I could land an interview and just show how passionate I was for it and that I could learn everything I need to know and more. After a few months of emails returning saying that companies were ""proceeding with candidates with more suitable experience,"" I got discouraged and stopped applying. Just yesterday, I got a call and email from a company nearby and they want to interview me next week. How can I prepare properly and show them that I will work my ass off for them? Thanks!

The nice thing about this is that the times are pretty much whatever I want, so I could still take the 2 classes.   
On the other hand, I was offered a internship at a household name, manufacturing company. It is also a industrial engineering focused internship. I would probably be able to do 1 class with this.   
I still have 2 more summers after this. Which one would you recommend? Is a nationally known company worth the sacrifice of a class? My next two semesters are pretty packed, so I was hoping to get two done this semester. "
34y9f5,58,2015-05-05,Something funny's happening in Beijing...,sleepyhollow_101,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/34y9f5/something_funnys_happening_in_beijing/,"It’s so hard to put this into words.  I keep hoping that as I examine and re-examine the facts, I’ll find that I’m just being crazy.  I’m praying there’s a loophole to this insanity, that there’s something I’m missing.  But the more I stare into the abyss, the darker it gets.  And now I don’t know what to do.

Background: I’m a Chinese major studying abroad in Beijing and Peking University, which will hereon be referred to as PKU.

It started yesterday when I got out of class.  On Tuesdays (it’s currently Wednesday in Beijing), I get out of class at noon.  Because I typically have the whole afternoon free, I usually go to a little café outside of campus.

For reference, here’s a quick layout of said café in relation to the campus.  In order to get to the café, you leave out of West Gate, which is the big official gate that all the tourists takes pictures at.  Straight across the street are a few rows of apartment complexes.  You weave in and out of them for about a quarter of a mile, eventually passing a small fruit market and a supermarket.  At this point, you’ll be spit back out on the street, facing a small waterway that is bordered by white stone barriers.  Turn left and you’ll immediately see a black fence almost completely covered by green vines.  There’s a small opening that is easy to miss, but if you see it, go in and there it is.

The Stoic Café.  Tiny and out of the way and absolutely perfect.

Stepping through that doorway is like stepping into another world.  I know it sounds cheesy and cliché, but it seems like something out of a fairytale.  There’s a tiny courtyard paved with cobblestones and surrounded by every color flower you can imagine.  I didn’t know that many flowers could coexist in such a small space.  To the right are a few small gazebo structures shading tables and chairs, beautiful and rustic.  They appear to be hand-carved and perfectly at home amongst the flowers.

Once you enter the café itself, time seems to stop.  It’s somewhat narrow, like a long hallway that opens occasionally to a variety of tiny rooms.  The walls are completely lined with books in every language and there’s always soothing, slow music drifting out of some hidden speakers.  A few cats laze around and if I’m lucky they’ll sit on my lap.  I usually sit towards the back of the café.  It’s a little dark as the overhead lighting is poor, but there’s a nice desk lamp and it offers me a quiet place to study for a few hours.

I’ve really only got one issue with my go-to café: it’s so warm.  Seriously, it’s like they’re constantly running the heat.  As a result, I get a little drowsy (particularly after I drink my regular hot chocolate).  

Yesterday I was studying in the café alone (it’s usually pretty dead since it’s sort of hidden) when a drowsy spell came on.  Usually I can fight through it, but apparently today it was a battle I was destined to lose because I woke up around six in the evening, groggy and disoriented and just a little dizzy.

Luckily, I’d finished as much homework as I needed to for the next day.  I paid my bill in a hurry and rushed out the door.  I wanted to get home in time for dinner with my host family at seven.

I turned right as I exited the café and took another right through the apartment complexes.  I passed the fruit stands and the supermarket.  I weaved in and out of the parking lots and gates.

I exited the final gate and stood on the street, but something was wrong.

I was standing in front of a restaurant. 

There wasn’t anything spectacular about it, just your average noodle shop, a tiny bit sketchy.  The main problem was that it shouldn’t be there.  I was supposed to be standing right in front of the PKU West Gate.

But I wasn’t.

I looked down the street, confused.  Had I somehow taken a wrong turn and gone out a different gate?  The apartment complexes were huge and all clustered together, so maybe I was just further down the street or something.  I scanned to the left and to the right.  An array of small restaurants and shops lined the opposite end of the street.  I turned around and faced the gate I’d just come out of.  Once again, I scanned left and right.  Everything looked the same as when I entered, the same black cab still parked to my left along with the same ridiculously giant restaurant that I’d always wanted to try.

What the fuck?

Well, obviously I’d made some mistake, no matter how familiar the area looked.  I carefully backtracked to Stoic, then wound my way through the maze of apartments again.

I ended up in the same place, facing the same stupid noodle restaurant.

I was beginning to get frustrated and just a little scared.  I HATE being lost.  In fact, it is my least favorite feeling in the world, and I don’t typically handle it very well.

As I stood puzzling and unsure of what to do, a taxi came down the street and I practically jumped in front of it.

As I got in, I brusquely requested he take me to PKU.

“Where?” He asked.

“You know, PKU.  Just take me to the East Gate.” Maybe I’d have better luck there.  It was closer to my bus stop, anyway.

“Sorry, I don’t know that place.”

I stared at him, speechless.  A cab driver who didn’t know where PKU was?  Are you kidding me?  No way, not possible.

“Um… just take me to the Zhongguancun subway station.” I could get home from there if I had to.

He took me to the subway station and I hopped on, transferring twice until I reached the Huilongguan subway station.  On the way, I found myself standing next to a guy who looked about my age.  His heavy backpack and defeated look suggested that he, too, was a college student.  I took the opportunity to ask if he was studying at PKU.

“Where?”

Well, what the hell are the odds that TWO BEIJINGERS don’t know China’s most famous school?  This wasn’t making any sense.

I got off at Huilongguan and jumped on the bus to my house.  As soon as I arrived, my host mom chirped up from the kitchen, “How was work today?”

But… I don’t work.  Not even an internship.  I was studying abroad.

I muttered that it was fine and I wasn’t feeling well.  I locked myself in my room and promptly succumbed to a panic attack that lasted about four minutes, although it felt like an hour.

Once I calmed down, I pulled out my American phone.  Although I can’t make any calls on it due to my lack of a Chinese SIM card, I can connect to the Internet.  I mostly use it for WeChat.  I opened up my WeChat and tried to message the other American students who were at PKU with me.

All their contacts were lost.

I yanked open my computer and waited impatiently for my VPN to connect.  Once I got onto Google (seriously, China? You block Google?) I searched “PKU.”  It came up empty.  Not a single hit.

I opened up iPhoto.  There I saw pictures of me and my friends, doing class presentations, hanging out at the bar, singing karaoke, taking pictures with random Chinese people… 

But our faces were all blurred.  And everything seemed to be in motion, like our bodies were fluid and trembling.

Then my computer shut down.  And when I opened it again, all my pictures were gone.

The university I’ve spent two months at is gone.  All of my classmates are gone.  I apparently have a job that I don’t even know about.  I haven’t yet succeeded in getting a hold of my parents, or anyone else from home, for that matter.  I have no idea what to do.

Has anything like this happened to anyone else?  Please, does anyone else out there know about PKU?  Am I just going crazy?

I have been in a monogamous relationship for 2.5 years where we lived together and I was basically a horrible boyfriend towards the end . My ex (let's call her Jenny ) has been in nothing but poly relationships her entire life . After meeting me she decided to give monogamy a chance and I ended up just being a couch potato pot head who played video games all the time . 
She is deeply involved in the fetish community and her business is surrounded by people within the Bdsm community as well . I however was incredibly vanilla in the bedroom and showed no interest in tying her up or facilitating more fetishised sexual encounters . Since she works from home I always assumed her need to go out was due to her feeling trapped at work 24/7 and towards the end I suggested she start going out with her friends to have fun . She seemed ok with the idea and agreed that she should be able to go have fun and be happy . I was extremely anti social and didn't put forth any effort when she had friends over for dinner or to socialize . I would get so stoned I would Zone out on the couch and escape through playing video games so I didn't have to confront my personal inadequacies in her life . Her friends are burlesque dancers and models as well as professional creative individuals . I looked at myself as lacking any creativity and any time she suggested going out to shows or anything I would make excuses as to why I didn't want to go . I.e it was too loud or too full of drag queens LGBT people for me to feel comfortable . Which in retrospect I found it is completely silly.
One day a few weeks ago I called her while at work and asked her what time she would be leaving to go to her friends performance after a brief conversation and telling her how gorgeous she looked every time she went out I got a angry comment from her about how she enjoys looking nice when she goes out with her friends . This was the moment I knew something was awry . So I took off from work and decided to go home so we could chat . Upon getting home she seemed more interested in working than chatting as her intern was still there . 
The last time she went out with friends I was in bed when she got home and she immediately took a shower and came and cuddled up to me . Being the insecure person I was I thought she slept with someone and was washing the evidence off . 
Since I came home to chat and she wasn't receptive at the time I kept thinking about that shower and what it meant because communication had broken down to the point that she was snapping at me for complimenting her . I decided to pack my things because I was sure she was already seeing someone else . After packing my things we had another convo about her wanting to go out with me and of course being the pot head I was I made every excuse under the sun with little room for compromise . At the end of the conversation she was so mixed up and indecisive that I grabbed my things in the morning and left because I felt there was no way I could make her happy .
After a few days of contemplation and deep introspective thought I decided to quit smoking pot because it was obviously contributing to my anti social behavior and reducing my energy levels to the point of unhealthiness. 
I invited her out that weekend and talked with her over breakfast . I had come to the conclusion that although I wasn't a horrible boyfriend my negative attitude and lack of concern for her needs needed to be fixed and I am so deeply in love with this girl that I would do anything to make it work . 
She is the only girl in my life that hd ever made me feel so special and the only girl I have ever thought about spending the rest of my life with .  
After breakfast and a conversation as well as a walk along the beach she said she needed a few days to think about it . 3 days later she told me to come over that night and she told me she would give me a second chance but needed her space and didn't want to live together or be officially monogamous . Given that I made her miserable towards the end of our relationship I understood her needs and decided to put hers before my own .  As well as the fact that she has had multiple relationships in the past where the guy said he would change but didn't and she was suckered into the same old roles that they originally had before they gave it a second try . 
We have since gone out consistently every week and went to a dungeon party as well as started involving myself in the Bdsm bedroom kinks that she enjoys  I even helped her vend at one of the Bdsm conferences in our local area this weekend . I have had problems with the openness of our relationship since because I am basically putting in 1000% of my time money and energy to make this work while she is adamant that she doesn't want to feel trapped by being my girlfriend . We have had a few conversations about the subject and every time I have suggested that in order for me to feel that we are connected and that I don't want to feel like a replaceable individual in her life she just reaffirms that she is starting to feel trapped again . 
Since our last conversation I have had to come to terms with her not wanting to be solely mine . 
It was surrounded by the idea that I feel like all my effort and energy is unhealthy if she is interested in dating other individuals because if you know tht I am fulfilling all of the needs that I did not before then why would you seek something else from other individuals . Furthermore how could she feel that focusing her attention on cultivating other relationships if she is not interested in cultivating our own ( she has been adamant that she doesn't want me hogging all of her time and needs space ) 
It's kind of a catch 22 for me right now because in order for me to show her how open I am to fulfilling her needs I need to spend time with her however if she feels like I'm being too pushy it will do me no good .  
After the conference this weekend I felt incredibly connected with her again ( I stayed at her place and had lots of sexy fun ) .
 I am incredibly monogamous when I  love someone and I truly do love her and want to make her happy in every facet of life and am willing to change mine in order for that to happen . I am still having a hard time processing how we can make this work if she is not interested in giving our relationship (whatever that may be ) the focus I am giving it . 
At the conference she had a conversation with her friend about how I am jealous because of my deep love for her and that she needed to figure out how to have her freedom for now until she knows that she is ok with it just being us . 
I don't know what his suggestion was as she didn't tell me but I assume it is that she should start dating other people and I will either be okay with it or I won't . I am incredibly torn up about the idea of someone else making her happy. I am also worried that her love for me is diluted in some way by the fact that she is capable of cultivating multiple relationships at once . 
I would do anything for this girl and the last thing I want to do is screw up my last chance to make things work . I have quit smoking the Devils lettuce started putting more time into work and also started helping her whenever I can financially due to her living  paycheck to paycheck I feel guilty for not supporting her before so I am doing it now . 
I really don't know how to cope with the current situation and would like any feedback that you guys can provide . I love this girl with the entirety of my being and would do anything to make it work . I am not interested in dating other people and only want her to be my girl . How can I move forward and feel healthy about what is happening and not be burdened by the idea that I am not good enough if she wants to date other people ? She has told me that I am her primary and that she wants to make this work . However I feel like I am easily cast aside if she can connect with other people in an intimate fashion. 
Any conversations lead to her seeming aggravated and trapped so I don't know how to process this without an outside perspective .

Me and 2 others are going to be moving to Phoenix for an internship this summer, and we're currently considering housing options. The potential apartment we're renting out is in the Deer Valley area, a mile or two south of 101. 

For a regular 9AM-5PM nearby Mayo Clinic, how long can we expect the commute to be? Google Maps claims a 15 minute commute with no traffic, but between 15 and 35 minute commute with traffic at 8:30AM and 5PM depending on the day. Can we expect it to take more than 30 minutes on a regular basis? Or are we looking at closer to a 20-minute average commute to and from?

Thanks! So excited to check out your city. Will be looking for people to show me around the area so I'll be hitting you guys up for drinks!

Here's a link to the afternoon Google estimate:

34zmg3,1,2015-05-05,Should I transfer to UIC's engineering CS or UIUC's liberal arts &amp; sciences Math + CS?,hikzero,uicwhatshot,https://www.reddit.com/r/uicwhatshot/comments/34zmg3/should_i_transfer_to_uics_engineering_cs_or_uiucs/,"I'm about to finish up my 2 years at Oakton Community College in Skokie, IL and have been accepted to those two programs.

While at Oakton I built a pretty tightly-knit circle of friends who are going to do engineering as well. I did not think I would actually get admitted to UIUC, so we all planned to get an apartment in the city together and tackle engineering at UIC together.
Now that I got accepted to UIUC, despite it not being full blown engineering, I'm still finding that the curriculum is nearly identical.

Given the following facts:
-They are both Bachelor of Science degrees

-The amount of financial would likely be a ton at both schools (not 100% sure on that, because I haven't received the award letter at from UIUC yet, but they want me to fill out the Illinois Promise Verification form -- only for students who need serious aid. So I think I'm going to get a ton of aid)

-I would still be able to get internships no matter which school I choose because every summer I'd come back to Chicago

-I would get a significant amount of additional job opportunities if I stay in Chicago, just because it is a major city

-The curriculums between the two programs are nearly identical, except UIUC's major seems like it requires a couple of bullshit LAS requirements, such as a foreign language class, as well as about 3 or so more math classes to satisfy the math portion of the major.

-I would have to provide/work for myself to support my share of an apartment at UIC if I go there (It's a commuter school, the dorms are mostly shit).


Should I leave my engineering buddies, who have also become some of my best personal friends, and pursue UIUC, or should I try to make working while going to UIC in Chicago work and let the opportunity go?"
34zo3y,2,2015-05-05,[Hiring] (Remote) Front-End Web Developer Junior or Intern,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/34zo3y/hiring_remote_frontend_web_developer_junior_or/,"Hi, I’m looking for a front-end web development internship or junior position.  Due to my current job (part-time) and location I’m look for remote only.

I’m looking for an internship or junior position over freelancing because I find working with a team more engaging and productive compared to working by myself.  As an intern or junior I’d expect to be able to contribute, while also continuing to learn. I believe that with modern tools a remote developers can work together just as well as developers in the same building, and I hope to find a position with a company that embraces this idea.

Most of the time I spend in either the Middle East or the UK, but I am always up late (it’s 2am here now as I post this) so I can also work teams in the USA, especially if they are in Central or Eastern time zones.

I have about one year experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I am also familiar with tools such as git, npm, bower, gulp, and yeoman.  Also, I’ve experimented with front-end frameworks, mostly KnockoutJS and Angular. I feel I’m actually quite knowledgeable about Angular, and I enjoy using it. Lastly, I do have some knowledge of PHP, Laravel, and Wordpress. I’m not as productive in this with these tools, but I can read backend code, and even pitch when needed.

Lastly I’m a good writer and communicator.  I’m coming for a field that is very customer service oriented, so I’ve been able to refine my soft skills over the years.  

Here’s some links to my [personal site](http://www.builtprecise.io), [Github](https://github.com/GrahamWood), and [Stackexchange](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3773119/graham) profiles.  Please either contact on the email published on my personal site or via a Reddit private message.

34zprj,52,2015-05-05,"Jake part XIV - Just Rewards [timestop, MF, nc, voy, reluc, etc]",jcr_nsfw,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/34zprj/jake_part_xiv_just_rewards_timestop_mf_nc_voy/,"Jake woke early, having already slept between moments. Time was already a totally different concept to him than it had been before, it seemed. He looked at the clock by the bed, noting that it was only 4 in the morning. Plenty of time to get started on the day.  
But first, it seemed there was some unfinished business to take care of. Jake had meant to spend some time next door last night, and had got so caught up with Katie that it had slipped his mind. A quick shower to freshen up and an apple from the fridge later, he was whistling to himself and strolling out the door.  
He’d taken the liberty of stealing and copying a set of Saul’s keys, so entering the eerily silent house was no problem. Of course, the silence was more due to the fact time was stopped than the late hour. Jake headed upstairs to Saul and Natalia’s room.  
Jake found pretty much what he expected under the covers of their bed: the two of them sleeping facing opposite directions, Saul in an undershirt and boxers and Natalia wearing a sexy nightie and matching panties. The poor girl was trying so hard to keep her husband interested, but knowing Saul he probably hadn’t risen to the occasion.  
After a whole night of fucking a pair of teenagers, Natalia’s body was that much more alluring. The nightie dipped low in the front, covering her generous breasts with just enough sheer lacey fabric to occlude her nipples. Jake slid the thin straps off her shoulders, admiring the generous swell of her chest, peaked by nipples that seemed darker in the dim light. He leaned down and sucked one, then the other, pulling them to points with his teeth.  
After all this experience stopping time, Jake still got a kick out of how objects froze when he moved them. For instance, the two perfect handprints that squished Nat’s breasts inward and together. He chuckled, restarting time and watching them bounce down to their resting state again.  
Natalia moaned softly, but didn’t shift or move. Jake stopped things again and ran his hand down her side, dipping at her hourglass waist and reaching back to give her ass a squeeze. He lifted her leg out of the way and pulled her panties aside, rubbing her pussy with his fingers and then leaning down to suck and lick at her. Then he put everything back and started time again.  
This time Natalia’s moan was louder, and her hand immediately slipped down between her legs. Without showing any signs of waking up, Natalia began rubbing herself through her clothing. Even with the bedclothes blocking his view, it was one of the hottest things Jake had ever seen, and his cock strained at the front of his pants.  
Nat licked her lips, and Jake just couldn’t resist. He slipped out of his pants and shorts, moving his already stiff cock closer to her and resting it on her mouth. Natalia responded immediately, parting her lips and touching him with a warm, moist tongue and sucking the head in.  
Jake shuddered with pleasure as Natalia sucked and licked at his cock. She kept rubbing at her pussy, and her soft moaning was vibrating her mouth around him. Jake reached down and slipped a hand into her nightie, cupping her breast and teasing the nipple with his fingers.  
Natalia’s suction escalated and Jake let her take him deeper in her mouth. He started moving back and forth, slowly fucking her lips. She shifted her arm and moaned more loudly as she moved from merely rubbing to actively fingering herself.   
Jake felt an orgasm building. He moaned, then stopped himself, but not quickly enough. Natalia’s eyes fluttered open and focused on him briefly, then widened in shock. Jake froze her, removed himself to the nearby closet, and started time once more.  
Natalia stared at the space where he had been. “Hello?” she whispered. She pulled her hand up from her crotch and stared at it a moment.  
Jake froze her once more and examined her under the covers. She was definitely wet, glistening in the dim light. He licked at her slit a few times, just enough to entice her, then returned to hiding and watched her as she suddenly felt his interference, squirming and biting her lip to keep from moaning.  
Natalia, apparently deciding she needed to get off, turned onto her back and returned her hand to her privates. She propped up on her pillow against the headboard, using her free hand to squeeze her tits through the nightie while she fingered herself.  
Jake waited for a minute, then froze time and stepped out. He stripped down completely, stood directly in Nat’s line of sight, and let her start up again.  
Natalia gasped in shock at seeing him “appear”, standing before her and stroking his cock. Her arm stopped moving, and so did his hand. Just like before, he stood, smiling at her, and stroking himself in time with her own masturbation.  
She seemed to accept that, and soon was laying back and softly moaning, working furiously to get herself off. Jake caught her eyes with his, then looked pointedly toward Saul.  
Nat took the hint immediately. She reached over and around her husband’s sleeping body, slipping her still-wet hand down and stroking his cock inside his boxers. Saul groaned, and Natalia pressed close against his back and began kissing his neck and earlobe.  
Saul turned sleepily onto his back and Natalia leaned in to kiss him hungrily. Jake walked around to the side of the bed, watching the couple and still stroking himself, now in time to Natalia’s own stroking.  
Saul seemed unwilling to put much effort into waking up, but Nat was undeterred. She pulled his cock out of his boxers and went down on it, staring up at Jake while she bobbed her head and sucked on him. Once he was completely hard, she straddled his hips, pulling her panties to the side and guiding him up into her pussy.  
Saul moaned softly as Natalia began riding him, slowly dragging her hips forward and back. She breathed quickly, panting in time to her movement, and kept looking at Jake, obviously getting into the “fantasy” that he was watching her.  
Jake froze time again. Natalia was in mid-thrust, staring at his cock with a smile on her face. “Well,” Jake said quietly, “if you’re that interested…”  
Placing his hands on her hips, Jake lifted Natalia up into the air. Then he dragged Saul carefully off the bed and stood him upright, sliding him back into the closet and closing the door. He chuckled at the image of Saul propped in there like a mannequin - or rather, given his condition, a well-used sex doll - then returned to the bed and took his place, lying on his back under Natalia’s levitated hips.  
Carefully, Jake held Nat’s hips and pulled her back down toward the bed. She was still a few inches up when he felt her wet, slightly gaping opening at the head of his dick. He guided himself up inside her, bringing her down until her knees were on either side of him, on the bed once more. Then he started Natalia again, leaving the rest of the world frozen in time.  
Nat had been in the middle of a downward thrust, and a pretty hard one at that. She cried out in surprise as she suddenly felt her vagina stretched by a longer, thicker dick, staring down in shock at him. Jake looked up at her silently, still pretending to be her fantasy hallucination, and waited.  
He didn’t have to wait long. Natalia slid her hands down onto Jake’s pecs and started moving again, slowly up and back down again. “Oh god,” she whispered, “It’s just like I dreamed…”  
Jake smiled up at her, running his hands up from her hips along her sides to cup her breasts. She moaned, pushing down a little deeper on him and moving faster. Before long, she was once again sliding her hips back and forth smoothly, only now instead of her husband’s cock inside her, it was Jake’s filling her, and she still seemed convinced she was imagining it.  
Natalia was tight, surprisingly so for a grown woman. She was clearly not used to even an above-average size on a man, but she just as clearly was loving the sensations. She shifted back and started lifting and falling instead of moving back and forth, using gravity to pull herself down and forcing Jake in deeper inside her until he could feel the brush of the end of her passage.  
Jake slid his hands around to her ass, helping to pull her down and thrusting up into her a little. Her pussy contracted around him and she cried out again, shaking as she came around him. Jake kept thrusting through the spasms, refusing to give her a rest, and Natalia fell down on top of him. Her breasts flattened against his chest while her hips rose and fell, and she pressed her lips down on his, moaning into him.  
Jake started pumping harder and faster, fucking Natalia eagerly now. He pulled her down again and again to meet him, and finally felt her give way, letting him plunge into her womb. Her cervix squeezed him like a vise and he groaned into her frantic kisses, but she kept moving, up and down, grunting and moaning with each balls-deep thrust.  
They came together, both vocalizing their pleasure loudly into another kiss. Natalia’s pussy convulsed, rippling inside and milking Jake’s cock. He thrust deep inside her, throbbing almost painfully as his cum shot out, filling the deepest parts of her womb.  
Natalia’s head fell on Jake’s should and they both laid still for a minute, panting. Natalia started to lever herself up to look at him again, and that was the moment Jake once more froze her in time.  
Jake took another moment to appreciate the view and the heat of Natalia on and around him, then began to lift her off of himself. He pushed her up into the air, slid off the bed, and retrieved Saul from the closet. Returning Saul to the bed, he carefully lowered Natalia onto him, sliding his cock into her and giving a little press to her stomach to hopefully close some of the gaping of her opening around him.  
Jake wiped his dick clean on the corner of the sheet, then dressed once more and stood outside the bedroom door. He listened in when he started time once more.  
“Oh god, Saul, that was incredible,” Natalia murmured. “And you’re still hard… mmm…”  
Jake quietly walked away from the bedroom and down the stairs as the sounds of Natalia riding Saul began once more.  
  
Jake walked down the street at a leisurely pace, enjoying the frozen sunrise. There was almost nobody on the street at this hour, and the quiet made it seem almost like a false world, a giant simulation created for his own enjoyment.  
Rounding a corner, Jake’s eye was drawn to a jogger on a path through a park. He walked closer to investigate. She was wearing a bright pink tank and black leggings, and had been frozen mid-stride. The leggings were tight enough that Jake could see the outline of her underwear, as well as the slight swell of her mound.  
The girl was clearly taking very good care of herself. She had a slim figure, average-sized breasts filling out her sports bra, and a supremely tight-looking ass. Without hesitation, Jake pulled out his stiffening tool and moved behind her.  
He laid his cock between the girl’s ass-cheeks, bending her forward and moving her legs to a standing position. It was a beautiful sight from his perspective: the long blonde hair flowing back in the “wind,” the arch of a slim back under tight clothing, and that perfect ass with his dick nestled against it.  
Holding her hips, Jake ground slowly up and down against the jogger. The sheer fabric of her leggings felt like a silken glove stroking the underside of his shaft. He smiled, stroking back and forth faster but taking his time with her.  
Jake thought about fucking the girl, but decided that it was boring to just stick his dick inside every nice-looking girl he met. Besides, he didn’t have enough time in the day. On the other hand, a quick standing lapdance was a nice diversion.  
He stood the girl up straighter and lifted her shirt and bra, fondling her breasts with one hand. The other hand held her waist, keeping her steady while he thrust up against her. The only sounds in the world were his moans and the shuffling of skin on cloth.  
Feeling his climax building, Jake turned the girl around and pushed her to her knees. He slid his cock between her breasts, which were slick with sweat already, and squeezed them around it. Pumping his hips, he groaned loudly as his cum shot out along her neck and cleavage.  
Jake squeezed the last few drops out onto the jogger’s nipples, then took a picture to remember her by. His picture collection was getting pretty pride-worthy, he thought as he stowed his phone in his pocket. He replaced the girl’s bra and top, but left the pearl necklace behind, then returned her to her running mid-stride position and walked over to a spot in front of her where he could observe from. Starting time, jake began walking on the path toward the girl as if he were just out for a stroll.  
The girl stumbled for a moment, confused probably by the sensations of contact on her ass and breasts. She glanced behind her, then kept running, oblivious to the obvious cum all over her chest. Jake smiled and waved to her and she lifted a hand in greeting as she ran past.  
  
Work was pretty quiet, but Jake was amused to see that Marta was wearing a fully-buttoned blouse and a bra. It seemed she’d listened to her “conscience” about the flirting. He planted a note in her purse that said “Good job on modesty, keep it up”.  
By the afternoon, Jake was suffering a severe case of boredom. There were far too few people doing things that earned them Karmic Justice, and his work was already done for at least a week ahead thanks to the efficiency of being able to stop time. But then, a person didn’t need to be guilty to be the target of a prank or two, right?  
Jake walked through the frozen office, glancing side to side. An intern was watching some training video over a manager’s shoulder, so Jake unfroze the computer, entered an address for a porn site, then froze it again. When things resumed, they would see an unexpected page load up, and probably think there was some sort of crazy virus on the computer. Jake made a note to volunteer to fix that one for them.  
Pam from Human Resources was chatting with a male coworker by the breakroom. Pam was usually close to wherever food was. She was a little overweight; not big enough to start being disgusting, but certainly past the range where Jake would consider her desirable. On the other hand, the guy talking with her seemed willing to overlook her gut in favor of staring at her admittedly very large breasts. Jake decided to make the guy’s day, using a knife from a nearby drawer to cut off the top buttons of her blouse. Just to be thorough, he opened the blouse and shifted Pam’s tits so a nipple was showing over the edge of her bra, then pushed them in so they would bounce outward, throwing the blouse open dramatically.  
Pam hadn’t done anything recently to earn any ire, but Jake had always found her to be a little annoying and useless, so he figured she was fair game. Maybe later he’d manipulate her and her soon-to-be gawker into an encounter in a supply room. That would be a nice way to make it up to her for the embarrassment she was about to suffer.  
Just for the hell of it, Jake walked over to Marta’s desk and opened her slacks up. He slid his hand down inside and rubbed her pussy for a while; long enough, he hoped, to get her off. He planted another note on her desk: “Have a reward for the good behavior, me!”  
Jake was so amused by the thought of Marta squirming in her chair and then getting annoyed at herself for it that he almost walked right into Danica. Danica, the mousy brunette PR girl who never really bothered anyone. Danica, of the milky-white skin and lovely C-cup breasts.  
Danica, who probably deserved some sort of reward.  
After all, how was it fair that Marta got to cum at random for being a skank, but Danica went through her day without any sort of physical gratification? Simply by virtue of… well, of virtue, she somehow had become less deserving of orgasmic bliss.  
Jake resolved to change that. He stepped around a corner where he wouldn’t be seen to “appear”, and started time. Danica, apparently carrying some copies back to her desk, walked around the corner.  
“Hey,” Jake said, raising a hand in greeting, “need a hand?”  
“Thanks,” Danica said, smiling at him and handing over a stack of pages. She’d worn her glasses today and looked pretty much adorable. “It’s a little awkward, I need to staple the copies at my desk.”  
Jake walked with her back to her office, suppressing the urge to stare and chuckle when Pam hurried past holding her blouse closed. “So how’s your day going?” he asked.  
“It’s pretty dull, to be honest,” Danica admitted. “I’ve about finished everything I need to do until tomorrow.”  
“So what are you going to do until five, then?”  
“I dunno,” Danica said, “watch videos of funny cats?”  
Jake grinned. “That was pretty much my plan as well.”  
Danica’s office was fairly private, and Jake thought it would make a nice venue for what he had planned. He set the papers on her desk. “Anything else you need?” he asked.  
“No, thanks. Enjoy your videos!”  
“Heh. You, too.” Jake nodded and left, sliding the office door closed behind him. Of course he immediately reopened it and walked back into the office, but Danica didn’t know that.  
There was really nowhere to hide, but Jake figured he could stand behind Danica and she would be unlikely to notice. Of course, behind her was a pretty good place to be right now, as she was presently leaning over her desk to sort through her printouts.  
Jake carefully slid her skirt up and admired her ass. She was wearing pantyhose over a pair of white panties, and the curve from her back to her thigh was tight and beautiful. Jake’s cock twitched in excitement.  
“Down, boy,” Jake muttered to it. “This is about her.”  
Kneeling, he slid Danica’s hose panties down to her thighs. Her skin was as milky-pale as he remembered; clearly the girl didn’t go out uncovered in the sun a lot. He leaned forward and slowly ran his tongue along the length of her slit, then covered her up again and let time start.  
Danica gasped, executing a full-body shiver. She looked around, but thanks to some quick reflexes on Jake’s part he was able to stop time and move out of her field of view easily enough that she didn’t notice him behind her.  
Danica shrugged and returned to her paperwork, dismissing the event. Jake stopped time again and once more exposed and licked her, then rubbed at her clit with his fingertips. When he redressed and unfroze her, her knees weaved and she moaned. Catching herself on the desk, she blushed and again looked around, but once more Jake dodged her detection.  
Jake decided it was time to escalate a little. He stripped down, then once more licked and rubbed Danica’s pussy. Then he sat on the side of her desk, where her line of sight would be pointed directly at his erection, and started time again.  
Danica moaned once more, this time stifling it with her hand, then gasped as she realized she was staring at Jake’s cock. Her eyes trailed up until they met his, and then he disappeared. Or more specifically, he moved to where she couldn’t see him again.  
“What the hell?” Danica whispered, squirming a little as she seemed to realize how wet she suddenly was.  
After a moment, she sat down in her chair, fanning herself with a notebook. Jake gave her a few seconds to cool off, but the moment she tried to lean forward and use her computer to do work again, he once again froze and stimulated her. This time he also pinched and rubbed her nipples through her blouse and bra, although to his pleasant surprise he found that they were already erect.  
Danica fell back into her chair again, biting her lip and squirming with her legs tight together. Again her eyes widened when they rested on Jake’s body as he sat on her desk.  
“Am I… seeing things?” Danica asked quietly.  
Jake smiled and nodded in response, then vanished and teased her slit again, eliciting a suppressed whine from her.  
  
Danica flushed and fanned herself again. Why was she suddenly feeling this way? “Get a hold of yourself, girl,” she said angrily. “Married. Off-limits. And he doesn’t really know you exist that way.”  
But then again, did he? He’d been so nice carrying those papers, and seemed interested in chatting. Danica was almost calmed down, thinking back to the walk to her office, when another flash of pleasure washed over her.  
“Ohgod,” she whispered, gripping the armrests of her chair. She looked up, this time less surprised to see a naked hallucination of Jake standing next to her. “What’s happening to me?”  
Not-Jake smiled down at her, reaching to caress her cheek. His imaginary hand was soft and warm. “You’re just imagining something nice,” he said. “Enjoy it, it won’t last too long.”  
Danica opened her mouth to respond, but Jake - no, Not-Jake - vanished again. She looked around the office again, once more confirming that there was nobody else there. Then, just to be sure, she picked up the phone and dialed Jake’s extension.  
Jake picked up right away. “Stevens here,” he reported. “Hi Danica.”  
Of course. Call display. “H-hi,” she stammered.  
“Something I can do for you?”  
Danica froze. She really had no reason to call him. Then another strange throbbing burst of pleasure radiated out from her nethers.  
“Aaaahnnn no, sorry,” she said, cutting off her moan. “I just… thought I’d left my pen with you. But I just… found it?”  
“Alrighty,” Jake quipped over the phone. “Talk to you later then.”  
“Y-yeah,” Danica replied, setting down the phone and looking over at Not-Jake, who once again stood nude before her. He looked just like she’d imagined, trim and fairly muscular but not intimidatingly so, but that cock… she hadn’t imagined it would be so… so glorious, really. She looked up at him. “You’re in your office.”  
Not-Jake nodded. “I am.”  
“You’re not here.”  
“No,” Not-Jake said, reaching down and undoing the top two buttons of her blouse. Just two, no more. Enough to cool her down again. Then he was behind her, rubbing her shoulders, while her girl-parts sang again in sudden excitement.  
“Aaahmmmnh,” Danica moaned, “y-you need to go away.”  
“Why?” Not-Jake replied, leaning down and kissing her neck. His lips were soft and warm, too. “You always work so hard. Why can’t your subconscious send me to relax you a little?”  
“Because I’m at work,” she protested. “I need to do… work stuff!”  
“Ah, but you told me in the hall that you were going to watch cat videos. Why don’t we cancel that agenda item and tend to an entirely different sort of pussy?”  
Danica blushed, almost painfully. “But what if someone comes in-”  
“Shh,” Not-Jake said. “I’ll stop time.” he snapped his fingers, then gestured to the window. She could see a bird flying outside. Or rather, not flying. It was frozen. “Now we’re all alone, this is happening instantly inside your mind, and you are free to enjoy yourself.”  
Danica stared at the bird and then at Not-Jake. “I… don’t know-”  
There was a shift of vertigo and suddenly Danica was sitting on the edge of her desk. Her hose and panties were down around her ankles and her skirt had been rolled up to expose her hips. Jake knelt before her, face buried between her legs, but she couldn’t tell what he was doing because she was already cumming, gripping at the desk and squirming.  
Jake didn’t stop. Danica could feel his lips and tongue at work on her, and his hands were rubbing along her thighs, holding them in place. “St-stop,” she breathed, “it’s too… much-” Her words were cut off by the crest of another orgasm. He may be imaginary, but jesus, Jake was playing her pussy like a violin!  
Jake stood up as she came down from the high. Or rather, he was suddenly standing. Her legs were free of the confines of her now-vanished hose and panties, and her blouse was completely open. Jake had his hands on her hips, and his cock was so close that she could feel the heat of him on her pussy.  
Danica swallowed. “Are you going to fuck me now?” she asked.  
Jake smiled knowingly at her. “Do you want me to fuck you, Danica?”  
She nodded. “Yes, please.”  
Jake took a little step forward and leaned into her. Danica felt his cock first probing and then spreading the lips of her opening. She looked down and held her breath, watching as it started to slide into her below her little patch if short brown hair.  
Jake moved slowly, but steadily, easing his beautiful cock into her empty passage. Danica pressed her palms to his chest, curling her fingers and digging her nails against the hard flesh there. She felt herself stretching ever deeper, and finally Jake bottomed out within her, with more length to spare. “Jesus christ,” Danica moaned, “It feels so real…”  
Jake smiled down at her. His cock twitched inside her, sending jolts up her lower spine. She realized suddenly that her bra was gone, and one of his hands was caressing her exposed breasts.  
Then Jake pulled back. No, not pulled back. He blinked back instantly, leaving only the head inside her. Danica felt her vagina snap closed around the empty space and gasped in shock, then moaned again as Jake once more slowly eased into her, this time stopping a little deeper as her body shifted things to accommodate his length.  
Danica whimpered as Jake once more shifted instantly back out of her. “Please,” she whispered, wrapping her arms around him, “Please don’t tease me.”  
Jake slid into her a little faster this time, and she wrapped her legs around his waist, trying to trap him inside. “What do you want?” Jake asked gently.  
Danica stared up, suddenly embarrassed again. “Don’t you… know?”  
Jake nodded. “I do. I’m part of you. But we both know you should say it first.”  
Danica bit her lip. “Collar me,” she said quietly. “Please, sir, collar me and make me your bitch.”  
Suddenly, wonderfully, Danica was on her front, bent over her desk. Her pussy was on fire with pleasure as Jake drove his dick into her again and again, no longer teasing. Something was pulling at her neck, and she realized it was a leather dog collar. Jake was holding her leash,tugging it to keep her back arched while he used her.  
  
Jake had been more than a little surprised when Danica had admitted her fantasy. It had certainly been a bizarre highlight of his life to walk to the nearest pet store and bring back a collar in her size. But hell, you never could tell who was and wasn’t kinky, and who was he to judge anyway? He’d been fucking his own daughter, after all.  
Danica started moaning in time to his thrusts, clenching tighter around him. Her thighs were pressed against the sharp edge of the desk in a way that had to hurt, but she made no attempt to push away from it. She gripped at the far edge of the desk, white-knuckled, crying her pleasure as she came again.  
In fact, Jake realized as the hot wet feeling slid down his thighs, she came hard enough to make a mess. He made a note to maybe lay a towel down in future, reaching up and gripping her shoulder with his free hand.  
“Good girl,” he praised her, pounding his hips up against her ass even faster. He could feel her womb starting to give way to him, and his balls were slapping her clit with each thrust.  
Danica made a breathless cooing sound, shivering head to toe in response to his praise. Her pussy clenched down tighter even as her cervix opened to him, sucking his dick deep into her center.  
Jake had meant to pull out and finish Danica off in a more controlled way, but the hot, tight sensation of her gripping him was too much to bear. Yanking back brutally on her shoulder and leash, he groaned and shot his cum into her. Danica squealed in pleasure, grinding back against him.  
Jake remained inside Danica’s pussy for a few moments longer, letting the last of his seed drain into her and keeping her stretched tight around his shaft. He leaned forward and whispered in her ear once more, again calling her a good girl. Then he froze her, slowly easing his cock out of her and inspecting the evidence.  
His thighs and hers were slick with Danica’s juices, but fortunately the floor was still dry. That was easy enough to clean up.  
Unfortunately, evidence of Jake’s presence was also lodged deep inside Danica’s now gaping cunt. Peering inside her and using the light of his phone, Jake was just able to see some of it deep within her. Luckily, that was the only place where it was. By not pulling out, Jake had ensured there was no mess within the reach of any probing fingers. He could only hope she didn’t get too curious and start trying to push out the hot feeling within herself.  
In any case, Jake felt like he’d done a service today. Danica was a nice girl, a little shy, and clearly she had some pretty wild fantasies. Didn’t she deserve the chance to experience them? Definitely. Jake dressed her once more, moving her back into the same position she’d been in before when she’d hung up the phone. He reached for the collar, then stopped.  
Jake left the collar on Danica’s throat, but coiled the leash up in his pocket. Between the leather and her skin, he tucked a note:  
“Danica, you are a very good girl. I may come back to use you again, if you ask nicely and I feel like doing so. Next time you need me, put this collar in your top desk drawer and then tell Jake something about cats. Love, kisses and spanks. -Your subconscious.”  
Because really, didn’t everyone deserve to live their fantasies sometimes?

With that in mind, I'm looking for a tech-savvy intern with the usual research and writing skills, preferably having already taken business/corporations. The work is all remote, unpaid and tragically not glamorous. 

If you or someone you know might be interested, DM me for details. Thanks."

I'm a college student on the East Coast. I just got my project assignment for an upcoming internship and learned that I'll be working on a large Java codebase. I'm interested in startups and modern stacks and am extremely disappointed by this. Java was my first programming language and I find it tedious and verbose.

Should I downplay the fact that I'm working in Java on my resume? I'm worried that startups will see me as out-of-touch with new tech. I'll try to work on projects in non-Java things over the summer, but it would be nice to have professional experience in something non-outdated.

Thanks!"

Help me decide which master to choose.,Yeikoff,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/3501fs/master_program_advice_help_me_decide_which_master/,"Hello everyone! I am finishing my bachelor's degree in Economics in Spain and have been accepted into this 2 master programmes:

Universidad Carlos III Madrid, Master in Big Data
http://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/Postgrado/en/Detalle/Estudio_C/1418713500746/1371208956904/Master_in_Big_Data_Analytics

University of Amsterdam: Master in Econometrics.
http://ase.uva.nl/education/master-s-programmes/content2/study-programme/study-programme.html

I find both programmes very appealing. The Dutch program focuses in the aspects of Economics that I like the most, Econometrics and Microeconomics. It also gives me an entry point to get an internship or something in the Netherlands or some neighboring country. This would provide some valuable points in my CV, and eventually help me get a job. This is important, as I feel that if I stay in Spain I will be an intern forever, and move out of my parents house when I am 45. (There is 50% youth unemployment in Spain, and NOBODY is hiring)
However, Dutch bachelor's degrees are 3 years, and Spanish ones are 4. I am somewhat afraid that this master would end up being something like my second 4th year.

The master in Madrid is provided by the same uni as I am getting my Bachelor's, but by the engineering school. I feel like I am gonna learn more here. While I think I have a solid Stats knowledge, this program goes into stuff I have had no contact with. Other positive side is that it is taught by an engineering school. Here in Spain, that is supposed to give you super powers or something.

I would love to hear your oppinions on any of those programs, from whatever perspective you have. I would specially appreciate any comments from people experienced with Dutch education.
If you have read this far, thanks a lot for doing so! I really appreciate you taking your time to help me.

TL;DR: I have been admited to 2 different master programmes. Links are above. I would like to hear your comments on them.

3504ek,7,2015-05-05,Trying to find a new public accounting job - worried about what I learned at my firm,Muckminster,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3504ek/trying_to_find_a_new_public_accounting_job/,"I've been working at a CPA firm since I graduated last May.  I've been working on audits, reviews, and taxes along with bookkeeping and payroll assignments.

I'm the only person here (of a staff of about 15) who has worked for another CPA firm (and that was just as a tax intern).  The partner started out in industry working under a CPA to get her license. Our sense of ethics and the staff competency level is appalling, it feels like every day I’m shocked by something that happens.  Among the highlights: 

* Clients were encouraged not to report cash income if no 1099 was issued
* A return was knowingly amended with false numbers to overreport income to try to help a client qualify for a bank loan
* Other staff members' PTINs were used to prepare and file returns.  My PTIN is on several earned income credit tax returns that do not have supporting documentation.  Some of the PTINs used were for staff that no longer work at the firm.  The partner refuses to put her PTIN on anything because she says if the client gets audited she can’t represent them if her PTIN is on the return.
* We just finished a review engagement for a construction company.  Nobody knew how the percentage of completion method for construction contracts worked.  The reviewer and partner did not care to learn and just signed off on my work.
* I was put in charge of an audit for a non-profit organization with almost no guidance or support.  Nothing I did was reviewed until I had the audit report finalized.
* I was in charge of doing the final tax return reviews on relatively complex returns prepared by staff members hired just before tax season.
* The partner's tax planning skills were so bad she thought a partnership could own S-Corporation shares.  This caused the S-Corp to lose their S-corp status.  
* The partner thought up and implemented illegitimate tax strategies like converting a company to accrual basis, starting a second company with the same owners as cash basis, and transferring money between the companies at year end.  The idea was the accrual basis company could deduct everything paid to the cash company in year X4, and the cash basis company wouldn't have to report it as income until X5.
* Numerous election forms were filed wrong in prior years, leading to a lot of rejected S-Corp tax returns during tax season.
* Some employees were told by the partner to book all meals and entertainment expenses as travel expenses to get around the 50% deductibility rule.
* Numerous business tax returns were prepared that did not match up to financial statements.  Things like bank balances on the financial statements we supposedly used to prepare the tax return didn’t match to the tax return, and there was no way to figure out how or why there were book tax differences because nothing was documented.


I actually like the people I work with a lot, but this is a terrible place to develop accounting skills and I am convinced that it’s only a matter of time before the firm finds itself in serious trouble.  I’m about to start the interviewing process, and am looking at other opportunities as well.  A few questions:

* I’m worried I’m going to have to relearn a lot of things from scratch if I start a new public accounting job.  Our tax processes don’t match up at all with the firm I interned at, and I’m guessing other firms do not audit like we do.  How concerned about this should I be?  
* How do I explain my reasons for leaving after just a year in interviews?  I don’t think revealing anything above or badmouthing the firm is a good idea, should I just say it wasn’t a good fit?
* A lot of CPA firms seem to be looking for people with 2-5 years experience.  Is there any point in applying to these positions?"
35064j,4,2015-05-05,27 [M4F] - The Black Tie Affair,ej165941,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/35064j/27_m4f_the_black_tie_affair/,"“...With your help, we’ll be able to get this country back on track....”

It was my mentor that told me to try a new lines with the black tie crowds first. If the big donors approve then the small donors will follow on the campaign trail. This is the only reason that a speech writer like me is at this party but I’ve been told that I need to get out of the office more. A man can only stare at his computer and guzzle insane amounts of coffee so many times before he loses it and flips out during a senior staff meeting. But, hey, it’s an excuse to enjoy free champagne and and look good in a tuxedo.

Looking around, I see the usual faces of the senator’s entourage. It’s the same song and dance - Senior staffers love to work the crowd in the hopes of squeezing a few more dollars out of a donor while the junior staffers drop names in the hopes of hooking up with someone out of their league. I’m just here to make sure my speech worked and how I can craft it for the next campaign stop. I should mingle just a bit so I don’t get torn into by the campaign manager. 

I raise my glass as I pass a crowd of people. “I hope you’re enjoying yourself,” I say with some faux-enthusiasm, “It’s always nice to see our supporters and I hope you’ll stay without throughout the campaign”. Making my way through the crowd, I’ve noticed we snuck in some of our interns to pad the crowd. They seem eager to be here but nervous. I should probably try to instill some confidence in them.  

“Guys, don’t worry.” I say as I walk up to them, “it’s not like you’ll lose the election by saying the wrong thing.” I can see them perk up and break away with their new sense of confidence. I understand their plight, it’s not easy being young and in the midst of political elite. You have to put on your best face or your written off as a nobody. 

Walking past a few more people, I make my way to the bar and order a champagne. I really should be at the office and working on our remarks for the next policy roll out. As I’m trying to figure out a way to make changes in tax policy sound interesting to the average voter, I’m interrupted by the a soft sounding voice. 

“You don’t go to many of these, do you?” 

With those words, I’m suddenly facing an introduction with a new face. Brown eyes, brown hair, and a smile that I swear brightens up the room. Her figure is complimented by the traditional little black dress that you see at events like these. Her voice is sweet and comforting with an accent that places her somewhere in the midwest. She’s tall but is wearing heels so I can’t give a proper guess on her height. I’d be remiss if I didn’t say she was stunning. 

“Sorry, I heard you talking with those kids a few minutes ago,” she says before ordering a drink “Are you with the campaign?”

“Yes” I respond before realizing she thinks I’m just an intern “I have some fancy title that I can’t remember but, mostly, I’m one of the lead speech writers”
“You seem quite young for that” she retorts before taking a sip of her champagne, “Sure you’re not some campaign eye candy?”

That was unexpected and I’m at a loss for words - a bad sign for someone that deals with words for a living. I had to have imagined that. The question that pops into my head is this - ‘Is she flirting with me?’ 

She must be a mind reader since the silence is quickly broken. “I’m teasing you” is the quick response to my befuddlement. “You seemed like you needed company so I came over. Would you like to join me on the balcony?” 

“There’s a balcony here!?” was the first words that pop out of my head. I’m not going to lie, I’m not smooth with the ladies. Call it a the punishment for moving quickly in the political realm. It’s not often that a man is his late twenties writes for a presidential candidate. My excitement at the new venue must have done something because she was laughing 

“Good thing you don’t work for security” She snorted “Are you sure you work for the campaign?” She grabs my hand and begins to lead me to the balcony door. Upon arrival, we discover it’s empty save for the secret service agent that acknowledges our presence. Off in the distance, a silhouette of the Washington Monument is visible with the light of the full moon. 

I should have offered some protest but I don’t care at the moment. I don’t get to escape the drudgery of my work so this is comforting to meet with someone not asking about policy changes or wording to speeches. If anything, I have a story for the office tomorrow. 

There is just one problem and I must find the solution quickly. I have no idea who this woman is. She could be a reporter, from the opposition, anything. If I’m caught with the wrong person then my career is sunk. The words weakly leave my mouth as we lean at the balcony banister. 

“I’m sorry, but, I didn’t catch your name...”

Another prompt I enjoyed writing and I hope to enjoy RP'ing. I'm keeping it fun and flirty with this but the adventure is coming up with a good story. Aside from the description, I'm leaving character development up to you. 

Let's have fun with this one!"

My name is Emily and I have three beautiful children and amazing life partner, Willliam. I have dedicated the past 7 years of my life to attending college full-time while Will stays home to take care of our children. 

I am finally graduating with my Master's in Nutrition Education from CSU, Chico and plan to begin a dietetic internship program in August so I can become a Registered Dietitian. It is my dream to become a Clinical RD. I am also very passionate about the WIC program. It would be great to work with those families!

In one year I can be eligible to finally become a RD and get my dream job. However, as you may have guessed, finanaces are extremely tight. So tight that I don't know how I will pay any bill except for rent. I don't even know how I am going to pay for the internship. Starting in August I am expected to work 40 hour weeks (and when I say ""work"" I mean pay them to receive experience) for 9 months straight. I will not be able to make an income and neither will William. I have to complete this internship to become a RD, but it is looking impossible without the money.

 My parents are very loving and emotionally supportive, but they are in no position to support me financially.  My children are my world and I just want to do right for them. They are the only reason I have stayed motivated to get through school for as many years as I have. I do not want to let it go to waste and let them down. 

I am humbly asking for financial support to get my family through this one last year before I can get my dream job. I promise to do my best as a RD and to serve my community well while taking good care of every patient that I see. 

Thank you, 
Emily

I know this might sound like your typical 'how do I learn to code' post. However, I am CS major finishing my junior year and will be starting a software internship at the end of the month, so I do know some stuff. The internship will probably be some sort of front end development -- sorry, I can't be more specific because even I don't know what I'll be doing yet.

The problem is I didn't take any CS classes last semester, and the semester before I only took theory-based CS classes. So essentially I haven't coded for almost an entire year now. I've never been the type that programs outside of classes because I've simply never been interested in doing my own projects. I know, I'm the worst type of CS major.

I need help with suggestions on what I can read about, tutorials I can do, languages to learn, programs to write -- basically anything I can do so I'm not so rusty. I only have 3 weeks and want to cover breadth rather than depth, so I'd prefer to avoid the obvious suggestion: think about something I'd like to make and just make it. I don't have the time for it, and it doesn't fit what I'm trying to do here. To be honest I don't know too much for a rising senior CS major. I know some python, some C++, some Java, some C, some Objective-C. Not much else, and I'm not really proficient in anything.

Should I focus on the stuff I learn in school, like data structures, sorting/searching algorithms, how to write good code, etc? Or should I just practice writing code in a specific language or two? Maybe both?

I'd really appreciate input from people working in software companies who take in interns and wish they would be more prepared in area x or area y."

What should I do?,iamnotarnold,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/350a5o/accidentally_overheard_a_job_offer_at_work_to_a/,"I was at my desk today working when my coworker - let's call him **Jacob** - the hiring manager for the position that sits in the cubicle behind me was on the phone with a job candidate - call him **Aubrey** - they intended to hire. It was not my intention to overhear the conversation as I was just sitting at my desk, but Jacob wasn't speaking quietly on the phone when he offered Aubrey the salary for the position.

Aubrey just graduated from college this past month and only has internship experience. He has the same degree I do from the same university. I was just out of school when I started with the company as well. I have been with the company now for a year and 8 months. Aubrey will be making 22%+ more than me right from the start. I started in another position in the same department when I came onboard.

My question is, what should I do at this point? I feel very negatively about the company right now, so I am tempted to look for another job. I want to bring it to my manager's - let's call her **Ashley** - attention (though Ashley is not Jacob's boss) that I overheard Jacob's conversation with Aubrey and believe Jacob should be reprimanded in some way for taking a call like that from his desk where others could hear. 

I also would like to have a conversation about getting a raise based on the work I do.
I just had an informal review on my performance with Ashley this past Friday, and she had nothing but good things to say about what I am doing.

I was held in a temp position for a year and 3 months when the company initially told me 3 months. From there, I was to be brought on permanently. I have been in my position now since December and was not really given a review and given a small raise when permanently hired.
    
Overall, I am happy where I am with the work I do and my coworkers and don't want to rock the boat, but this is just eating at me now. What would be my best option?

Without giving too much personal information, I graduated at an US university with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I got accepted into a masters in Computer Science at an European university.  

The thing is am not european or american, I am doing both as an international student. This fact made it very difficult for me to find any internships in the US because in the Midwest companies didn't seem to receptive to me. Not only that but frankly I was struggling with many things, adapting to life alone, culture, etc...All my energy went into being focused on classwork and little on internships.

In the end I was able to graduate with a 3.3 GPA but was so burned out from all of it that I decided to take a semester between undergrad and graduate school off, but now I wonder if I was right to do that.

I just wonder what I should be doing to be certain I can get a job, specially in Europe. The problem again is no citizenship, meaning a lot of places are not keen on hiring me (even tho doing so IS legal - I can work for a year after finishing my studies).

Also, going back to my country is not a huge attractive option. My country has high crime, low quality of life. I have been studying abroad in order to have a better life for myself. My gf is foreign but It sounds silly to me to marry for a visa. I would like to achieve something on my own.

Hello, from Puerto Rico. 

My friends and I have been close with Luis [21M] since High School. He’s a kind, polite guy who’s exceptional at certain areas of science but near oblivious when it comes to people and social situations.  Luis has never been diagnosed, but we (friends, teachers, professors) believe he’s on the spectrum of Autism. He still lives with his parents and is financially dependent on them while completing his bachelor’s. As a teacher’s aid, he gets a small paycheck. 

3 years ago, Luis met Stacy [19F] from Florida online and started e-dating. She ~~is white trailer trash~~ comes from a poor and unstable family, has been in foster care and did not finish High School. 10 months ago, she moved here to live with Luis. 

Luis and co. are now my neighbors (apt building next door) so the gang has gotten to know Stacy over time… and despite her generally polite demeanor, we conclude that she is no good for him.  

* Luis’ bilingual parents willingly took Stacy in, but she has no interest in learning Spanish and/or getting any sort of job here. Or finishing High School. She’s waiting for Luis to get a job so they can “start their life already”. 

* Everytime we all hang out – at the mall, watching movies or playing games at my apt – Stacy makes little effort to engage with us (though we try with her) and posts FB statuses about “someone” being “rude”. 

* Luis has trouble making friends. Every time he so much as mentions a female she gets jealous and posts things on FB about “keeping her man” and “sluts and whores”. 

* Luis took fewer classes this semester because he “wasn’t spending enough time” with Stacy. He has zero extra-curricular activities. He was also recently offered an internship at NASA, but put it on hold and has given indirect statements that it was due to feeling guilty about leaving Stacy “alone” here. She has also mentioned how she doesn’t want him to go and die in space… 

* On FB this month, Stacy publicly claimed to be pregnant but also mentioned negative pregnancy tests. Upon news of a possible pregnancy, the gang finally decided to sit Luis down and talk to him – but every time we called, she’d answer and say he was busy.

* Last week, I left him a message saying I wanted to talk in private. Stacy answered with an invite (him, her, and me) to the mall on Friday. I said I wasn’t feeling up for hanging at the mall but would like to talk to him for a bit. She replied: “Sorry bro, I barely get to see him and I live with him. And Friday is our date night. You can either come over here and talk to him or wait until next week”.

* With that, we went to his apt and brought him over to talk. All we talked about was that we were concerned about how he was going to provide for a possible baby and then we asked how he felt about it. He said he’d like to have kids with her, but wasn’t ready. We expressed support no matter what and he went back home. No bad talk about Stacy whatsoever. The next day, Stacy erased us all from FB (including mutual friends that are 100% unaware of what’s happening). She posted a quote from my friend Daisy, “I didn’t invite Stacy because I don’t know her very well”, obviously taken from Luis’ recounting of the group talk.  

* While looking for another friend by the same name, Daisy accidentally interacted with THIS Stacy online. Now she’s sending messages to Daisy about “stalkers and insecure women” and how I am a flaky friend for waiting so long to talk to Luis. 

The “indirect” jabs keep coming and Luis has done nothing for or against. But we don’t expect him to be able to deal with this, we’re just worried he’ll drop his potentially bright future to “care” for this ... bitch.  


   
**tl;dr**: My somewhat Autistic [21M] friend took his girlfriend[19] in. She’s dependent on him, he’s dependent on his parents. She’s been controlling, jealous, passive-aggressive and is possibly trying to get pregnant so they can “start a life already”. She might persuade him to drop his studies and a potential career in order to provide for their family. My friends and I don’t want it to come to that. What can we do if anything? "

When first started studying CS I was excited about it, but in the past couple of years I've realized that it'll never be my passion again. I still want to be great at what I do, but I won't be spending my free time coding, that's for sure.

I've lived in this country for almost all my life (I lived in the US as a kid for a short while and then came back). So pretty much all of my education has been here. I speak, additionally to my native language, English and German fluently (and a couple of other languages but not fluently enough to warrant a mention).

Anyway, I read this sub quite frequently and I always see posts of recent grads asking if they should take the 100k or the 80k USD job, or how their CV should look, or asking about internships. None of that is a reality here, and while it's fun to live vicariously, it's starting to affect me negatively.

I have about 2 years of experience (in mostly web development) and I was a TA in school for compiler and computer architecture classes, so I like to think I'm a well-rounded developer. I currently work from home for a company that's located in the first world and I get paid what I would earn by working for a local company, i.e. I'm not even close to hitting 50k a year.

Lately I've been starting to feel very bad about the hours I work and the money I make. Where my career is headed and what I can do about it... I'm really starting to think this subreddit is painting me a picture of something I can't reach.

Should I be shooting to get to a first world country? Is keeping my remote job a good choice? Are there any other third-world developers here who would like to share their experience?

At this point I'm just rambling so I'm just gonna stop writing."

Hi

I had my first internship last summer in Illinois.  I am not a resident of Illinois, I just had an apartment for the summer.  I am a resident of Iowa, but I go to school in Missouri.  So I had no idea which state tax forms that I should do.  I opted for just filing an Illinois tax return.  I was only going to get $5 back so it seemed pointless.

Then I heard that because I was a resident of IA, they have this agreement:

https://tax.iowa.gov/iowa-illinois-reciprocal-agreement

Basically it says that all wages earned in Illinois can be treated as wages earned in Iowa, or at least I think that is what it means.

While I was in Illinois, I was having income withheld from me at the Illinois rates, which I believe are higher than Iowa.  So if I filled out this form, would I get more back?

Would it be worth it to go back and do it this way?"

350yax,1,2015-05-06,High School senior staring at 100k in future student loan debt. I have a rough plan but am looking for advice/wisdom.,Dward16,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/350yax/high_school_senior_staring_at_100k_in_future/,"Hi PF. After getting rejected :( by some of the more elite universities out there that promise better financial aid for families like mine, I'm left with making the best out of my in-state school UCONN (University of Connecticut). WARNING: Long post incoming!!! (sorry about that) 

UCONN estimates their total cost of attendance for one year to be $30k and has offered me $5k in merit grants, and the rest in federal loans. So with $100k worth of debt looming on the horizon, I'm now looking for strategies to (1.) minimize my dependance on loans while in college, and (2.) get a feel for how sizable student loan debt might affect some of my life decisions post-bachelors degree. 

1 = Reduce financial dependance on loans while at college. Some things I've considered but am seeking advice/experience with: 

Getting a part-time job: I'll be an economics major most-likely (also considering math/comp sci however). I'd like to intern in investment banking for a summer or two, but don't know if I'll break in to the industry due to networking unpredictability and my school. Any other econ/business jobs (non-marketing) out there for college kids that pay reasonably, and look impressive on a resume? If I don't do computer science, I've also been looking into taking a summer or semester off to do a coding bootcamp. That way I'd be able to freelance during and after college. Also wondering if things like being an RA later down the road are worth it, or other on campus vs off campus jobs.

Scholarships: Have any of you had success with private scholarships? I've applied to a bunch as a senior, and I know its better to seek out niches, but I don't have high hopes for most. Any types of scholarships that I should look out for in college? I don't have any hooks besides that I have traveled a lot, and started a couple of small business ventures.

Federal Pell Grant eligibility: I know they reevaluate every year. I wasn't offered anything this year, but I know about 5% of awards went out to families with incomes of &gt;$50k. Anything I can do here to maximize eligibility for next year?  

Transferring: UCONN was my last choice so I'm still holding on to the possibility that I transfer to a top 25 school. I imagine if this option works out it wouldn't happen until after sophomore year. Does anybody have experience with financial aid after transferring? My family is in the less than $75k income bracket, so ideally we're talking Penn, Duke, Dartmouth. Others, depending a lot more on aid, could be Georgetown, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, Boston College. I'm not currently considering community college as a long term option unless something disastrous financially happens.


2 = Coping with debt after college. Scenarios range from, if I take out $100k I'd be paying ~$1,100/month for 10 years and I'd pay back $140k, to the hopeful of, if I take out closer to $50k I'd be paying ~$550/month for 10 years and pay back $70k in total. This in mind, a few things I've considered doing after my undergrad; 

MBA/Graduate degree: I definitely have a future MBA in mind. I've heard some companies sponsor MBA's in exchange for several years with the company. Is this an uncommon type of offer? How long have some of you had to wait because of debt before doing graduate work?

Starting a business: I'm an entrepreneur at heart, so I know I'll have plenty of ideas/motivation/potential partners/ramen-noodle-budgeting experience, coming out of college. Bootstrapping would probably be key here, but I'd love to hear any stories if you guys have had experience with starting a business while under student loan debt pressure.

And in general, I am wondering of other significant ways debt will affect me after college? I see myself renting in big cities rather than buying until after graduate school + stable career. I also don't see myself marrying young or starting a family at least not before I'm 30 (but who knows). If the finances don't look good the first 5-10 years out of college, I understand that means practicing frugality, and I'll get a taste of that in college. 


Anyways, thanks for reading this far! Feel free to comment on whatever you'd like. Any advice and especially experience related to student loan debt will be appreciated. :)

We have ended every single day with, at least, a phone call before bed and an ""I love you.""

I connected with this girl, we'll call her Kathleen, like no one that I ever have before.  She challenged me in all the ways that I love.  I can honestly say that being around her has enriched me - made me a person more sensitive to other, improved my sense of morality, and changed my definition of love forever.  

Things got serious fairly quickly.  Within a few months, we began to discuss the possibility of a long-term future together.  I am about to enter a 1-year master's program and she is entering her gap year for medical school.  In recent months, the prospect of marriage (eventually) became a very real possibility for us - and that was scary for the both of us.  We had intended to move in together once I graduated with my MA and she entered medical school.  

Cut to perhaps just a few weeks ago and she proposed the idea of moving to the city where my school is to spend her gap year.  This would be dependent upon whether or not she could find work there, however.  She does not have the means to split an apartment without a job of some sort.  I will be spending this summer at an internship in a city about the same distance from her as the one that I am currently in.  She will be taking classes in the late summer session at her university to finish up her prerequisites, so this would have put us both out of our summer plans for the fall semester. 

She had been entertaining the possibility of working as a research data collector at her university during the summer while she was in school.  So here's where things started to go downhill, and I apologize in advance because it might not make much sense.  She was given the job (to her surprise) and she indicated to me that it would be a year long position - meaning she would not be considering moving in with me at school.  While I didn't necessarily have a problem with this, I was somewhat taken aback because I thought there was a strong possibility of us moving in together.

She realized that I had reacted strangely to her announcement...which I felt guilty about.  I told her that I thought she was considering moving in with me while I finished my master's degree.  At this point she began to talk about how she needed to do what was most convenient for her and that this wasn't a time that she could pass on career opportunities (things that might help her interview process for medical school / residency positions later on).  At the time, I was okay with this.  We went to bed at ease with each other.

However, the next day I had a strange feeling about me that I couldn't quite put a finger on.  As I discussed the situation with my friend, I began to realize that I had a concern that I would soon be making compromises if I wanted our relationship to continue.  This is to say, once I graduate with my master's degree, I would need to move to wherever she gets accepted to medical school.  I absolutely wanted to do this because this was the girl that I envisioned spending the rest of my life with.  My concern was that she might not be willing to make the same compromise that I would soon be making if the tables were turned. 

I thought long and hard about this.  I ended up asking her what she would do if the tables we turned.  She had the choice of either following me to medical school (a place that work would be available) or capitalizing on some other career opportunity that would be better for her, but much further away.  When she began to favor the idea of moving away...I began to panic somewhat.  I have reached a position where I am comfortable making reasonable sacrifices in order to have a future with her.  I feel that if she weren't willing to make the same sacrifices for me, then our relationship is out of balance in some way.  

Upon discussing this more and more with her, we simply reached an impasse.  She essentially said that her past experiences prevent her from committing to a relationship that might risk her career opportunities.  While I understand her position, I simply think that there must be faith in serious, forward-looking relationships.  I decided that I could not be with someone that would not do the same things for me that I would be doing for them.

I'm devastated. So is she.  Did I overreact? 



   
tl;dr: Met a girl, she was great.  Things got serious, but she indicated that she couldn't commit to a relationship fully.  She would choose her career over me rather than trying to compromise between the two.  I broke up with her...my heart hurts.  "

Due to my current job (part-time) and location I’m look for remote only.

I’m looking for an internship or junior position over freelancing because I find working with a team more engaging and productive compared to working by myself.  As an intern or junior I’d expect to be able to contribute, while also continuing to learn. I believe that with modern tools a remote developers can work together just as well as developers in the same building, and I hope to find a position with a company that embraces this idea.

Most of the time I spend in either the Middle East or the UK, but I am always up late so I can also work teams in the USA, especially if they are in Central or Eastern time zones. Basically I'm able to adapt to any reasonable timezone.

I have about one year experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I am also familiar with tools such as git, npm, bower, gulp, and yeoman.  Also, I’ve experimented with front-end frameworks, mostly KnockoutJS and Angular. I feel I’m actually quite knowledgeable about Angular, and I enjoy using it. Lastly, I do have some knowledge of PHP, Laravel, and Wordpress. I’m not as productive in this with these tools, but I can read backend code, and even pitch when needed.

Lastly I’m a good writer and communicator.  I’m coming for a field that is very customer service oriented, so I’ve been able to refine my soft skills over the years.

I'm trying to create 3D models for Tekla so only some of these attributes are relevant to me. The intern before me was doing this manually. My issue is that there are 10 files and each file is over 100MB large. I'm not interested in wasting a significant portion of my existence sifting through over 1 million lines of code. Here's a basic setup of each Product entry in the Xml file.

      &lt;Product ID=""productID"" UserTypeID=""USERTYPE""&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;PRODUCT NAME&lt;/Name&gt;
          &lt;ClassificationReference ClassificationID="" CLASSIFICATION_PARKING"" Type=""LINK_TYPE_CLASSIFICATION_SYSTEM""/&gt;

          &lt;Value AttributeID=""CHA_STREETPRICE_STD_NETAMOUNT""&gt;0.00&lt;/Value&gt;
          &lt;Value AttributeID=""CHA_SAP_MATMAS_WERKS""&gt;0000&lt;/Value&gt;

        &lt;/Values&gt;
      &lt;/Product&gt;
    
 I've only just discovered LINQ but I think it might be able to help me here. My problem is I only seem to know the basics of LINQ and XML. I've got a basic approach in my head but I'm not quite sure how to write the queries.
Here's what I'm thinking:

- I only need products of certain **USERTYPE** so I'd ignore all **Product** Elements without that **USERTYPE**

- Then I'd like to extract the Product attributes ""**ID**"" and **""USERTYPE**"" together with the **""Name**"" Node.

- Then extract the Values in the **Values** Node based on the **attributeID**. I don't want all attributes just some.

- Write to a text file on a single line.

However, I've stumbled at the first step. I've got this query: 
 
    
    // find Products with USERTYPE ""PRD""    

      static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;GetKeyWordNames(string file)
                {
                    return XDocument.Load(file)
                        .Descendants(""Product"")
                        .Attributes(""ID"")      // how do you write a query to select multiple attributes
                        .Select(attr =&gt; attr.Value)
                        .ToList();
                }    

So my questions in short are: 

- How do I query multiple attributes and only select a product based on attribute type?
- How do I query **Values** nodes based on **AttributeID**. Is **Values** a descendant of **Product** or an innerNode?
- How do I stored said results.



**TL:DR: Please save me from a life reduced to CTRL+F and excel.** 

Edit: Made a change to close out **Values**

Her nail on a chalkboard vocals caused me to be cross with a young nurse. I was upset because I had informed all the nurses that one of them must be near Mrs. Hammonds room at all times to ensure that the other patients, and employees of the hospital don't have to deal with one old ladies short comings. Sadly the nurses are unreliable on this matter. The burn units is our most ignored unit, and it's due almost entirely to the annoyance, and frustration that comes with trying to help someone you can't touch.

Dr. Conroy stopped me in the hall as I've come to expect of him any time I should happen to be walking with in his range of view. As annoying as I find, Conroys over saturated charisma he does seem to think I'm worthy of admiration. Which I find to be a redeemable quality. 
Conroy informed me that Mr. Zimmer, a former patient of mine hasn't been seen for 3 days. Conroy made a rather obscene remark saying, and I quote ""Maybe we got lucky, and he went snorkeling alone this time."" 
He was of course referring to Mr. Zimmers encounter with a tiger shark only three months ago which resulted in the loss of his right arm. I chuckled, and agreed with Conroy. 

Zimmer handled being an amputee with an absolute lack of grace. He was pathetically reliant on the nurses for even the most one handed of tasks. There were even allegations he had begged one of the younger nurses for masturbatory assistance. claiming that he was incapable because he had been right handed. 
I shared that story with Conroy which got a sincere, but obnoxious laugh out of him. 

An eavesdropping nurse commented on how that was my third missing patient in four years. Jocularly claiming I was cursed, and asking doctor Conroy to work on her should she ever be hospitalized. 

Doctor Conroy made a defensive statement praising my reputation, and skill set. Saying he'd have me work on his own children before himself. 

I retorted to the nurse by saying ""while I don't believe in curses I also scarcely believe in coincidence, but I say that to say only that it isn't that coincidental. 
I'm certain you'd concede to the fact that all of those patients received hair cuts with some regularity. It's a somewhat small town id be willing to wager at least two of them have had their hair cut by the same beautician. Is it perhaps that the sheers used by that beautician are possessed by an evil spirit that kidnaps the clients whose hair it most fancies, or is it the much more probable deduction that missing people are just like anyone else, and have had encounters with many people before they went missing?""

Conroy actually answered my question by saying ""obviously it's just more common than one would think."" As if my question wasn't entirely rhetorical. 
The nurse had lost focus somewhere in my explanation, and responded with this very generic sentence ""You doctors are all so crazy!"" 

I smiled politely, wished Dr. Conroy luck with Mrs. Hammond, and was on my way. 

Conroy replied as I walked away ""I'm not sure luck can help. Her burns are so severe we've been unable to place an arterial catheter so we don't even have a heart monitor, and she's only been able to take drugs orally. She's a breathing miracle, or disaster depending on how you look at it.""

I found Conroys last sentence interesting.

My shift is off to a most exciting start! As I was making my rounds I heard the unmistakable horrid sounds that could only come from Mrs. Hammonds old dry throat. No nurses had noticed the pained consistent, coughs, but coughs are common in a hospital, and nightshift nurses rely almost solely on heartbeat monitors to determine emergencies being that most patients are asleep as they should be. I entered Mrs. Hammonds room, and closed the door behind me. She was asleep, but her brain was fighting a failing fight to clear her throat of what was likely a piece of her own wicked charred tongue. A far too painless way to go for such a wretched women in my assessment, but her entire body was raw disgusting, and absent of skin. She looked as if she had used a box jelly fish as body wash. The idea of touching her disgusted me so I was content just watching her choke. I was smiling so intensely as I watched that my teeth still hurt as I'm writing this account of the events. Each cough was a failure for her throat to clear space for air, and each cough was a victory for the halls of my hospital finally being clear of this screeching bat. When suddenly the bitch coughs up whatever she was choking on! She sits up holding her throat with her eyes now agape. I wouldn't dare risk her throat healing. I grabbed her pillow out from under her, and covered her face. She couldn't quite scream, and her ""fight"", or rather lack there of was easily controlled. Very little pressure was enough to cease her movements, and not leave any indication of harm. I bent over close to the pillow, and sang ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away, but a house fire ensures I'm gonna stay!

I had to lift her scab covered head to put the pillow back under her. I regret that truly because I don't think anyone would have had a second thought about it. They just would have assumed it fell on the floor as she choked. 

In my official report, and to my colleagues I explained that I rushed to help her, but by the time I got to her door she had already stopped coughing.  All of my attempts to help failed.

I stopped and searched for on demand jobs in my country, as expected they all  wanted  ASP.net Webforms, SQL server 2005 or J2EE developer, and of course with 3 -5 year experience.

then I went looking for remote jobs regarding Node  and different

Is That it ?, I'm practically screwed.

I keep reading blogs about people who changed careers and became developers and managed to become professional developers through internships.

Even my developing country is worst of developing country, I read about girl in Jordan who only learned HTML &amp; CSS and got internship in Google (to rub salt on the wound, she mentions that she failed interview at intel IT department because she didn't know Javascript).

even when I tried to look for freelancing in odesk and freelancer, I found Indian companies undercut all the competition.

Transcript from ""The Dreamweave Proposal,"" by Professor Lakshik 234.1 at the 43th Annual Grand Topics Summit. A revolutionary proposal that, despite protests and moral objections, went through to create the Dreamweave, one of the most powerful and impactful creations the world has ever seen.

&gt;Good morning everyone. I humbly come before you, Chancellors, Professors, students, to propose something that can revolutionize the world. 

&gt;I admit, this is not something that I do easily. I understand the moral implications of such action. I wonder myself if what I am doing is right. But I strongly believe that creating the Dreamweave is something that can greatly benefit our world. It will forever change how we view information and access it. I know I am not the only one that has devised such an idea. Colleagues and friends of mine have been debating on whether or not the Dreamweave should ever be made. 
I have been selected to be the voice.

&gt;When Professor Thas Poltren announced the discovery of the Dreamspace, it shocked our world. We had never ever seen anything like it before. What does it all mean? Have we really successfully found the mind and soul of thought-beings? How can we use this knowledge to better our world? The efforts of many fellow Dreamtechs has been a long road. We've come up with new ways to approach psychiatry. We've developed drugs that allow people to explore their minds and dreams, even sharing them in special cases. Our universal equation is looking more and more complete each day. Of course, we should remain humble, our world is much bigger and grander than we could ever imagine. We should not falter in our quest for understanding.

&gt;Which brings me to my friend sitting on the stage. He is a young male human. We call him Sullen. 

&gt;Sullen is an orphan. We have never met his parents and neither has he. He is what we call ""gifted."" Sullen, can you please recite the 1000th digit of pi?

&gt;Sullen: ""Nine.""

&gt;Okay, harder question. What is the 314th number of pi?

&gt;Sullen: ""One.""

&gt;Thank you, Sullen. He is not only capable of reciting hundreds of thousands of digits of pi, but every information we give him is immediately catalogued into his mind. He knows every information we place in front of his eyes. Would someone like to tell him a short story as a test?

&gt;[Removed by request of speaker]

&gt;Now, Sullen, what is the 45th word in that story?

&gt;Sullen: ""Of.""

&gt;Thank you, Sullen. Now, do you have a favourite colour?

&gt;Sullen: ""...I do not.""

&gt;As you can see, Sullen has unbelievable information retention, but little in the way of everything else. He is a savant. He cannot even dress or wash his face. In the outside world, I believe he would have perished long ago. However, I propose an idea that can give him a place in society. And not just a simple place, but one that is fundamental to the way we view the world.

&gt;When we, as individuals, go into the Dreamspace, there are two main components that make up our mind. The is the Avatar, and there is the Omnitar. The Avatar is almost always the strongest and dominant force in the average thought-being. The Avatar is the consciousness, the feelings, the thoughts. When I wander through my own memories in my own personal Dreamspace, I use my Avatar to access hard to remember moments, to find facts I may have misplaced. The Omnitar is the construct that manifests around the avatar. It is our memories and facts. It is the world that we see around us. Our Avatar does have control over the Omnitar, it allows us to control our mental worlds and act almost god-like in our Dreamspaces. 

&gt;Unfortunately, Sullen suffers from a very small Avatar. He has one, but it is almost negligible and practically non-existent. We've tried to grow his Avatar to that of a normal thought-being, but have only grown his Omnitar instead. It is why his information density has grown from impressive to absurd. His Omnitar is many times our own. When tested, we discovered it expanded well beyond our comprehension. The information stored is simply beyond belief. It is effectively another world.

&gt;Sullen is not alone. We and other colleagues have others like him. All have expansive Omnitars that eclipse any of our own. 

&gt;My proposal is that turn them into what I call Servers, then form an information hub like never before. It will allow us, as users, to connect our own Dreamspace Avatars with theirs at any time, from any place, accessing their information. We can place them in a permanent dream-state, enhancing their Dreamspace and keep them alive. By creating this network, we can allow communication across our world, we can research and find information faster and quicker than our libraries, we can perform complex calculations with specialized savants.

&gt;Some may call this immoral and inhumane. But before I leave the stage, I shall leave a personal note. Though Sullen exhibits very little in the physical world, he still has an Avatar presence in his Dreamspace. When I entered, he was there to help me find the information I desired. When I asked where I could find the collected writings of Phenolymes, I could feel him shuffling the world to lead me to them. It was the most alive and happy I have sensed him; he was helping as much as he could. After all, I do care about Sullen. He has become a friend of ours in the lab, not just a lab experiment. 

&gt;He can multitask, too. He was able to aid close to a hundred of us, professors and students and interns alike, and he assured me that he can handle a much higher thoughtput. But he alone cannot know everything. He can, however, point us in the right direction, may it be another Server or another source. This is why we propose a network or Servers.

&gt;It is this network that I call the Dreamweave. It is a mesh of Dreamspaces, intertwined to form another world. A world of information. And it is not often that we are able to create another world.

Of course, the moral implications from the Dreamweave would likely be immoral by our standards, but this is a much different world where values are vastly different. I hope you enjoy it!*

I plan to add as much detail to this, without making it too long - I hope you can help me, i'd appreciate it :).


*Background Story*


In 2011 I met my now ex at university, we were (supposedly) great together, we were with each other every day - She was studying managing and I was doing my dentistry course. We met each others family, I was welcomed by her father, however her mother hated me (because I'm not as financially able as them - I assured her dentistry and orthodontics would pay off - to no avail).


Around 1 year into the relationship, she had to move back to her home town in another state for two years, she was taking a long-term internship at a firm. I was busy with my course, so this meant long distance. We managed it well for 9 months, regular texting/calling/face time/sexting etc. It was of course shitty to not be with her in real life, but hey, at least I still had her. Anyway - soon after that she began to become distant, she took longer to respond, our calls were shorter, she said things weren't great with her family. I understood, let her have some time, reminded her I was her boyfriend, and it was my duty to help her when necessary.


Eventually one day she messaged me ""I can't anymore, I'm sorry."" We talked, broke up, and ten days later messaged me ""I miss you."" Soon after that, we were back together. Gosh sounds so immature when I type it, but anyway - as judging by the title, that didn't last long at all. She broke up with me again. I was of course upset, but took my time to reply to her texts, she'd still message me, continuing if I didn't reply, I guess to get my attention, or some attention.
We had some days where we'd just talk and talk, and it'd feel like old times again. We'd say the occasional ""I miss you"" and stuff. However we stopped talking again, turns out her mum had an argument with her about me, she apparently found out we were talking again. Anyway, after that - we continued to talk less and less, she said she was upset at her brother one day and I should ""blame him"" for her breaking up with me (wtf?). It was followed by a "":P"" so I don't know if it was a joke or not.


One night I was chilling with my mates, and she sent me and my mate a snap chat of her looking smoking, saying ""Going out with Mickey &lt;3."" We were all like wow what?! So we got together for a massive snap chat picture and flipped her off. She then texted me that ""Mickey was short for Michelle."" lol.


Anyway, one day she said she was going out with her high school crush, ok, whatever, I decided what's the point, blocked her, and went to the gym.
Two months passed and she added me on a different snapchat. She messaged me an image, I thought ah ok. We talked a bit, she said she was reading through our texts. I just said that I deleted them 'accidentally,' she said ""Oh I threw my phone at the wall when I accidentally deleted someones chat with me :P."" Ah, here goes the whole 'I have a partner that's not you' talk. I said ""Ahh your bf?,"" she replied, ""yep."" I immediately thought, wow, ok. She went out of her way, to tell me, she has a boyfriend?


I understand if I slightly led it to the conversation, but, essentially, I told her off, badly. We sent long paragraphs to each other, arguing, she said her boyfriend was helping her, and she missed having a boyfriend she could actually be with in real life. Me, on the other hand.... I implied she was a dumb slut, a retard for messing with my feelings, a piece of trash, I told her to never speak to me again, blocked her, and that was that.


Am I an asshole? I understand I over-reacted.


It's been.. holy shit, 9 months since that event happened, and about a year and a bit since we broke up. I don't have Facebook, or snap chat anymore, nor any contact information of hers, except for her friends. I don't know if I should still be feeling guilty about ending it on a bad note, but I do. I have no idea if I'm in the wrong or not, but I'm just telling it from my perspective. I don't know her side to the story. I have the feeling of getting on my old phone and getting her contact details, and messaging her a long ass paragraph of how much of an ass I was to do such a thing - but it's been 9 months, should I assume she's over it? Should I even do it? Am I the asshole in the story? Help!


Thanks guys, and sorry for the wall of text.



   
**tl;dr**: Had an ex, was a slight ass to her, however she was to me. 9 months since talking and 1 1/2 years since the break up, I have moved on, however my conscious has not. Do I dare apologise?"

I am a 20 year old student entering his Junior year in college. I am currently having some issues with my life which I believe a lot was caused by my lack of self control of weed. Before college I was always against drugs (Including Marijuana). Freshmen year came and I think I got caught up with the wrong group of friends. We would only occasionally smoke maybe twice a week if that during the school year (We lived in the residence halls) so it was a lot harder to smoke at the time. We all got great grades, never had any issues. 

Sophomore year comes in which we all lived together (4 total) in an off-campus house. Now this is where we got out of control with Marijuana. It started with smoking Dabs( Concentrated Hash Oil). We would literally smoke every day, multiple times some days. The worst part happened when 2 of my roommates went to Rehab for addiction or so that's what they said. They have been out of the house and I have not seen them for about 4 months now. My only other roommate does not smoke at all and he tells me that I need to quit.

I recently was on a internship position. It wasn't the best but I kept there for about a year before I was fired because of being unreliable. I could agree with them because these last 3-4 months, I have been smoking non-stop with the occasional day off or so. I feel like I have lost my happiness and drive to succeed from my Freshmen year. I feel so low all the time, especially now that I lost my internship and I need to find a new one. 

Basically, I have a long story trying to summarize it, but I just wanted to get some advice on how to go about quitting. I am seeing now that those 3-4 months have been wasted with my just sitting at home playing games while smoking.. I am sick of it and I want to be social and driven again. I am not saying Marijuana is bad, but if you abuse it like me, it is an unpleasant experience. I literally every night and morning when I wake up, I always think about how Marijuana is affecting my life in a negative way, but I just can't seem to stop. I guess there is one positive, I am moving in the next 2 months into an apartment with my other roommate. It will just be the two of us and it is a non-smoking building. I am hoping that I can stop smoking to go forward with my life and career instead of going backwards. 

Any advice/life lessons you want to share? Sorry for the long post but I just needed to get this off my chest.

I am being paid what is essentially a ""salary,"" we agreed upon a lump sum for the duration of the summer. I am worried because I have heard that those in salaried positions are expected to come early and stay late, and I have seen in my previous internships that those who were salaried would always stay at the office until 6 or 7pm.

I should make it clear, I like cs, I like programming, and I will always give 100% at my work. But for me, work is not the most important part of my life, I am into training and running triathlons and marathons, and I'm afraid I will no longer be able to if I'm expected to spend 10+ hours at the office. 

So as the title of my post says, for those of you who are in salaried positions, how to manage your time so you're still able to do the other things you love?  "
352f28,1,2015-05-06,"Reddit, what university course would you take? Or would you rather...",concerned_student_ru,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/352f28/reddit_what_university_course_would_you_take_or/,"Alright, hear me out.

THE SITUATION.

In a month I'll be graduating my Master's degree in Linguistics in one of the best universities of Russia. 

I have an opportunity to work in a foreign embassy for 1-4 years with a decent starting salary ~ 3700$/month.

Problem is - I've completed an internship in the Russian embassy to one of the East Asia's countries and I didn't like it one bit. Everyone there acted like convicted who are serving their sentences. Nobody's happy with their profession and would gladly try some other field. But they have their contracts that require them to work for years and years to come. In a nutshell - they're hooked for life.

Whereas I have yet to sign any contract and I... I want to escape it all. 

I want to study abroad. I want to go the Netherlands or some other nice country and study my ass off (I'm turning 23 in a month) in either Linguistics, Pedagogics or Computer Programming.

THE PROBLEM.

I am scared of getting too old and not having a career - that's why I might take that embassy job, but in the end I will be miserable - I just know it. If I go and study, I'll be 27 something when I graduate with no connections in a completely foreign country (I've been abroad only to one country during one month internship).

I don't know what course should I take: I have worked as a simultaneous interpreter for 2 years now (I'm very good at it - even my own government hire me when they need to get things done), I was a teacher for 7 months and a tutor for 11 months and I loved it (because of a flexible timetable, I'd hate to be tied down to some school or university and work 9 to 5), whereas I don't know a first thing about Computer Programming but I always wanted to try it.

Important note: all my friends say that I need a creative job where I would have a total freedom over things. That's why I'm a successful interpreter - because I do what I want to do and get good results. Same goes for teaching/tutoring. Is programming the same thing? How creative can you get? Do you have a freedom of your project? Can you recommend any other fields relevant to my skills? (I know Russian, English and Spanish - these are my only skills, to be honest). 

I have three questions to you, dear Reddit:

1. Would you take up that job in an embassy? Mind you, they want to put my in Central Asia/Africa/South America

2. If not, what course would you take up: Linguistics/Pedagogics/Computer Programming? Can I earn something in Europe as a linguist or a tutor/teacher? What about programmer? 

3. In what country/university would you study and why? I really want to study somewhere in Europe because I could finally travel by bike and go green to the max. Budget is, of course, a sensitive issue.


You are my only hope. Literally. Everyone else thinks I should take that embassy job because ""money""."
352iwd,2,2015-05-06,19F4M - Inspired by a Picture: The Cabin Trip,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/352iwd/19f4m_inspired_by_a_picture_the_cabin_trip/,"Hey guys. A couple of weeks ago I went on a trip with some friends I had made this semester at my internship to a little cabin as a fun spring break trip. It was three girls and three guys, just all kinda hanging out there and being silly. We all got a little tipsy and we all ended up taking our pants off, but it stopped at that. The ""fun"" part of the night kinda-sorta ended when one guy got a little *too* drunk and a little creepy and whipped out his cock and none of us (except me, I guess, I was fine with it) were really ready for that. 

Anyway, I was looking though some old photos on my phone and I found the picture of us that we took together that night, and it got me thinking... what if the night didn't end there? 

What if the night got even crazier? Or after everyone goes to sleep, you come into my room and we fucked? Or maybe I get fucked by all three guys in the dark, not knowing who is who? The choices are as wide as your imagination. 

Let me know if this scenario interests you, and of course you're welcome to see the picture so you can see the source of my inspiration! "

352tf0,1,2015-05-06,My [23 F] girlfriend of 9 months broke up with me [22 M] out of nowhere and very suddenly. Looking for some perspective.,TheCoFr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/352tf0/my_23_f_girlfriend_of_9_months_broke_up_with_me/,"About a year ago I met the most amazing girl on an internship. We just clicked instantly. It started with messaging at work, moved on to texting, and then started hanging out and within about a month and a half, in August, we were dating. I suffer from severe anxiety issues which started 2 years ago around the Christmas before my 21st birthday. However, I was quite literally on cloud 9, my anxiety was gone, I went off of my medicine, and I had this absolutely amazing girl that truly, truly cared about me. The biggest obstacle I was worried about was the fact that I would be returning back to school 3 weeks after we started dating for my next semester. The engineering program through my university requires 5 internships to be completed and the entirety of the program lasts 5 years, I was starting out my 4th year. Anyways the remaining three weeks before I left were incredible, we were inseparable. We'd take turns spending the night at each others house and then driving into work together the next morning, we spent every single weekend together. But, finally it was time for me to head back to school, I was hesitant because I wanted this to work out with her so it was pretty upsetting to leave. But you know what? It worked out, that bond/connection we shared didn't fluctuate or die down in the slightest. We took turns going to see each other on weekends, sometimes we'd spend weekends where we met halfway and stayed in a hotel and spend our time at different outlet malls, movie theaters, fancy dinners, zoos, everything. 

Before I go any further I will say things moved quick with us she said she loved me before we started dating, she also took my virginity before we started dating. I was convinced she was the one, a love at first sight kind of deal, we began planning our future around each other. She had accepted a job for after college graduation which is this month for her in which she would be part of the trainee program at the company we both interned at. I would still be finishing up my final year of classes and then we'd figure it out from there depending on where I get a job and where she gets a final location after her time in the trainee program. But we knew we were meant to be. Our saying was ""always and forever"". The remainder of the semester while we were on opposite sides of the state stayed perfect I've never been happier. Not only that. once I finished up that semester I was returning back to her side of the state for 8 months of interning. Again, I know I keep saying this but when I returned back it was like I was never gone we were out and about, just like when we left off. I spent the holidays with her family and really got to know everybody and she got to know my family very well too. That being said around Christmas time my panic attacks and anxiety came back full force, for those of you who haven't dealt with it it's absolutely paralyzing. It takes your happiness and rips to shreds and hurdles your worst fears to the forefront of your mind to the point where sleep isn't even an escape. She was aware about my past with it and as soon as it came back I told her and was honest with her. I did my best, the best I could possibly do to stay strong for her, I wouldn't let this overcome us, we're always and forever. She was super supportive. I'll admit I wasn't as active in terms of us getting out and going everywhere but it was winter time and we would stay in and watch netflix and cuddle, we still saw each other all the time. I still took her out for Valentine's day. We traveled to a really nice area, stayed in a really nice hotel, ate dinner at a very expensive restaurant, and saw a movie. We spent the weekend up there. For her birthday I took her out to a really nice dinner and  let her pick out a $380 dollar ring, we considered this to be a promise to each other and a way to stay connected while she's gone on her trainee program for work. Now comes the rough moments. 

This past month I've been pretty stressed out at work and have been working towards overcoming my anxiety, which seems to be on the upswing, getting much better again. I'll admit openly that things were slowing down in the sense that, that initial relationship excitement was fading (a completely normal thing) a bit just as any relationship has ups and downs, it's not all sunshine and roses but the beauty of it is that its commitment between two people to hopefully work at it together. She had started going out more with her sorority friends like she used to which wasn't a big deal to me, I want her to have fun and be happy, friends are important. It did make me uncomfortable that she would get black out drunk but I trust her. So this weekend she went out on Friday. She had seemed uninterested in me the entire weekend, out of nowhere and I brought it up to her. She said she wasn't and that we were great, ""were forever don't worry"". She came over on Saturday and everything was pretty normal, we just kind of hung out and relaxed. On Sunday morning,  I asked if she wanted to go to breakfast and she gave me some lame excuse and said she had to go home. I didn't read much into it I didn't think it was a big deal. Then Sunday night she completely stopped texting me after 6 and I didn't hear from her until 10 on Monday morning. I asked her what happened and she gave me some excuse that her phone wouldn't charge unless it was off and that she went to the gym. I asked her if she was uninterested in me again and she said, ""No?"" but something just felt off all weekend. I asked if she was coming over tonight and then she said she didn't feel well and I said what's going on you seem so uninterested in me lately, can we please talk. This is when it came out...she told me she feels like she lost herself to us and that she still wants to be young, go out with friends and be dumb, and have fun. That was it. I asked to call her and she said she was at the mall with her mom. 9 months with someone I truly love and she didn't even have the decency to talk to me in person let alone over the phone. I feel so confused, lost, and hurt. She only has a month left before she starts work..she won't even be with her friend's at that point I can't believe she would prioritize all of that over our relationship. I don't understand how you can just let someone you've centered your life around for almost a year go within a 10 min text conversation. She said everything she said was true about wanting a future with me and that she still loves me but ""we aren't there yet"". She said she started thinking about this since Friday. Can someone give me some kind of perspective?? I feel like my heart has been shattered.

TL;DR: I've been in an almost perfect relationship with a girl I love for nine months. Within the blink of an eye, after everything we've been through and planned on together, she ended it over a text message without even the decency of seeing me in person or a phone call. She decided she'd rather go out and party and be with friends and that somehow I was holding her back. Her decision was made within a weekend without even discussing how she was feeling. I'm confused and need perspective"
352x6r,1,2015-05-06,"Late start, 1 year out of College, NYC, Need advice",TheDreadPirateRobert,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/352x6r/late_start_1_year_out_of_college_nyc_need_advice/,"A little background first. Let me start by saying I love accounting and this is what I want to do, but I didn’t figure that out until my last semester of senior year. 



I majored in business during undergrad with only a concentration in accounting which was just 12 accounting credits. I figured I enjoyed math and rules and when things “balance” and at least a background in accounting would be beneficial for whatever I wanted to do in the future. Late in my junior year I took Intermediate I and Cost at the same time, got A’s in both and loved it. It was around then I started looking into accounting as a profession instead of just something to go along with another plan. That was also the first time I learned what a CPA was and found out about this incredibly hard exam, and this Big 4 group. Public accounting is for private clients?, and private accounting (industry) could be an accountant for a public/corporate company?, weird. Ok, I thought, no way is that for me but I can work as staff accountant/ accounting manager in industry and be satisfied and fulfilled with my career. I took 12 additional accounting credits during my last semester to help me reach that goal. 





I have no internships, went to a total of one accounting/networking mixer, made a few contacts that went nowhere and then graduated this past August with 3.6. It was during the summer and after graduating that I really started getting an itch to be better and reach higher. Which brings me to my current situation.





As you can assume, no one in my family really has an accounting background. I grew up being told I “could be whatever I wanted because im brilliant and prettier than anybody else.”  I love my parents, but to be the “best” in accounting you need a determined, well thought out plan and path to put yourself on. Obviously there’s room to switch and change gears as in any profession, but you can’t just wake up one day and decide you’re going to be a CPA and get a job at one of the Big 4 or any major accounting firm for that matter. My professors were even pushing me to go the more finance/MBA route so I didn’t even have better “accounting” specific advice during college. My career center was a joke but I still use the forum to look at prospective jobs in the area. 





I got a job in December as an accounting clerk to at least have some office/ accounting experience on my resume to make up for no internships. I set myself up on a path to take the CPA exam in either August or October and I took Audit over the winter to be able to sit in NYC. Since I’m a weak candidate, I figured being on track to sit for and start taking the exam would give me a bit of a leg up. Get a job at a local firm in the fall and then maybe take a few community college courses to meet the 150 next year after taking the exam. Is that a good plan? All of the very few people I trust to give accounting related advice have told me to take the CPA exam as soon as possible and then move forward from there so at least I have that under my belt, and everyone will look at that positively. That seems like solid advice but I don’t know if I’m still stunting myself by not going for master’s and trying to get internships/recruitement opportunities that come with receiving a MAcc. I’m reaching the point where I have to make a decision and I don’t want to make the wrong one and put myself even further behind and more stressed. I wasn't even considering a MAcc since I’d only need a few more credits to reach the 150, but if a more streamlined accessible path is afforded to me through that then that might be the better option.





Right now I just really want a better job. I’m working at a nonprofit as a temp and the work is good, but I don’t feel like just having this on my resume will put me in any better position. Yes, the NYC market is ripe with accounting positions but most of them, since they have a larger pool to pick from require AT LEAST minimal experience or internship which I have none of. Going straight for the CPA is not a bad plan, but will that help me line up a job for the fall? Obviously not a public firm yet but in industry at least or a small regional firm? It's been a year since i've graduated and I feel like I accomplished nothing. I'm tired of dragging my feet and want to make a firm decision I can be confident in and get my wheels moving again. I frequent /r/accounting a lot and this is the best group of people I could think of for actual solid advice. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks

A few things about me: I'm a computer science major with 1.5 years left at GVSU. I've mostly worked with Java, although I've dabbled in C and just started picking up python.

She frequented r/relationships before, but I couldn't post this there. I guess it's an apology, and me trying to move on.",ineedhelpmovingon,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/352zxg/i_33m_wrote_a_letter_to_my_new_ex_29f_after/,"Please read this, all the way through. And please never reply. And please never think about reaching out to me. 

My heart hurts. It hurts when I wake up. And when I lie awake at night, and it hurts until the few minutes or hours of sleep I can manage finally creep in.

I messed it up. You pulled away from me. And you knew long ago I wasn't treating you right. And I can pretend to blame you all I want - that you didn't communicate with me. That you didn't give us a chance to grow up. That you didn't tell me what I was doing was wrong, and that you didn't tell me I needed to grow up, and that you didn't tell me I was losing you - or that I already had.

I can put all that blame on you, and I can pretend to hate you, and I can try to ease my pain by making it seem like I didn't deserve this. 

But the truth is I took you for granted. I have a lot of things to work out about myself. I am a troubled person, who is too stubborn, too petty, too angry, too childish, too selfish, and I was too much of an asshole to really understand how to care for someone else. I thought if I bought you flowers, I was a good boyfriend. 

I thought if I remembered all the right dates, I was doing enough. I thought that as long as I was there, physically, I was doing enough. I have a lot of growing up to do. I have a lot of frustrations, regrets, doubts about myself, and anger and trust issues. I have so many things wrong with me, that it's a miracle I was able to hold onto you for as long as I did.

I think about how I threw away 5 years, treating you like you weren't good enough. I thought about how I bullied you into being someone you never really wanted to be, when the truth was I was happy with everything about you, good or bad, because you made me happy, and gave me a reason to live, to want to be better, to want more for myself. I think about all the empty threats I kept throwing at you... just like how we ended, thinking that getting what I thought I wanted was the point. I think about how you first brought him up to me, before any of this, probably out of guilt. About someone helping you, and I know now it meant that I should have been doing that. And thinking about that now, I know it went further back than I wanted to admit. 

I get angry at all the lies you told me. I get angry at all the things you refused to tell me, because I'm stupid enough to think I deserved the truth from you. I think about how long ago I started causing you pain. I deserve what I'm getting because I took everything you've ever done for me for granted, and I let myself believe I deserved all of it, and more.

I have my own issues. That's clear. I have so much that's unmistakably wrong in my head, that I thought arguing with you wasn't taking it's toll. You had so much stress in your life, and I kept forcing more onto you. 

I thought I was deserving of sympathy, because after following you, after making my own decision to uproot everything, that I was owed more than just 8 months. But I was never good enough to you.

We weren't perfect, and I thought because of that, I didn't have to be either. I knew what you wanted, but ignored it because I never took the time to think that we were't guaranteed. I took everything you gave me for granted. I took all the times you gave things up for me for granted. I let you spoil me, and I took all of it for granted because I wasn't smart enough to grow up and appreciate it. 

I stopped trying because I thought you weren't trying. I stopped being there for you because I thought you weren't being there for me either. But I know now how much work was required. I know now how much more I could have done. I know you deserved it, because you did, and if someone like me want to love and be with someone, then I needed to give it my best.

I want to be angry that I lost you so long ago. I want to blame you for stopping your love for me after only 4 months. I want to despise you, I want to hate you, and prove you wrong, and make you feel the pain I'm feeling now. But I can't, and not simply because I love you, and I'm delusional enough to think that this is a love story, and being sweet when it's much too late wins back the girl, and gives the happy ending. I can't blame you because I know I was wrong. I can't blame you because I know I was abusive, and unforgiving, and petty, and a bully. I can't blame you because I lost you - you didn't just decide one day not to love me. I did it to myself.

I can't take any of it back, so I won't. I can't create feelings where there are none, and I won't believe it for one second either. It hurts to know you've moved on so fast, so quickly. It hurts me to know that I was so easy to let go of, and that I didn't mean to you what I thought I did, and that I didn't mean to you what you meant to me.

But that's not the case. You didn't just leave me after 8 months. You didn't just check out after 4 months. You didn't just do this to hurt me, or to get back at me. I wasn't good enough to you, or for you. I didn't respect what you needed. I didn't take care of you like I said I would, or like I thought I was. I was an asshole to you, and I know it's the truth. It wasn't just 4 months. It was 6 years. It wasn't just 8 months, it was 6 years.

I needed to grow up, and I still do. It hurts me to my core to admit this, but there was no reason for someone to stay with me, to want a future with me, to want to stick around any longer, to wait for me to wake up and finally do all the right things. My heart feels like it's breaking in half a little more each day. Every second, every minute, I want to give everything up, and hide in a hole somewhere, and never come back out.

I didn't give half as much as you did, and every time I did try, I made sure you knew it, I made sure to remind you of it. I held so many things over your head. I was a bastard. I didn't deserve you, and you didn't stick around because you were a coward. At least not completely. You stuck around because you really did care for me - even if it was a long time ago. I made you feel guilt. I made you feel like you weren't good enough. I made you feel bad for living your life, and wanting bigger things, and a better future. And to make your mom proud. To make yourself proud. I made you feel bad for wanting more.

All because of my own issues. I have to let you go, and stopping all contact was a way of doing that, however horribly I went about it. Even in the end, I couldn't do the right thing. 

My pain will go away, eventually. If I can, I will move on. And you will be someone I used to love, someone I used to know. Someone I used to care about, but never appreciated. I always wanted to be right, and that's something I know now will change. I always wanted to have the upper hand, and that's something I know that I will correct, because that's not how you treat the most important person in your life, and that's not how you act as a partner to someone you love so much.

I can't blame you anymore, because I know deep down I was the one who was wrong. I want to hate you for leading me on, for making me believe there was something left, for going ring shopping with me and being with someone only two months later.  I want so much to hate you for making me believe this was something I could fix later, something I still had time to change.

I'm not perfect. Neither were you. But you let me be me, and I was the one who wouldn't compromise. I had a stick up my ass for so long that I took it out on you. I should have gone out with you. I should have stopped focusing on only my school, my needs, my part of a relationship. I should have realized that I needed more people in my life, I needed to let you fully experience this opportunity that you worked so hard for, and I needed to realize that I really was holding you back and hurting you.

It's not that I couldn't change - that's where you're wrong. I was an uptight asshole because I was so worried about my own problems. But it's not that I couldn't change, or would never. I was never naturally this angry, this closed off, this uptight about someone having a good time. I was just always afraid I would lose you, that I wasn't good enough to be around your circle, that I was ashamed I was holding you back and that I had to explain that I was just an undergrad. That I didn't have anything going on, and that you could do better than me. 

I didn't think about how you were moving forward, working really hard, and needed to live your life. It wasn't that I was stuck on our life in LA, as I wanted to move forward as well, and that's why I changed my life. It wasn't that I wanted to tie you down, to make you a housewife, to hold you down and check up on you, to make sure you behaved a certain way. It was all due to my own insecurities, to my own fears, to my own feelings about myself, that I gave you such a hard time about living your life. I was afraid I would lose you. And then. I did. 

I should have done so much more. And if I was only willing to try, to grow, to get out of my own head, you would still be here. I was so paralyzed by my own doubts that I ended up pushing you away. And I never stopped to think about how amazing of a person you were, how loving, how caring you were to me, and I never thought about how much work you put in, in order to be there for me because I needed you.

And I never gave any of it back. I fought you out of my own frustrations. I made it so difficult because I was angry, about so many things. You needed me to be there, to help you, to support you, and I never even bothered to listen to your problems, to go out with you, to stop thinking only about myself.

I held so much over your head, that I never acknowledged that I was the problem, and that if I loved you as much as I did, then I should have gave a shit and been there as a partner, growing, learning, experiencing with you. 

No one stole you from me. You're beautiful. I always thought so, even if I never let you believe it. It was what I thought the first time I saw you, and the reason I brought it up to Xxxx, hoping you'd give me a chance. You were kind, sweet, and caring, and smart, and driven, and passionate, and I fell for you hard, immediately. And it never occurred to me that you weren't only that special to me, but to anyone else who saw you as well. It shouldn't have come as a crushing blow to me that someone else saw that in you and appreciated it, and gave you what you wanted. I was an idiot. And I didn't appreciate what I had, and now you have someone who I can only hope gives that to you. 

I know you liked that Sam Smith cover I showed you. I suppose it's fitting that that's how this ends for me. I will have my good days and bad. I will hate you, want revenge for my pain. I will pretend I'm not to blame, and like I used to, act like it was all on you. But while I can still think clearly for now, and understand my pain, and know the truth, I wanted to get it out. This is just another long, ranting letter from me. But the difference is this isn't some last ditch effort to ""win"" you back, while I'm agonizing, and delirious, and without sleep, and in paralyzing heartache. 

But I know deep down it's true. I didn't deserve you. I wasn't there for you. I made you feel only bad things, and not enough good. I kept to myself, and only expected you to come around. I didn't put myself out there out of fear and insecurity, and refused to be a part of your life and your career. And I can only blame myself. I was wrong. And I never admitted it enough, or considered it enough, and I wasn't there for you. Love wasn't enough, and I barely gave you that as well.

In the end, you would have been worth it. And as much pain as I am in now, I can't honestly regret what we had - only how I messed it up. I should have tried harder 6 years ago. I should never have ever laid a finger on you. Ever. I should have told you how much I cared. I should have showed it. I should have let go of my pride, and swallowed my feelings of inadequacy and been there for you, always.

I was wrong, and I'm sorry. I will always love you. And I will never forget you. And I will never let myself forget what I did, and I will never forgive myself. You were worth it - all of it. Even now, with how much I hate myself. Please be happy. Please don't feel guilt. Please enjoy everything you've worked for.

I won't always be able to think this way, as there are too many emotions for me to live through right now. But I know that it's true. I want to be angry, but I know I shouldn't be. I will only have regret. I know you deserve to be happy. I know you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy. 

The bitterness will slowly die off. Just like my pain, and my sadness, and my broken heart. With time, I will be able to feel again, and eventually, when I am ready, I will be able to move on. That's how life works. I've been through enough to know that, no matter how much I don't want to believe it. It may not seem like that now, but I know that's how love works, and how life works, and how people work. I can only wish you happiness.

One day, I might be able to feel the same for myself as well. All I can do is keep moving forward, because that's all I have left. I love you. Good bye Xxxxxxx.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is what I sent her father:

Hi Xxxxxx. It's Xxxxx. I'm sorry about calling you so early. I hadn't slept and didn't think about the time difference. I will be in Los Angeles this month, and wanted to clear my stuff out of your apartment so you didn't have to. If that's possible - you can let me know, or not. I understand if you don't.

I know I left you a message before. But I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I really did... And do love your daughter. I moved here to spend the rest of my life with her... And I regret everything that I've ever done that made her not love me anymore. I could have, and should have been much better to her, and I wanted to apologize to you.

I know I'm just some idiot. And you don't owe me anything, at all. But if you could keep this text between us... 

I told her not to contact me anymore, because it hurt too much to talk to her, even by email. I'm a huge mess right now, and it's inappropriate for me to contact you - I know. 

I'm not sure what to do or where to go from here. My heart is broken, and that shouldn't be you concern, and it won't be.

I thought I would marry her... I really did. I left everything I've ever known to follow her here, and I'll forever regret that it didn't work out. Please don't tell her I sent you this. Please. I'm begging you. 

I know she wants nothing to do with me, and she has already moved on. She has a great internship coming up. And she worked really hard to get it. You should be proud of her - and I know you are. 

You're her only family here - and she was mine, at least when I was lucky enough to share the time I had with her. I wasn't supportive enough, and I didn't give her the love and attention I should have. I was selfish, and only focused on my own school, and my own needs, and I even though I love her... I didn't give her what she needed from a partner.

I really am sorry. These are only words - I understand. But I'm really not well. And I mean everything that I'm writing. I love your daughter very much. And I can't really think about anything else. 

I've been trying to keep as far away from her as possible - because I know in reality that's what she wants. I never really had a stable life. She was the best thing that could have ever happened to me, but I took how amazing, and special she was, and I took all of it for granted. 

So I'm sorry. I will forever regret losing her. You don't need to respond. About anything I wrote at all, please don't feel any sort of obligation as I don't deserve it.

I lost her because I wasn't there for her. Physically I was... But not emotionally. I was too selfish, too stubborn, and much too proud.

I hope she's happy. And I hope she gets everything she ever wanted. I'm just sorry I can't be the one by her side to give it to her, and help her achieve her goals.

If you are willing to let me come clear my stuff, and if its still there. I will be there later this month. I won't come if you don't tell me that you'll allow it. 

I'm sorry Xxxxxx. For everything. Please don't tell her I contacted you. And please don't try to ""fix"" anything between us, not that you have any reason to try. She is happier without me ruining everything she has worked so hard for.

You always offered me nothing but love and compassion, and I know I let you down as well. I could have been a much better person for her. And I will always regret not trying my best. I'm sorry. And I understand if I don't hear back from you. 

I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me one day, for not treating her right, and for not treating her the way she deserved. I know I won't ever forgive myself. 

This will be the last time I contact you, and put you in this position. I'll translate this into Xxxxxxx as well. Thank you for reading this, Xxxxxx. And I appreciate everything you've ever done for me. "

I am her boss.  This is why it never fails to amaze me that she shamelessly claws after my job and openly complains about me to our superiors.  But Zoe is a not new creature.  I have worked long enough to know her type which is why I study her intently as she babbles about Aeronautical Emission Standards.  Zoe lacks poise and polish and speaks too fast in her high, tinny voice.  Her horse teeth don't help either.  But she is young and ambitious.  If she wasn't so socially awkward she would climb faster.  People like Zoe have intellectual merit yet lack social finesse.  They are embarrassing at company parties.  I glance at her slides praying none of my points are in there.  This bitch has stolen from me before.  

But I steal too.  From her and anyone else.  We all do.  Fucking corporate douche bags braying like donkeys for the 3 executives in the room.  This is the worst kind of meeting.  No snacks, no birthday cakes, no fucking point.  Just a room full of dimwits who should be working but have instead made elaborate presentations about what they WOULD be doing IF they were actually working.  My phone vibrates like a heartbeat against my leg.  I live by The Code.  It is 10:00am.  The Code says take some oxy so I casually palm a pill, crunch it up and sip coffee.  Doctor's orders.

I will not do heroin at work.  This environment is too unpredictable and wild.  The stakes are way too high to be that fucked up.  This meeting popped up 30 minutes ago.  People scramble like motherfuckers to justify their livelihoods.  They think of mortgages, their children's futures and social status as they prove themselves valuable and irreplaceable.  This is fucked up and wrong but EXACTLY the kind of shit people with power enjoy pulling.  Like a dog humping your leg, the executives enjoy displays of power.  So you must be ready.  And heroin is not a ready drug.   

Ahh but oxycodone...Now that is a corporate drug!  Thebaine stimulates you and gives you that winning smile and firm handshake!  Helps you bellow out HI HOW ARE YOU DOING BOB!  GREAT TO SEE YA BUDDY! - when you actually hate Bob and fantasize about slitting his fat fucking throat.

I can see Bob's blood drip down my arm as Zoe rushes her last point and Dan the Man VP of Sales asks for clarification.  This makes Zoe turn bright red with shame.  Like Bob's blood.  She mutters her final points.  I can't help but notice that 2 of her 3 points are criticisms against her boss who happens to be me.  But no one cares.  She lost momentum, sits down and stares at her feet.  

Ahh, my turn.  I look at her but she refuses to meet my gaze.  Attack your boss in a meeting eh?  With a casual flick I turn off the monitor behind me that casts Zoe's presentation.  I don't need any spreadsheets or graphs.  That filler is for pussies.  I work from memory for I am pro.   I lay out hard facts and point out flaws.  Zoe's flaws.  I slam her in everything but name.  Leaving her nameless screams ZOE much louder.  

I am known for this no nonsense approach.  It is the Mask I wear at work.  5 minutes into my presentation I feel the first little fingerlings of euphoria reach up and tickle the back my brain.  Ohhhh yeahhhh....By the end of my little show I have presented a positive spin, a solid schedule plus a novel solution I thought up while standing there.  Before I take my seat I wink at the cute intern who is taking Meeting Notes.  

Then I look at Zoe the Soulless.  YOU FEEL THAT YOU HORSE FACED BITCH?    

As the rush hits me full strength the meeting ends and I walk out with The Boys.  Executive level go-getter, plastic-faced douche bags.  We speak of professional sports, island getaways and real estate margins.  But on the way back to my office I sit with my nemesis Zoe and her team.  I put on a Pleasant Mask as we talk of coffee, weather and lunch spots.  I let my oxycodone fueled charisma ooze out over her staff.  They love me for Zoe is an unpleasant hard ass.  The type of person who doesn't understand the concept of tipping makes a cruel boss.  

But I buy everyone bagels and muffins because I understand the Game.  And I make nice with Zoe.  We talk about her parrot.  That fucking bird is the closest clue we have that Zoe is a mammal with feelings.  So I praise the parrot to lower Zoe's guard.   Fucking screwy bitch.  I gently let her know where she fucked up so we can fix it.  She accepts this.  I know she grows smarter with each blow but we need to stay competitive.  China is kicking our ass.  I give her more resources to show her that I do not harbor grudges even though I KNOW and YOU KNOW you just tried to FUCK me in front of the executives.  

But I need Zoe.  In reality she does 85% of my work while I sit around high as fuck reading Reddit.  

My lunch is ruined as an ambitious newly minted engineer nervously sits near me to talk about her 2016 goals.  My roast beef sandwich could be a thing of art.  Freshly baked bread, thinly sliced Prime Rib, organic butter lettuce and vine ripened tomato with just a dab of mayonnaise...but no.  Not even the artisan potato chips help.  I must talk.  I hate talking when I could be eating.  But the oxy helps.  I let her feel good for I know what a long walk it was to approach me when I am eating alone.  She means well.  But in my mind I make a mental note to go out tomorrow so I can eat in peace.

At 1pm The Code buzzes me and I chew another pill.  God damn what a beautiful day.  Actually its raining, gray and miserable but I feel awesome.  I feel so awesome I get up and leave.  Fuck this place.  I have programmed my planner app to release my report summaries and schedules at exactly 6:13pm in case my bosses are checking time stamps.  

The newspaper kiosk guy hates me.  But to be fair, he hates everyone.  Working a kiosk in a train station exposes him to a cross section of humanity that is just too disgusting to contemplate.  He argues with a woman who complains her shitty $2 coffee sucks.  His command of the English language does not allow him to scream BITCH IT'S $2 COFFEE WHAT DO YOU WANT?!  

As she proves what an unpleasant fuck of a human being she is I think of reaching over and stealing a pack of smokes.  No one would suspect me in my office disguise.  So I reach over and grab one.  I palm it casually.  I can walk away.  But I don't.  I pay for it and leave as he scowls at me because he KNOWS what I did.

Would the younger me have stolen those smokes?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Maybe I was never that kind of a person....Wow.  Me the Nice Guy?  Really?  I contemplate this as I wait for a train to get out of here.  Damn its only Wednesday.  Wednesday is the asshole of the work week.  

Once I'm in my seat I look around.  I know no one in the car.  I take off my corporate Mask and sigh with relief.  Barely pulled 5 hours today.  Without my Mask I am a fragile, frightened human being.  Afraid of the world, afraid of the future and afraid of myself and what I have become.  Is this what it feels like to be old?, I wonder rubbing my face.    

The kid that sits next to me on the train reeks of bread and pizza.  His eyes are dead and he is clearly exhausted.  Someone rode his ass for 8 solid hours.  The burns on his forearms are familiar as I worked a bakery job in school and know those baking rack scars well.  

I feel tired and spent because I was up late last night being high.  I feel ripped off because I spent my lunch talking about work.  But this kid covered in flour?  That is real work and for not much pay at all I bet.  I can see the kid's phone and he's looking at Craigslist rental listings.  Is he being kicked out?  Is he moving?  Hell, my only concern is If I run out of oxy will my house of cards lifestyle crumble?  

But then the train departs.  The kid puts on headphones and zonks out.  I sit back and fall under the humming spell of travel as I stare out the window.  2 more days of this shit and the weekend comes.  I yawn and go back on Reddit.  God these fucking suboxone questions..."
353561,8,2015-05-06,"Me [19F] with my boyfriend[22M] are starting a long distance relationship, he is becoming a professional athlete.",Kaibaby33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/353561/me_19f_with_my_boyfriend22m_are_starting_a_long/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for several months now (4-5, we haven't really kept track). He just recently graduated college and has been pursuing a career in the NFL. I am two years ahead at my university, so I will be graduating with my degree within the next two years. 

Tomorrow, he will be moving across the country for camp and hopefully signing a contract in August to be secured through the season and several years out. I can't visit him until August as he will be living with other players in a dorm like unit until then.  I have an amazing internship this summer, and I will be extremely busy along with summer classes. So either way, I wouldn't have had time to fly out and see him until August either. 

He is extremely focussed and excited. He has spent his entire life working for this moment. I completely understand that this is bigger than me, and currently more important than I am. 

I'm asking for long-distance advice, especially from those that understand what is going through a man's head who is in this situation (or similar). I know not to call him constantly and I have my own career, studies and life to tend to. But I do still love him dearly, and hope to spend many more years by his side. I need to know how to feel fulfilled in my relationship as well as securing myself in his life. I trust him, we have talked about the situations he will be faced with and I believe he will make the right decisions. If he doesn't, well then it's his loss and I can accept that.

All I have asked of him is to either call me or send me a text before he goes to sleep letting me know that he is doing well-- while he's at camp. If he makes the roster, it will be a bit different in terms of communication as he will have time to call and I can visit.  

I understand that this is going to be difficult, but I know our relationship is worth it. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully respond! I truly appreciate it.

[How easy was it for you to break into the games industry and how easy do you think it would be to do so today?... im currently doing a digital design major and i want to aim for a career in developing games.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr095cv?context=5)|I never planned for it myself. I just loved bulding levels for Quake and eventually I was approached by Jens Matthies (who I've been working side by side with my entire career) and Starbreeze. I think this still happens today - especially when it comes to getting into the business as an artist.
 |Design is a bit harder I think - mainly because companies usually require a lot of experience with a few titles in the portfolio. As I mentioned in a previous answer - i think the best approach nowadays is to go through a game development focused education and through school get an internship. We have some truly great schools here in Sweden and for a lot of the students that have done their internship at MachineGames - it has resulted in a full time employment.
[Is that your real name?  If so it is pretty awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0iu6b?context=5)|Yes it is! I was born in 1971 and times were a bit different back then. My mother came from a region in Sweden called Dalarna where the name Jerk at that time was, not very, but fairly common. It's a variation of the name Erik and my mother and father thought it was nice to use a name from my mothers region. And what it meant in english wasn't even something that anyone would think about at that time. I would lie if i would say that it hasn't bother me from time to time - of course it has, especially when i was younger and travelling to US or UK I was always embarrassed to show my passport or id. But I have never thought about changing it - I'm quite fine with it nowadays.
[What do you think is the best way to get into games programming? and what do you think are essential skills to develop for programmers and designers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07osu?context=5)|Hi Regygamer - nowadays, at least here in Sweden, we have really good schools that are specialized in game developing educations. This is usually what I recommend when young people ask me how to best get into the business. It was a lot different when I started. We didnt have these types of educations back then.  
[How did you come about adding in the Nightmare levels in the Old Blood? Was there any challenges getting the old levels to run on the new engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr080jp?context=5)|Hi! The first Nightmare level that we added to The New Order was not planned from the beginning - it was something that our team did for fun during development and when they got it working we of course wanted to include it. We have a truly amazing and very creative team here at Machine Games. 
[Would you like to make a Wolfenstein game in another genre than the FPS? Which one? Platform, TPS, even a strategy game??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr08a49?context=5)|Hi zeppelinsw! I think I always will prefer first person. Whatever game we're developing. Its a great genre that allows you to truly be the character you play. This is and always will be extremely appealing to me. 
[I really enjoyed the New Order what floored me was the great acting went so well with the gameplay. so i was wondering what was the decision to bring that great acting to a over the top action game ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07yi2?context=5)|Thank you for your kind words! We feel that it's our responsibility to bring the best possible story to any game we develop. We are fortunate to work with  amazing actors for both The New Order and The Old Blood. 
[Thank you so much for your time in bringing back Wolfenstein to the main stream. I thought The Old Blood was incredible and just couldn't stop pinching myself going back to Castle Wolfenstein. How much joy and pressure did you and and your team feel with such a monumental task? My first Reddit post btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0d4uo?context=5)|Thank you Jyncks! A lot of joy and a lot of pressure, but having Bethesda and id Software by your side certainly removes some of the pressure - and adds a lot more joy!  Personally, being a huge id-fan, it was a dream come true to work with such a legendary ip.   
[What are your plans for the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07mcv?context=5)|Hi - unfortunately I'm not quite ready to talk about what we have planned for the future. We are just one day after launch!
[The Old Blood is bloody awesome as The New Order, thank you! Could you please give any ETA on The Old Blood soundtrack release? I'm really desperate to purchase it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr09eoz?context=5)|Thank You! I love the music as well. Mick Gordon is fantastic. The cover of The Partisan is so amazingly good. Unfortunately I dont have any information on a soundtrack release today.   
[ of all thanks for bringing back all those amazing memories from RTCW to The Old Blood. I am so happy to see it once again and being able to replay story, funny because i wrote to bethesda if you guys consider to relase some kind of RTCW remake (we still play RTCW\). Game is awesome. Please tell me if you are going to keep on doing great work and if you have got already plans for future connected with Wolfenstein? Also will you add some new products to bethesda store? Cant wait to get them all!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0b0on?context=5)|You're welcome! I'm also, as you may understand, a big fan of Return to Castle Wolfenstein - its a great game.  I'm pretty sure there will be more stuff coming to the store and while i'm sorry to say i dont have any solid informtion on whats coming I'm very happy to hear you want to get them all! Thank you! 
[Hello Sir Gustafsson!  I am a huge fan of your work. Every single one of your games are on my fav games list! So, I guess you are one of my game idols?  If I want to become a game designer/director, what is the best and most effective way, without the involvement of direct programming skills, to show my ideas to.. lets say.. you guys?  Are you guys satisfied with the ID Tech 5 engine? Us gamers, especially on PC, look at the engine as a living nightmare, especially since it's coming from Carmack :(. Barely any modding capabilities, terrible optimization (60 fps cap? really?\) and texture pop-ins, baked lighting techniques... etc. What are some future plans for this engine and if given opportunity, what engine would you like to use instead? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr09ioe?context=5)|Hello Sir! Very nice to hear you like our games!  I would recommend to keep a look out for open game design positions at developers that are of interest to you and then submit an application with your ideas.  Yes, I'm very satisfied with id tech. Whatever technology you're working with there will always be challenges, but considering that we now have delivered two games running at 60 fps/1080p - I'm definitely satisfied.
[Hello Mr. Gustafsson, I was 14 when I first played Chronicles of Riddick (yep I know that game was rated M but I really didn't care, haha\). That game was a part of my childhood and I've been a big fan of you guys until today. Wolfenstein: The New Order was AMAZING and I'm having a blast with The Old Blood right now.  What really amazed me was how brave MachineGames and Bethesda were for making Wolfenstein TNO, I mean it was 2014, most people ask for multiplayer for a 60 dollar FPS game or else they won't buy it, but no, you guys decided to take a risk and made a freaking triumphant! Did you guys expect Wolfenstein TNO to be successful after taking that risky move? Also will Neumond Recordings' songs appear in the next Wolf games? :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr086os?context=5)|Thank you! We have always been a single player focused team and it's truly amazing to work with Bethesda, who always encourage us to do what we want to do and feel really strong about - story driven first person action adventure experiences. I'm very happy that a lot of people enjoyed The New Order - it shows that there's still a market for the type of games we love to create.
[Hi Jerk! Just want to start off by saying I love the work you and the rest of Machine Games are doing with the Wolfenstein! What other kinds of games can we expect from you guys in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07s42?context=5)|Thank you XKV22! The only thing I can say for sure is that you can expect games with a lot of action and heavy weapons!
[What are your favorite pizza toppings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0950e?context=5)|Minced meat, egg and Tabasco!
[So first off, I wanted to thank you and the team for giving us both The New Order and The Old Blood, as well as all the great games you guys made at Starbreeze. I have a number of questions, so just answer as many or few as you want.  What is the canon status of the series? With TNO it was assumed that at least Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 2009, and TNO were all one continuity, with Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny also possibly being connected. But The Old Blood's first part seems to be at somewhat of a re-imagining or retelling of the beginning of RtCW.   If the canon has been re-imagined, would there ever be a possibility of the return of Robo-Hitler, or some other form of him, or would you prefer to go forward?  The Wolfenstein games are interesting in that they feature an extremely limited health regeneration in favor of an old-school health/armor system, which is rare in modern shooters. Was this just for the sake of capturing the Wolfenstein feel, or can we expect classic mechanics in future non-Wolfenstein games from you guys?  With modern Wolfenstein games, it's kind of been a series where a developer puts out one great game and then passes the torch to the next developer, allowing them to give their own take on the franchise. I feel like this is part of what gives the series its charm, since no two games are the same and it keeps each game having a fresh perspective. Do you intend to keep going with the series, or is TNO/TOB your contribution? I wouldn't mind seeing more Wolfenstein from you guys since your current games are amazing, but I'd hate to see Wolfenstein become ""The Machine Games series"" or for you guys to become ""The Wolfenstein developers"".  If/When you do decide to move on from Wolfenstein, what would you like to be next? Is there any hope of returning to previous franchises like Riddick, The Darkness, or Syndicate?   Are you guys ""set in stone"" with id Tech 5, or are you open to other engines in games not published by Bethesda? Is there a chance of a successor to the Starbreeze Engine?  Wyatt or Fergus? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr08e8w?context=5)|Hello JocLayton! You're quite right, The Old Blood is very much inspired by RtCW (one of my favorite Wolfenstein games) - especially by the first two episodes.  I definitely would want to see the return of Robo-Hitler some day - who wouldn't? I really wanted a health system that involved the classic 100 health/100 armor, but at the same time gave the player some possibility of regeneration. Basically to avoid situations where players just stand behind a cover and wait for the health to regenerate and instead encourage players to move around more, while still not ending up stuck with extremely low health - we had a similar system in Riddick (but with cubes) and it's a system that, I think, works very well with the combat we want to have in our games.  I'm not yet ready to talk about what we have planned for the future, but I am very happy with what we have accomplished with both The New Order and The Old Blood.  Wyatt - mainly because I love J so much.

DC-DC converter. (1 using all analog components and one using a microcontroller)

Alarm system with a keypad using a microcontroller.


Any other suggestions? What would you do in my shoes? Are these good enough? Criticism no matter how harsh is welcome.


Yes I have had people look over my resume I just don't look good compared to experienced candidates.

353l31,3,2015-05-06,I'm [M 20] not sure if my feelings for my friend of 3 years [F 20] are loneliness/rebound or genuine &amp; lasting.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/353l31/im_m_20_not_sure_if_my_feelings_for_my_friend_of/,"I'm taking a semester to do a co-op (internship for college credit) across the country from where I and everyone involved go to school. Right at the beginning of the term “Kaylee” [F 20, ~3 yrs relationship] broke up with me.  The whole process was rather long and drawn out, and really only ended about a month ago when she started a new relationship and has kind of cut me out of her life. Her life, back at college, moves forward, but I've been feeling stuck in the same place out here. I've never been great at making new friends quickly, so I don't have much of anyone in this town to talk to or hang out with, except my older co-workers, who have families and lives of their own. I've made a few loose friends in my apartment block, but nothing anywhere close to fulfilling. There was a while when it was literally hard to get out of bed in the morning, but that's at least a little better now.

Through it all “Anna” [F, 20] has been incredibly supportive. She goes to the same school as Kaylee and I, has been pretty close friends with me since freshman year, and is doing a co-op this semester about four hours away from where I am. I'm also pretty sure she's been interested in me romantically for a while, but hasn't said or done anything because of Kaylee. I've grown a lot closer to her, both through being sorta-nearby (we've spent the occasional weekend visiting each other, gone to concerts in the nearby city) and through her support. She's a wonderful person, and I feel like I'm in love with her.

I don't totally trust myself here. I'm still out-of-sorts, from the breakup and from general loneliness. I'd been with Kaylee since high school and there's a big hole in my life where she left, so I wonder if I'm just grabbing the nearest person I can confide in and hoping she'll fill all the gaps in my life. 

Worse, I don't think I'm physically attracted to Anna. She's in no way ugly, just not my type? I'd shrug this off, but Kaylee broke up with me partially because of our shitty sex life, and I've cheated before. (That was in high school, it’s what ending my previous relationship and started things off with Kaylee.) Yes, I think I've learned, no that doesn't mean I don't worry anything I start with Anna would take a nosedive as soon as someone prettier came along. I don't want to start something that's destined to end in cheating or even in just leaving her for someone else, ‘cause I really value the friendship I've built with her.

But most of my communication with Anna (like most people in my life right now) is through text-based communication, so I forget I'm not attracted to her and find myself flirting with her because, god help me, I love who she is and the connection we've built. I flirt even when we’re together, and I end up hating myself for it. I worry I'm leading her on with something that could never be, but I also don't want to shut the door on anything ever happening. 

So what's my deal? Am I building Anna up for a let-down when I decide I'm not interested (now, or after a ""misguided"" relationship starts)? Would this be a rebound relationship doomed to fail (if it isn't already that in all but name)? Should I make a move, wait until I've got my life together and we're back at school in the fall, or somehow let her down now/next time I see her? Is this worry about whether I'd be attracted to her shallow and self-deceiving, or deeply self-aware? 

**TL;DR: I love this girl, but I'm not attracted to her. Do I start what could be a disastrous rebound relationship with the girl whose friendship I value most right now, leave her hanging for a few months until I figure things out, or somehow put a relationship with her off-limits indefinitely?**"

Slow servers, heavy traffic problem",[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/353vwy/what_would_you_do_slow_servers_heavy_traffic/,"This scenario is currently hosted on Spiceworks in the Networking forum. Our interns are providing details and answering questions, so if you have a Spiceworks account and want to submit your solution, find us on the Networking forum!

Curvature's newest interns have been tasked with a project. They are to imagine they are working as IT consultants, but we need YOUR help to guide them to the best-fit scenario!

Comment below to give our interns helpful suggestions about what they should do!

Here is the situation:

You are working as an IT infrastructure consultant and have been contracted to provide networking, server, and storage advice to a small software development company based out of Santa Barbara, California. The company, named AppSB, has a server-based network, but their projections for future expansion and growth are necessitating the deployment of a forward-looking infrastructure that can handle their increasing data demands. The company is scheduled to move into a larger facility in June to accommodate a workforce that is expanding from 20 to over 50 employees.

Working on a rather conservative IT budget and cognizant of their cost constraints ($15 -20K), management is looking for creative and innovative ways to optimize their new systems for cost and performance. Their current network consists of a single router, two switches and a single server, a small IT infrastructure that manages the entirety of business operations: inventory, ordering, sales, tech support, transaction data, and provides an Internet connection. The company is comprised of five departments: management, sales, research and development, finance, and marketing. They all connect to the central server through high-speed Internet connections. Numerous employees have reported having problems with heavy traffic and slow server response at various times throughout the workday. Management does not exactly know where the traffic originates or what type of traffic it is and additionally has not been able to determine whether the heavy traffic times every day warrant a change in their connection methods to complement their desired hardware upgrades.

The router currently deployed in AppSB’s network is a CISCO2811, while the switch and server consist of a small 24 port FastEthernet unmanaged switch and a Dell 2U 2950 rack, respectively.

Given this information and aware of AppSB’s budget limitations, what hardware and/or software recommendations would you make that could address the company’s immediate and future needs?﻿"
353wac,0,2015-05-06,"14 months in to a 36 month Toyota Corolla lease, 24K/36K miles used",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/353wac/14_months_in_to_a_36_month_toyota_corolla_lease/,"So I am just now becoming financially conscious, thanks to the help of this subreddit. I've lived most of my life with the idea that future me will figure everything out, which hasn't been great financially. I'm now looking back at a financial decision from last year and wondering if A) I'm an idiot and B) if something smarter could have been done.

Last February, I had quite the surprise when I went out to my 2007 Hyundai Elantra early one morning and found the entire parking lot underwater. It was -4 degrees in the Chicagoland area, and a nearby condo building's fire hydrant had a main break that caused thousands of gallons/minute to flood the lot, with ice blocking the drains.

Once the water cleared about 2 hours later (about half way up the drivers door) I was surprisingly able to get my car up and running. I drove it for nearly an hour to keep it warm. I had called my parent's State Farm Insurance Agent, and he advised that I immediately take it to a body shop to keep it warm so they could inspect it.

The next step was to get a rental car, and because of our policy we didn't have rental insurance. So I drove a minivan for $25/day, hoping it would be a short problem.

At this time, I was a graduate student making $13/hour as an intern, but I had a full-time job offer for $50k upon graduation. I had about $750 saved in the bank. The $25/day for the rental was painful, so I started looking for my next move.

After playing phone tag with State Farm and having my case transferred to Arizona for whatever reason, it took nearly a week for them to come out and inspect the car. By that time, the car had been full of water for 7 days and despite being in the auto shop the lines started to freeze up. State Farm decided to total the car, and ended up giving me an offer that was above the KBB, so I thought it was fair. The Elantra had 155k miles on it (long-distance girlfriend and a long commute between work/school)

All in all, it took nearly a month to get the check for $5,500. Since it was my parents insurance/car, they got the check but agreed to give it to me since I needed the car for work/school. They are very bad with money as well, and had to take $1,000 of the check for their own problems. I didn't mind, it was their car and at the time I felt things looked pretty positive with a $50k/year job coming up, which was what my father was making at 53. Sounded like a lot of money at the time.

With the $25/day ticking time bomb burning through my cash, I was feeling desperate. I had been in talks with a Toyota Dealership, and had my eyes on a 2014 Toyota Corolla. In hindsight, I really would have been fine getting another used Hyundai Elantra with like 75k miles on it, but I was so focused on graduating and starting my new job that I didn't really put the research in to how to buy a used vehicle and obtain financing. The lease just seemed easier. Additionally, I liked the lower monthly payment.

I now have a 2014 Toyota Corolla S Plus that had an MSRP of about $~21k. I negotiated the total value down to about $18,000, and the sales guy threw in a model with a sun roof and back up cam. I put $2,000 down with about $1,000 in taxes/registration/6 months insurance, and with the signing fee it came out to $180/month. The original plan was to take that extra $2,000 of insurance money for the next year of car payments, but with my savings crashed from the car rental it only lasted about 12 months.

The goal with the lease has been to buy it out at the end, which is a buyout of about $13,000. When I did the math, I figured a 3 year old car with ~60,000 miles was around $13,000, so I figured I'd rather have my own car that I had put those miles on.... possibly recklessly.

So here I am 14 months later, and I still love the car. My plan is to get it to buy it out after the 36 months and keep driving it to 250K+ miles. However, I am a little confused about the mileage overage. My understanding was that if I bought the car at the end, I wouldn't owe the .20cent/mile penalty, but I've seen conflicting information on this? If so I may be in a tough position at the end, because I am driving close to 22k miles a year (yes maybe the lease wasn't smart).

Also, did I leave any money on the table with the rental? The condo association was at fault for their line and my understanding is that my insurance company went after them for subrogation, but as an individual I did not. Is it just tough luck that I had that happen to me, or should I have looked in to something else?

Thank you all in advance for reading through this mess!"

3543on,2,2015-05-06,"My ""Get Out of Credit Debt"" Plan",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3543on/my_get_out_of_credit_debt_plan/,"For reference, I am 25 and my job pays ~$35k gross annually. I say about as this is influenced by overtime, as I am hourly staff.

Due to some poor choices during university--a mixture of impulse purchases, fraternity dues that I could have avoided, and a period where I didn't have any income--I ended up with around $2700 of credit debt, on two cards. Since, I have closed the $700 card but still carry around $1900 on a card with Citi, which has 19.99% APR.

I opened another card about a year ago with the plan to pay bills with it (that I already pay) to earn travel points but that hasn't gone well, as you can imagine. Due to purchases and some emergencies it is around $7900. So currently I carry close to $10k in credit debt.

Now, I can't have this forever. So, I've started to formulate my plan:

-I opened a Chase SLATE card, which has 0% APR and 0% balance transfer fees or APR, and will carry half of my Citi balance there ($980). 
-With my Citi card balance now halved, I will start my debt snowball there and throw as much as possible into that. My monthly budget is set so that my funds are allocated for $1k, which is normally what I make per pay period without extra overtime. Anything I make above that automatically goes to the debt.

-I also have a couple of other revenue streams, not much. Somewhere between $150-200 monthly if I do the legwork, which will go into the card, though this fluctuates. I may have another $300 coming my way this summer if someone decides to bum at my place for an internship.

-I have not been aggressive about saving. At all. So now my monthly budget has included savings. Additionally, the plan is to also dump into savings half of my rent, so that my rent doesn't come out of one paycheck, which is demoralizing. 

I do have monthly loan payments (student loans) to worry about, but I have made those consistently since they started, without missing a payment. I know how damaging that can be to my profile. My goal is to have enough of my credit debt wiped out by the time I have to take on another loan that my parents have been taking care of the past few years.

The last piece of this puzzle is the card with the $7900 balance. My issue here is that I have a crossfit membership that is linked to that, which I'm bound to until August. Even if I put my membership on hold I would have to continue the payments through August. I figured that when I started i could handle it but, apparently, I couldn't. This is obviously a big chunk of my finances and was a huge mistake. When my term ends I will not renew.

My credit cards sit in a drawer in my room so as not to use them--my wallet can't accommodate them anyway--I have the important things in there like my license and debit card. I don't want the temptation to use them even if I have credit free.

Obviously there is a lot of stuff here. A lot of stupid shit to get together but an earnest attempt to really plan and budget and get things in order. Thankfully my credit is pretty good, between 716-731 so I'm not in a ruinous state. But I'd rather be secure and financially independent.

If anyone has any suggestions or ideas or advice I'd love to hear it. It's just nice to write this down somewhere to keep myself accountable.

Cheers!"

So a little bit background of me:
An undergraduate majoring in CS that just landed an internship at a startup based in Jakarta (kuningan to be exact). I am originally from Surabaya and currently studying in the States so I am pretty much know nothing about Jakarta. 

I got a few question to ask you guys:

1. Can you guys give me any idea about how much does a kost cost in the area? 
1. What kind of public transportation that I should know?
1. Do anyone here knows a great ""kost-kostan""?

Well, this semester ended and I got a D in one course. I was doing well in it until the final, which I completely bombed. It didn't bring my GPA down too badly, I'll have a 3.4-3.5, and I'm typically a good student, but I'm debating on doing grade forgiveness. My minor in CS depended on taking one class this summer, but if I do grade forgiveness for this course, I can't take the other one since the times conflict. I don't want to take it next summer either because I want to get an internship.

I then thought that I could take a few CS classes my last couple years and go for a master's in CS, but looking at the courses many programs suggest taking, I know there's no way I can fit them in my schedule and stay sane. I also really don't want to spend an extra semester here because money. How important are those classes? Are some more crucial than others? Do I have a chance of getting in? Should I just keep the bad grade and keep the CS minor? I don't know if it's relevant, but I have CS related research lined up.

**TL;DR: I am a biomedical engineering major who can't fit a lot of computer science classes into my schedule. Is it possible to get into a CS master's program without a ton of experience?**

My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years. We were both in high-school when we started dating. We both were really into the relationship and decided to continue it during college. It was a little awkward for a time because she is a year older than me, plus we went to different colleges at first. She decided to change to a major for which my school had a good program, and we decided to move in together as we're now in the same college.    
    
My major is very time demanding. I spend most of my free time studying. Her major is also very time consuming, but very different from mine in virtually all aspects (think Math vs. Art).    
    
We had a very good relationship for a time while living together, but things began to change over a year ago. She worked hard for her major and was always disappointed in the criticism she would receive. She also had a very hard time making friends in her major (a problem we both share). She joined a community on a website (I don't want to be too specific), that practices ""role-playing."" I thought that it was a great idea at the time. She went from seeming bored all the time to being the bright, fun-loving person with whom I fell in love 6 years ago.     
    
That fucking website ruined everything I loved about her.    
    
Last summer I worked full time for a summer internship. She didn't have anything to do, so she spent what I imagine as every waking hour she wasn't with me on that website.     
    
By the time we came back to school for Fall semester, she was completely immersed in this community. Aside from watching a couple of shows a week while eating, we rarely talked. I always reached out to her to spend time with me. I took an interest in her projects and helped her with many of them. She doesn't find anything I do interesting, so she doesn't return the favor.
    
I've told her several times over the past 6 months what this had been doing to her and our relationship. She was spending so much time on this website that her projects weren't getting done on time, and when they were, the work was so sloppy that she would get a terrible grade.
    
Time and time again, she told me that I wasn't telling her anything she didn't already know and that I ""don't understand."" 
    
This brings us to three days ago. She went out and left her laptop and her phone at the apartment. I didn't have the intention of looking through her computer. One thing led to another and I just happened to decide to take a peek (we both know each other's passwords).
    
In her messaging app, there are unfathomably large numbers of messages to people I assume are in this online community. She has mentioned many of these people by name to me before, so I didn't have a hard time figuring out who was who.
    
I came to one thread that broke my heart. I saw that she was sending some guy messages saying ""I love you."" 
    
This thread was only two weeks old, and she managed to say that she loved him over 100 times. The realization hit me like a train. She was in love with some fucking guy, and she was spending all of her time talking to him online instead of talking to me or doing her work.
    
I thought of all the times she sat next to me in our apartment with her laptop screen facing the other way, because she was ""embarrassed"" to have me look at what she was working on. Every single one of those times, she was telling this asshole that she loved him, while I'm fucking inches away.
    
She was out most of that day, but when she came home I confronted her. I wasn't mean. I didn't curse or yell. She admitted it. She told me flat out that she was in love with him. ""Oh, but it's not the way it looks."" ""He just reminded me so much of you."" She told me that she loved me so much more than anything else. I told her I wasn't sure if I believed her. I told her that she had succeeded in completely destroying all of the trust I built up with her over the past 6 years. There were years of silence between anything we said. She told me she would stop talking to him. She told me she would leave the online community. I didn't know what to say at the time, but after I saw how sad she seemed at the idea of losing me, I thought that maybe she could change. I thought maybe we can make it work, and I told her that.
    
I wanted to tell her I was leaving her right there and then, but I knew that I was really emotional and perhaps wasn't in the right mind to make decisions. We're having finals this week. As I'm finishing writing this, I have just one left. For some reason I can't fathom, I still helped her out to finish her portfolio for its final review. She handed it in this morning and got her grade back hours ago. She got a C, which means she didn't fail out of her major like she would've had I not helped her.
    
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm destroyed. I want to hate her forever for what she's done, but I don't know if I have it in me. I don't know if I can be in a romantic relationship with her anymore.
There's more. Maybe I'll add it in an edit later.


tl;dr – GF of 6 years has been cheating on me emotionally with a guy she met RPing online. She admitted it and promised to stop. I'm destroyed.

354fks,1,2015-05-06,I [25 M] caught with my soon to be fiance [23 F] of &gt;2 years messaging her ex,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/354fks/i_25_m_caught_with_my_soon_to_be_fiance_23_f_of_2/,"Throwaway and I apologize for the length.

Back story: Previously to me my girlfriend (who I am set to be engaged to at the end of the month and living with shortly after) had been sleeping with her professor. She had had issues with it and felt that she was taken advantage of and needed to 'get closure', which she did by reaching out to him  about 4 months ago.  Also before this he had been attempting to reopen lines of communication despite knowing about me. I asked her to block him. That was that, I thought it was settled.


Fast forward to now:
Yesterday after work I headed over to my girlfriend (Call her Sarah) to spend the night. While on the way she asked me to swing by the store to grab some sugar cookies 'since she is on her period' and I oblige. After some brief hugs and kisses she quickly grabs her phone and walks with into the bathroom saying ' I swear I always have to shit when you are here.' 

She knew I was half coming over to use her computer, because my Word Starter is awful, and I instantly hop on it. Well she has her iphone and mac hooked up and within two min there is a ding displaying a message, from her cousin. She sounds a feeble 'is that my computer'? Sarah rushes to finish up. Right as she approaches there is another ding and a name pops up only as ""A."" Not realizing anything I jokingly ask 'Oh and who is A?' She drops the bomb of who it is. The professor. 

I flip out just saying 'nope' and packing up. She starts trying to explain that she was trying to meet him today to talk. I say ok and take a moment to step outside and breath. Wrong move. I come back in and say I need to see the messages. She says 'I deleted all of them'. 

Side note: We had already had issues because of his trying to reach out to her often and she was in his class last semester. I asked her not to remain in contact because it makes me feel uncomfortable. 

Now we have never snooped through each others phones before as it had always been a general rule and we were trusting. Plus she always says it freaks her out if I touch her tech. So this was a first. 

Obvious fight ensues and I  ask her why she hid this from me and went behind my back instead of letting me know she was going to do this, and deleting the thread. I tell her I am too shell shocked to handle it tonight and am going to leave. She cries and asks me not to leave her but agrees to letting me think. I tell her I love her and leave.

This morning we talk while I am at work and I tell her that I am distrusting of her for lying and arranging a meeting that I felt uncomfortable with behind my back. Even when I would eventually be ok with it if I had had a heads up. She apologizes and said she needed closure and she just didn't want to fight. (We have been fighting a lot lately due to stress of her leaving for an internship and me starting another degree).

Later in the day she starts sending me very angry messages saying she is done and we are through. And we start fighting. She basically tells me that I need to get the fuck over it. She says she understands why I wouldn't trust her and says she would leave me if the roles were reversed.  Many comments of if we retrieved (my suggestion) the thread can we 'shut the fuck up about this'. She doesn't seem to understand why I am flipping out, and thinks I am being controlling. 

Her stance is pretty much I need to get over it she'll apologize that 'I feel that way' and then it has to be a wash and I just have to trust her. I actually do and know she didn't cheat but worry about emotional cheating and feelings for her ex. The biggest issue is the way she handled it. Not apologetic, placing the blame on me, reacting very angrily. She wants me to be a door mat and just take whatever.

354i87,1,2015-05-06,26M4F Unleash your inner slut; five prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/354i87/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_slut_five_prompts/,"I've had a LOT of fun with these prompts in the past, and I'm at it again. A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages. Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing. Seriously, it REALLY gets me off to know what I'm writing is getting another woman off, too.

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you tonight!"
354jkk,3,2015-05-06,In need of career choosing advice. Thx!,vickypath,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/354jkk/in_need_of_career_choosing_advice_thx/,"Hi all,

I graduated last year from a top 30 school in chemical engineering. Due to lack of internship experience, I was unemployed for 9 months. In March this year, I applied for an engineer position with one big company, but they interviewed me for a technician position. I was so desperate to get a job so I took the offer and moved myself across the country. 

This big company hires a lot of ChemE and the manager told me during the interview that he knows I have a BS in ChemE and this is a technician position they are offering, but as I grow, I will probably find more projects to work on, etc... Also, this position pays better than other technician positions. Therefore, I took the job. 

Last week, I was contacted by another company, which I applied in Feb, (a very small environmental company in my home state) for an Associate Engineer position. I interviewed with the president last Saturday and now they invited me for an on-site interview. I really wish this opportunity could come sooner before I accepting the job offer.

Now I'm torn whether I should go interview for the Associate Engineer position or not. One of my friend told me that technician is more likely for someone with Associate degree and Associate Engineer position is for someone with BA. I'm not sure if that's true. Since I just started this new job, if I jump boat, that will make a very bad impression I assume. And I don't know whether working for a small company (less than 10 people) is a better choice. 

If someone has any thoughts on this situation, please let me know. I would really appreciate any input. 

Thank you all in advance!"

354q58,4,2015-05-06,How beneficial are internships during the summer between semesters?,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/354q58/how_beneficial_are_internships_during_the_summer/,"Preface: this isn't a troll, I'm using a secondary burn account since I may be giving a little too much info. 

I'm a **computer science major**

Okay, so I'm in a situation where I could theoretically have internships lined up for 3 summers. One this summer is already decided for sure, it's a government agency comp sci internship. 

My other internships are possibly with Northrop Grumman. It's through their scholarship program where I am given a 2.5k scholarship each year and can renew it by interning for them two years. So that equates to pretty poor pay (technically unpaid but the scholarship obviously)


So, would these internships help my future job prospects? I hear that in comp sci your resume really doesn't matter nearly as much as other career fields. I'm going to a college where start ups are pretty common and the mediocre ones are always looking for cheap code monkeys. 

Considering the scholarships are low enough, do you think it'd be better to make more money working for a crappy start up? I feel like the start up would give me more intensive experience but the name of Northrop Grumman may also help in grabbing a future job?


I mean theoretically I could do this with my summers:

* Senior HS: Gov agency (paid) intern

* Frosh: NorthGrumm (unpaid) intern

* Soph: NorthGrumm (unpaid) intern

* Junior: Start up or research

Senior: graduating...


But that locks me out of either undergrad research or a start up over the summer. 


Okay some may say I'm over planning but I like planning ahead and it worked well for me in high school

it’s my first post on this forum although i’ve been lurking anonymously for a while and i made a throwaway account just to make this post so apologies for bad formatting etc. (still getting the hang of things)   this post is going to be pretty massive (even though ive tried my best to make sure it’s the “condensed” version) and im assuming pretty messy since there’s a tonne on my mind and i guess i just needed somewhere to let it out and someone to bounce ideas off so here i am.  i guess my issues might be “insignificant” compared to some of the others on this forum but to me, it’s still doing my head in so any responses at all would be really appreciated.

      
**please skip to TLDR at the end as necessary - thanks for reading and your help in advance!!**    


so i turned 21 in the middle of last year (2014) and ever since then my life has gone into crazy tornado mode.   although i presume change is pretty normal at this stage in my life (just turned 21, a recent college graduate etc) i’ve been faced with and am still facing some pretty difficult decisions which have and will directly and indirectly affect the rest of my life.  (or so it appears to me at least)

 


as mentioned, i recently graduated from my 4 year undergraduate college degree from my home country.  my family (parents and brother) moved overseas to the USA as soon as i started college in order to be closer to my other relatives and also to give my younger brother better college opportunities in the future (everyone knows that USA still has many of the top colleges in the world).  at the time, I could not move with them as i had just missed the college application deadlines and i did not want to wait another year before starting college when i could start straight away in my home country.  in addition, i had just been offered an internship with a large firm in my home country which i felt was a good opportunity at the time.  hence for the next 4 years i rented a place, paid for it myself with my internship money and completed my college degree.  during those 4 years of college i met my boyfriend of the time in the first semester of first year and we started dating since then and for the next three years.  

soon after we started dating, our two friendship groups merged into one and over the course of the next few years of college, everyone within the group became incredibly close (about 10 people with 1 or 2 joining and leaving over the years).  after my 21st birthday, one of the other guys in our group (lets call him C) and i became increasingly close as C’s best friend “L” had gone overseas for exchange so i guess C was just looking for someone to hangout with etc. absolutely no ill intentions from either of us.  my boyfriend at the time “B” (B for boyfriend) was a really chilled, trusting, easy going kind of guy but we had different interests.  i was the typical college party girl and i partied hard, he was social too but he didnt drink and preferred sober chilled outings/dinners with friends as opposed to the crazy party life but still he allowed me to do what i wanted with very few complaints.  he wasn’t the jealous type and would happily let me go out with other guys even 1 on 1 because he trusted me not to do anything that would hurt him.  unforunately his trust was misplaced.  one night C and I were out - B was actually there too it was the three of us for dinner but B had to go home early because he had an early start the next day but C and I didnt have much to do so we decided to stay out for a bit longer.  C and I had already started drinking (C was also the party type) while B was still with us but it wasnt until B left that we got drunk … and then it happened.  C and i shared a kiss.  

 i don’t need a lecture on this, im not proud of what happened and i realise what i allowed to happen was incredibly selfish, disrespectful and downright scum.  C and I both realised that so we decided to distance ourselves from each other.  I tried to save the relationship between B and I, reasoning not to tell him about the incident as it was a one off thing that would only hurt him and his trust if he knew.  But in truth, that was already the beginning of the end, once that line was crossed there was no return.  Although C and I both tried to distance ourselves, we would inevitably see each other in the same friendship circle etc.  We still got closer even though we tried to stay away and one night we ended up sleeping together.  (scum scum scum…) 

 Eventually B and I got into a pretty big argument over the declining state of our relationship in general. (inevitable considering what i had done)  At the same time C was giving me an ultimatum saying that he couldnt be “that guy” anymore.  I knew that there was no going back after what I had done to B and that it completely wasnt fair to B that I wasn’t 100% his anymore so after that big argument, after 3 years of dating, i broke things off with B without telling him the real reason for the break up in fear of hurting him and ruining his trusting nature forever.  I had no intention of getting with C at the time.  Even though C and I had a pretty good “connection” both physically and emotionally, we both knew that we could be nothing more than FWB at most because of the deception and lies from which our relationship was founded on.  we never thought about a future together but for the next few months after i broke up with B, C more or less served as my “rebound” (rebound in the sense that he was the person i was spending all my days with now) although in doing so C eventually confessed to me that he had been developing feelings and was ready to look past our history. eventually some time later, i realised and accepted these feelings as mutual.  

back to the point about my family now - so as i mentioned i just graduated, not long after C confessed his feelings, i took an extended leave from work (that internship that i was doing) in order to visit my family for 3 months.  now, my family was pressuring me to stay with them in the USA now that I had completed my degree.  although i didnt have a job in the USA, my family desperately wanted me to stay anyway to try either get employment with any small firm or even continue studying if that was possible.  this was all however unguaranteed as to whether or not i would be accepted into a grad school/masters degree (my marks were very subpar due to my party life… i know… shameful) or if i would be successful in gaining employment.  my family raised the point how even though i was working my internship (now turned full time graduate role after my graduation) back home, the cost of living (rent) would render me worse off than if i took up a role in the USA which paid even just HALF of what i was being paid at home.  although the internship back home was difficult (long hours for very basic pay) it was for a reputable company but the key thing was i wasnt sure it was something that i wanted to do for the rest of my life.  another point to consider though was my residency with the USA - if i chose to return to my home country to live and work, i would forgo my US “green card” residency which you may know is quite a valuable thing to have. (people marry into the US just to get this … )  

during my 3 month stay with my family in the USA (i’m still here at the moment actually) an interview opportunity presented itself back home in the form of a graduate program with another company which was in an industry that i objectively would have liked more than the current one i was in however, in light of multiple reasons such as the cost to change my air ticket to go back for an interview where the position wasn’t even guaranteed to be mine and the fact that i would have to start a fresh with younger graduates and have no “edge” gained through my internship work with the initial company etc. i decided with much difficulty and reluctance to forgo the interview opportunity back home and stay for the rest of the 3 months as intended.  

now that i am drawing closer to the end of my 3 months stay, the dilemma is becoming increasingly pressing as to whether i should go back home to continue my life in the internship/graduate job that i have done for a few years already although it is difficult and i dont love and dont intend on staying in the industry for the rest of my life (but im hoping there will be exit opportunities down the track to other industries etc), whether i should go back home to a guy with whom i have a messy history but i feel that i am truly compatible with, a guy who challenges me to grow as a person and as a couple but face the rest of our friendship group/my now ex (B) and forgo the opportunity of being with my family, watching my younger brother grow up, forgo the opportunity of the potential to find a better job in an industry which i like working in and also give up my residency status here in the US.   

it’s been a crazy 10 months or so for me but one way or another i’m glad that i’ll be over soon. 

thanks for reading, and any comments would be appreciated.  i just feel that theres so much uncertainty right now and i get that everybody’s choices are half chance but i guess any feedback would be appreciated as to my weird situation. THANK YOU!! 

**TL;DR -  should i move to a new country in order to be with my family or should i go back to my home country to a guy that i’m interested in having a relationship with? (career considerations also for both)**

**Home country:**

PROS:  

- guy im interested in pursuing a relationship with (although we have a complicated history)

  
- established job in large firm (although not in my preferred industry)

  
CONS: 

- living costs are incredibly expensive (close to 50% of my income)  

**USA:**  
PROS :

- my family

 
- green card residency status 

- no need to pay living expenses (rent)  

CONS: 


- unemployed (unsure if i can find a job or even if i could it may be in a much smaller firm with less career advancement opportunities) 

- having to start over (friends/network and connections etc)

I had the luck of visiting last Wednesday when there was a shooting on the same block and the street was closed, I'm assuming that type of thing almost never happens though.I don't have the luxury to ask people around the town as I'm currently in Cleveland.

I've heard very split things from friends about this district, one family friend saying, its still very dangerous at night, while friends from school saying its fine.

I start on the 18th any advice? Should I look for an apartment in the suburbs? I know this is an area of urban revival, but is it safe  at night to live in as well? I would like to be closer to night life, so I don't have to pay for a cab on the Weekends.

A while back, I began an internship at a software company. They gave me and the other interns a short training period on the core concepts and technologies that they use, and then threw us in the deep end to start writing code, full stack web development. It was a blast! Recently, they hired me as a true employee.
  
I'm still in college, completing my CS degree, but I've found that as the semesters have passed since beginning with this company, my motivation in school has increasingly tanked. Assignments and content are no longer motivating and I find myself caring less and less about the degree. It feels like even the surliest of bugfixes bring a greater sense of accomplishment and joy than re-learning the same algorithms for the fourth semester in a row.  
  
I don't think this is a case of senioritis, as I had never felt this way up until programming professionally, but I feel like I'm really in a corner here. Do any of you have experience with this? Did you stay in school and complete the degree? If so, how did you keep yourself motivated? I really want to finish the degree, considering I'm already a senior (though I have one more year left), so any tips on motivation would be fantastic.

We're running on a tight budget and are generally understaffed. We get by but there are many things that are just never taken care of. This combined with a very relaxed atmosphere means if someone wants to help out with anything they're generally allowed to do so regardless of their field.

This means I've basically become the IT guy (I even [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2vn9y5/i_speak_computer/) in /r/talesfromtechsupport).

THE SITUATION.
In a month I'll be graduating my Master's degree in Linguistics in one of the best universities of Russia.
I have an opportunity to work in a foreign embassy for 1-4 years with a decent starting salary ~ 3700$/month.
Problem is - I've completed an internship in the Russian embassy to one of the East Asia's countries and I didn't like it one bit. Everyone there acted like convicted who are serving their sentences. Nobody's happy with their profession and would gladly try some other field. But they have their contracts that require them to work for years and years to come. In a nutshell - they're hooked for life.
Whereas I have yet to sign any contract and I... I want to escape it all.
I want to study abroad. I want to go the Netherlands or some other nice country and study my ass off (I'm turning 23 in a month) in either Linguistics, Pedagogics or Computer Programming.

THE PROBLEM.
I am scared of getting too old and not having a career - that's why I might take that embassy job, but in the end I will be miserable - I just know it. If I go and study, I'll be 27 something when I graduate with no connections in a completely foreign country (I've been abroad only to one country during one month internship).
I don't know what course should I take: I have worked as a simultaneous interpreter for 2 years now (I'm very good at it - even my own government hire me when they need to get things done), I was a teacher for 7 months and a tutor for 11 months and I loved it (because of a flexible timetable, I'd hate to be tied down to some school or university and work 9 to 5), whereas I don't know a first thing about Computer Programming but I always wanted to try it.

Important note: all my friends say that I need a creative job where I would have a total freedom over things. That's why I'm a successful interpreter - because I do what I want to do and get good results. Same goes for teaching/tutoring. Is programming the same thing? How creative can you get? Do you have a freedom of your project? Can you recommend any other fields relevant to my skills? (I know Russian, English and Spanish - these are my only skills, to be honest).

I have three questions to you, dear Reddit:
1.Would you take up that job in an embassy? Mind you, they want to put my in Central Asia/Africa/South America

2.If not, what course would you take up: Linguistics/Pedagogics/Computer Programming? Can I earn something in Europe as a linguist or a tutor/teacher? What about programmer? OR RECOMMEND ME ANY OTHER COURSE THAT WOULD SUIT MY SKILLS AND NEEDS!

3.In what country/university would you study and why? I really want to study somewhere in Europe because I could finally travel by bike and go green to the max. Budget is, of course, a sensitive issue.




You are my only hope. Literally. Everyone else thinks I should take that embassy job because ""money"". But I'm really scared of moving anywhere on my own. And not having career by the time I turn 25. "

He and I have been living about twelve hours' drive apart for the last year, and we're sick of it.

Well, my parents were not happy to hear this at all. They kind of went ballistic, and the truth finally came out as to exactly what they think of my relationship. They called my boyfriend all sorts of horrible names––manipulative (because, in their eyes, he's trying to distance me from them), lazy (his grades were much worse than mine in undergrad, where we met), disrespectful (he was rude to them, and then never adequately thanked them for taking us on a trip four years ago) and unmotivated (he wants to work for a while instead of going straight to grad school). 

But the most important factor, in their minds, is our age: they think my boyfriend and I are *far* too young to be moving in together. They say it's unseemly to do that before your late 20's... and besides, personal growth is best accomplished while living alone, and in their view I need some more time to accomplish that.

From my perspective, this is a little ridiculous. The last nine months have been lonely and depressing... I've made good friends here, but I still miss my boyfriend a great deal.

This wouldn't be a big deal to me, except for two reasons: 1) my parents are still paying for my living expenses, on their own insistence (believe me, I tried insisting on taking out student loans, but they strongarmed me into letting them help), and 2) they're threatening to substantially cut contact, for good, if I move in with my boyfriend. Not no-contact, per se, but I would definitely lose all their respect, and their friendship, both of which I value very highly.

I guess my question is this: based on the (admittedly limited) info I've provided, am I being unreasonable? Or are they? What's the standard age when it's acceptable to move in with one's SO? If I move in anyway, what steps can I take to help gain their respect back?
   
**tl;dr**: Parents hate boyfriend, I want to move in with boyfriend, parents might hate me too. :("

I applied to a bunch of the big names in the bay area and a couple in DC, though I think it's too late for most of them, and now I'm applying to jobs where I live.

The problem is that where I live (city of ~1m in the South), there aren't very many software companies. I'm going to apply to all of the decent-sized ones in my city, but I feel like I have slim odds since I'm a rising sophomore, it's already May, and none of them are very big.  I am 3 hours shy of senior standing though, so I have taken a decent amount of CS and math classes.

I do think there is a very good chance that I can get a job in IT / IT consulting / Systems Engineering in my city. Would this be an acceptable alternative to an actual software job considering it's my first summer of college? For what it's worth, I plan on making an app, website, and potentially setting up a server for the app on my own this summer, so I think I'll still be picking up some good coding experience. "

Honestly this is the first time I've considered the possibility, but I need to pick something sooner rather than later. 

I've been reading about it, and what scares me is that it appears as if getting into med-school depends to a great degree on things like extra-curricular and volunteer hours. If I decide to do it, I would be committed, I would be willing to go to great lengths to keep the option open, but I'm not sure if it's possible to keep up with the joneses and hold down an engineering internship.

I'm wondering if anyone else has taken a similar path. How is it working out for you? "

I want advice on what to do regarding getting a job with my set of skills:

* I am able to type over 135+ words/700 keystrokes a minute.
* I'm creative (with text). 
* I know a lot about computers (Windows mainly, I lack skills in actually putting one together though). 
* I have two degrees in Marketing (but I hate it, I know I should've figured that out sooner while I was getting my degrees). I just think it's boring work, and it's really something I don't want to do. 

My previous job had me working as a content specialist, where I'd create texts/descriptions for computers, videogames, toys, clothes, headsets, tablets, phones. Whatever, you name it. I got laid off on the 31st of December (contract wasn't extended). I then took a few months 'off' because of health issues. Now I'm fully back in my game, but I have no idea what I should do. 

I have the knowledge, interest and skills to do work with computers, but I don't have the neccessary papers to say 'hey, I'm good at this'. I could look for a data entry job (which I'd be very good and efficient at because of my typing), but it wouldn't pay a lot. I've looked into a bunch of content specialist jobs, but they also require me to update their social media channels. I've tried that in the past (as an internet marketing intern) and that didn't go so well. I'm kind of stuck, I'm hesitant. I'm nervous. One thing I do know is, I don't want to go back to school. Sure, I'd follow courses to be able to get further in life while gaining more skills, but I don't want to attend school for another 4 years. 

So here I am Reddit. Humbly asking for advice. Maybe from people who have been in the same situation, or who just want to chip in. I'm all ears, and grateful for any advice!"

Not being from DC, I am flying out there and will need to pay for my own housing. If I am able to win this competition, I will have nearly half of my housing covered from it and it will make the financial aspect of moving out of state for 10 weeks much easier.

I am working for a new social media app here at Purdue! It combines all of the aspects of Snapchat, YikYak, Twitter, and Instagram but brings them all together in one app. It is available at 8 different campuses and will be launching many more this fall. 

I am moving to Washington DC to work on the summer marketing with the parent company, Moko Social Media.

The campuses that Speakiesy is at is as follows: 

1) Purdue 

2) Indiana University 

3) Boston Unviersity 

4) University of Florida 

5) UC- Santa Barbra 

6) Ohio State 

7) UNC - Chapel Hill 

8) U-Penn


The following download link works for anyone at these colleges, as long as they select their university upon registration. 

It will connect them with those on their campus. I just have customized the bit.ly link for advertising here at Purdue.
Here is the download link : http://bit.ly/PurdueSpeakiesy


The main reason why this app is targeted at Greek Life is because when traveling from campus to campus, we obtain the contact information of the University officials as well as IFC and other greek governing bodies on said campuses.


Registration requires the use of a .edu from the user so we blacklist the Greek Governing bodies to allow free use of the app within Greek life. Doing this at Purdue allowed the Greek Community to feel more at ease. 

**We also hold fundraisers for Greek organizations only, allowing them to raise money via speakiesy for the philanthropy or even just if they want to get a new flat screen tv.**

On all of our campuses, the *Campus Founders Interns* are primarily made up of student within the Greek Community.

Also, if you are interested in a position (even if you are not on one of the aforementioned campuses, we might be coming your way this summer/fall!) please fill out the following application!

If you have any questions, please let me know!

I took java and database organization this spring semester. However, I'm already finishing a chemistry batchelors, and have a math minor. 

So my question is, of my options, I could graduate next summer with just a minor in computer science. Or stick it out and graduate the one after with a double major, or maybe a masters. The question is is it worth the time? I already took one semi worthless computer organization class also that was required for the degree. So I was wondering whether it wouldn't be better to just focus on learning this summer and through the next year, with an internship next summer and whether that's actually enough time provided I have projects to show off by then.  

Will I really need the full time to learn enough, getting the whole degree or should I focus on getting out faster? I'm old enough I should have been graduating already, but just starting with computer science now. So I don't want to spend more time then I have to.

**Other question:** is there some kind of list somewhere that contains a summary of every major term and concept to get acquainted with, as well as topics to learn? My brother said he graduated with a degree, and apparently didn't even know what an object was."

It is really important that we get this message off the internet and to the people we interact with everyday, I think most of the people on /r/trees may be pro cannabis already. ;) I have been talking to co-workers and family members and have discovered a surprising amount of misinformation people believe in, even the pro cannabis people get some of the info wrong. You can't convince people if you don't know all the **facts** yourself. So let's have a little refresher. Norml.org has a Library to read, and studies you can cite. Have you ever cited a study in a conversation? Pretty much shuts down the misinformation and makes them research and learn.

356w2t,5,2015-05-07,Interviewing while working full-time?,glittery2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/356w2t/interviewing_while_working_fulltime/,"So I currently have temporary work lined up through August but I really would like a full-time continuing job so I am still applying.

One job is May 15th-July 8th and is 9-5 except for the first two weeks (a training schedule that is TBA). The other job is my current job that will begin June 15th-August 6th and I will then work 9-6:30pm between the two jobs when they overlap. 

So one job I'm applying for is my current job that I have a good chance at (but is not promised, depends on who else applies) and I'm pretty sure I will get an interview for (around early June).I also applied for another job that I have no clue if I'll get an interview for that if I did would also be around early June. 

Lastly, I just had a phone interview today (for a job I applied to awhile back) and she said if I continue I would have an interview at one location and then another (that is far away). I would anticipate these interviews to be mid May through early June. 

My dilemma is if I get these 2-4 interviews during this 2 month time frame... how do I take all this time off? I'm hoping one I could manage on a lunch break but the one that is far away would definitely be a full day off. The job that has two interviews doesn't know I'm employed (just that I'm graduating in may). 

I just don't want to look bad to my internship that is only two months long and have to take off 2-3 days of work. Should I be honest and say what it's for? One of the jobs he knows I'm applying to but not the others.

356w48,46,2015-05-07,Summer nears... here's some advice for you soon-to-be interns!,propionate,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/356w48/summer_nears_heres_some_advice_for_you_soontobe/,"We’re almost there! For most, finals are either happening or about to begin… and that means internships and co-ops are just around the corner as well. I’ve been with my current company as an intern for a year and am moving across the country in two weeks to begin an internship elsewhere. The past months have taught me a few lessons that might be useful to others, so I figured I would share them. They may be obvious, but if anything they’ll serve as good reminders.



1. **Challenge authority with utmost care.** This holds true in any job, but even more so when you’re a new-hire/student. Regardless of how sure you are that someone is wrong – be they fellow intern, engineer, or supervisor – voice your opinion as a discussion point, not a correction. If you’re a characteristically sassy person, bury those tendencies deep inside of you until you know your coworkers well. Similarly, if you’re the one who always feels obligated to correct the professor or point out to others that centrifugal force doesn’t exist, just don’t be yourself for a few weeks. First impressions are important.

2.	**Google first, ask questions second.** You’re going to be confused at times. Acronyms won’t make sense, conversations will sound like another language, and tasks will have no apparent beginning point. Before bothering someone else, take two minutes to Google your questions. 50% of the time, it works every time. 

3.	**Take initiative, but do so without drama.** As you become more familiar with the work that you’re doing, you will begin to spot small jobs that can be done or things which could be improved. Regardless of what it is, confirm with your supervisor that you can do something about it, and then *just do it*. Don’t work in secret on something for weeks and then reveal it to your boss like a grand Christmas present. This will not endear you to anyone. Before spending any company time, ensure that your initiative is valuable. If it does end up being pretty neat, don’t flaunt it around the office. Pat yourself on the back and keep working. 

4.	**Coworkers can be friends too!** No matter how old or young, veteran or new-hire, all of your coworkers are potential pals. If you’re invited out to lunch or drinks, go! If people are discussing their weekends on a Monday morning, join in. 

5.	**Take notes.** Think you’re going to remember the model number your boss just told you? Or the specifications for the instrument you have to procure? You’re not. Write it down. WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN!

6.	**Take more notes.** Do. Not. Trust. Your. Memory.

7.	**Be honest.** Be honest about your understanding, your progress on assignments, your dog’s middle name, everything. The quickest way to lose the trust of your coworkers is to lie. (For the record, the second quickest way is to be a dick). 

------------------------

/u/Setruss 

8. Be nice and have a good attitude. People will like you more if you're generally cheery and take things in stride. Treat other coworkers with respect, no matter what.

9. Remember to be professional. Don't get too informal without first getting the ""feel"" of the company culture.

10. Don't spend all of your money too fast! I've saved ~30%-50% of my salary and I'm sure the early start on my 401k and Roth IRA will help me in the long run.


---------------

/u/vNaughtTcosTheta

1. Ask for more work.

2. Give input - most engineers are set in their ways. Last summer, a couple of my suggestions (that were totally unrelated to my project - I just liked to sit in on others' meetings) were considered and one was funded.

3. The most important thing is to look professional. No matter how good your work is, it will be ignored if it isn't clean and professional.

4. Go out drinking with the other interns every night.

5. Talk to your boss occasionally. Ask him how you're doing.

6. Talk to your mentor (if you're assigned one) more.

------------

/u/lastsecondescape

1. Get things done right. People will likely give you very simple tasks to start with. Make sure you do the small stuff perfectly, because then they will slowly build trust with you. Make a habit of checking everything before you turn it in.

2. Be social. if you are social it will shorten the time it takes to be ""one of the team"".

-------------

/u/cmeng 

1. Set up weekly meetings, ranging from 15-45 minutes. Usually these are quick progress meetings, held on Friday. What's discussed is: What I've done the past week; Areas where I think I need help; Areas where my supervisor thinks I am lagging behind; What is expected of me in over the next week. It is very important that your supervisor put this in their calendar... otherwise they'll forget, and it'll get pushed to next week, ad naseum.

2. Don't be the last person to show up to work. 2a) Don't be the first person to show up to work.

3. Don't ask for help until you've researched the problem. If you need help, make sure you're starting out like this, or something similar: ""I tried this method, but..."" or ""I couldn't get this to work, so I researched blah blah blah, and I still can't get it to work"". 3a) Don't ask your boss to do it for you. Ask them to ""give you advice"" or ""point you in the right direction""

4. Talk to people in other departments.

5. Get everyone's contact information / business cards before you leave.

6. Don't become facebook friends until after your internship is over (if at all, unless it feels appropriate to do so).

7. Write everyone you had direct contact with / reported to (should be no more than 5 or 6 people) a handwritten thank you card at the end of your internship. For everyone else, a warm email will suffice.

8. Always be nice to the Admin Assistant / Receptionist / Secretary.

9. If anyone says to you ""You fly I buy"" say yes. They're offering to buy you lunch if you pick up take out.


------------------

/u/StructEngBrah 

1. Ask for more work but within boundaries. Don't pester for work every 30 seconds.

2. Prepare for a presentation at the end of the summer, I always had to give one. Take screenshots of your work, scan hand calculations and keep these in a folder for later use. Nothing will get you a job faster than knowing how to present in front of an audience. I got two job offers after internships and was told it was because my presentation was good. I did very little work at one internship, so that job offer was 100% because of my presentation.


3. Go out drinking with your other coworkers too, not just interns! Industry is raunchy man. I get sloshed with some of my bosses at my first internship. Depends on company culture, some will not drink as much as others.

4. If you enjoyed it, make it known at the end of the summer if you want to work there. Say you enjoyed your summer and would love to work here full time.

357427,66,2015-05-07,Graduating med school and starting residency in July. I have a lot of questions about what I should be doing.,medschoolfinancehelp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/357427/graduating_med_school_and_starting_residency_in/,"**EDIT:** Thanks for all the responses. They've been insanely helpful and given me a lot of stuff to read about and learn. I hope this is helpful for any other med students out there who are graduating and looking for some direction. I can't recommend the White Coat Investor book enough. It's written in plain English so that even a dummy like me can understand it. 

----

 I've never taken a single finance or economics class. Ever. I'm trying to read up on my own between now and July on what I need to be doing but if anyone has any guidance that would be great.

I have approx. $170k in med school debt (all Stafford or Grad PLUS loans at various interest rates), no undergrad debt, no other private debt. I will be making about $50k next year as an intern. I have a significant other who will be making about $30-40k for the foreseeable future but we are not married (yet). My residency will be 5 years after which my earning potential will be around $250-300k/year.

I've read through The White Coat Investor book and have gotten an idea of things to do and have spoken with my parents about how to go about setting up some of them, but I'm still fuzzy on certain concepts and was hoping you guys could clarify. I've also tried to set up a meeting with the financial aid person at my university but that won't be for another week or so.

First off, how do I student loan? I know I want Pay As You Earn during residency rather than forbearance, but how exactly do I make payments... like, where do I go to actually do that? If I make PAYE payments during the 6 month grace period are those qualifying payments for PSLF? Are payments made during the grace period eligible for the student loan interest deduction? My thinking is that if I do PAYE during residency and end up in academics I should be able to take advantage of PSLF after 10 years, and if I end up in private practice after residency then I will just switch to standard repayment. I know I will end up paying more in the long term by paying the minimum amount during residency if I go private practice, but the monthly financial flexibility during residency is worth it to me. 

Second, how do taxes work with an abrupt change in income? I earned $0.00 for the first six months of 2015, but will make $25k for the last six months. When I file my taxes, do I file based on the $25k I actually made or will I need to pay taxes on the monthly salary which comes out to $50k/year? And just to be clear, my first year of residency I should be eligible for a $4000 tax deduction from my spring tuition which was paid for by loans according to [this](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch06.html)? Are there any other deductions I should know about other than that, student loan interest, and IRA/403(b) contributions that are above the line? As far as I can tell for residents it's easier and better to just take the standard deduction and personal exemption than try to itemize, is that a safe assumption?

Third, what is the optimal way to save for retirement? My residency program does not provide any match at all during residency for their 403(b), so my current plan is to max out a Roth IRA, then put a small amount of money into my 403(b) and a small amount of money into an individual investment account for big purchases down the line (down payment on a house, etc). I also plan to get a separate bank account for an emergency fund, and a regular savings account from a community bank that gives 3% interest if you meet certain conditions.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I really appreciate any help you guys can offer. I'd also appreciate recommendations for books to read about this kind of stuff. I've already got a few on my list that were recommended in The White Coat Investor, but please recommend any others you think would be helpful!"
3574rv,5,2015-05-07,My (23f) bf (22m) just broke up with me after being together for 6 years and living together for 5 months.,atalolo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3574rv/my_23f_bf_22m_just_broke_up_with_me_after_being/,"This is just so much to take in I could barely focus on work. I figured getting some of this emotion out could help clear my head a little. 


So I guess I should give a little background. We started dating in hs, and things were dramatic and rough as people would expect from teenagers, but we pushed through it. 


After that we went to different colleges, but we both commuted so we still saw one another a couple times a week. A lot of insecurities from hs still came up and we had serious fights and near break ups because of it, but worked through it.Then in junior year we both started looking for internships and jobs, saw each other less but things seemed to be going pretty well.


After I graduated I got a very eh job, but I wasn't too concerned, figured it's just a job. At this point we only met up once a week, he still had one more semester of school, worked 3 days at an internship and 2 days as a waiter. I believe this was the high point of our relationship. We rarely fought and really cherished the time we had together. 


After he graduated he was hired for a full time position at the place he was interning. After the long stretch that we've gone through only seeing each other once a week, he started talking about moving out together. I wasn't all on board, leaving my family, not having good savings, only having a full time position for 6 months, it all really worried me. But with more talking and thinking about our future and all the time we've already spent together I thought it would be okay, things would with themselves out, sometimes I have to take a chance. So we moved out together. 


He decided to work full time (weekdays 10-6) and still keep his waiter job (weekends 9-4). He figured he might as well be making money since he'd just be a potato at home or out spending money if he weren't working. So he's working 7 days a week. I work weekdays 9-6, so I figured that I would have to pick up doing more house things like grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. I didn't mind doing it, but it was tiring for me. 


Our sexual/emotional relationship suffered. 

Just as a side note, I have never been very into sex before, which was a reoccurring issue throughout our relationship, but once I was only seeing him once a week it felt like it was resolved, because we had sex every time and we were still in love. 


He broke up with me last night saying he can't take it anymore. That he's not in love with me anymore. He says he isn't attracted to me anymore because he doesn't feel like I want him anymore. 


I told him that I am still very much attracted to him, and at the end of the night I just tired want to go to sleep. When I wake up in the morning I'm usually ready to go and have initiated. He says it feels like pity and he hates it. At this point I don't feel like I could change his mind, and I don't think I want to. 


Another problem is that we have a 2 year lease on a one bedroom apartment, filled with new furniture that we are still paying off. 


This just happened last night so I'm not sure how this will all really play out, but for now we agreed to be mature about this and just be roommates. At first he said he would sleep on the couch but then decided that we could still share the bed, just stay on our own side. I tell you last night was the most awkward and heartbreaking night for me. I don't want to manipulate him to change his mind, but I could've really used a hug last night. 

 
**tl;dr** My bf and I moved out together 5 months ago, he broke up with me last night because he doesn't feel wanted or loved since our sex life has been suffering. As a result he isn't in love with me anymore. I'm trying to be level-headed. I don't want to seem manipulative or anything, but I really need a hug. "

What I am attempting to do is to determine that average time per week that each intern actually works and from there, determine the ideal hours per a week for an intern to week by comparing the hours versus our graduation rate from our program. The problem I am running into is that our interns come in in groups of approximately 20 and most of the time start/end on a date that is not the beginning or end of a pay period and, therefore, when i run my weekly averages in excel the average is skewed since 20+ interns do not work a full period at the beginning or end internship. So, my initial question is this; what can I do in excel that will reflect the true average of hours per week each intern works instead of going through each individual interns hours and manually recording their pro-rata average?

note: interns are paid on the 5th and 20th of the month (or the friday beforehand if that date falls on a weekend)"

1. Apply for work visa before I depart. 

2. Apply for temporary resident visa/permit...and if I should do this while in SA or in the US.

3. Leave the country for a few days and return with the 90-day visa reset. But I heard the visa laws have become more strict and I can no longer just pop over the border to another country for a few days and return with a new tourist visa

357omw,10,2015-05-07,Me [19 M]. How do I build a relationship with my parents?,PRESIDENTSAIDS,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/357omw/me_19_m_how_do_i_build_a_relationship_with_my/,"So, let's start off.  I'm 19, my parents are 57 (mother) and 54 (father).  I moved away from home at around age 14 for school reasons, while still spending all breaks, summer and otherwise back home (which is around 1000 miles away).  This year was my first year as a college freshman, and I chose to stay in the same state that I have lived in since 14. 



I have also been dating a girl for around a year and a half, and at the start of the current semester, she suggested that I could stay in town with her and her family, whilst working a Summer job.  This sounded great to me, especially because I A) have more friends in this state than at home and B) will be able to participate in certain outdoor sports important to me that would be of little availability to me in my home town.  My parents do not appreciate my relationship.  They see this girl as someone who could hold me back and take away from my ""college-experience"", despite only spending 2 or 3 days of the week with her; such sentiments have caused a lot of anxiety for me and, I believe, have taken away from my relationship as a whole.  



In addition, my older sister of 23 years moved away from home the same year I did (also for school); she moved across the country (the US) and began spending Summers in and has been absolutely terrible with communication, causing my parents a lot of stress, often questioning what they possibly did as parents to cause her to stay in such poor communication.  



The secret is, my sister dealt with depression in high school, as did I to a lesser extent.  I feel we are very similar, and likely seek the same ""adventures"" in life for fulfillment.  To me, staying with a different family in a different place sounds fun and adventurous, especially with the outdoors so closely available and some friends close by.  My parents, I'm guessing, are very worried that they are failing to keep their family together; as a result, I am very reluctant to communicate with them on my Summer plans.  I am especially wary of talking about my girlfriend, or expressing any attachment to her.  Whenever I talk to them about not returning during this Summer, I fail to mention that my girlfriend is an influence, and have not yet told them my plans to live with her family. 



This is not how I want to communicate with my parents.  I do not want to be out of the loop like my older sister, checking in every two or three weeks, and occasionally dropping off the face of the planet (she's not a bum or anything; college-educated with a paying job).  My relationship with my parents seems tested right now; we were never very close and I have never been quite open about my feelings, but I do not want it to stay that way.  



Honestly, I see the way my girlfriend's family is and I get jealous / wishful; despite the problems they've had in the past, they are very open with her regarding life, relationships, and are extremely respectful of her and me.  They treat me very well and acceptingly, and have even helped me find available internships for my future field in-state.



I cannot talk to my parents the same way, and want to change it.  Any advice is appreciated Reddit, however I am not keen on telling my parents: ""I'm an adult, deal with it."" They visit me and have tried to be supportive, regardless if they always succeed.  I believe they deserve more than that. 



How do I build a better relationship?
   


**tl;dr**: I have spent my school years away from home since age 14, and want to spend this summer at my girlfriend's residence.  My parents are tough to read and skeptical, I'm guessing, due to my sibling's actions over the years.  How do I build a more open relationship with my parents?"

I have always wanted to go to Davis, but after visiting UCI I really liked the campus and the engineering program. However I went on UCI Celebrate 50 years, so it was very busy. I've heard that UCI is ""boring"" on the weekends and there is not much to do in Irvine itself unless you drive to Newport Beach or LA . I am surprisingly now conflicted b/w UCI and UCD for Mechanical Engineering. I have until May 13 to decide if I want to go to Davis or UCI. In terms of engineering I have heard they are about the same ranking, but does anyone have any positive or negative experiences with any? Now for Davis, I really liked the college town feel and the campus, but does it ever get boring that there is not much around (unlike Irvine located in Orange County). Another thing I wanted to know is if companies are interested at these schools for jobs and internships. From what i've heard, UCI is better because it is located in Orange County (I could be wrong, I really don't know). I guess what I wanted to know is how the college life in both UC's and if anyone has any experiences with engineering at either school. Any feedback is helpful, I have less than one week to decide where I want to go to college. Thanks!"

Luckily (kinda) I will be in school for 4.5 years so I still have next summer to intern, but I still feel like I really need to make something out of this summer, so I'm here for your advice: What should I do?  I've already had a hard time getting internships, so I'd like to do something to help me out career-wise.  I have the option of taking two tough classes (heat transfer and vibrations) in the first 7 weeks of summer, which will greatly reduce my load for next year, so I've thought about taking those classes and getting a part time job or something.  I'm really stressing about this, so I would appreciate any advice you guys can give! Thanks"

I Migrated to Canada and been living there since 2006. I graduated, did 2 years of Internship, Got hired fulltime from January 2014.
My take home is 3720 CAD Monthly. My life has/about to change dramatically and I want to be prepared, currently I feel and pretty sure that I am not prepared.

My expenses (monthly)
Car payment 422
Car insurance 250
Fuel 180
Rent 400
Food and Stuff ~400

My Wife and son will be migrating over to Canada within 6-10 months. I want to be prepared as best as I can. I had saved up $25000 but used it all on my wedding. main expense was the Air travel for my parents and my brothers.The only saving I have is 6000 on RRSP. My family is saying they will give me 25k for down payment for a house. If I take it I'm pretty sure I will pay it back even though they will not ask or take it. To be honest I would rather not take that money and just manage everything on my own, I don't know why I just like that feeling. pretty sure many do.

What Id like from you guys is advices on what I should plan and account for. My wife has been in Telecommunication industry for 7 years in another country but I'm sure it will take a while before she can land a good job to help out. So I'm pretty much on my own. I know ill need more money for food and cloths, sons education. Im pretty sure Im not accounting for alot more. 

Rent or buy a house and reasoning + other expenses I should account for.


**My Story** probably not relevant for the topic, but might give you an idea of my state.
I had no intention of getting married for several reason, so I never cared or put thought into my finances. Leaving the country I was born was hard but all my family moved here and I had really didnt have a choice.
I left my Girlfriend when I left my country, It was very hard to keep in touch with her because time difference and money. We broke up and carried on with our lives. Never kept in touch, thought it was for the best.
But she was always in my heart... 

All the hard work through out the years, I got my citizenship and was stable and comfortable for the first time in my life. So Last year I went back to my country after all those years to meet all my friends and family. Found out that my old GF got married soon after we broke up. She was in an abusive relationship and the guy left her right after she got pregnant. She has been living with her parents ever since(6 yeears).

I met her and instantly felt so much pain in my heart to see her after all that time, don't know what it was. She told me everything that happened and we spent alot of time together in my short vacation. I never thought I can fall in love again but I did. She said she is worth nothing and she has a 10 year old son, but I had no doubt in my mind that she is who I want to live my life with. It took alot to convince her because she didn't want to feel left alone again. I explained everything to her and In the end we decided to get married. I am looking forward to my new life as a husband and a father. The whole thing is sudden and I would appreciate all the help I can get.

3584sw,1,2015-05-07,"I [22 M] had a date [17 F] and i don't really know how to continue, maybe i screwed up?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3584sw/i_22_m_had_a_date_17_f_and_i_dont_really_know_how/,"Alright, two weeks ago i was on a date with a girl (let's call her A) i got to know at a weekend in ljubljana. I knew of her existence but i never really talked to her before that night, but something really strange happened. 

But first the circumstances: Were a group of young adults (~28 people form 16-26( who do some catholic youth work (nothing crazy, just organizing some stuff and regular meetups with games etc. none of us are really overly religious). We go on a trip for one weekend once a year, this year we went to ljubljana, Slowenia.

We were out in a smaller group (one of my best friends and 4 girls, 2 of which we knew very well and the other two not so much) and on our way home one of them (let's call her R) started to hold my hand. I was not very comfortable with the situation and tried to ""calm"" her by making jokes about when we were gonna marry and so on...which she found was funny but she didn't REALLY get my gist. So we come back to the hostel and some of the other guys are still awake and playing cards, so we join them. We start talking and joking about our ""marriage"" and about heritage and how R's grandparents have a nice house somewhere pretty far away from where we all live today. So A chimes in and claims her grandparents had a house really close (~20km), so i jokingly say ""we'll then i'm gonna marry A instead"" and started holding her hand. R was kinda pissed (well hard to say i was a bit drunk and didn't really pay attention to her afterwards) and A and i played cards together and we always tried to play together and acted all cute (layed my arm around her etc), i even scored a good night kiss on the cheek. Nothing really happend the day after that.

Flash forward four days, we had a meeting and went to a bar afterwards, my friend and i stayed after most ppl left and R stayed with us, so i kinda already knew what was up. When we left the three of us first went to my buddie's house where he left us two alone. Under the next lantern she pulled my head towards hers and wanted to kiss, i played the joke card once more but she pulled the same move 2 more times after we decided that i was gonna accompany her for most of her way home (she's 18 years old, it was super late, super dark and cold, i would've accompanied ANY girl home). Well that was obviously a mistake because i eventually DID kiss her but she knew AND said ""you don't even know if you want this blablabla"". I just thought ""fuck it just make out with her it'll be awesome"" Which it was...we went to my place, had no sex but made out until forever and i drove her home in the morning.

What i didn't mention till now is that A and R know each other because they have a group of girls together (imagine a scoutmaster, only in pairs of two and in charge of a group of either boys or girls roughly the same age), just like my buddy and i. I did not know how well they knew each other though. I still had plans to message A and ask for a date....

And on the next day at night, R messages me and asks if i would like to go out with her sometime, which i don't answer until the next night, drunkenly, with the help of a female friend whom i had explained everything to. I said i didn't want to and said thanks and it was fun and all but nothing more...(which she recieved very well and said ""ok i understand, no problem"" and we chatted for a bit, haven't heared of her ever since). And then we decided to contact A before R can tell her what kind of an asshole i was (because i was afraid she might do that). It turned out they didn't know each other very well and they had not talked. So i told A that i kind of slid into something and don't know what to do blablabla. She just answered that she had absoultely no clue what i was talking about and i asked her out (since we were gonna marry soon haha) and we decided to meet for ice cream on sunday.

On Sunday i explained what happened with R (i felt i had to tell her) which was fine for her i think. That was halfway through the date though, the first half was kind of slow, she's only 17 and kind of shy so i payed for her ice cream and i asked questions and she answered but barely answered back so i was pretty much just talking and asking all the time (she mostly gave really short answers). Then i told her what happened and after that i felt that she kind of started to enjoy herself more and we ended up laughing a lot and she talked way more without my constant input. We ended the date after ~3 hours with a hug and i told her that i wanted to see her again which she approved of.

In the following week we texted a bit ,she is doing an internship right now so she only has access to her phone in the morning and at night, and she always answered really late because of that (well at least i hope it was because of that...) On saturday we had an activity planned for our youths (wow that sounds so strange...you know what i mean i hope), we planned to play ""scotland yard"" in the city. (One team is mister X and the others must find him, you can use all sorts of transportation methods (train etc.) and mister x reaveals his position from time to time and you try to catch him) i asked A if she wanted to take one group of kids with me, which she agreed to if her girl friends would take one group, which they wanted to and were supposed to but R (haha which conicidence) was sick and couldn't come. Everyone knew that early and so i didn't even talk to A besides greeting her together with everyone else...Even at night when we came home and talked about the day and how the game went i just didn't talk to her at all. (today is friday, 0:00 a.m and we last saw each other on saturday)

I do not know why, perhaps it felt too awkward around everyone else. Well anyway we haven't written each other since then but i REALLY like her and i would love to see her again but it feels so awkward now, my female friend told me to just text with something funny which will make the awkwardness go away, but i don't now what and if that's really the way to go.

Does anyone have ANYTHING to say, ANY comment i would just like to talk about this situation because that drunk night with my female friend i talked about emotions for the first time in my life and it felt really good :) and while i did talk to her again about A i want some more input on this whole thing....maybe i'm just blowing this all up...

Thanks for reading this super long post, i appreciate your time and effort, you are all wonderful human beings :)

So please leave some advice, thougts, suggestions, encouragement, whatever!


Off to bed, will be back in ~8-9 hours


   
**tl;dr**: Meet a girl, refused her after making out with her, have a date with a friend of hers, goes well, second ""date"" doesn't happend as planned, we see each other but don't communicate, now it's kind of awkward, need advice, i really want another date with her :)"
3587jr,5,2015-05-07,How to get an accounting job?,d_lirious,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3587jr/how_to_get_an_accounting_job/,"Hello everyone!  Little bit of background....

I graduated last May 2014 with my B.S in accounting from Arizona State.  I live in the Phoenix market and have sent somewhere between 300-500 resumes out over the past year and cannot get hired for an accounting position because I have no experience.  I have tried big staffing agencies and they can't place me for the same reason.  No experience. 

Unfortunately, I was dumb when I was in college and did not network, do an internship, or join any clubs.  I did work summer jobs and during the school year in non-accounting related fields.

I have been unemployed for a year since graduating and can't get an accounting job because everyone wants 2 years experience.  The few (and very rare) entry level jobs I have found I applied for but did not get.  I have had a total of maybe 12 in-person interviews and maybe 25 to 30 phone interviews over the course of the year.  I did ask one person that interviewed me what kept them from hiring me and they said they didn't like my unemployment gap before I went back to school which was several years ago.  Now I have a 1 year gap since graduating which probably doesn't help either.  I think most of the positions I didn't get hired for though was because of lack of experience.  Not sure though.

A few questions that I need help with please....

If I can get an A/P clerk position or A/P coordinator or Accounting Assistant position (i've been mostly trying for staff accountant positions), will that be good enough experience so that in 2 years I can get hired as a Staff Accountant somewhere?  Are there accounting jobs I should steer clear from?

I'm not sure if I want to go for my masters and take on more student loan debt and I am worried that if I don't get an accounting job soon it will be too late.  

Anyways, I am super depressed about this and have no idea what I can do.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"

Both of my other options were probably better. All my financial aid offers were close enough to each other that it was negligible.


I had a panic attack while visiting caltech and I think that just left a bad taste in my mouth but I'm realizing now I gave up possibly the best college if I decided to go into research. 


Then Harvey Mudd is easily the best choice for going into industry, it's like the easiest way into SiValley and I gave that up because I was worried about moving so far away...


I'm looking at internships and prospects look so much better for HMC compsci majors...

358mq0,1,2015-05-07,"i [21m] am unsure how to proceed... considering getting back together with my ex [20f] who's basically exactly what i want in a woman, but she now lives far away and LDR's are hard for me",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/358mq0/i_21m_am_unsure_how_to_proceed_considering/,"alright so, here's the deal (much of this is copy/pasted from another sub, so sorry if any of it seems weird or out of place)

i've got a history of dating less mentally stable people. my most recent ex was a bit much and the ex before her was seriously psycho and probably would've killed me/had me arrested/killed herself had i not broken it off. so i kinda made a vow to stay away from serious relationships for a while considering my history.

but there's this one girl, man. this girl i dated for a while when i was like 18/19, then i left her for the psycho, then me and the psycho broke up and me and this girl briefly talked again... then i found my most recent ex and went through another year of hell.... all in all really we've gotten back together 3 or 4 times after the initial breakup, but i never seemed to realize that this girl was right in front of me the whole time with literally everything i want in a woman and none of the bad shit. the only reasons i ever left her in the first place were because someone more ""dangerous"" or ""exciting"" came along and caught my attention, and i basically ended up taking advantage of this girl and as i'm growing up a bit i'm realizing that that's not the person i want to be anymore, and i need to start looking towards the future rather than the present. and this is the only girl i've ever really envisioned a serious future with.

she's just flat out awesome. just to start with, she's gorgeous and she's got a great body (and she's tiny, like 4'11 or 5'0, which i love), but more importantly, she's hilarious, she's extremely affectionate, she's sweet, she supports me in my powerlifting goals (something NONE of my exes ever did), she doesn't care that i basically by necessity have to use steroids to reach my goal (a huge problem with my last ex, wasn't on them for the first ex but i'm sure she'd have a problem with that too)(also please let's not make this a discussion point, it's not exactly relevant to the conversation it's just a part of my life), she does everything in her power just to make me smile whenever she can. we NEVER fight. i've known this girl for about 4 years now and i can't remember a single fight between us, whereas with these other exes we'd fight basically every single day, and that's not an exaggeration, and always over stupid shit that i never wanted to fight about in the first place. they were those ""no matter what happened or who did what, it's always your fault"" kinds of relationships. 

her and i can go from not talking for months at a time because i'm off being a fuckboy to right back where we were in a day's time. we don't dwell on each other's mistakes, we forgive each other when one of us ends up hurt, and we communicate very well and just talk our problems through rather than fighting about them.

every time i've looked back on relationships, i think.. ""wow, i can't believe i ever saw anything in that girl, she was wayyyy wrong for me"" and i could never see a future with them or any reason to get back together with them. except for her. she's the only girl i've ever been with who i could see myself seriously having a future with, and she's the only girl i've ever gotten back together with after we stopped dating.

i've had multiple friends tell me ""she's the girl you were meant to be with"" when those same friends also told me i needed to get out of the other relationships i was in because they were abusive/unhealthy. so clearly my friends see it too. i've spoken to a couple of my friends and they all agree that i need to pursue her and get back with her and try to figure things out. i think i'm pretty much set on that path and that i want to see if i can make this work with her, because dammit i feel like i've been through enough shit in my life that i deserve to be happy for once and not have to be in a constant state of fear about the status of my relationship.

only problem is, she now lives many states away and she's in some kind of beauty school program thing until december. after that she's free to move wherever, but until then she has to stay there. i just don't know what to do until then. i'm the kind of guy that needs a lot of physical affection in a relationship to be happy. not necessarily sex, but like a lot of cuddling and hand holding and just touching in general. i've done long distance before and it wasn't too bad, but that was before i got into serious relationships where the person actually lived close and i got to see them all the time. now the prospect of not being able to sleep next to someone while wanting to so badly is agonizing to me. 

i've spoken to her about getting back together and she's open to it, but she has a lot of stuff going on in her life right now between school and friends and work and stuff, and of course the distance thing, so we basically just agreed to take it day by day and see what happens. i'm trying to scrape together some money so i can take a flight out to see her soon, but i don't know if that's gonna work because a round trip ticket for the 29th of may to the 1st of june is about 195 and i sold a bit of stuff for about 110 bucks and can sell a bit more but i'll probably end up with about 145 tops and after that i've got nothing left to sell, which kinda sucks. it's probably gonna have to wait until i get a job at a gym as a personal trainer (i just moved recently and got my certification about a month ago, then did a two week internship and finished about a week ago, not a lazy unemployed bum) after i get back from this camping trip (may 10-17th). i just don't know how hard it's gonna be for me to go more than half a year without seeing her more than a couple times.

and i've been using tinder to really just find hookups and stuff like that, and it's been going okay, but i don't take it seriously. i wouldn't seriously date anyone i found on tinder and i would be more than okay not having it any more. i've never really been the ""have sex with lots of girls and have tons of fun partying"" kind of guy, i really enjoy companionship and stability, and she can give those things to me. i feel like that's definitely a tradeoff worth making. edit: also please note that me and the ex have only been talking again for a few days, this is just more backstory, not ""i'm gonna hook up with girls on the side while her and i work on our relationship"", in fact i've already deactivated my tinder

i guess, the core of this is that i need advice on two things.. or anything else anyone can give input on really

1: am i being too optimistic or thinking about this wrong, or is pursuing this relationship the right thing for me to do (also keep in mind i basically live in a dating dead zone, i've met maybe 3 people worth seriously dating in the 7 years total that i've lived here)? 

2: how do i deal with the lack of intimacy and physical affection until she's able to move here?


tl:dr; **absolutely amazing girl and i have dated a couple times, never really fell out of love. in my time of experimenting with less than savory women, i came to learn that she's exactly what i want for myself and we've been talking about getting back together. only problem is she now lives many states away, and can't leave until at least december. LDR's are difficult for me because i need lots of cuddling and the like. need help, unsure how to proceed.**"

I graduated 11 months ago with a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a GPA of 2.78 from a local state university.  I come from a impoverished family and I **really** struggled with my identity, our family finances, and depression and it affected me from performing well in my undergraduate studies.  I have no internship or technical work experience to speak of and so during these last 11 months I got hit with a huge dose of reality rejection after rejection.  As frustrating as it was, I still continue to learn from the past.  I've seen gotten my EIT, self-taught myself SolidWorks, picked up basic coding skills, etc.  Though it may not seem like much, it was most important because I got into a better mental state and rediscovered my passion in engineering.  I realized I was never incompetent or a bad student, *I just never asked for help when I needed it* -- my biggest regret.

So after learning a hard life lesson, I will hopefully soon start my first job as a technician at a big company and work my way up... wherever that may be.  I do have a strong desire to return to school very soon for a graduate degree to ""redeem"" myself and open more opportunities, but that's another story.

So my burning questions might sound crazy but I think it's reasonable.  

* **How can someone with a resume like me get an engineering position at companies such as the likes of Tesla Motors, Intel, Apple, SpaceX, NASA etc.?**

* **What should be my ""3-year plan"" in achieving my dream job?**

3594bf,1,2015-05-07,Need advice on switching career to statistics.,statstu83,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/3594bf/need_advice_on_switching_career_to_statistics/,"Greetings. I am US based. I want to change my career (from pure computer science to computer science+statistics). I have a masters degree in CS and few years work experience. I’d like to get a masters degree in statistics. And then I’d like to get a job in a 100% statistics domain, analyzing data and programming in R/SAS/python etc. I am open to any statistics industry and jobs anywhere in united states.

NOTE 1 - I am not looking for CS jobs. I am looking for jobs in data science and statistics - which almost always require MS in statistics (or higher).

NOTE 2 - I’d like to pursue MS in statistics not a phd in statistics.

So purely from the perspective of getting called for a job interviews after getting my MS in statistics, here are a few questions:

Question 1 - if you are the hiring manager, would you select me for an interview if you see this job applicant profile - someone who wants to switch their career to statistics and who has zero professional work experience in statistics and who has strong computer science, programming background, and a newly minted masters degree in statistics.
If you absolutely must have work experience in statistics, how do i go about getting a job in statistics without any degree in statistics?
Does a summer internship (during masters) count towards work experience in statistics? Does teaching assistant, research assistant work at university count towards work experience in statistics?

Question 2 - if the job ad does not explicitly state it, does it matter if my MS statistics program was not from top 20 universities? - I am not applying to the top 20 schools because of their extremely low student acceptance percentages (some top schools have percentages as low as 2% and 3% - yikes!). 

Question 3 - Do you know any specific graduate statistics programs to avoid based on their coursework/bad past experiences?  i.e too “theoretical” or “outdated”  or “ill-equipped computer labs” etc? I looked on yelp and found some general reviews, but unfortunately not a single one was specific to masters statistics programs. 

Question 4 - I trust reddit more than job websites when it comes to salaries. Would like to know the average base salary for a fresh MS statistics grad in the following regions in united states:
northeast - 
northwest and CA  - 
south and FL -
midwest - 
mid-atlantic and NC - 

And finally...
Question 5 - What are some of the best companies to begin your career in statistics, where one would get to learn the most (on the job learning), and be surrounded by good ""mentoring"" co-workers and managers?

I’d very much appreciate your advice and candid answers to these questions. Thanks very much. "

My dad suggest I learn Asp because it is what he has been using and he might be able to get me an internship next summer if I learn it now (I just finished my freshman year so no company is looking at me right now)

While learning Asp seems like a good idea because I can get my dad's help learning it, it seems like I would narrow my audience because it isn't a super popular language, at least I don't think it is. **I currently only know C++ and Java,** and that is only on a basic level. 

Would it benefit me more if I were to learn basic web development like HTML, CSS, and Javascript beforehand or does it really matter? I understand HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, and Javascript makes it all move and function but how does Asp fit into the equation? Is it more geared towards manipulating a website built by someone else? Similar to scraping a website for data and then doing stuff based on that.

What do you suggest I learn over the summer? If it helps I am interested in the Cyber Security industry.

**TL;DR:** My dad suggest I learn ASP because he might be able to get me an internship next summer if I learn it. I only know C++ and Java. Should I learn ASP or other web development languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript? I am interested in cyber security if that helps with the decision. "

Some of my friends not in the CS world just went through some interviews for internships and were talking about sending thank you emails to their interviewers. Although, under their circumstances, they don't necessarily have different rounds of interviews that they go through.

It then occurred to me that I have never done such a thing. For some background, I just got my first internship this summer but I never had an in-person interview, just a Google Hangout interview (and all the rounds before that). So my question would be, when is it appropriate to say thank you to your interviewers? Do you say thanks after every round? The first HR round? The second technical phone call round? Or only after an in-person interview?

Thanks!

359ra6,1,2015-05-08,"I've been in college for 8 years now. I just failed my statistics class, the only class I need left to graduate, for the second time. I'm ready to give up on college and start with the real world.",AlkalinePacino,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/359ra6/ive_been_in_college_for_8_years_now_i_just_failed/,"Firstly, I apologize. This is going to be long. I need your fresh perspective, reddit.

I'm finishing up my 8th year in college. My only excuse for being in school so long (besides being an awful student, I won't even lie to you anymore) is that after my first two years of being a music major, I switched over to Mass Communication, and none of the credits for my music classes really counted towards anything for Mass Comm, so I basically started over, save for a few core classes.

Last semester (Fall) was supposed to be my last semester. 14 hours- not a huge workload, but a decent amount.  I did all my graduation paperwork, got my cap and gown, and then...failed statistics. Literally one class now stood between me and graduation. I was so broken. This all thrown in with a pregnancy from my (then) fiancee, which ended in miscarriage. Needless to say, it was a rough fucking few months for us both. I was (still am, for that matter) so jaded, so done with college and ready to just get out into the real world. It's funny- people (mostly teachers in high school) tell you that school is training you for the real world, when in all reality, college is nothing like the real world. At all. 

Anyway, I digress. This semester, (Spring) I took the Statistics class again. Started with a fresh upside - I married my girlfriend. The first few weeks I didn't go to class, because I thought I ultimately wouldn't be able to pay for it, as I was under the alloted credit hours needed to receive financial aid. I was luckily able to have payment deferred over a few months, and so I could pay it after all. On top of this, the first couple of months were mostly spent finishing up preparation for the wedding, and so I didn't go to class as often. My reasoning was that was the part I went to most the first time around, I still had all the notes and homework, I knew that section. I figured I would come back and have the whole month of April to catch up and prepare for the last test and the final. Somehow, through my own fault, I missed Test 3, and as I didn't have a doctor's excuse (or other university allowed excuse) couldn't make it up. With this test marked as a 0, i would need to make OVER 100 points on the final to pass the class. The whole semester I kept in contact with the teacher, let her know the situation from start to finish, told her my situation and how i'd need to make over 100 points to pass, and she kept telling me to just do really well on the final and prove that I knew what I was doing and i'd be okay. I took that to mean if I prove that I knew the material, she'd make sure I'd pass. Well, I just spent the last week (literally, aside from work and sleep) at my desk at home with my head in this textbook, on websites dedicated to math help, and with a tutor, who at first I had trouble working with because i can't focus well in one spot for a long time (diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid, stopped taking medicine in high school. Might need to reconsider that for this class if I ever intend to finish), but I was able to score an Adderall from a friend, and took it the last time I met with the tutor, the day of the final. I felt so focused and on top of my shit when I met with him. He helped me work out as much as he could before hand, and I really felt like i was good to go. I got to the testing room, I joked around with the teacher a bit before hand (Still feeling so calm and focused and ready) and then sat down to test. I felt so on top of my shit! I felt like i knew every formula, I knew how to work out every single problem (only left 3 blank, she gave partial credit for partial work) and with the help of the attached formula sheet, felt like i really answered every problem i could with no problem. I left feeling so relieved, so ready to finally graduate. Went to Target with my wife and I remember feeling happier than i have in a few days, I was so over the stress.

And then she posted the grade. A fucking 50. FIFTY. I was so sure that i made at LEAST a passing grade. Not to be pessimistic, but I felt at the time that because I was so sure I did well on the test, that I either made a failing grade or I made higher than I've ever tested before. Sad to say it was the former.

So now I'm sitting here in the dark at the same damned desk while my wife went to sleep in the living room. I'm sure she's upset with me for failing AGAIN, but i tried my fucking hardest. 

I'm not trying to use this as an excuse, but I DO have ADHD, and I think that's something I need to fix, but I don't know what to do. I just turned 25, don't have health insurance, need to probably get some kind of ritalin prescription, not to mention the fact that I either have sleep apnea or something along those lines because i snore SO loudly, and it takes about 10-11 hours for me to feel even remotely ready to start the day. not rested, but ready enough to get out of bed. and I work nights. I feel like college is just holding me back, because if you look at my life not including college, i've got my shit so together. I've started a business a year ago with 2 friends that's going nowhere but up, I've just gotten married...i'm doing so well in my life in all regards other than college. In the real world, my ADHD doesn't matter. I'm a DJ, I play music for people. Weddings, bars, whatever. I'm great at my job. People love me. People ask for me by name at bars sometimes, and my referral count is nuts! I don't have to worry about how long I sleep during the day in the real world because I work nights anyway. In college, sleeping all day means i'm restricted to night class, and if I need to get ahold of someone, I have to wake up during business hours feeling like shit and try to make sense on the phone, or god forbid i have to drive to class barely half-awake.

College makes me feel like a failure. I can't keep my shit straight, I can't focus for more than 30 minutes in a 2hour class, I get shitty grades....it makes me feel like i'm truly a failure, that I can't do anything right, like I'm a hamster running in a wheel- just making efforts after efforts that show no fruit. I'm just not a good student. I literally tried so hard. I put my heart and soul into learning all this stuff for this class to do well on that final, and now i feel like a worthless good for nothing piece of shit who can't focus or study hard enough to get out of school to provide for his family or to prove that he can finish what he starts.

Despite this, I know college is nothing like the real world.

And right now, all that's standing between me and the real world is one class. One. Class. and I just failed it again.

I want to quit so badly, just give up on college. At this point, i've already been given everything by college that I can get, not including the actual diploma: i've networked enough to start a career in my field (because in mass communication, especially in my small town, it's just really who you know. I could have had a career in the local TV station 3 years ago, but I wasn't ready to settle down then. Scared to start a career, to be an adult. My fault.), i've got plenty of experience from internships, and of course, the hefty student loans that i'll have to pay soon no matter what because in their eyes, i'm not enrolled in enough hours to have the payments deferred, because i'm only taking one class...like I said, the only thing missing from what i'm ""supposed"" to get out of college is the piece of paper. I don't need it to prove to myself i finished.

But my family does. I'd be the first man in my family to graduate. i'd prove to people I can finish what I start. I can finally give my mother those pictures of me in cap and gown she wanted after high school, but i was too young and stupid and ready to get out of the cap and gown so i could go try to fuck my girlfriend, or get the hell away from school, or whatever i was doing. All she wanted was pictures of me to cherish in my cap and gown. If for some reason she dies before I graduate and get her those pictures...i'll never forgive myself. She's not old or anything really, but it happens to everyone.

And so here I am. Not knowing what to do with myself. Wanting more than anything to just give the fuck up on college, and start my real life and show people what i'm capable of with things I actually give a shit about and that i'm passionate about, but knowing that so many people would be disappointed in me if i don't get that fucking single piece of paper.

359sax,5,2015-05-08,Life is a mess and I don't know where to start to fix it. (AC of Nmom),viewer14152,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/359sax/life_is_a_mess_and_i_dont_know_where_to_start_to/,"The reason I'm posting in this sub is because I think it's most relevant that people understand what it's like to suffer because of a narcissist and to deal with the many problems that normal people don't have to deal with. I have questions regarding how to get a job so mainly I can get away from my Nmom and the abuse. I want to fix my life and take control but don't know how to get started. 

I have graduated college 3 years ago with bachelors in economics but have been unemployed and unable to find a full time job. Since high school, I felt increasingly depressed but I thought those feelings would disappear if I pushed it back or ignored it and focused on my work. However, it became worse in college. I recognized I felt this way because of all the suffering my Nmom made me endure. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of confronting her about it, which made her treat me even worse and deny all her actions. I thought life was hopeless and didn't work towards my grades or get internships to improve my resume.  After I somehow barely graduated, I couldn't find jobs. I didn't even feel like working at first. I moved in with my Nmom (another mistake) because back then I didn't know about narcissism or narcissistic personality disorder and thought she would help me. It made my condition worse. Also, other bad things happened but I don't want to say it now because it involves another family member( whose privacy I want to protect). 

I dont mean to make excuses (like my Nmom calls them), but those things in combination just made me want to give up on life, so I regrettably didn't work like I should have. I somehow just barely managed to survive and about 2 years later, I decided I needed the means to live independently, so I started applying for jobs. I couldn't get any because my resume was pretty poor with lack of experience and references (I couldn't keep relationships with no money and personal problems.) Now I have no money and it's been 3 years of no job or work history. I know it may sound strange, but it took a lot of effort for me as I struggled with thoughts about suicide and depression for all those years. While other people worked towards their future, I was struggling every day just to survive and not give in. It was paralyzing. Too bad though because it just made me fall back further behind everyone else.

I have thought about ways to get a job and make money so that I could get away from my Nmom and start to fix my life. How can I go about doing this? 
I'm worried because I don't know if my history of problems with my Nmother will affect me negatively. How can I explain my 3 years of no work? Should I say I come from an abusive house or just not say anything? Do they even ask? These things make me worry and I'm just wondering if anyone has any information. 

I have thought about joining the military because it would allow me to get away from my Nmom and it could provide a job and income for me. Also, I am worried about bullying and other problems in the military. I'm not a physically strong person and I don't have anyone to talk to in the military. If I join I will likely be alone. I don't have personality problems, but I'm worred if somebody asks about my past that they might misjudge me and say that I'm an ungrateful child to my Nmom or something like that. Also, I've seen troubling reports about rape in the military and how it's much more likely for both men and women to be raped or sexually assaulted while in the military. So I’m just considering all the pros and cons. 

Also, I was wondering if there are any social programs I can qualify for such as government job training or if I can receive welfare (although I have unpaid student loans). I would also like to move away from my Nmom as soon as possible and am wondering if I can do so and how. Or should I just live with her and take a part time job? I really need help and advice and have no one else to talk to (because she keeps me isolated from my relatives by lying to them about me.) I want to fix my life but I just don't know where to start. Also, my Nmom made me spend my own money for myself while she threw away tens of thousands of dollars on her gambling addiction. I would like to know options that will let me make money. I will consider volunteering or unpaid job experiences later on to improve my career, but for now I need money. Thank you for reading this long post.

For BMath coop,

1. How difficult is it to get ""a Cumulative Mathematics Average of at least 65% (calculated over all math and computer science courses) and a CS major average of at least 70%""?  (i.e. to satisfy the requirements for taking the BMath CS plan).  Someone mentioned that the average mark for a math course was around 65%-70%.  

2. The first coop job is usually the most difficult to get.  In the first year, would a BMath coop student be at a disadvantage in competition with a BCS coop student?

Would also appreciate insights into other aspects on a comparison between the two programs.

I've been asking this question around to other people, on other subreddits, and I did get some good answers, but I figured this would be a good place to ask too.

So I'm a french college student, about to be a bachelor graduate in software development.  I'm currently in a sandwich degree, so I basically have a whole year of work experience in a startup, and I'm going to get another year in that same company before leaving France.

I've been on an internship in Montréal, QC, Canada, and I went to the United States a few times during the time I was in north america, and now I want to go to the USA to live my life, and thus I need both a job and a visa (the company who will hire me will provide said visa if I'm not mistaken).

How do you thing I should proceed?  Is there anything I should know?  Places I should head towards?  I've heard that Seattle and basically the northwest are a good place to start with, but I know people in the northeast?

If anyone has any advice on that I would be extremely thankful for it!"

I'm a computer science major who was about to enter his senior year, having finished all my courses and all. However, disaster struck and long story short, my university decided to separate me from my program for a year on disciplinary grounds. The appeals have run their course and it really looks like the end of the line for me.

I have my junior year exams coming up and am trying to study for them, but this has left me severely depressed (that's saying something - I've rarely ever been depressed before; real optimist). I am now looking at 15 months of deadlock (year+summer) and honestly don't know what I will do... I've stopped looking for summer internships etc. and am starting to despair.

I'm not even sure whether i'll (be able to?/want to?) return to college after this long a hiatus. I'll really my miss friends and social circle, the community one tends to build while living in a place. Money is not an immediate concern as my parents are supporting me, so I don't have to get any job right now. 

What I do know is that i'll go mad id I sit around doing nothing for any length of time. I'm fair at programming, and have won a few competitive contests. I wasn't sure what I'd wanted to do after graduation anyways; grad school was a possibility and so was a good job, I also wanted to work on this start up idea I had. That was before though, now I'm not really sure.

Sorry for the really long and rambling post. I'd be really grateful if anyone has any comments/advice to share."

My ABSOLUTE favorite Dream Big episode featured Eric, the boy who wanted to be a basketball in a Lions game. No, not play basketball with the Lions, but actually be a basketball! It was so cute. Thank goodness they didn’t actually dribble! They passed him around and threw him through this big, soft-rimmed hoop and always made sure someone was there to catch him when a point was scored. The pictures will just melt your heart: http://www.dreambig.com/eric_the_basketball

As a Dream Big employee I’ve pretty much seen them all and the most brilliant one, to me, was Julian’s. I think Jacy was kind of disturbed, at first, because Julian wanted to be buried alive. Not permanently, because he didn’t want that and I think that would be illegal? But he wanted to be buried alive for 20 minutes and then be taken out. I don’t think the audience understood what was going on but when he came out from the dirt and the coffin with his Dream Big smile they just went crazy.

The most heartbreaking one? When Eddie asked to be in prison for a day with his dad. He was so happy. Then you found out his dad was in prison because he tried to steal drugs from a hospital for his dying wife (Eddie’s mom). It just made you feel sad all around. Even Jacy teared up at the end of the segment. I think we all did.

Now, I’m not going to say this was a “good” dream come true or anything like that, but I like the statement Emily made when her last dream before she died was to be put to sleep. I mean, she was 92 after all. “Assisted suicide” is what they call it. She just couldn’t take any more pain. Can you really blame her for that? Could you imagine having any one wish granted and you wish to die because you can’t go on any longer?

So, I’ll be the one to say it. My favorite was when Gill had sex with Brittany Beaver. It’s pretty much the dream of every guy in this country to get her. Really, who else can say, “Yeah, I lost my virginity to Brittany Beaver.” Well, probably a few guys, but they didn’t lose it on live television. If I win the Dream Big lottery, um, yeah, I’m gonna take it in that direction for sure. Not gonna lie.

Gracie. She had such a tough life. Father was out of the picture, Mom had three jobs (yes, three), and her brother had died one year prior. You know what Gracie’s wish was? No, it wasn’t a vacation, she didn’t ask for all the gold in the world or to swim with humpback whales. She wanted to free animals out of the zoo. The Greene zoo. To date it’s the only dream Dream Big hasn’t granted, I guess because it would’ve put the zoo out of business, and that’d make them look bad, so I get it. But she did release one monkey (who Gracie named Brian, after her dead brother) into the Secure Land Habitat in Greene and together they had this moment where it was like the monkey knew it was Gracie who was letting her go and be free with his new to-be monkey friends.

I intern at Dream Big (hey Brad!!) and the most surreal dream come true has to be Sherry from Season 4. She always wanted to be a doctor but things just hadn’t turned out the way she had planned for them to, 51 and working as a secretary for an Emotion Engineer Technician. So she got to spend a day with this doctor (super hot btw, ha). She brought Sherry down to the operating floor while she was performing surgery on this guy’s nose. Sherry peered over and seriously passed out. Like, black-out fainted. Then the whole thing became about Sherry needing help! Thankfully she came back to pretty quickly. But if you think about it, it’s funny because she went to the hospital to be an “honorary doctor” for the day, but she also got treated by a real doctor. Good twist.

Episode 8, Season 2, when Jenny wanted to spend the day with her cousin who had died. It was so sad when they told her they just couldn’t do it. But they teamed up with Lifebot to build a custom-made version of her cousin. She sounded just like her cousin and it almost looked just like her, too (they still haven’t gotten the eyes right on the LifeBot, as you know).

I’ll never forget Lucy, the little girl from Wisconsin, who wanted to build a tunnel to China. Obviously that’s not geographically possible, so what they did instead was they built a tunnel from her basement to her best friend’s basement two doors over. The tunnel collapsed two weeks later but thankfully no one was injured and Dream Big wasn’t sued by Lucy’s parents.

Sam. Sam had always wanted to hunt a cheetah, his favorite animal, but his parents were against it. So, Dream Big brought him to Niger in first class. Check. Next they took him out to the forest in this big Jeep (painted his favorite color). Check. The show got a custom-made hunting rifle, in camo colors, donated. Triple check. Then Sam and the crew camped out for three nights until the cheetah finally showed and BOOM! Sam shot him (with the help of a hunting professional). Sam and Jacy led the crew in prayer, thanking Paix (Sam named him that – peace in French, which apparently is what they speak in Niger) for giving his life. Weeks later the show had Paix’s fur turned into a blanket for Sam. When they gave it to him he said he’ll truly never forget it, the best day of his life.

35ah98,7,2015-05-08,Pay to ship car or lease one locally?,trynewvegetables,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35ah98/pay_to_ship_car_or_lease_one_locally/,"For a college student, would it be better to pay to ship a car from Hawaii to Texas or sell it and simply lease one in Texas? The car is a 2008 civic hybrid in excellent condition, but doesn't get great mileage in Hawaii, where we do mostly city driving. The leased car would likely not be a hybrid. 

Backstory: When my eldest graduated from high school, we didn't quite have the money to allow her to go to an elite college without also depleting funds set aside for our two other kids, who also would be graduating within the next four years. She ended up getting a full scholarship plus stipend large enough to just cover rent, books, food, etc.  but at a much less well known public school. Obviously this takes a lot of strain off of us, so we told her if she accepts it, we'd pay for a car when the time comes. 

She did, and now is starting to actually need a car to get to interviews, internships and job opportunities. She's not the best driver but is very familiar with the civic and learned to drive in that car. We plan on getting a new car at some point as well as the civic wasn't working very well with the city driving and the hills, and would either sell the civic or ship it to her.

On the other hand, we don't want to have her worry about maintenance or the process of moving with a car she may not necessarily want to take with her. (She will be in Texas for at least one more year, but after that, is planning to go to California for graduate school.) She will be paying for gas and all other car ownership costs and is favoring the hybrid over a non hybrid. 

If shipping is the better option, should we ship directly to her or to California and drive it over to Texas?"

I was thinking about emailing the chief executive at the company, who I had spoke to initially when I applied for the position. I wanted to write an email paying my compliments about how impressed I was with how well the company was being run, and how it was a pleasure speaking with the manager who showed an enthusiasm about the products they were creating.

**Background:** I recently got an internship at a startup. I did apply with a strong background in Web Development and very limited work with Android and iOS. 

The on-boarding process had me exposed to the app, and now, it looks like a couple of sample projects have been thrown on my lap. 

I should preface by saying **I know how to code** but I haven't worked with Java or Objective-C in years. 

The first project on my lap is an app that takes a picture of a pill, uses a web service to compare it to some database containing the ""authentic"" pills, then return the results, and finally play an mp3 to the Android user based on the result. 

Where would I begin with this project? I've installed the SDK, and I'm reading through the project but I REALLY feel out of my element here.

I'd appreciate any articles, tutorials etc that would help me along. Lastly, I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask and would appreciate some direction. "

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

First build. In school for computer science and biochemistry. Will mostly be using the computer for League of Legends, programming assignments, word / spreadsheet processing, and eventually computational biology research, most likely using Python or MATLAB. I'm going to move around a bit (this summer for an internship, after the summer for uni, etc) and wanted a more portable desktop so this desktop is being built from some salvage parts from my current PC. I can't remember what my power supply is but it's somewhere between 500W and 650W. I'm planning to run a dual-boot with Linux and Windows 7 and I kind of wish I had just invested in a 500 gb SSD because currently my Windows partition is running lower on storage than I would prefer. Also not totally happy with the number of USB ports on the case but I think I will just get a USB multiport for that.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I mainly just play League (might try Hearthstone), max settings for those.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Between 400 and 500 (maybe up to 550).

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

US

35aw4q,22,2015-05-08,I've seen the first season over ten times but haven't watched since after Season 3 aired. Rewatched the first few episodes and it was awesome!,heymeowmeow,PrettyLittleLiars,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrettyLittleLiars/comments/35aw4q/ive_seen_the_first_season_over_ten_times_but/,"*Emily's Canadian accent is so obvious in the first few episodes 

*During Ezria's meet cute: ""I want to know more about you..."" Eek! :O

*I forgot how, early on, every goddamn Ezria scene has that stupid soft piano music

*Also, when Ezra sees Aria in the rain and picks her up, that whole scene looks and sounds like a Toyota commercial lol

*It's amazing how far Mama Marin has come over the years. Everything she's done has always been for Hanna but she's so gross about it at first. When she walks up the stairs with Wilden and looks back at Hanna, ugh. Couldn't you have just gone to Wilden's house?? Gross. And telling Hanna, ""In a small town like Rosewood, what people think of you matters."" You mean well Ashley, but you really blew it at first. Also, thank god you went back to your more natural red hair after the pilot

*Aria calls her parents by their first name like in the books! When did she stop doing that?

*Everyone's lips looks so pale! Did they get a better make up person or something? 

*Jenna has always been such a goddamn mystery. In the second episode she sits with the girls at lunch and acts friendly. In the first scene of the third episode she walks by the girls with a catty, ""Whisper, whisper, whisper, it's almost like Ali's still alive."" She just switches personalities at the drop of a hat. 

*Mona is prominently featured in the scene where we see the first A text. They conspicuously show the whole class reacting to Aria's phone going off, but you do not see Mona until like ten seconds afterward. You sly Devils! 

*Seriously, who the fuck was that blonde girl in Maya's room that Spencer sees? Did Ali really break into her old home to get a quick glimpse of Spencer. Was crazy Spencer just being crazy and imagining things again?

*I like how it has been some 1 year and 11 months since Aria caught Byron having an affair (She sees them in the first secret, Halloween of Freshman year. Ali goes missing Labor Day before Sophomore year. The show starts on Labor Day before junior year) and Byron and Aria keep having conversations that imply this is like the first time they're really talking about it lol. They keep saying she found a way to move past it in Iceland because they didn't know anyone so they had to get closer as a family, but WHAT WERE YOU GUYS DOING FOR THE YEAR BEFORE THAT hahaha

*Spencer says that Wren's not like Melissa's other boyfriends because she actually likes him. Ummm, weren't you hella into Ian, girl?

*Netflix subtitles have Wren's name as Ren in the pilot. Either it's a mistake or they changed the spelling, which thank god cause Ren just makes me think of perverse cartoons. 

*Thank fucking god Sean and Ben went away. Fuck those guys. 

*They really went overboard showing how intense Spencer's family is at first. The first time we meet Peter he's emailing and won't even look at Spencer. 

&gt;Spencer: I've decided on what class I'll take at Hollis, but it's not for credit it's for fun. 

&gt;Peter: What's the point in that. 

Later:

&gt;Wren: I got a brilliant parking spot right in front of the Chem lab

&gt;Peter: *smiles with his mouth; directs laser beams from his eyes*

Then we meet Veronica. 

&gt;Spencer: I made pasta. 

&gt;Melissa: No thanks, I don't want to be depressed and fat. 

&gt;Veronica: Good point. I'll make salad. 

What the fuck? How is that a good point? All of you can afford to have pasta, Ms. Fuhrer von Diet Nazi. 

*I'm glad they stopped name dropping Facebook and Twitter every other moment. In three episodes I saw three facebook references and a couple Twitter ones. I'm excited to get to the episode with Aria checking Ezra's ""website page"" lol

*Who the fuck lets their sixteen year old daughter remodel the family barn into a loft? She may be an over achiever but she's still a goddamn sixteen year old. For that matter, do mayors ever have sixteen year old interns? Weird. 

Well, I should probably actually be productive now. Just thought I'd share my thoughts on how ridiculous(ly awesome) this show can be.

Hopefully it'll lead to a job when I graduate. If it does, my girlfriend and I would like to move here and get married as well (well the getting married is happening whether we come here or not). Which leads me to my question...I'm looking for an engagement-worthy ring which does not need to be a diamond or ultra-rare gem. Actually, if it was a diamond, my girlfriend would make me return it. So, is there anywhere around the town that would be worth looking at? Again, I don't need something extravagant or opulent, we've talked about it for a while and we'd both like to go through the gesture, but neither of us wants to spend thousands on a ring just for the sake of it. Something simple and elegant would be the best thing, and ""alternative"" rings are totally fine. Anyway, any suggestions are appreciated.

EDIT: The reason I'm looking for a ring here and not in the states (where we live) is because I'm not too fond of American jewelry design, and also because when I propose I'd like it to be here since we've both had some good times here throughout the years, and if we end up moving here it'll be extra symbolic/special/relevant. And I'm here right now...so yeah."

My interviewer did mention that he really liked me and was going to fight to add more positions because he liked some of the other candidates as well.

I was about to call them today and confirm my suspicions that I didn't get the job, and to ask what I could do better  for future interviews when the woman who did the phone interview called me.

Does this sound like I got the job? I'm ridiculously excited for this opportunity and can't wait for the final interview.

I was thinking this question could help a lot of people here across all levels of education as summer vacation is finally here. 

This summer I plan to go through a few books to get ready for interviews in my final year for full time positions. The order I plan on going through them:

- CLRS Intro to Algorithms(w/ mit video lectures to accompany them.)

- Programming interviews exposed 

- Cracking the coding interview

- Elements of programming interviews. 

I just want to know if this is a good progression and how ready I will be for what the job market throws at me this fall/winter. 

I also want to know if it is realistic to be able to get through these in the 4 months I have until September. 

I hope this can help out other students who have summer vacation this year.

-$1000 shared room utilities included in an apartment in either Washington Heights/Fort Greene/or Sunset Park

-$300 groceries (meat/veggies/fruit)

-$60 subway/bus

I don't use a cell phone. I can't think of any other monthly recurring bills. I plan to come with more than $6k for me alone. I make about $1600 a month through an online job. I've lived in mega cities before and am comfortable with it

I'm looking for any feedback on neighborhood choice, how my budgeting/savings is looking to those of you who moved to NYC alone in their late 20's recently (or anyone else in-the-know), and any other pertinent information.


Also, I'm going to be looking for an internship as a psychotherapist (I'm a graduate student) and I like to play coffee shop gigs as a singer/songwriter.

I'd love any insights, info, help you can offer!"

You'd think I'd feel confident in my ability to land a good job and finally get a start on my career.

Well, I'm not.

I never managed to land an internship in the four years I went to college. Granted, the first two summers, I certainly could have started earlier, but my Junior summer I *really* tried. I didn't get one. So I started applying for jobs after I would graduate. I started in October of 2014 and now here I am with nothing to show for it. I have probably submitted my application to over 150 unique positions since then. Granted, probably 50 of those had any chance of happening, but the point is that I certainly have made an effort to apply. I don't just blindly apply either. I try my best to write a compelling cover letter that shows why I want the job, and why I am qualified for it. My resume is decent and is focused mainly on my project experiences since i don't have any engineering work experience.

In all of this failure, I've essentially trained my brain that I am helpless. Nothing I do, no matter how hard I try, will ever land me a job. I feel so depressed that I can't get a job, and I can't get a job because I'm so depressed. Jobs require experience, but I need a job to get experience. I have had varying intensities of anxiety since last Fall, and obviously plenty of depression. I used to feel lonely because I've never had a girlfriend, but now I don't even care anymore because I can't afford to think about that right now. I feel like I'm not allowed to be happy. I'm not allowed to enjoy anything because I don't have a job. I don't even want to do anything anymore because I can't enjoy them.

I have nothing. No job, nobody I can feel close to, and no motivation to do anything, yet somehow I manage to still apply to at least a handful of jobs every day despite my ever-increasing depression. When will I stop caring? I feel like it'll be pretty soon."

35c6uj,16,2015-05-08,"[Advice] Just started ""interning"" at a startup, becoming increasingly apparent that they don't know what they're doing. What do?",ConvenientPlotHole,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/35c6uj/advice_just_started_interning_at_a_startup/,"Hi everybody. Posting from a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm 30 years old and trying to pivot careers into webdev. I've been playing with Ruby and Rails for about 2 years. This year I've looking for somewhere to cut my teeth and get some experience under my belt. I do not have a CS related major or work history, so I'm basically starting from 0. I know I'm capable of contributing as other devs I've shown my work to say I'm ready for an entry level position.

I applied to basically every remote junior/intern level opportunity I could find (not many inhouse opportunities in my area). One company on angel.co actually contacted me and said they could use an intern to help get their MVP out. I jumped on the opportunity to hopefully learn from more experienced developers about shipping code and all that good stuff. The position is unpaid, but there is a promise of remuneration if/when the app goes live and turns a profit (red flag #1).

Having no other opportunities at the moment, I agreed. 

On the date that I was to start my internship, the CEO emailed me saying that they had some ""internal issues"", development of the app has been halted (red flag #2), and he would email me when they were ready to proceed. A month or two goes by until they're finally ready for me to begin.

I hook in to all their collaboration tools and notice that there's essentially only one other ""dev"", who I suspect is also an unpaid intern. Chat logs and git repo history shows the dev team has turned over several times over in the year that this app has been in development (red flag #3).

I clone the repo and dig into the code. 

There. Are. No. Tests. 

Well, okay, there's a few basic unit tests, but not a single integration test or any unit tests for the actual business logic. (red flag #4) Rubocop blew up with just about 2k offenses. 

I bring this up to the CEO (because the other dev apparently isn't working on the app this week), and he says, ""Okay, write some tests to familiarize yourself with the code."" I say, ""Sure...but I don't know how the app is actually supposed to function because there's 0 documentation."" I ask for use cases or anything that outlines the basic functionality of the app. I'm told to ""research [sites that we want to copy] and do what they're doing"" or ""write some front end using CSS or any other framework"". (red flag #iLostCount)

I ask for some kind of list of things that need doing and I'm pointed to a KanBan which has not been updated in months. The project has pivoted focus several times since the last post. I bring this up to the CEO, he says he's planning on reorganizing it. I ask what the main focus is, he says, ""Getting our silos of functionality to work together"". In my mind i'm thinking, ""You have silos of functionality that don't work with each other because no one wrote any integration tests.""

I talk to the other dev about the things that he's working on and he says, ""Take a look at x and tell me what you think."" In my mind, I'm saying ""Why are you asking an intern with no experience what he thinks!?!?!111??""

I was expecting to be given clear tasks (test that, it should work like this) by a head dev. I expected TDD/BDD to be the norm. But now I'm basically looking at an app that barely works with no clear idea of how it's supposed to work, no supervision, and no clear priority of tasks.

My questions: 

* Am I being needlessly fussy? Is this how most startups/webdev jobs are?

* Am I wasting my time here? Is there anything to be gained from sticking this through vs. quitting and finding an open source project to contribute to?

* Does anyone need a remote Junior dev? I'll work hard for not very much if it means a chance to learn.

TL;DR: I get the feeling that I'm interning as a webdev for a CEO has no idea what he's doing with regards to webdev and has been hiring interns to write code for free. Wondering if there's any point to sticking around. Pls halp."
35c9k7,2,2015-05-08,26M4F Unleash your inner slut; five prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/35c9k7/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_slut_five_prompts/,"I've had a LOT of fun with these prompts in the past, and I'm at it again. A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages. Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing. Seriously, it REALLY gets me off to know what I'm writing is getting another woman off, too.

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you tonight!"

I have been accepted to both UTSG Computer Science and Queen's Engineering. I thoroughly enjoy programming but I also enjoy doing some hardware stuff too, like Arduinos and robots.

My question is: Which one is the better choice? I know U of T has the better reputation, especially for CS, and PEY can land you better jobs potentially at silicon valley.

Could a student with the Queen's internship also end up at silicon valley?

35cbzg,2,2015-05-08,(CA) Need some guidance on when to start the qualifying process for a mortgage.,faulome,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35cbzg/ca_need_some_guidance_on_when_to_start_the/,"So I have been searching around and collecting information along the way as to what goes into buying a house, in this case my first home.

A little background first. . . I am currently a 23 year old college student, I will graduate in December with the Bachelors in Computer Science. I currently don't have any student loans, but I do have a car loan for about $10k that I can pay off anytime, I am just using it to boost my credit score at the moment. I am currently working as an Intern, which pays pretty dang well. My boss has mentioned time and time again that he wants to keep me on full time once I graduate. The only downside to this is that he can't offer my anything until three months out from graduation, so October ish time. If he cannot keep me there are other departments that are more than eager to snag me, even hope that my boss can't keep me, haha. So I will have a full time job the moment I graduate. I work in a department where starting wages are between $70k and $85 for my degree and personal experience.

Back to personal finance. . . this is in reference to this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34zncb/just_an_fyi_do_not_get_married_buy_a_car_or_do/)

I will have enough for a 20% down deposit on a $300k house (max range), including closing costs and the likes. However, going from an internship to a full time job I would assume counts as something major. . . I was planning on applying for a loan just after accepting a full time position, in October ish time. So that would be two months to go through the whole loan process, I don't know how long the loan process takes, and hopefully finding a house then my salary will change. I was wondering if this is enough time to complete the whole process or if I really should wait until after I start my full-time position? I am waiting long enough to graduate, but I really need to get out of the living situation I am in now, the sooner the better. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advanced!"
35ce7r,3,2015-05-08,Bad internship vs no internship,awgeezf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35ce7r/bad_internship_vs_no_internship/,"Hi.

I'm currently a freshman CS major and I have to make this decision by Monday.  I have a summer internship offer from this small startup in the midwest.  The problem is, they only have one other developer, who has been programming for less than a year.  Their current code base has all been written in India and they recently made the decision to move development to the U.S.

I'm worried that if I take the internship, I won't be learning much, as their would be no mentoring or even experienced developers giving me guidance or critiquing my code.  The company also has very high expectations of me, and I'm worried that I don't have the experience necessary to be 50% of their development team.  And the pay is minimum wage, so is it even worth the stress?

Would it be better to just work on side projects/independent learning over the summer, or accept the offer and get the work experience?

Will not having an internship my freshman year impact my chances of getting a nice internship next year?

Thanks in advance for any advice."
35cj6a,1,2015-05-08,23 [M4A] - 10+ scenarios for you to choose from!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/35cj6a/23_m4a_10_scenarios_for_you_to_choose_from/,"Pick a fantasy, any fantasy, or even a combination of some of them and send me a message with your kinks, limits, and what you'd want to include!

**Fairy in the Woods** - One day, you wandered a little too far outside the fairy lands and into the humans' part of the jungle...and that's where you saw me. As a fairy less than 100 years old, you haven't quite developed the resistance to humans that some of my kind have...so it turns out you have to grant you almost any wish I ask. Your powers are sexual in nature, and every spell you cast makes you more aroused...so the more wishes I make, the hornier and more uncontrollable you get too.

**The Real Magician** - I’ve just hired you, my new assistant, to aid in my performance. Little do you know that I actually practice *real* magic! I can hypnotize you, make your breasts swell or shrink, and make you grow a giant cock between your legs among other things. We can do this on stage in front of a large audience, or, if you prefer, it can be a practice run before we do the show.   

**Alien Orgy** - Exactly what it sounds like. Pick a universe, a set of aliens you’d like to use, and let the huge cocks, tentacles, giant breasts, antennae and whatever else go crazy in a hot, steamy orgy. I’m quite partial to the Star Wars universe for this, I’ve always wanted to have fun with a Twi’lek or a Togruta. Something about those tail-heads… WoW universe is also something I’d like to try!

**Goo Girl Made of Cum** - Yup, you read right! A girl made entirely out of cum. Sticky, slimy, and able to change shapes, you must consume cum in order to stay alive. Fortunately for you, you find me, a young man who is able to keep up with your needs. My loads are particularly massive, enough to satiate your desires. And if you ever get too much cum, your belly swells and, well, you can guess what happens next.

**Futa Fantasy** - Ever wanted to pound a girl with your huge cock? Well then this one is for you! I, a mad scientist, have created a serum which causes you to grow an enormous dick. In order to complete the experiment I let you try your new cock out on my young, tight intern. Watching makes me so horny I might just have to join in too.

**Bimbo Bonanza** - You could be a co-worker, neighbor, or just about anyone you like in this one. With one spray from a special chemical I’ve purchased your hair turns platinum blonde, your breasts grow ridiculously large, your clothes shrink, and you develop an insatiable craving for cock. You feel yourself becoming vapid, but the whole time, somewhere in the back of your mind, you are all there but unable to control yourself. 

**Sex Island** - Your boat is destroyed in a storm in the middle of the Pacific. As you come to consciousness you find yourself on a tropical island. As you explore the island you come across it’s inhabitants. Since it doesn’t seem like you’re getting off the island any time soon, you better get to know them. Just hope that the initiation ritual that all women must complete to be allowed into their tribe isn’t too crazy…

**Public Fuckpuppet** - As the mayor of a wealthy town I’m celebrating the opening of a new public square with the purchase of a fuck slave. You are to be strapped down on your back, completely naked with your legs and arms spread apart, in the middle of the square. Anyone may use you as they please, and if you survive the initial crowd you will be fed and your positions changed daily. We can start this one with you in a line up of slaves, and me looking for one to pick out for this job.

**Gym Milf** - I’ve always fantasized about that fucking hot, in shape woman who’s at my gym. She’s always wearing tight clothes that show off her curves and toned body. She’s always bending over in front of me, giving me smiles, I wonder if she has any idea how much I want to tear her clothes off and fuck her in the mens locker room. A place where she’d soon find herself with more cock and more cum than she could handle.

**Incest Extravaganza** - Sisters and mothers please enquire with a pm! I have a bunch of scenarios just for you!"

35czbn,1,2015-05-08,"I [F25] love my current SO [M29], but can't seem to get over a short-term thing from a year ago.",saturnpattern,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35czbn/i_f25_love_my_current_so_m29_but_cant_seem_to_get/,"I've been thinking about posting on here for advice for a while. I also didn't know whether this should go under personal issues or relationships. Relationships seemed more fitting.

Exactly a year ago, I met a 26 year old man who we'll refer to as Sergei on OKcupid. He looked familiar and it was then that I realized I had seen him in passing on campus at the university I'm attending for grad school. I also recalled that he had dated a friend of mine 5+ years prior (the friendship had grown into a vague acquaintanceship and enough time had passed that I didn't care).  

Before I met Sergei, I had struggled through a year-long stint of short-term dating spells. I just couldn't meet anyone who I clicked with. Sergei and I clicked extremely well almost immediately. On our first date we talked until 3 in the morning in a dingy diner. He was everything I was looking for: intelligent (an aspiring electrical engineer), edgy (he had been the drummer for a death metal band before returning to school), and extremely attractive (constantly likened to George Clooney). The chemistry between us was electric. I have never been that physically attracted to anyone.

Long story short, a couple of weeks after introducing me to his parents (who told me they liked me), he began a flashy internship and became disinterested in my day in, day out. Eventually he became rude and started alluding to female friends finding him attractive and began mentioning the ex quite a bit. I wasn't going to stand for it, so I broke it off, only to desperately ask him to stay. He told me some hurtful things...namely that he had never felt so un-aroused while having sex with someone. 

I was devastated initially. For some reason, my heart had grown extremely set on being with this person. We dated for a grand total of two months. I ran into him periodically at school, avoiding his gaze. I ran into him in the town we live in. And then, he disappeared. Through Facebook, I saw that he had moved to Los Angeles. Good riddance, I thought. He still popped up in my mind every once in a while, but I figured I would eventually forget about him. 

I continued casually dating until I met an amazing man who I love more than anything. We've been together for almost 7 months now. Our relationship is healthy and fulfilling. He is more or less the ""safe"" version of the man I was dating before. Equally intelligent, if not more so, but more grounded. I find him very attractive, though not admittedly not as attractive as Sergei (though I doubt anyone will ever measure up to him). I don't mind this though because all of his other qualities greatly outshine a slightly above average appearance.

I had a vivid dream about Sergei last night. He was sad that I had moved on and I explained to him that I have so much going for me and he just didn't see it. I awoke and was frustrated that I was STILL having dreams, thoughts, anything about this person who has been out of the picture for such a long time.

And then today, I went to have ice cream with my friends at school. And lo and behold, Sergei was sitting in the food court with his old roommate. I nearly started hyperventilating, as he had moved away. Maybe he moved back. I don't know. I can't care. I don't WANT to care. 

Which brings me to my question: Why the hell is my brain still reeling over this person? It's been a year. We were together for a couple of months. One of my friends said that perhaps it's because he was so attractive. At this point, I'm over figuring out why and would really like to move onto the how portion of the solution. How can I stop feeling like he was the ""one who got away""? I don't want to think about this person anymore! 

   
**tl;dr**: Dated a guy a year ago for about two months. Felt intensely connected to him before I ended it, which he was totally okay with. Have a boyfriend of seven months whom I love dearly. Still have periodic thoughts/dreams about other guy from a year ago. How do I stop these thoughts/dreams/wonderings?"

In fact, I consider myself a much better programmer than 99% of the people who graduated alongside me, based on working with them in team projects.  I was president of a game-development club and have released several complete games of my own.

I've applied to quite a number of places, got three interviews and one job offer (which I turned down due to a number of red flags).  Frankly, I'm not yet sure what area of development I want to be in.  Most places are looking for JavaScript and database experience (both of which I have a sliver of experience in, but not enough to be confident in).  My experience is almost entirely Java and C# along with some C/C++, git, HTML, SQL, etc.  But not enough to write a database application during an interview question.  I can ace the programming trivia all day, but when it comes to practical things like web design or database linking, I'm clueless due to lack of experience.

I'm confident I can pick it up quickly and easily, though.  Learning has always been my biggest strength.  Do I just teach myself this stuff before trying for jobs, aim lower for experience, or find a place willing to work with me?"
35ddx0,4,2015-05-09,Trying to get a friend home for a wedding cheaply. (Halifax to Calgary),Jrixyzle,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/35ddx0/trying_to_get_a_friend_home_for_a_wedding_cheaply/,"Edit: Needs to be here for July 22nd and return July 27th.

I'm the best man for a friends wedding. It's a very small event, with the total invited guests at around 50 including their dates. We have a friend, who didn't quite make the wedding party, but has been part of our grooms group of 6 or so very close friends. He lives in Australia, but will be in Halifax at the time of the wedding. As of now it will cost him $1000 or so to find a return flight from Halifax to Calgary. The problem is that he is in medical school, and a few hundred thousand dollars in debt, and though it's the home stretch, his ultra fiscally conservative dad still has a lot of say in what he can spend money on because the father's house is collateral for his line of credit.

So, basically, there is a chance that my friend may not make it home for the bachelor party and wedding. It's important to me that he makes it, because it would mean a lot to the groom and to the rest of us, and as the best man I feel I have to do what I can to make it the best possible for the groom.


-I have tried looking at different airlines and prices.
-I tried looking at Airmiles, because I have a lot that I could sell to him(once he starts making an income, which will be next Jan when he starts a paid internship), but I didn't have enough to make it across the country, the best I could do is land him in Thunder Bay, Ont. 
-I tried checking www.skiplagged.com, which I learned of today because of an /r/askreddit post, but it really doesn't work in this situation.

So what can I do to make it cheaper for him?

If all else fails I will offer to help him pay for a flight. It is important to him that he come, he has assured me he isn't worried about $1k extra debt piled on to what he already is.

The Flight is Halifax to Calgary, but it could also be Halifax to Lethbridge, AB or Kelowna, BC, or Cranbrook BC. Any of those would be alright."

I'd really like to hear personal stories about how you got out of yours. Backstory:My car breaking down has put me into debt at the worst possible time. and bf has a low skilled job. I graduated (not amazing GPA, but 2 years internship, then new internship of 3 months presently) in CS, and have recently been told to find a new job at my very first job out of college. They're letting me stay on as an intern, (for the cheap labor and an undetermined amount of time) but they want code zombies who can bring in customers (very niche company), and my coding style is slower/more careful than the hackish code being put into production (they make money off subscriptions and this place underpaying employees by 15 - 20K, most have been here &lt;1year ). I didn't look for other jobs, as the salary listed was higher, I don't care to fight the issue since I'm tied to my car loan (bad choice perhaps, but needed a car and made a rash decision) I expected this to be a few years gig, but it's not sustainable at intern wages. I I feel kicked in the face by this, but have to put on a happy face for work because bills. I try to keep a positive attitude, but spent the last 3 days playing league/ redditing when I should be looking. I'm usually not this demotivated, but I am afraid of the challenge of finding a new job. So, I'd like to hear your stories about how you have gotten out of a similar (multiple things weighing on you etc) rut. On top of that I'm vastly overweight and it has only happened in the past year which sucks my confidence dry. I'm working on the diet, etc, but this all at once is very disheartening. I want to start coding my passion projects for a really cool job I saw posted in webgl, I want to be confident and assertive, I just feel trapped. Any insight and real practical solutions that worked for you is extremely helpful. Thanks for sharing."

I would love to see a world where governments would be more willing to let groups of people experiment. Say, to allot some areas that would be totally tax free and where people could start new kinds of communities, maybe they'd be mixed- not only geographic, but also online.

Of course, it is really hard to get meaningful number of people to join some new community, people have roots in places they live etc., but perhaps such forward thinking initiatives could attract people, for example at least for internships and voluntary work, with youth from all over the world.

It just seems that with current government models (what we mostly have), we are not efficient as much as it is required in today's world. I think 21st century should be efficiency century, where we should just look at all kinds of established institutions and see where we can improve and cut some things.

I would believe that perhaps some country in Eastern Europe or other place that is relatively safe, but not as developed as West, could greatly benefit for allowing such an enclave within its borders, as no doubt it could attract creative brains from all over the world who could try to make a better tomorrow.

I know that these ideas might not work, I am not an expert and people like Lenin and Hitler and Mao etc. have proved that experimentation can also be dangerous, but this would not be starting with millions and extreme measures, this would be just starting with a fairly large plot of land and progressive thinking people who could draw up what's right and wrong based on 21st century sensibilities, to be laws, than try to accommodate changes to books of entries collected through millennia...

Failed relationship. Failed childhood. Seems like everywhere I turn I'm struck with failure. I'm a good person. I think I deserve a few good things.  I treat people equally and nicely. I don't yell, don't scream, don't put people down. 

I've been dreading my career for about 3 years now, but decided to keep going to finish it. After a big rejection from what could be a huge internship to turn my career around, I feel so hopeless and aimless. My heart's just not in this career field anymore. At first I chose this field because at the time that's the only thing I thought I could do. Now my brain has developed a bit better, and I have a huge passion for mathematics and computer science. I want to pursue a career in computer science, but being 28, I feel I have limited options and limited time. I already have two degrees, not sure how realistic it would be to go back to school. 

The relationship was the best thing that happened in my life. The only girl who ever love me. The only girl I ever love. We went on a break. But now there's little chance of getting back together because I don't have a high paying career. She's sick, and I want to take care of her but have very little money. Thinking about this makes me so so sad. The best things in my life right now is escapism by learning computer program, mathematics, and watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy. 

On the plus side, I have a job in retail that maybe I'll work in till the day I die and finally get some peaceful rest. 

Sorry that everything is all mumbled jumbled. I'm at an all time low and having a hard time getting disciplined to do anything else. 

Not sure where to go from here. I've been doing well these past 3 months by having a routine, waking up earlier, going to work, finding jobs, not playing video games. But got struck today, and everything just feels pointless.

35eirb,20,2015-05-09,I pissed off my farrier. Help.,[deleted],Horses,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/35eirb/i_pissed_off_my_farrier_help/,"I love this guy, he's the best farrier I've had for nearly 5 years and is great with the horses; a 14yo QH (my primary horse), a 17yo mini, and a 3yo draft-pony.

I have a constant struggle with my non-equestrian parents, who bought these horses a long time ago. They are toxic people, and as long as I am completing my Bachelor's I cannot move out. I've been trying to make things as safe as possible here and have a new home set up for my horse--- I already have her breeder glad to take her and I trust them greatly. My parents know I care about this horse and are using her as blackmail, though, seeing as she was bought in their name years ago she is legally ""theirs."" They bought two more horses for themselves, and I originally agreed to take care of these while taking classes... but that they had to understand when I went full time, I would need some help. For a while they paid for the barnhand/student rider to come help and teach them how to handle the horses, somehow they twisted it so that the student rider was coming and teaching *me*, not them. I don't need the lessons, as all she can teach me is showmanship and provide riding lessons. Once I stopped coming out to see the rider, thus making it so that she *had* to work with my parents, I thought it was working out. Weeks later I learned my mother cancelled the help after two visits because my mother ""didn't like working with the horses.""

So throughout all this I'm trying to transition to being full-time in university classes, dealing with my parents, and attending therapy on campus without them knowing. I have severe anxiety and depression that they refuse to acknowledge. After a year with the extra horses, I told them they would have to sell the youngest (3yo) one, because I cannot take care of her alone and all she's doing is sitting in pasture. I feel absolutely horrible that I have not been able to keep up, and as I live in a humid/muddy area, the horses all got thrush.

On the bright side I chose not to take any summer classes, so I have been able to treat the thrush consistently and it looks better. I needed to get an internship, but this seems unlikely if I still have to care for the three horses alone.

My farrier knew I was struggling on and off with the thrush, usually I would be able to treat it consistently for a week and then have trouble after that (it would clear up, then come back worse) but the last time he visited it was bad enough for him to be *pissed* about it. I wasn't present last time, and my parents informed me that he yelled at them about the very bad thrush and said I was doing a shit job, no excuses. I know my parents love to exaggerate anything like this, but I think he really is upset about it. There wasn't anything I could do, and I feel worse knowing I let the farrier and my horses down so bad. If it was my way, I would at least have sold the younger horse on, at best I would not have any of the horses right now. I could take care of my one horse, but the other two are too much.


**Tl'dr: I've been having serious issues with mental help, my manipulative parents, college full time, and taking care of two additional horses. The horses all got deep thrush, the farrier is pissed about it and the condition of the whole barn area since I have not had time to take care of everything. I feel like whatever I say sounds like an excuse. What should I tell him in the upcoming visit?**"
35elk5,1,2015-05-09,Me [24F] trying to be friends with my ex [24M] after the end of a seven year relationship where he left me for another woman. Any advice?,may92015,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35elk5/me_24f_trying_to_be_friends_with_my_ex_24m_after/,"This is a throwaway account. I know he is on Reddit. 


Some background:
I was with my SO for almost 8 years when I was accepted into graduate school. My school was over an 18h drive away and in another country. We started dating in high school and had lived together for roughly 3 years in undergrad. We also did long-distance off and on while we both did internships, traveled, etc. I was pretty close with his family, and we had even lived with his grandparents for about 4 months. All of my friends and family loved him as well and would constantly compliment our relationship.We had openly discussed our future many times, and were considering a 2016 wedding. 

We had a great relationship where we could talk through all of our problems.  He was a sweet, kind boyfriend, and I have no real complaints about our time together. We got along extremely well and enjoyed being with each other. He made me very happy and we both truly loved one another.  


I moved to graduate school and within the first few weeks I noticed something was off. When I asked him about it he told me he was having doubts about our relationship and wanted to date other people. His main reasons for this were 1) that we had never really dated other people because we got together when we were 15, and 2) that he was concerned about the distance. I was incredibly shocked and hurt and didn't know how to respond. I asked if he wanted to try to fight for us or if he was planning on ending it. He said he wanted to fight for us. 

Long story short, after a few weeks and me flying back to visit him to try to work things out, he told me he was talking to other girls and he wanted to try dating other people. We broke up and I was devastated for months. Within a few weeks he was dating someone he met right after I left for graduate school. We broke up in September 2014 and they are still together.


I am now in a much better place. I've been running almost every day, dating, and am really enjoying my school. I have not seen him or spoken to him over the phone since we broke up. We text about once per month, and our conversations have always been friendly and polite. I will be moving back home for the summer, and I know we might run into one another since we have a lot of mutual friends. 


I told him about a month ago that I didn't want our friends to feel awkward around us, so that I wanted to work on some sort of friendship. He agreed. I do think this is possible. Even though I have not completely forgiven him, for the most part I am no longer hurt or angry with him. I think we can be friends and I am looking forward to getting to know him in a different way. I feel that his new gf may have issue with us being friends, but I think it is necessary in order for me to completely forgive him. Any advice on how to become friends with someone you once loved but who then broke your heart? 


TL;DR; Was in a happy, committed relationship for almost 8 years. I moved away to graduate school and he broke up with me to start dating other people. He is currently in a ~7 month relationship that he started within weeks after we broke up. I'm moving back home and want to try to be friends.  "

* Country of purchase: The Netherlands

* Budget range: €1100 - €1500

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Both gaming and web/game/application development.

* Screen size preference: 15,6"", but I can live with 14"" or 13""

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows, but it doesn't have to be pre-installed as I can get it for free via Microsoft DreamSpark. I will also be running Linux on it. (no Mac, way to expensive and I don't need it).

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Payday 2 on max settings with 60fps would be great, but please check the bottom of this post for more info.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): Web development (Sublime Text, PHPStorm, Databases etc., some game development (in Visual Studio) and app development (Android Studio). I also use Illustrator.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I don't have great experiences with Acer machines, owned both a desktop and laptop, and a friend of mine had a laptop from them. They were all from the 'eMachine' series, but if you guys can convince me otherwise I don't really mind.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): The XPS 13 from Dell is a beautiful laptop, my brother has a MSI GS60 which I like for it's weight.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: I'd rather have a lighter laptop because I have to carry it with me to school and my internship everyday. 

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: Having a good build quality is nice, but I'm willing to sacrifice on this.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Doesn't really matter

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: 1920 x 1080 is good enough for me

* A great keyboard: Good keyboard is nice, although at home I have it connected to a mechanical keyboard

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Good touchpad is required

* Great audio: Doesn't really matter. At school I wear headphones, at home I have great speakers.

**List any features that are critical:**
I'm still in doubt over one thing, which is, should I buy an expensive laptop that allows me to play games &amp; do my school work, or save some money on the laptop, and build a gaming pc? The problem is that I also have to save for my own future, and I don't make enough money for a good desktop pc within a year.

Also, for videocards, I prefer Nvidia cards, have had a really good experience with them so far, and I like and I'm used with the included software.

35eu2e,52,2015-05-09,Racial bias in job interviews?,puppydog1234,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/35eu2e/racial_bias_in_job_interviews/,"I graduated from a top public school with a decent GPA and multiple internships. I have found through my entire college experience that I am always the only minority female student interviewing for the job in final round. It is literally always white or asian male applicants. There is sometimes a few females, but always white or asian. I have literally never seen another non-white or asian final round interviewer EVER.

I have found all my interviewers usually are white males. Moreover than that, I find the interviewers are always surprised to match my face with the resume. When I have had my name called out for on campus recruiting, I can see the interviewer scan the whole host of candidates assuming it is someone else.

I can't help feel that sometimes I don't get the job because of my race. I have found phone interviews have always gone better for me than in person. I have heard countless times from my peers, friends, and managers that I have great interpersonal skills/ presentation skills. 

I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to the topic, but I constantly feel like I have to prove myself more because I am not white or asian. I feel like people assume I am not smart or qualified because of my ethnicity. I also feel like people tend to make assumptions based on my body type. 

For example in Mock Trial in highschool, I had one of my best performances I ever had. I went up to the judge afterwards to get constructive criticism and she told me I was dressed inappropriately for a court room. I was wearing a suit and a button down shirt with a pair of black pumps. How else can I dress more appropriately other than to get rid of my body? She also called me ""bravado"" when literally my entire team had the SAME demeanor as me. I was congratulated from the other team for my great performance and even had random people from the opposing team tell me how great I did. I can't help feel her ""bravado"" comment really was the ""you're a pushy black woman like all those other ones"".

I didn't really think it was a big deal until I started to notice how little minority female representation there is in the corporate environment. The only jobs I seem to land are when I have been interviewed by asian females. Although they may face different discrimination than black woman, I feel like they put me less on the ""prove yourself"" standpoint.

It also drives me crazy when white men tell me it should be easier to get the job because I'm a minority female. I'm like so they just haven't hired any minority females for the past x years and they suddenly are going to change their culture to hire one? No, they most likely will hire the white guy who was in their fraternity and likes to golf. (I'm not joking, I've been asked if I'm in a sorority or if I play golf ever).

Maybe it's all in my head, but does anyone else feel this way?"
35f407,4,2015-05-09,"Bosses forcing me to work heavily in a support role as well as dev, what do I do?",DevTurnedSupport,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35f407/bosses_forcing_me_to_work_heavily_in_a_support/,"I'll try to keep this somewhat vague to keep anonymity, but it might be tough considering the specific situation. I'll give an overview so you guys can get an understanding of my mindset around the situation so far too.

So last spring I graduated from a small state school with a BS in Computer Science. Had about a 3.5 gpa, never went all out in school, but when I started job hunting I *really* cracked down on my data structures and algorithms, and actually became quite proficient with them. I'd say that knowing proper data structures to use in certain situations and problem solving is my biggest strength as a programmer, while organization and structuring my code is more of a weakness(so I'm great at interviews, haha).

I interviewed at a pretty large financial company shortly after graduation for a .NET developer role. They were looking for someone who they thought would be a good fit with the team and was willing to learn, so they asked me a few really simple data structures questions and whiteboard problems, and I was fairly enthusiastic in interviews so I got the job(they told me after among 20 other people which I was *very* surprised to hear).

So I've been working there for the past year, doing small, simple C# apps, working on an older asp.net app, stuff like that. It's been okay, but it hasn't been particularly challenging in terms of coding or the projects I face, but more of getting proper permissions, getting information from people about stuff I don't have knowledge about, getting people to respond to my freakin emails, stuff like that has been the most challenging.

Recently they told me that one of their contractors, a guy who has pretty much *all* of the knowledge around a process, is leaving this winter. This is more about overnight processes, all the data they get from other companies about transactions and stuff, how all that stuff happens. It's actually very complex with dozens and dozens of working parts. No one else around really has that knowledge, so it's imperative that he passes it on to someone, and apparently they want this someone to be me.

Now I'm fine with learning about how all this works, and even documenting it well for them so that people in the future can learn it faster, but I'm *not* okay with becoming their support guy. Basically if something goes wrong with these overnight processes, people offshores are the first line that sees if they can fix it, if they can't, they call this contractor. That will be me in about 6 months after I learn all this stuff. That's bullshit. I don't want to be contacted every weekend, or wake up in the middle of the night, to deal with this stuff. Like how much time out of the day do they want out of me? Is 8 hours not enough? Ridiculous.

This is not what I signed up for. I applied and accepted the job to become a developer. I had another job offer that I could have taken at the time as a .NET developer for the exact same salary, I chose this one because I felt I would learn more here. Now I'm getting the impression that they're trying to dupe me, and that they gave me these small simple projects to lure me in, and then now that I'm used to my salary, have an apartment, car, and a bunch of bills, and straight up leaving isn't an option, they turn me into their overnight support while doing dev on the side.

Now if these guys were assholes just leaving would be easy, but the problem is they're genuinely nice guys. We joke around, laugh, it's not a stiff work environment...but who fuckin knows what they say behind my back because I'm pretty sure they think I'm an idiot, they ask me all the time if I understand stuff that is *extremely* simple, like they didn't expect me to be able to pick it up in the first place. This isn't the case guys I swear I'm not an idiot lol. I'm also grateful because I didn't have any internships coming out of college, and the college I came from definitely would not have been heard of from pretty much anyone, so the opportunity has been essential to starting my career, at least now I can say I've worked somewhere for a year and have some experience under my belt. If I got a job elsewhere I feel like I would be betraying them a little bit, they took a risk on me and in the end it *didn't* pay off because I bailed on them.

Does anyone have any similar situations where a job like this tried to turn you into less of a developer and more of a general tech guy/support role? How did you handle it? What do you think I should do? Should I stick it out longer? If I'm planning to leave within the next year would leaving now be more of a favor to them so they can get someone that might stick around for some time? They've made it seem like they want me to learn this stuff so I can be in place doing this for a while. I honestly don't know what to do.

Edit - Thanks for the responses guys. I think I'm going to start looking for a new job. Seems risky to tell them straight out that I don't want to be support, because if that's *really* all they're looking for, then I don't want them to just find someone else and let me go. If I could afford to job hunt for a couple of months without working then maybe I would address the concerns, but I can't currently afford that. Maybe that will change in a couple months when I have a little more saved."

I've been getting a lot of initial phone interviews, but when I get in, I just blank on the simplest things and end up getting turned down. I've gone through CTCI and Programming Interviews Exposed several times, and have done a lot of problems on hackerrank, and I've shown myself over and over that I know my stuff, but interviews still rarely go well. Sometimes the interviewer will give me a hint that will have me saying ""duh!"" but often times, they just let me struggle then have me move on to something else or it's something that I need to solve a larger problem and it throws me off and I never find a solution and the interviewer ends up clearly displeased with my performance. Most often, as soon as the interview is over, the memory whatever I couldn't get virtually smacks me across the face before I can even look it up. The other day I got asked ""What is polymorphism?"" and even though I have gotten that question on every third interview I'd ever had, it was like I had never heard the term in my life. Not long before that, in a different interview, I blanked on a minor implementation detail of basic binary search and it threw off my entire solution to the bigger problem that I had gotten asked.

I thought it was just nerves, but this happens even when I go into the interview feeling fine. I already spend almost all of my time studying and working on problems because I only had one blowoff GenEd class this semester. What else can I do?

and FWIW I never used to have this issue. I got plenty of internship offers when I was in college, but even though my interviews now are basically the same as they were then, I've gotten turned down from every company I got an internship offer from, and then some. "

My question is: Which one is the better choice? I know U of T has the better reputation, especially for CS, and PEY can land you better jobs potentially at silicon valley.

Could a student with the Queen's internship also end up at silicon valley?

35g2c5,0,2015-05-09,26M4F Unleash your inner slut; five prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/35g2c5/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_slut_five_prompts/,"I've had a LOT of fun with these prompts in the past, and I'm at it again. A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages (if you're looking to play a scenario out in just an hour or two while still getting all the details nailed down, I'm your guy!). Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing!

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you tonight!"
35g2ty,1,2015-05-09,Stay behind for extra semester/term or do another internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35g2ty/stay_behind_for_extra_semesterterm_or_do_another/,"Hey guys,

I'm currently doing a 12-month internship (Software development at a large telecom corporation) and will be finishing at the end of August. I have also done a 4-month internship at a Startup the previous summer (QA and a little development). 

Starting September, I'll be returning to school to complete my last year of my CS undergrad, which includes a final project as well.
My end goal is to work at one of the Big 4 or a company like Khan Academy (I'm very interested in their goal). I hear its better to get as much experience as an undergrad and that interviews will be easier than as a new graduate.

Here are my options:

1. Spread out my course load so I get another summer to do co-op through my school or find my own internship.
Fall 2015 - School =&gt;
Winter 2016 - School =&gt;
Summer 2016 - 3-4 month Internship =&gt;
Fall 2016 - School, do final project (Last semester) =&gt;
Graduate

2. Have really tough semesters and graduate right after my 2nd semester.
Fall 2015 - School =&gt;
Winter 2016 - School (do my final project, will be a really hard semester) =&gt;
Graduate

Would do you guys think? Tips will be much appreciated.
Thanks"
35ga07,1,2015-05-09,Everything is going well....but my brain is still trying to kill me.,Squirrel_Bandit,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/35ga07/everything_is_going_wellbut_my_brain_is_still/,"I am almost 27 years old, and I have struggled with serious depression for as long as I can remember. It's only gotten worse as I've gotten older.

I always told myself it would get better as soon as my life improved. I'd feel OK once I was out of high school. Once I had my own car. Once I got a degree, a place of my own, found friends...and so on.

But right now, things are going well. I've gone back to college, I'm getting perfect grades. I'm working an awesome internship and just landed a summer job that's basically a dream come true.

And last week, I nearly decided to drive my car into a tree on my way home one night.

Success, it seems, does not have the miraculous powers I once ascribed to it. Because even as I recognize that nothing is actually wrong, I cannot shake off the soul-tearing sense of despair.

My doctor doubled my meds, and that's taken away the worst of it for now. But it's always that way -- new meds or new dose, and it feels fine for a while, then it gets bad again. And each time it comes back, it's harder to get back out of it again.

I'm terrified that one day I will not be able to escape it again. Or that there IS a solution, but I won't be able to hold out long enough to find it.

My mind is now trying to tell me that everything will be fine when I get my degree....when I get my own house.... when my career is started. When I have enough money for small luxuries.

But I just can't believe it anymore.

I'm praying that this time, the meds will bring me all the way up out of it and keep me there. But I'm not sure I believe that, either... :("
35gbvn,1,2015-05-09,My parents (dad in particular) seem a bit controlling.,controllingparents10,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/35gbvn/my_parents_dad_in_particular_seem_a_bit/,"Hey guys I'm 16 and my parents seem a bit controlling and it starting to worry me. Well not really worry me, but there behavior seems a bit strange with my older sister, and I'm afraid to see how they will be with me later on.

My dad tells her when to get to bed, last night it was 11:15. She is 20. She has a job. Is it weird that I find this so strange? They have always been a bit strict, but the way they control her makes me worry about how my relationship with them will be when I'm an adult. 

She is about to start an internship at $600 a week. She gets to keep $50 as spending money and the rest goes towards her college. They still have power over her bank account. Their logic is they are helping her with college so it's only fair that they take that much. My parents are not poor, and obviously will not be taking this money for themselves (it would not really make a dent), but this just seems unfair to my sister. Am I wrong? She does not seem happy with it, considering it is her money, but they do provide her with a rent free, food covered place to live

They are not covering college completely for her, so it doesn't seem like an ideal setup. It's not as easy as just saying ""well I make enough money to rent a cheap apartment."" Some people seem to think it is, but have never been in this situation with a family like this. 

Anyway I should get to my point. The reason I mentioned all of that about my sister is I am worried about what my future with them will be like. They are pressuring me to go to college, but will not let me go to community college because ""You're too smart for that,"" but I'm not smart enough, or poor enough to get any good scholarships. Basically I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place with parents seeming to have a large control over my future to my financial predicament.

35gjmk,11,2015-05-09,Film School: A Reflection After Completing My First Semester,Levittra,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/35gjmk/film_school_a_reflection_after_completing_my/,"**Some generals about myself for context:**

I'm in my mid-twenties, and currently enrolled in the graduate program at one of the Hollywood Reporter's alleged top-five film schools. [Reference](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/top-25-film-schools-united-721649). Prior to my admittance I had completed two short films, been accepted into a handful of mid-tier film festivals (i.e. NOT Sundance, Venice, Canne, etc.), and Producer/ADed two independent feature films, which are currently in the final stages of post-production. I was working full-time at a corporate video production company as a Production Assistant and Associate Producer (on lower-budget projects), so all ""narrative"" film pursuit was taking place during my free time.

**Why I wanted to go:**

Primarily I wanted to get to LA. At the time I was in the Mid-West, and, while at one point in time I thought a newly inducted motion picture tax credit would drive some high-caliber feature films to my part of the country, I quickly realized that wasn't the case. 

Additionally, I wanted to have the opportunity to completely devote my time to film. I was feeling an overwhelming pressure to get a job and make money, but upon doing so I was compromising my true passion for the sake of structure. I was still pursuing film, but the idea of devoting all my time and energy to film was a much more enticing option. I felt film school would provide that. 

Finally, I wanted to learn from proven industry professionals. It's one thing to take advice and instruction from fellow aspiring-filmmakers, but it's something entirely different to hear it from Oscar-winners. They seemed like much more credible sources, and through the foundation of film school they seemed accessible. 

**My First Impressions:** 

This is not what I expected. 

It feels like a downright case of false-advertisement, and I struggle to decide who is at fault for that. I distinctly remember touring the school prior to arriving, and being led into one of the on-campus theaters and shown this video... It had all the notable alumni speaking about how incredible an experience this was for them. How they wouldn't be where they are now without it. It was hard not to walk out feeling motivated. But they never once spoke about the curriculum, the gear accessible, the structure of the program... and I didn't ask. All I knew is that they were promoting themselves as one of the top programs in the world, so what else would I have done but expected the best of everything?

That is not what I feel like I have gotten. This entire semester has been devoted to ""getting everybody on the same page."" This has involved learning what a camera is and how it works, the various on-and-off-set positions and their responsibilities, and the basic tools of the non-linear editing system AVID. (Please note the blatant absence of how to create and effectively convey a ""story."" Presumably that comes later...) Please remember that I mentioned THIS IS THE GRADUATE PROGRAM.

One disclaimed to the aforementioned paragraph: The school did stress prior to my acceptance that they strive to let in storytellers of all experience levels. They want the person who's never touched a camera but worked on Wall Street for the past 15 years, just as much as they want the person who's been the Second Unit Director on the last three Marvel movies. They're looking for people with varying backgrounds and outlooks on life. As a result, that is presumably why this program panders so much to the basics... I do not, however, believe that should entitle me to pay a semester's worth of tuition for 4 months of refresher courses. 

Now I do not want to act as if I haven't learned anything. Every now and then a golden nugget of information is dropped. Yet I personally do not feel that the ratio of ""gained knowledge"" to tuition money warrants any praise. I would also like to note that my tuition apparently bought me a copy of ""Movie Magic,"" so I got that going for me... which is nice.

The gear situation is a joke, only to be compensated by the faculty and advisors' constant reminder that ""It's about the story, and not the gear."" Yes... but I'll stress again the lack of class time devoted to learning story. In this program you are required to use the assigned camera: A fixed zoom-lens, HD camcorder with a 1/3"" chip that maxes out at 1080/24p and 4:2:0 color (I believe 4:2:2 is achievable with an external recorder, but external recorders are not permitable to students in my semester). And for those wondering, no, you may not use your own personal cameras, even if they are better than the provided camera. Doing so may result in expulsion. As the faculty and advisors will remind you, ""We don't want anybody to have any unfair advantages when showing work.""

Finally, the faculty is... cool? I mean that in the best way, I'm just not quite sure the right word to use. I've definitely achieved the goal of wanting to learn from ""proven industry professionals,"" and I do have a class or two with an Oscar winner. They're very accessible outside of class, and they're incredibly friendly and approachable. They teach the curriculum, and they teach it through the rules and regulations that have been implemented on the students, so I cannot fault them for that. The curriculum simply isn't what I as an aspiring filmmaker with my level of experience had hoped it would be. 

The facilities are solid, though. And the campus is beautiful. Gotta give them that.

**What I've learned/gained:**

Confidence. This, to me, is one of the most important takeaways I've had from this experience to date. I've received compliments and reassurance from faculty that I look up to and trust, and while I'm in no way at all believing myself to be the next Lucas or Spielberg, I am slowly starting to believe that I might not be terrible at this whole filmmaking thing... which I'm taking as a good thing. 

You don't need to go to school to learn how to make films... and you may not actually ever be able to LEARN film. This is something that was stressed to me many a time before I committed to school. ""You can learn everything you need to on set."" They were right. I shouldn't have doubted them, but I needed to figure that out for myself. 

School is safe. I have absolutely no worries here. The government gives me money. I pay the school. I pay my rent. I pay for food. I write... there is nothing to really worry about while I'm here. It's freeing, and I do like it, but that lingering and ever-increasing debt is hard to ignore. As this post hopefully shows, every day I questions its worth.

The people here are awesome. Faculty and students. Students arguably more. I've made friends who I know I'll continue to shoot films with, and point-blank I would not have met them without attending for this semester. Whether or not we propel each other to success is yet to be seen, but I can't see myself collaborating with anybody else at this point in my life. We push each other in the best of ways, and I am very grateful to have met them.

I got an internship. It's at a solid, top-tier production company with a first-look studio deal. Who knows whether or not it's because my resume now has the school's name at the top... but I got it, and I'm excited about the opportunity. 

**What now:**

I'm still enrolled. I've attended the ""orientation classes"" for the next semester, and they in no way shifted my view/opinion about the program into a positive light. I fear that at this point my mind is made up, and nothing could save my view/opinion. 

I'm looking for a way out. I don't know what that way out is, but I'm afraid to leave without having anything to leave *to*. To me, going to film school was a stepping-stone to being able to write and directed a feature film, and that is the goal I will continue to pursue. I have an outline (which I have been able to receive guidance on from faculty members), and I will write it... 

Quite frankly, I don't know."

She's visiting from another state to see her old room mate, we've known each other for a year, I met her during an internship opportunity in Florida. While we were there, we did everything together. Late night food trips, going to theme parks, hang out and all that. However I never really felt like she liked me the way I did.

I've known about her visit for a while and we've actually planned on hanging out for months now. So naturally, I expected this date like scenario, we'd do everything we used to do, probably reminisce about old times, go out for drinks, and maybe the night would end with a kiss or a confession of our feelings.

Today, after telling me we're hanging out next week, she then told me that her room mate is tagging along, this reconfirming the friend zone. LOL.

So, tell me about your expectation vs reality moment. Doesn't have to be romantic."

If this person was able to attain a job at Microsoft with just the CS courses below (he said this was his background in the thread):
Intro to CS 1 and II

1 Web Development Course

Question 1: How likely is it that I would be able to get an internship with just those courses? Not necessarily at Microsoft, mind you. More specifically, will I be marketable for an internship with the same such courses?

They're pretty much considered a ""safety school"" for my state.  They're unranked in CS (meaning below 25th percentile) and the graduation rate for the whole college is basically half-and-half.  The only reason I went is because I had no choice- they offered a full tuition scholarship and in my family's financial state I had no other option.

I've finished freshman year with a 4.0 GPA and almost 60 credits (including APs).  I'm planning to double major in math, which is why I took differential equations this semester.  I may take one or two minors as well.  Compared to the norm at my university I'm absolutely excelling.

But the university is garbage, and there's no avoiding this fact.  What do employers see when they look at people like me?

35gvj3,38,2015-05-10,Me [23F] found out something about my boyfriend [24M] and I don't know how to react at all!,due33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35gvj3/me_23f_found_out_something_about_my_boyfriend_24m/,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

First of all I would like to just say that I love my boyfriend! There was something about him that really attracted me to him. His calm and cool presence, his deep eyes, the way he naturally demands respect without uttering a single word. I could go on and on about him BUT recently I found out something about his past that I could never have imagined.


We met about a year and a half ago at an yearly summer festival. He was playing soccer and he kicked the ball by accident and hit me straight in the head lol, He came rushing towards me all concerned, and made sure I was alright. He stayed with me for 15 minutes! I was already crushing on him. I later found out in the fall semester we go to the same university! I saw him a few times at university and he always looked like he was in his own world, thinking deeply about something. I finally initiated contact with him and hot his number. He was friendly and agreed to hang out. We later started dating and things were awesome! He was caring and was just so different than any other guy I've known! 


**Fast forward**: I was at his place waiting for him there. I came across a diary? I just was generally interested in what it was for. I thought of this as some university fancy notebook, but still opened out of curiosity. As I kept reading my heart sank! I quickly took pictures of all the written text so i could read it all at home.


**Contents of Diary**: So 2-2.5 years ago, my boyfriend was in love with another girl. Apparently he loved her for 6-7 years and it didn't work out for him. He's been depressed all this time. Every day, the version of himself he showed me wasn't the real him. He is depressed and couldn't come in term about losing this girl forever.


**BUT** here's what the really concerning part about this is, he knew this girl from high school. But they weren't even friends or anything and he developed a crush on her. He fantasized about her every day without even knowing her! He created this mental image about her being the ""perfect girl"" for him, soul mates if you will (according to him)


He started university and was still obsessed with this girl. Stalked her on facebook and this obsession/limerence/extreme oneitis took over him, consumed him. He got depressed when he saw pictures of her with other guys! His university grades dropped, he never had any interest in studying. He just wanted this one girl he barely knew. 


He got an internship at a different city and that’s the city where she went to university. He randomly saw her at campus and he froze apparently. He said this was like a dream. His destiny to see her what’s written in the stars.
 He stalked her facebook and found out about an event in campus. He summoned up the courage to go up to a girl he’s probably never talked to but fantasized about for year. He succeeded and got her number! Apparently she offered her number to him and he described her laughter as heart melting... He described this as one of the best moments in his life. 


 They texted and he kept writing about how he actually somehow made this fantasy about her a reality. Like he achieved the unachievable. He also wrote about how all those years of depression, he overcame that period and actually did something to be with her. He concluded by saying, if you want something so bad, the universe itself will help you achieve it.


Then one day at campus he saw her with some other guy and he felt bad. He texted her and she didn't respond. He was so depressed for that one month where she didn't respond. She finally did one month later and it reignited his hopes. He saw her at some event again with that dude and according to him his anger got the best of him and he wasn't acting right when he confronted her that day. He claims he let his emotions of hatred for the guy being with her get the better of him and the girl sensed that and she wasn't feeling comfortable that day because something was off about him. He even indirectly confronted the dude with her and that dude just walked away. The last conversation they had was the girl saying you’re bad , you’re evil. (This was a response to a joke he made about her chilling with her guy friend)


Afterwards, he texted her and she didn't reply. He later texted a genuine apology text and she also didn't reply to that. It broke him and he schemed things to see her at campus no matter what. He claims he couldn't let it end this way after all those years. He failed to see her and didn’t text her claiming his love for her.  His internship ended and he went back to his home city. It's been 2-3 years to those events and he can't move on from this obsession. Living in regret and self hatred for screwing this up.


The thing that really broke me was..
&gt;it's been 2 years to that day. I fucked up. Why can't I get over this girl. I barely knew her, I found out so many flaws about her when I actually saw her but why? I loved her and was willing to sacrifice everything to be with her and the last words she uttered to me was that I’m evil and bad...Why do I only find happiness when I think about her? Fantasize about her? Why do I rely on my happiness on her? On others? Is it because of my abusive childhood that I never experienced love from my own that I desperately look to others to fill that void? I am now dating **OP**, she's an awesome person but this is so unfair to her. I'm wasting her life pretending everything is alright. Pretending my past never existed. She deserved so much better than a low life scum bag like me.. I may not recover from this but there’s no way I’ll let **OP** suffer because of me…


I don't know what to do now. He's been obsessed with this girl and still thinks about her. I feel so broken that he will never feel that way about me. Should I confront him? Should I break things off? I just can't let go of him, I honestly do love him but why didn't he tell me about her. Why is he so obsessed about her? I can't believe that this is the same guy I knew all this time....

I'm a 21 year old computer engineer. Currently at an  internship with AMD.

A few years who, back in a rather terrible highschool, I found most of the girls around to be rather... To be blunt, dumb. The few that were decently smart/mature, were far from interested in me, and didn't end up in a single date.

College comes around, there seem to be few to none girls around the computer engineering courses I take, and the rest seem more concerned with their coursework than anything else. (My general lack of time didn't help either)

You folks all know how bad the gender distribution is in the tech industry, in fact, I don't think there's a single female in the entire corner of the building I'm in.

With a full time internship (with overtime now and then), I feel that my opportunities are even less than when I took a full course load. Is there something I should be doing, or somewhere I should be going just to, well, see a more balanced gender ratio in my life?"

I need your advice...  My boyfriend is from the USA, and I'm from the UK.  I am currently studying in Finland, but have managed to get myself an internship where he is living over the summer.

The internship is at an NGO, so I won't be getting paid.  Travel expenses or anything else won't be covered either.

I have been trying to apply for the J-1 visa as I know I need it, but everything has been getting delayed - majorly delayed!  And now there is only less than 3 weeks to go... I am getting terribly worried!

My question is... as my total duration is 90 days (on the nose), do you guys reckon I would be able to get away with just saying I'm visiting my boyfriend and travelling across the US'?  If I show that I have enough money in my bank account, and that I have to be back in Finland at the end of August, do you reckon Customs would be alright?  My auntie also lives there, so I would say that I'm going to see her too.

Or do you think I should book a flight to Canada, which is not too expensive (in comparison with the J-1 visa), so it looks like I'm leaving the USA earlier and thus won't raise too many alarms?

Thank you in advance, so worried about this!"

The other response is, build something, anything and you will learn, but I feel like I will build horrible habits and want a mentor or guidance.  I feel like I've been wandering in the web self study department for an entire year and didn't make significant progress( did all of codecademy, javasript/rubyHTML/CSS of team treehouse, dash, the HTML/CSS of project Odin, read Chris pines intro to programming). I don't know how much I should know and have no sense of whether what I did learn is even good enough for an internship or job.

My bachelors was in Finance and I saved up ( worked 3 years in finance and supply chain) and quit my job( was bored, wasn't creative/ problems weren't that interesting) to pursue CS or Web Dev and I am very interested in full stack web Dev or software engineering( more web Dev). I'm currently considering a masters in CS.  
 I have completed Intro to java, intermediate java and currently taking Data structures, assembly, and programming languages. I took an HTMl5/CSS3 and javascript/jQuery class this past fall. I still have to take OS, advanced algorithms, Computer architecture and some math classes before I can apply to a masters program.  
 
Should I or should I not pursue a masters in CS? I am still (25)very young so I feel I can take this risk( no debt, can afford the classes), but at the moment I'm not sure if i should even pursue my masters or why, since I am more interested In web dev... I just need people to talk to about this.  I feel like a masters would benefit me long term wise and open up more doors for management positions later in my career/ increase my pay, and give me a strong foundation to become a software lead, but currently i want to learn and work as a web dev because i find myself more interested in web apps and web sites compared to enterprise software.  

  My future is clashing with my present desires, mixed with arguments I see repeatedly in the below subreddits.  

Sorry if this post is all over the place, just So many schools of thought that are conflicting for aspiring web devs/people who want to get into CS from this subreddit and /r/webdev and /r/learnprogramming"

I accepted an internship for the summer at a fairly large company back in December. I just received an email regarding first day logistics and all that. The email states: 


""You must bring the required documents that prove identity and employment eligibility with you on your first day. All documents must be original and unexpired."" (see more here: http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents)

Now, due to parental/family issues, I only have my ID. Not my birth certificate or SS card (passport expired a year or two ago). I know I can request these, but since I start soon, I can't do both. Here are my options..

1) Get a replacement SS card, arrives in 2 weeks. Perfect except the email states ""original"". It won't be the original. Does this matter or am I overthinking it?

2) Get a copy of my birth certificate and submit that and/or use that to get an original SS card. Can do, but this probably won't happen before my internship starts( appx 2.5 weeks).

3) I was reading online and found this: http://www.ssa.gov/employer/SSNcard.htm and this: http://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnv.htm#a0=-1

Can I email my recruiter and ask about this option? It would save me the hassle of doing both 1 and 2, with the same result (hypothetically).

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."

I live in Quebec, Canada (Montreal area), and I recently graduated at 25 years old. Because of good internships and part-time working, I don't have any debts and even have around 10k sitting around that I could invest (not counting the money I keep for living and other short term investments).

I don't plan on buying a house any time soon since I'll probably move around a lot in the next years, but I want to start looking for long term investment plans. I am currently with CIBC, for my savings and chequing accounts, but their TFSA rates seem low (0.75% when there's no promotion while I have 0.8% on my savings account). I've been with CIBC since my parents opened an account for me when I was a child, so I never gave it any thought, but now that I'm ready to maximize my investments, I'm wondering if I should open an account at another place for my investments (probably a TFSA).

So, after looking at the RateSupermarket site, Peoples Trust seems like a good choice, but I don't know that bank and I would like to know if there's a better choice overall for my money.

I'm of course not limited to TFSA, but I'm quite a newbie in personal finance, so I would like to have your advice on what's the better way to start investing, knowing that I already have 10k to start with.

Thanks"

The first 2.5 - 3 years were spent having major surgeries, non stop physical therapy, and I even had to practice walking own my own again which was pretty humiliating. I was a freshman in college and owned my own business at the time of the accident so I had to drop out/close up shop and move back home while trying to heal. I've had around 30 surgeries since the wreck and developed a terrible pain pill addiction due to the crazy amounts I was prescribed to try and help the pain. Most of the major surgeries I had required me to be on a 7k-10k calorie diet a day while getting a minimum of 500 grams of protein. So all that food plus being on complete bed rest for the first year or so and half bed rest for the next few years (even to this day there are days where the pain gets so bad I have to take a day off or two) that I blew up and gained 110 lbs. 

In the last year and a half I've managed to lose about 90 pounds, I've gotten completely off all opiate based pain meds, I'm back in school and about to switch over from a community college to a 4 year school, and I'm about to finish a phlebotomy class and have an internship and job at the top hospital in the area. Yesterday I had another surgery and went back to the hospital that I used to always be at. I was really close with all the nurses and doctors so when I got there everyone I knew came by for hugs and to catch up. After talking to them and catching them up with my life did I realize objectively how far I've come but when I got home all I could think about is how much time has passed and how far behind I am compared to the people I graduated hs with. I know from the outside it seems I've come along way and I should be proud of what I've accomplished, especially dealing with chronic pain seeing that it doesn't happen a lot, but I can't help but feel absolutely terrible. I know I really needed that visit and reminder of how far I've come because the last two months the pain has been getting worse and I've been thinking about ""giving up"" quite a bit lately, but I just feel like I've hit a plateau in all aspects of life and I have no idea where to go from here. I feel like I've been surviving for survival and all that work I've put it puts be back at square one and it's just a sickening feeling. 

So, anyone that's every had to turn their lives completely around, how did you find direction? What did you do decide and achieve what you wanted? How did you go from just existing to thriving? I used to be a people person and had lots of friends. Over the years out of all my friends less than 5 stuck around. After spending so much time alone and indoors/in bed how did you learn to talk to people again? How did you learn to meet and make new friends? I just feel so lost right now and despite working so hard to overcome the shit in my life I feel like the journey is just beginning but now the path is foggy with thousands of directions to take. Anyone that's ever had to start over again what advice or thoughts can you give me that helped you? "

So I'm a 20 y.o. french guy, about to graduate a bachelor in software development (sandwich degree, so I got a whole year of work experience in a startup at the same time).

I went to Montreal, QC, Canada last year for a three-month internship, so I used this time to travel to the Unites States a few times, and I absolutely loved it.  I've been wanting to move there even before that but it absolutely confirmed it.

I'm not actually bad at what I do, but since I'm just graduating, I don't have a lot of work experience, even if I already have some, and I have a good reactivity in the work field (working in a startup helps for that). Also I'm good at english.

Now that I'm about to graduate, I'd like to gather more information about how I should proceed.  I'm not in a hurry since I'm going to stay in my current company for at least a whole year, but I'd like to go to the USA as soon as possible.

From what I've gathered so far, I know that:

* I need to find a company that will sponsor my Green Card
* It may take up to more than a year for the Green Card to actually be ready

I don't actually know much more so far.  I don't really know how to look for companies, how to proceed for any of that in the USA.

Is there anything I need to know about all of that process, how I should proceed to make it go smoothly?  Anything that could make it easier for me?

I've had 3 job since then in a variety of sized companies and they've all  drained my enthusiasm a little bit further.

I struggle to put my finger on what's bugging me the most about the industry or whether it's the industry in general that's not suited to me.

**Brainstorming wise, the following things popped up:**

* The competitive nature of engineers in these smaller environments, we no longer seem to want to cooperate to produce a product, we fight to get our own bit of code completed and then defend it to the death. It doesn't matter if the product is late as long as my area is done.
* The lack of Engineering process. Everyone's heard of Agile these days saying how great it is to minimize (Avoid) documentation and designs but at the same time they've taken it as a free pass to be lazy and sloppy often resulting in no system architecture or system breakdown. In my last 3 companies I've not seen a single design document.
* Avoidance of accountability,  it's strange to me that so many companies seem to disrespect their customers so badly, I worked in a top class Scientific Instrument company who's policy was that things don't count as bugs until the customer finds them. You see so many developers who don't believe testing is their responsibility.
* The Not Invented Here principle and failing to understand the value of following best practices. It's hard for me to understand just how far people are willing to go to reinvent the wheel. 
* [Expert Beginner syndrome](http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner) hurting the future generations of engineers. Try working for a boss who thinks he knows it all, even worse, a boss who's responsible for 3 interns who thinks he knows it all. He read about the Factory pattern so now he teaches the interns that EVERY class should have an Interface, a concrete implementation and a Factory class to instantiate it.


 

I think the worst of all for me though is the idea that you stay with a company until your mistakes catch up with you, so many people seem to have this approach these days.

35hgws,14,2015-05-10,Losing my first love.,applesandcherry,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/35hgws/losing_my_first_love/,"Approximately three years ago, I [22F] started dating my ex-boyfriend [24M] when I was a freshman and he was a junior in college; now I'm a senior and he's a 2nd year PhD student. He ended up staying in the area for graduate school in the same college. He broke up with me about a month ago, and for weeks I was trying to convince him to stay with me. He said that he could not commit to a long-term relationship, despite telling me otherwise and even meeting my super strict Asian parents knowing that that's what our relationship would mean if he did that. However that was not the whole story. Yesterday he admitted to me that he was actually developing feelings for one of his friends/fellow graduate students [24F] in the same department over the course of several months and they will start dating soon. Before I say more, I guess I should give some background:

The first year or so was great; lots of love shared between us. Then... I don't know what exactly changed. I've been reflecting a lot on our relationship. I admit it was both our faults; he had an inability to tell me his honest and true feelings when they were happening and I kept pressuring him to live up to my expectations. He was hesitant about things like moving in together and marrying eventually, but I kept talking about them even though I knew deep down inside that he didn't want to talk about it. I feel as if I have pushed him away and it's a lot more of my fault than I thought. I expected him to fill up a lot of gaps in my life that were missing because of my low self-esteem.

I used to think/hope that maybe if we both grew up a little bit and matured, and yes even dated other people then we could come back a year from now and possibly reconcile because I believed that we were meant to be together. But I know this girl that he's going to be with, and the way that he talked about her -- they're very serious. They haven't done anything yet and they're already in love. This isn't something he's going to back away from for a long time. 

I want to be happy for him, I really do, but I feel so fucked over too. The other side of the story is that I have issues going on at home so I didn't want to stay with my parents for the entire summer. My parents are VERY strict and are super against me dating which is why I was hesitant to bring up the relationship until I knew that my now-ex was confident in saying that he wanted a long-term relationship with me. They pretty much told me that this better be a relationship that ends up in marriage because otherwise they're not ""going to let me do this anymore."" Meaning that I can't date and would have to be in an arranged marriage or lose my parents' financial support. I'm about to go to a Masters program so I CANNOT have that happen. My ex KNEW about this, and he fell out of love from me and was having feelings for someone else and still said that I should tell my parents about us. I still cannot get over this. His friends are getting married about a week after graduation, and I told my parents that I would be staying with him and his mom (before the breakup happened) for the wedding. I was also planning on essentially staying with him for the second half of summer as well, under the guise that I got an internship.

However, with the breakup and with him starting to date this new girl -- who broke up with her live-in boyfriend as well for the same reasons as my ex -- will be staying with him along with a couple other friends over the summer; but I'm 100% certain she's going to stay with him the whole time. So essentially, I'm fucked. I have no place to go. I asked several friends and begged a few too and they said no. One friend said he could house me, but he'll be gone for all of August so I'll have to get things straightened out. Back to the situation at hand, because of this I don't see how I can be happy for him or wish them well. I feel like he lied to me all this time and everything that he's said and done in the past 6 months have just been a lie.

And it's not just that. He told me he wanted to be single to figure out some stuff. But that wasn't true at all, as soon as she broke up with her boyfriend (of 6 years), they decided to be together instead. They fucking work together, and this is what they want to do? I couldn't fucking believe it. In a way I was also pissed off because I realized that if they're willing to risk it then it's probably more serious then what I know. 

I just feel like this was completely unfair... and now I am left alone and she got picked up. He said he still wanted to be friends, but that is such a lie. This wasn't a mutual breakup, how can I be friends with him when he had lied to me all this time? His mom reached out to me too and she said she wanted to still talk to me, but now she's going to play mother-in-law with this new girl so I highly doubt it.

I've gotten a lot of help from friends, and I do feel a little better today. My roommates were telling me all these stories of their interactions with him, which made me realize how pretentious and conceited he can be. But still, I wish I had some happiness in my life right now. Being told ""I don't' love you anymore"" is one of the worst feelings ever."

My parents both knew about the situation and tried to hide it but finally the truth came out because what they were doing to try and get him into recovery wasn’t working.  

My parents are divorced and live in different towns and at the time I was NC with my NDad.  We resumed contact for the sake of my brother because I wanted to be there for him and make sure he had all of the support he needed.  

During the first week of my brother’s withdrawal, my (E? N? not sure) Mom went about her life like nothing was going on. She even missed a therapy session for her hair cut appointment. I found out later that she is such an (enabler? Toxic person? Evil withc?) that she had known about his addiction for at least two months, had given him money for it and HAD KNOWINGLY DRIVEN HIM TO A DRUG DEAL!!!!!  I ended up having to take a week off from a competitive and important internship and miss classes in order to take care of him.  NDad was also staying at the house but did almost nothing to help.  The entire week I slept maybe 10 hours total.  My brother was up all night, every night pacing the house and I was terrified he would leave and go use.  NDad and Mom slept soundly while my other brother (who also lives in another town but eventually came to help) stayed up with him.  If it weren’t for my other brother being there, I would have had zero sleep.  

I also had to manage the medications (6) that my brother was prescribed for anxiety, depression and things like that.  They were mostly powerful sedatives that could only be taken every certain amount of hours or no more than (blank) per day.  I got to keep track of that.  

My NDad took every opportunity to take jabs at me and put me down, almost as if he had been saving it up during the time we were NC. By the end of the week I was completely frazzled and exhausted. 

After the week of withdrawal was over NDad went home, but not before we had all discussed that I would be in charge monitoring my brother and helping him to his appointments.  We had come up with a bunch of ground rules like he couldn’t talk to certain people (heroin junkies), his car that is owned by my parents would be taken away and that he had to have a curfew.  He didn’t take it well since as the youngest and the GC he basically has never had any boundaries. 

He used again almost immediately and I told NDad and him that this was obviously not working.  He needed inpatient treatment or something more serious than just sitting around at home with my EMom.  Bro promised that it was a slip up and he really wil try harder this time.  I am overwhelmed (did I mention my internship is full time and I’m a full time grad student?).  Next weekend comes, Bro tells me he got a job as a delivery driver and needs his car. I say no. Why did you get a job where you need a car when you know you don’t have one? NDad agrees at first.  Then finally gives in after GCBro throws a fit. *Gosh wouldn’t want to have him upset at us, right??*

I tell NDad that this is it.  If he does not put his foot down and refuse this car, I will no longer be acting as GCBro’s actual parents should be by following him around, snooping on his phone, giving him drug tests etc… I told him that I absolutely would not be trying to keep track of his whereabouts when he is driving around in a car freely like nothing is wrong.  I also told him that I was in danger of failing my courses due to how much time I am spending dealing with this and that he needed to do more and I could not afford to fail out of school.  My career is literally on the line.  Ndad’s response: “Well, I had to take time off work, too.” Da fuck???? You’re his FATHER!!!!! ?????? 

So now my brother won’t speak to me.  If I go right up to him and say “hello.” He turns and walks away.  Not sure what NDad said to him but I’m sure its not what I said.  NDad has called every relative and bitched about how shitty of a person I am because I abandoned my family and I don’t care about my brother and my brother did thing 1, thing 2 and thing 3 for me and I'm ungrateful.  By the way, he got the car in case that wasn't clear.

So I am the bad guy.  Because I tried to set boundaries and help my heroin addicted brother into recovery with almost no help or support from his actual parents. I’m the piece of shit.  And NDad actually had the nerve to compare me having my a child to my brother being a heroin addict: “You’ve both made mistakes.” Um, FUCK YOU!

And to put an even better context on this: I was the one who frequently took care of my brother after my parents divorce neither had any interest in things like: buying him food, spending a lot of time with him, etc… I literally had to buy him groceries so that he would have something to eat. (He lived with NDad who received child support from E(N)Mom and they both refused to buy him groceries and bitched about it every time he said he was hungry/there was no food.)  But now because I put my foot down in this situation, I’m an evil selfish bitch.  


tl;dr It's my fault that my brother is addicted to heroin because I won't give up my competitive Master's program and internship to nurse/guard him while my parents go about their normal lives."

I managed to get to one internship fair, but I live in Atlanta so Georgia Tech students make me a low tiered candidate. Also, online and at that fair, college students were/are highly preferred, understandably so. I've found one company that I'm going to apply to today, but I'm not super hopeful. I have the option to develop an app or something alone this summer instead of an internship and I'm thinking about just doing that. It would be a good experience, as I've yet to do anything like that. Should I search harder for internships or develop on my own? Personally, I think I would enjoy the internship more, as it would give me real insight into the career, but working on my own seems to be the realistic option.

I am a 23 y/o with a Bachelors in Information Systems and a Business Admin minor. I have ~ 5 years of work experience as a Quality Assurance professional. I was offered high paying QA internships while enrolled in university and as a broke college student naturally I embraced the opportunities. While this was not my dream career path I am pretty happy making 60k in my early 20s.

Lately I have been feeling like QA is a very pigeonholed career path sort of speak. This makes me nervous because I do not LOVE QA. I have hopes in transitioning to a more business oriented IT position. Searching through positions on CareerBuilder, Monster, etc. I could see myself enjoying positions such as Business Systems Analyst, Project Analyst, Business Analyst, or Project Manager. Can anyone please provide advice in how to tailor my resume to better align me with the positions I stated above. Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you!

35ikwi,7,2015-05-10,How Much to Charge per Article for Contract Writing Project,codys109,freelanceWriters,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/35ikwi/how_much_to_charge_per_article_for_contract/,"I'm trying to get a sense of how much I should charge for writing blog articles on a contract basis. This would be my first time doing this on a contract basis so I could use some help.

The company is a online e-commerce site that sells pipe and fittings. Customers use these to build railing and DIY industrial pipe furniture. I currently work for the company as an intern and we've worked out that I would write for them on a contract basis when my internship ends. This would include two blog posts per week. Most blog posts are roughly 600 words. The type of articles include how to, list type, customer project overview, product benefits, and case studies.

Here's all that I'm thinking may be involved in writing and submitting the article:

- Writing the article
- Coding/Formatting the article in HTML
- Uploading the article to the CMS (Content Management System)
- Image collection. This might include searching through the customer project images we have on file or search Google/Pinterest for images that match the article I'm writing
- Image editing
- Creating graphics for the main image and social media 
- Research (if necessary). This might include searching the internet for relevant information to talking to customers about their project.

The project may also include:

- Developing posts for social media involving the article
- Developing and creating the email to sent out to the email list
- Call to Action development

I know some of this may not be writing related but I'm trying to get a fair offer to bring to my manager. So anything you can offer will be helpful. Maybe a suggestion of what you think I should charge for just the article and/or the article plus the other services. Or maybe an idea of what you would charge for this type of project. I appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks in advance!

As I have been quite busy with my internship lately I try to write blog posts in advance on week-ends and schedule them...but this totally made me forgot to link them here so now you'll get all the reviews in one post! =D  
  
First off, there's the review of the [Nature Republic Glow Lipstick](http://sleepyypanda.blogspot.com/2015/04/review-nature-republic-glow-lipstick.html). I hardly ever hear anyone talk about this product. Sadly. The packaging looks very similar to the Innisfree lipsticks. It's a creamy lipstick which also can lead to it enhancing the dry patches on the lips but I like the lipstick a lot!  
  
Then there was the [Tonymoly Magic Food Banana Sleeping Pack](http://sleepyypanda.blogspot.com/2015/04/review-tonymoly-magic-food-banana.html). Oh my! The smell! Awesome! And squeezing that plastic banana is way too much fun! However, I couldn't see any outstanding results so it's more of a gimmick to me, albeit a very fun gimmick.  
  
Going on to the [Holika Holika Pro:Beauty Bloody Oil Tint](http://sleepyypanda.blogspot.com/2015/04/review-holika-holika-probeauty-bloody.html). When I saw the design an in particular the shade ""bloody vampire"" I just had to buy it. Vampires are my favourite mystical creature. Although I have some problems to get an even application (that might just be me) I really love this tint and it totally deserves the name. Such a bloody and vampire-ish color!  
  
And last but not least, the [Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum](http://sleepyypanda.blogspot.com/2015/05/review-innisfree-green-tea-seed-serum.html). I bought this, because it's said to be one of the most popular Korean skincare products. Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed. Not only is alcohol pretty high on the ingredient list (boo!) I also couldn't see any great effects on my skin. It is lightweight and good to layer though. I will definitely look for another green tea serum after using this one up.  
  
That's it....thanks for reading =D

My grades are decent (3.5 which I can probably bring up to a 3.7 by the time I graduate--slacked off hard the first 3 sem), I have a bunch of ECs ( student government, wrote for the school paper, exec on clubs) as well as work experience that while unique, aren't that amazing. I'm working in the gvt in accounting in a role that usually requires a degree (I got lucky and obviously want to into consulting/ finance).

I applied everywhere this summer for finance/ consulting internships and came out of it with a pile of rejections and not a single interview. My school isn't all that prestigious and the connections are really limited so there's nothing that can be done on that front. Obviously I know that it's an uphill battle but I was wondering if you guys had any advice as to what to do/ what skills I should learn to set myself up for graduation

I also really want a internship during the summer of my 3rd year and obviously don't want to have this summer repeat itself again. As for what I want to do once I graduate, I'd like to go into either consulting, IB or trading, but am not really sure. Ideally in the summer, I get something in those three areas, but again, I'm just desperate to get my foot in the door.
Thoughts and advice?"
35imoq,1,2015-05-10,Got something off my chest. Hope it will pass soon.,_throw_catch_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/35imoq/got_something_off_my_chest_hope_it_will_pass_soon/,"2 years ago (January 2013), I was one of the top student in my class and just finished an internship and I was ready to work on my thesis. I also was just getting to start a serious relationship with a girl that I've been known for 3 years. Everything looked so great, I already dreamed about my life 5 years ahead of college.  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
But then, all the hype caught me. My mind snaped. I got my psychotic break.
Weeks before that happened my mind was like crazy productive and make me want to think, learn or work on something.  
So after the christmas break, I went back to college. All that hype in my mind boosted my confidence that led me to alcohol. I was more hyped than before that made my close friend thinking I was high or something but I wasn't realize at the time so I was just getting crazier and crazier.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
The night it happened (2 days after I went back to college), I was drinking alcohol with my friends, then I felt really tired so I slept about 30 minutes. Then when I woke up, I saw something strange about the video on my friend's computer like it was talking to me, I felt like it was telling me something, then I was taking notes on the computer, then my friend just tell me to go to sleep (they think it was just the alcohol effect). After 15 minutes, I raged up in my sleep, started to kick at punching stuff in my friend and 5 minutes later I was already in my room feeling scared as hell, broke my lamp and pissing all over the floor. That was the beginning of my psychotic break. That night was the most dark experience in my life. I couldn't sleep, I was scared, my mind was full of ridiculous theories, I keep talking and writing some ridiculous formula or something.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
I was diagnosed with depression, and myself at that time was totally denying that like saying ""I'm not depressed, I never felt better than this"". Then they gave me medicine that made me so sleepy, like sedation I think, because when I wake up I felt so tired and really didn't know how long that I slept. After that my dad took me home to my hometown, which is 1000 miles from my college. I kept hallucinating, having these episodes. Sometimes I saw something strange on other peoples' faces, heard weird things, tried to burn my room, said shitty things about my family, hit my mom. But my family kept taking care of me.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
3 Months later, I was free of those things in my mind. But the effect of the drugs and constant sleeping really caught me. I felt like I wasn't myself again, I cannot think as I fast as before, cannot code program like before and felt really lazy. And also I lost contact with my friends and my SO because my phone and internet was prohibited to me.  
After that obviously my relationship didn't work out, like it never happened, my friends were really happy to see me, but I felt like they still afraid of me, like I will never be the same again with them (it took me almost 2 years to shake that off). I also developed anxiety, I was so afraid to go to campus, to meet up with my professor about my thesis that made me caged up in my room, numbing my pain with internet, tv shows and movies.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Now 2 years later, almost all my friends all graduated, still haven't finished my thesis. Still feel lazy as fuck. I keep feeling guilty to my family because I haven't graduated.  
I'm not eating healthy (in fact, I'm barely eating) I keep thinking I wasn't great anymore, feel like I keep getting dumber as I got older every single day.  
I keep thinking what if it didn't happen, maybe I already have a promising career right now and not just sit here by myself feeling lonely as shit.  
But I know I got to shake that, I got to move on. But it's really hard. All my motivation just keeps getting shut down.  But hey, maybe tomorrow will be different at the very least I got it off my chest.

&amp;nbsp;
  
Thank you."

35iue9,5,2015-05-10,Graduating in December with no accounting work experience. How screwed am I?,HugeSissy,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/35iue9/graduating_in_december_with_no_accounting_work/,"So if all goes as planned and I pass all my classes, Allah willing praise be his name, I will graduate after fall semester. Problem is I really don't have any accounting exp at all. I have done two ""internships"", one at a small marketing company, and the other at a very small non profit organization, didn't really do much of anything there honestly. My only relevant exp besides class is that I've done VITA the past few years. I'm also in BAP. My GPA is 3.32. I'm also involved with a few clubs that I have on my resume, showing what Ive done. 

I went to all the career expos, a few meet the firms events we have had. I have had a number of interviews for different internships but have never gotten them. Some last year said they appreciated me coming out, but they had seniors and MACC students also applying so basically I had no shot. At the beginning of this past spring semester I had 3 interviews for 3 different internships and didnt get any of them, all of them went to more qualified candidates. Then last week I got back home for summer and I reached out to 10+ local small town public accounting firms in my area, none of them replied. Now I just work at a restaurant and am taking a few summer classes. So it's not like i'm not trying. I'm really hoping since I am one of few students graduating in the winter, I will have a decent shot at securing a tax season internship at a good firm, but since I have no accounting exp I dont know whether they will even want me. The school I go to is small and we have little to no big 4 presence at our career events. There are a few regional ones that always come out but they usually only have one or two spots open for seasonal interns so it is tough when atleast half of the accounting majors my year and masters too are all shooting for the same stuff. 

So yea how screwed am I in terms of getting a half decent internship or job offer after I graduate? "

I applied online on my schools career portal, greeted up to around 15 recruiters at my career fair, ask a friend to put a good word at his old place, and emailed recruiters who's emails were forwarded from the career center. I even asked and used a few professors as references (it's easy for me to have professors like me).

I had a few phone interviews but ultimately they went south because of my disability which makes it hard to understand verbal communication. 

As an IE I have no idea what I could do over the summer. My GPA is a 3.1 which hasn't been an issue. I also ran for a few officer positions at clubs I am a part of but lost to ""better"" candidates. I haven't heard from the last 2 positions I ran for yet. Luckily the president of one club actually really likes me and wanted to appoint me for one of the extra officer position, but even that must be voted on by the officers so it isn't guaranteed.

Still I need to know what I can do to stand out from the other IE if I cannot find a summer internship or a student leadership position. Am I screwed?"

35j024,5,2015-05-10,"I [24 M] cut communication with my mother [56 M/F] four years ago. Pretty sure she is BPD, but sometimes feel guilty and I'm not sure what to do or how to feel sometimes.",justonce9010,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35j024/i_24_m_cut_communication_with_my_mother_56_mf/,"So it is Mother's day and I inevitably got to thinking about my situation, which in short, is that I do not talk to my mom and haven't for almost four full years. As a lot negative memories resurfaced today (I realize I really have done a good job of erasing my childhood and teen years from my memory), I realize how messed up this situation is. For maybe 3 years now, I have operated with the assumption that she has Borderline Personality Disorder. I am hoping someone can give me some closure and confirm that my suspicion is probably correct that she does have BPD. Additionally, I do not plan on reconnecting with her after thinking about how ludicrous this situation is, and how after four years she has made no attempt at all to rectify this situation. I would like to know if anyone has experienced something similar with a parent, and whether I am justified in wanting to remain as far away as possible. A little more backstory, and I am sorry if this turns into a biography. I really dislike the idea of spilling everything out on the internet like this, but I hope that it maybe helps others experiencing a similar situation, as I feel that my view on relationships with parents is unique after what I have been through.


As far back as I can remember, I was very, very depressed. My parents divorced when I was 4 but I saw my dad's side of the family a lot growing up. My mom isn't from this region of the country and all her family is back where she is from, so my dad's side is really all I have ever known. This is significant because I am extremely, extremely fortunate to have seen how they live, and adopted much of their qualities and values. Because of this, since I can remember, I couldn't wait to live on my own, and dreamt of being in a more stable environment. I constantly think about how lucky I am that I graduated from college with good grades and have a really good job and an amazing girlfriend, without falling into depression like happens to so many people. 

Anyway, my mom always had a very, very volatile mood. I remember being very young and seeing her depressed, lifeless, crying, on many occasions. I felt so horrible and wanted to try to help her but there wasn't anything I could do. I remember when we first moved to a small apartment building she had a boyfriend relatively quickly, and I remember her finding someone being the number 1 priority. Short end of this aspect is that she had about 5-7 boyfriends from when I was 4 to when I graduated high school. I recall feeling very neglected, and part of my guilt is that I wonder how much of this is my own fault vs. how much was her actually focusing too much on herself. What makes it so much more frustrating is that the relationships ended up with them fighting and her falling into depression and my sister and I just confused. Again, I am so thankful I had my dad's family to fall back on every few weeks where we were around some normalcy (grandparents married for 50 years and a lot of stable-seeming friends that they had). I remember being depressed every time I went back to my mom's because I never knew if she'd be mad at my dad, depressed, or jubilant and happy. 


This is another key point -- I recall a lot of times where she was very nice to be around, and I was partial to her (over my dad) for a lot of the time when I was younger. I liked the freedom I had when I was at her house, able to play video games and eat what I wanted, but looking back on it she was just careless. I used to think she just loved me and my sister so much, but I was overweight and I really think she just did what she could to make us love her more. Hence, I feel like she was very manipulative in a lot of ways. 



So a few more details regarding why I think she has BPD. Weekends would either consist of very happy mom (sometimes even when she was single, which was quite a lot) or she was miserable, absolutely horrifying to look at mom which left me with a pit on my stomach. I used to feel so guilty, whether she was angry at my Dad for some reason like we were an hour late returning home, or she was not getting along with her boyfriend, or she spent too much money and was crazy stressed about money. All of this led to so many ups and downs I couldn't wait to get out. The worst memories are her slamming doors and threatening to just kill herself. This was all while I was like 10 years old! I am especially hurt to this day that my sister had to endure all of this. These are horrifying ways to act around kids who are developing, and I am absolutely sickened at the thought of what my sister and I could have turned into if we didn't have a better support system in our dad's family, and our friends and their families. 

Beyond my childhood years, my middle school years turned completely sour, and school took a huge fall on my priority list, which I look back on in disgust. When I was 12 she embarked on an attempt to move me and my sister away (other side of the country) to move in with her ex-boyfriend, who she had broken up with multiple times. They were together when I was about 8 i think, and he moved in when I was 9 or 10. They broke up multiple times, and he moved in twice, breaking up ""for good"" when I was 11. However, after about a year or so they decided over the phone, and a 3-day trip to his house (alone) she wanted to marry him and move with him. This involved moving me away from my dad's side, which they were not having. For the better part of two years my mom constantly told my sister and I that my dad's side wanted to control her. She convinced my sister and me that they were selfish and horrible, power-hungry people, and I hated them for what they did to my mom. This was the worst thing I've ever been through. I felt guilty every time I was away from mom my and with my dad or his family because she hated it, and I thought it was her just loving my sister and me but she was just ill. I would try to convince my dad why we should be able to move and we were just completely brainwashed by her, convinced that she was trying to better her life and that my other family was just trying to ruin her life. A lot of yelling, depression, and crying took place until she kind of gave up this effort (after a multi-year legal battle) to move when I was 14, and she ended up divorcing the guy anyway.

There were a few blowups in high school which just compounded my eagerness to get out of her house. When college came, I bloomed from a mediocre student into a top student at my university, studied abroad for a year, and now have a job at a dream company of mine. This all happened without my mom in my life. When I was 20, I returned home for a summer before I went abroad, and was extremely depressed and anxious about finding a summer internship. We had moved many times when I was younger (another annoying trait my mom had, which was moving to another mediocre duplex or apartment every 2-3 years, in the same town. It was obnoxious), so I was adapting to this new house, searching endlessly for an opportunity. While I was doing this, I was taking a summer math course to prepare for my time abroad, as I was worried my math skills didn't stack up for the program I was entering. I shared a car with my sister (which my Dad bought us) so I would use that to drive about an hour away to this class once a week. 


On my way home one night, I noticed condoms in the middle console, and knew it didn't belong to me. I was in a period where I was trying to shore things up with my sister, who hated me and pretty much still does (mostly to do with my Mom asking me for parenting advice regarding my sister and resulting in either my Mom reprimanding her or just my sister resenting the fact we ganged up on her, which I still feel horrible about). I texted her in jest, referencing the condoms, and she (understandably) freaked out. 


What I didn't realize she would do is run right to my mom, who called me screaming at the top of her lungs and just berating me, telling me I'm not perfect and they have heard me having sex with my girlfriend. These things horrified me, and I thought they were completely uncalled for, and I was pretty sure this constituted the last straw. I couldn't handle that instability in my life, and anyway, I needed time away from that situation until it cooled down, so I went to my girlfriends house.


The madness escalated, with my mother telling me she was disconnecting my phone (the second or third time she did this since I started college), and I was in an internship where I used my cell phone every day to make sales calls. I was mortified. I had a job that was great for me and I was hoping to make the best out of it and I told her that, and she proceeded to do whatever she could to let me know I was wrong, tell me how ungrateful I am, etc. She did end up disconnecting my phone and that was the last straw. I felt she was tampering with my wellbeing, putting my job in jeopardy, and I could just tell (particularly given that very similar events took place right before I went to school where I could just see in her eyes that something was not right when she would get so angry), I wasn't going to be able to deal with this forever.

We spoke before I went abroad and it ended with her refusing to apologize but telling me she loved me, and this and that, but at the end of the day she got so angry and told me I needed to see someone, and I was ungrateful, that she didn't raise me to be that way. I was and still am livid. My view is that I was a product of her upbringing (a value she did instill in me, I will admit), so why couldn't she see that obviously I had all this pent up from the past, I had taken time over previous episodes to let her know how fed up I was with that instability, and she would apologize and say she was sorry that it would never happen again. Time and time again I would find myself anxious, trying to help her get through depression, guide her in how to handle my sister's sports or issues at school, or whatever. I just couldn't handle it after she jeopardized my internship, and she told me to leave anyway, so it made it easy to get my stuff and go.


My year abroad was the best year of my life. The next summer I had an internship at a prominent company and lived with my uncle. Since I stopped talking to my mom, my anxiety plummeted, my depression virtually disappeared, and my life improved immensely. 


Last little anecdote: my senior year of college started with the realization that my financial aid form, which is filled out by the parent (my mom) wasn't submitted in time and I was unable to start school until it was finished. I was irate that after all that happened and that despite my mom being fine with not talking to me, and seeming at most times to be in relatively good spirits (via my Dad), I thought that she at least would have done the one thing she had to do to help improve my life, which she did every March I was in college: fill out the financial aid form. Well she didn't so I tried to be civil, calling her (on my new cell phone paid for by my uncle, which enraged her) and asking her to fill out the form. She started to apologize and rectify things but I didn't want to hear about it and just wanted this to be finished. She got really angry and went from apologetic to irate in about a second, ending with saying she wasn't doing sh*t for me and I was ungrateful blah blah. She flat out wasn't going to fill the form out for me and if I hadn't done a fire drill I don't think I would have been participating that semester. This proved to me that she was out of her mind, selfish, and just blew me away. 


There have been other stories I've heard through my sister or Dad that she has acted up, angry that I have gotten a new cell phone, or laptop, or whatever, or she has had fits at my sister or Dad for various other ridiculous things. She is just out of control, has been since I was a baby, and I have yet to receive an apology. The last time I remember kind of caring to resolve things, I just remember her asking ""what did she do that was so wrong?"" or ""why am I so angry?"" and it is just the most pathetic thing I have ever heard because I literally don't know where to start. I don't know, maybe the relationships you dragged my sister and me through, and my suicide notes I wanted you to find and your passive response to them? I was so depressed for so long, and giving up caring about maintaining a relationship with her was the best thing I have ever done.


So, I hope I didn't bore anyone too much with this long note. Really, I do hope that this helps someone else that has to deal with this, and I hope that you use any situation as motivation to make your life better. What I realized at a young age was that you are the only person you can depend on in your life. She let me down so many times, and caused me and my family (sister and Dad's side) so much grief, I don't think I can ever forgive her.


With all that said, does anyone else have a similar story? Do I feel guilty for not trying to help her (more than I already have) find help and make her life better? I am convinced, after numerous pathetic/failed attempts to improve herself, she is doomed, and there is nothing I can do but get sucked back in. 

   
**tl;dr**: Haven't talked to mom in four years. I think she has BPD and don't plan on ever talking with her again. Is this wrong/what would you do?"

35jhnz,4,2015-05-10,Guys I just don't know what to do,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/35jhnz/guys_i_just_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I finally got a part time job to save up for a car while in college. I searched everywhere including dozens of craigslist applications and even my college all of which came up dry. Finally I got a retail job at a store in the mall and I thought it would be better than my last one, and it was for a while but now the company is doing some stuff that I don't like.

First off they gave us a 5 page packet to read on selling to customers. One of the lines gave an example of a man coming in saying he can't buy something because he has to pay his mortgage before it defaults. The very next line, and I kid you not, said we are supposed to sell to him anyway and persuade him his payment can wait, we sell board games btw (in their defense my district manager crossed this line out but it was still sent by our main boss). A couple other of my favorite stupidities in that packet where we aren't allowed to say sir or ma'am. I was raised to say that whenever possible how can they force me not to? The packet also said that 95% of people hate being called Mr. (Insert name) no matter if it's in retail or business. If I can't say Mr. and I can't say sir what am I supposed to say? Lastly apparently if a customer says they aren't interested in something my line is supposed to be ""ok I will put this up at the front for you."" What? I don't really want to be apart of a company that has such silly ideas. 

Next is just the work itself. I'm a person who will generally believe you have to crawl through the shit to make progress. Work is tough I get that. However this is hardly work. We are in a mall and parents routinely drop off their kids while they shop. We have to constantly call security on unattended children and they make my work life hell because holy shit do they make a mess. Now that would be fine if we had time to clean up but if we don't close within a half of an hour we are supposed to clock out and then continue to clean. Today I was there 45 minutes after close and had to clock out at 30 minutes so I had 15 minutes of unpaid work I was there for. Is that even legal?

I don't know what to do. The job seems pretty cool and the people are alright I just feel it's going in the direction my last job did and It's going to be hell. It's only my 3rd week and I feel I should stick it out but we only get a small amount of time on this planet do I really want to waste it here? I would look for a job in my field (IT) but I haven't even been able to find unpaid internships let alone paid work. 

Any advice? Maybe I'm just too soft or picky and if I am by all means tell me. I just want to make the right decisions "

&amp;nbsp;


Aaron is currently a game engineer for a market research group, and is tasked with creating shopping simulations used for researching trends in purchases. Prior to this, he earned a Bachelors Degree in Have Programming, a Masters in Software Engineering, and served a year internship with NetherRealm, in which he is credited on being involved on Mortal Kombat 9 and Injustice: Gods Among Us.

&amp;nbsp;


As for his interest in the project, Timesplitters is one of many game series he has fond memories of playing. He has been wanting to develop a game as of late, and was impressed by the history of frequent and quality community updates, which showed him 'the team was in it for the long haul,' and wanted to be a part of that.

&amp;nbsp;


If I could speak on behalf of the entire team, we are certainly glad to have him aboard, and want to utilize and share his abilities. We hope to show some of his work in the near future, which will involve the weapons and health systems. Stay tuned."

I interned full-time at a big name company last summer. I started my job search in October and it's now May. The only offer I received was for a summer internship that had no potential of becoming full time; I turned it down.

I've gotten many many interviews, and a lot of times I'll make it to the final round, but I can't seem to get the offer. At this point, I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. 

I get contacted by big name companies quite frequently that I would LOVE to work for. I talk to them, go through phone/ Skype/ in-person interviews, but can't seem to get that final offer. I usually ask the hiring manager or the recruiter why I didn't get the offer (of course I put it in nicer terms), and they typically respond with the same thing: you were a great candidate and we were impressed, but the applicant pool was extremely competitive. How do I make myself more competitive?

On a side not, I'm more on the shy side. I try to be more outgoing during interviews, but I'm just introverted by nature. My experiences have been in Human Resources so I've been applying and interviewing for HR Coordinator/ Recruiting Coordinator type positions."

35jsyv,2,2015-05-10,Problems with Ministry and Mom,mandrews909,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/35jsyv/problems_with_ministry_and_mom/,"So I'm not sure if this is me looking for advice, support, or if I just need to vent to someone other than my girlfriend, but I feel you all will at least listen. Or I can think you are. Anyways.

To tell you about me now: I'm in campus ministry. I'm 24, almost 25, unmarried, no plans on engagement yet, $30 grand in debt from college, and 3 hours away from my immediate family.

To tell you about my past: My mom's a regular attender of church, very involved (I think because she has a power complex about herself). My dad's a non-Christian, but we're pretty tight. I won't say close because we don't talk much. But I don't want to rip his head off like I do my mom. Older brother who was ""perfect"" and older sister who was the screw up of all time, as my mom acted (Knocked up at 15, 1st kid at 16, I was young but knew what was going on but never told anything so assumptions were made and hell hath come). In all that, there are some respect issues between my mom and I. My actions during my high school years were pretty rough on the family as well including me getting my gf pregnant then her getting an abortion, which I fought but gave into because it wasn't really my choice. My parents knew but it was never mentioned after the initial discussion that I would be skipping school to go with. 

Moving on: I went to a Christian university for youth ministry, which my parents both told me not to do. Did it anyway because I know God made me good at nothing except what he wants me to do. I worked at church plants, preaching ministries, and youth ministries, none of which really fit me. But then I got into campus ministry. I love the idea of it. The one I was with this past year was pretty crappy (I was just an intern and had no power). Getting here was interesting because he thing about campus ministry is this: You have to raise your salary. No easy task with church members not willing to part with their precious money. I tell my mom this. Her response, ""I don't think you can do that."" Thanks for the vote of confidence! Didn't speak to her for a month because I knew how disrespectful I would be. She finally resigned herself to accepting that I'm going into ministry. But now that I found what I want to be a part of, she tries to tell me that's not it. I'm getting real tired of her. 

Now: I'm looking at going to another campus for ministry, one that I would lead. I tell my parents about it, my dad blows it off with cool indifference as he does everything else. My mom still tries to get me to take a position in a church because I ""need to make money!"" Today I told her about a situation at the next ministry I'm looking at and a deal that the ministry/organization has with a church right next to campus. I also tell her about other possibilities. ""Sound's like things just aren't coming together like you thought they were."" God doesn't make things easy mom. ""Well he doesn't always make them difficult either."" 

I have been having this back and forth fight with this church leader for YEARS. One who is supposed lead people on how to be a Christian, who is supposed to disciple, and follow God and encourage others to follow God can't even back her own son into the direction that God calls him. Why? Because of money. Every fight we have is about money. Every time she tells me I'm wrong in a decision it's because of money. It's her God and she doesn't realize it. I try to tell her but her head is so far up her own ass she won't listen to anyone else because she thinks she's always right and I'm tired of all the crap that comes from her. 

Anyways, it's mothers day, and she just kept pushing my buttons. I didn't blow up on her. But she knew I was close so she got off the phone real quick. 

I guess all I really want is the emotional and spiritual support of my immediate family. But I'm the black sheep I guess. Always why I'm looking for a new family.

Anyways, if you read this far, thanks for reading my pissed off rant. If we ever meet in person I'll give you a sucker."
35jvqt,4,2015-05-10,"Possible incoming CS transfer, how are the career/internship fairs? + other questions.",headerfile_h,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/35jvqt/possible_incoming_cs_transfer_how_are_the/,"Hey everyone,

First, from what I understand I was accepted to the BSOE for Computer Science, but I can't find anywhere where it states if I was accepted for the B.S. in CS or the B.A. in CS? I applied for the B.S. so I'm hoping that's what I was accepted for, but if anyone can please shed some information on this or where I could check on this it would be appreciated.

Next, I was wondering about career and internship fairs at UCSC, and what that experience was like for maybe past transfer CS students who came in from a CC. I saw that the CS/CE fair is held in October at UCSC, and if I were going to be looking for an internship for my junior to senior summer, I'm guessing that's the fair I would need to attend. I'm really worried though that I won't be prepared enough to take interviews that early. By October I'll have been a UCSC student for only a month or so and have taken mostly all CC courses before-hand, and to be quite honest, I don't think my CC did that great of a job in teaching us in the harder classes like Data Structures &amp; Algos. 

Any advice? If you were a transfer CS student at UCSC and went to any of these career fairs, how did it go? 

And one last question, my CC taught us strictly in C++. If I sign the UCSC SIR, I'll be teaching myself Java over the summer as counselors have been telling me that UCSC students are expected to know Java for upper division coursework. I was wondering if there was anything else that I would need to know or tips on things that I could do over the summer to make the transition into UCSC upper div courses easier?

Thanks everyone!"

It's my first time posting here, but I'm applying to be my Key Club officer. For the people who do not know what Key Club is, ""Key Club International is the oldest and largest service program for high school students. It is a student-led organization whose goal is to teach leadership through serving others."" 

I have an interview this Thursday, and I'm applying for the positions in the order:

1. Secretary
2. Treasurer
3. Activities Coordinator

This is my first time being in an interview, and I was wondering what kind of questions would be asked/how can I respond to them? A few problems in the club, are member participation and turnout to meetings.

A few things about me are I have participated in numerous events, participated in DECA and actually placed 2nd at ICDC, served an internship at Charles Schwab

Also, it would be great if you guys could help me out with how I should approach the interview (It's with the Club's Co-Presidents rn), and how to greet them/how to close the interview.

35jwte,2,2015-05-10,I feel backed into a metaphorical corner.,WestC0astM3tal,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/35jwte/i_feel_backed_into_a_metaphorical_corner/,"I'm 19, male, studying CS in my first year, and I'm not sure what I want to do with my life. My CS classes are very hard and extremely time consuming, and I've never had a formal job before in my life (never needed one).

I thought I wanted to do CS because I am very creative and enjoy creating things. I've written songs, stories, and plays, but this was one of my first years seriously writing code (largely in C++ if you're curious). I actually enjoyed it at first. My first two introductory classes were enjoyable for the most part, and I learned a lot. Then came the third introductory class and things took off to a whole new level and I began to struggle hard.

One of the few relevant things going for me is the possibility of an internship this summer for a data company, but if I do take the job, I won't enjoy it. I'll sit by myself at a keyboard for hours on end, while I try to keep up with content I haven't seen or worked with before in a language I don't really understand. The boss told me himself that they expect their interns and employees to pick up things very quickly and adapt to whatever the circumstances may be at a moment's notice. If the level of adaptability needed is anything like what my third class is like, I'll have more gray hairs than Jay Leno by 30.

My mom is very insistent that I finish at least two years of CS and to pursue this opportunity because she thinks I'm lazy and spoiled and have nothing else to do with my life at this point.

**TL;DR My classes have increased exponentially in difficulty, my mom thinks I'm lazy, and I have an opportunity to intern doing work I won't enjoy.**"
35k0xg,3,2015-05-10,WELL HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/35k0xg/well_happy_mothers_day/,"So, today I talked to my Nmom on the phone (because that is generally what people do on mother's day) and of course, it went poorly. 

I let it slip (I thought Edad had told her, but apparently not) that I was going to live with my BF for the summer. She immediately started to guilt trip me. Now I know why Edad didn't tell her. Here's some of what she said:

""But you'll get to spend the rest of your life with someone else, and I won't get to have you anymore!"" You had me for 18 years, most of which you spent in bed. If you feel bad, it's your own fault.

""But you're just going to mooch off of BF's family."" Uh, no, I'm going to do my best to get a job, and if not start up my online store. Also, his family knows Nmom is crazy and they want me to stay with them, and basically made BF promise to get me over if I didn't get an internship.

""But you won't see the kitties/grandma and grandpa/xyz"" I don't usually see them anyways. I go to school 1000 miles away. What's your point?

""If you stayed home, you could watch your sister and then I'd get a job!"" I flat out told her that it wasn't my responsibility. Mom has been avoiding getting a job for YEARS and me being home didn't change anything. Also my sister is nearly 13 and is definitely capable of staying home alone.

""But if you were home, you could hang out with her and go places."" Sister and I don't even get along, and never really have. There's an 8 year age gap. Also, it isn't like she can do much now because NMOM WON'T DO ANYTHING. So she's basically trying to shoulder her parental responsibilities on me here. I don't even own a car.

[Obligatory guilt trip about not being close with Sister] Sister has the means to communicate with me, and has no desire to. I don't really blame her, and I'm not about to force a sisterly bond where there is none. If she wants a relationship, I'll let her have it on her terms.

*Edit: She also started talking about remodeling my room and letting Sister have it. I knew it was just a ploy to get me to do what she wants, so I said I wouldn't be spending much time in there anyways, with me graduating soon and all, and that we might as well move my stuff into storage. I don't think she knew how to take that.

I called Edad right after to warn him that he might be in trouble for not telling Nmom about my plans. His response? ""I'm always in trouble."""

My boyfriend and I were going to move in together July 1st, he's still moving in to our apartment (with all of my books and our combined cats), but I'm trying to decide how I should transition.
Option 1- Commute 100 miles each direction every day. I have a hybrid, so gas would be about $75 a week. I could sleep in my own bed. My boyfriend can afford the apartment on his own, my only expenses are my car insurance, gas, phone, and student loans.
Option 2- Rent a room near work for the summer, go home on weekends. The cheapest I can find is around $500 a month, and I would probably still have to commute a couple weeks because the only things available short term are summer sublets that end when students come back.
Saving money is definitely a pro in the commuting column, but will I go crazy with that commute? Is it worth it?"

What can I do to start to mend this?,hugefuckup96,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35k4sv/i_20m_hit_my_girlfriend_19f_of_8_months_today/,"I know that nothing excuses what happened today.  This might come off as me trying to make excuses, but it's not.  I'm just trying to explain the background and everything that happened.  Ages and whatnot changed for anonymity.

I've been dating the love of my life for ~8 months now.  We've been close/complicated for about a year before that for various reasons, but made it official last fall.  She's kind and sweet and just all around wonderful.  She's the most perfect person I could ever hope for.

A bit of background on my family: I was basically raised by my grandparents for the early years of my life.  My dad worked eight hours away and was only home for weekends and holidays, and my mom was juggling work and my baby brother.  My grandparents lived next door and were more than happy to take care of me, so I ended up practically living with them, even sleeping over there at least once or twice a week.  This changed when we moved close to my dad's work, but I called them every night that I was home, and would see them at least once a month.  They're like a second set of parents to me.  My grandpa passed away suddenly two summers ago and it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through.  My girlfriend (just a friend at the time) was incredibly supportive through everything and felt like the only one who understood what I was going through, as she had lost her mother a few years previously.

Moving onto this week....  It was a really shitty week.  First off was finals, which were stressful as hell as is, except I was moving out at the same time.  I had a mountain of shit to finish up this weekend before starting work tomorrow.  I also found out that a whole bunch of legal shit from something stupid I did a few years ago is coming up again and probably will haunt me for the rest of my life.  I found out that it's the sole reason I didn't get a massive scholarship from the university, why I got zero calls back for summer internships, and probably will end up ruining a lot of my job prospects coming out of college.  And the cherry on top, after my last final, my mom decided to reveal that my parents have been lying to me about why my grandma has been in the hospital for the last couple weeks.  They told me it was just pneumonia and not to worry.  Turns out her cancer has come back worse than ever, bad enough that they're starting  some untested new drugs just because nothing else is working.  The other part that they still haven't actually told me is that my dad is trying to get a hold of his brother because they don't think she's going to live much longer.  So I'm probably going to lose the woman who raised me this summer.  All in all, I've been a pretty shitty person to be around this week.  But my girlfriend has put up with it.  She's been over all day every day helping me get everything done and has basically been an angel.

We were moving me back home this weekend, and today was finishing unpacking and trying to get everything back into my room.  We were going through all my shit and trying to sort and get rid of some stuff because as she put it, I have too much junk.  I've been crabby as hell all weekend but she's been kind and patient through it all.  We were going through one of the boxes and she pulled out a beat up old pocketwatch that doesn't even work, told me I don't need shit like this, and tossed it in the garbage.  Which I wouldn't care about, except that pocketwatch was my grandpa's, and is one of the only things of his that I have left.  I don't know what happened, but I snapped and shoved her, grabbed it out of the garbage, and stormed off.  She grabbed her keys and walked out the door, and that's when what I'd done finally sank in.

At that point, I basically locked myself in the bathroom for a couple hours crying and cutting until I had to come out and get ready to go out for dinner with my family.  My girlfriend came back a little before we left and came to dinner and everything, acting like nothing happened.  I brought it up a little later, profusely apologizing, but she brushed it off and said to drop it, but if it happened again it would be a problem.  Obviously this isn't something that's just whatever.  I crossed a huge line today, and I don't have a damn clue how I can even begin to try to make things better.  So I guess that's my question.  How on earth do I try to fix something like this?

tl;dr: I'm an asshole.  How can I try and mend things with my girlfriend?"

Hello everyone! I'm currently a Junior in High School and as the end of this school year gets closer, the stress of getting into college is starting. I'm 100% sure that I will be applying for Film/Video major wherever I go. 1st on my list of schools,  is Berkeley. I know the film program there isn't that great, but I love the environment and I love Film theory (what their school focuses on). As I see my surrounding friends with a 4.0-4.5 GPA, I'm getting really nervous as to whether or not I'll be accepted at Berkeley. As anxious as I am, I decided to ask you all what my chances of getting into Berkeley are (or any UC) and what I can do to improve my chances. 

Before I provide information, I would like to note that I have chronic depression and generalized anxiety that I have to take medication for everyday . You'll understand why I bring this up as you look at the information I'll be providing. 

I'm a  6'2"" Mexican/ Spanish male living in California. I attend a public school in the bay area. My classes/grades from my past years are the following:

As you can see my grades took a sudden drop sophomore year. That's when my depression and anxiety that was passed onto me from my mom, really kicked in and became apparent. Again, I'm applying to the film program at Berkeley. I wouldn't have a chance at all of getting into Berkeley if I was applying for business. People Say that art majors have a higher chance of getting in, so that's why I’m actually trying to get into Berkeley. But then again that can be a lie and I don't really have a chance at all. 

So Reddit community. Thank you for reading this. If you can, please leave information below regarding my chances of getting in and what I can do to improve them. Thank you again.

We have known each other for 8 years.
We are best friends.
We tried dating, 3 years ago, but apparently she was pretending to like me, because she wanted it to work out, but she couldn't do it and it ended in a week. Broke my heart. The next year we made up as friends but were still distant. Her high school crush went after her and she accepted and they kissed/went out. I dated another girl and she knew. I moved to a different state for a job. The first time I came back, we were great as friends, she had broken up with him, I was single and we hung out like old times! At the end of my three month vacation she confessed to me she had messed up and that she was sure this time she had feelings for me, and that she had matured a lot in the past three years. I said no, mainly because she broke my heart and I was leaving again. I left for another half a year and came back for three weeks during Christmas. We had kept contact and we hung out a lot. We went on a trip with out other friends who are a couple and in that trip we kissed and decided to do the relationship. 

I said yes because I only had half a year left. We talked during long distance, and I went to her for Valentine's day and it was amazing! Fast forward to today, she's met a new friend while she was in a different state as well(for an internship) and she is the devil. She has gotten in the way of our plans and a bunch of stuff. Anyways, I visited her on my way home from where I was coming and originally I was gonna stay the night with her, but then I learned that this new ""friend"" moved in with her two days prior to when I was coming so she canceled the me staying part.

She kissed me when I arrived and left, but when I asked her to make out she said she didn't want to even though we have in the pass and she's enjoyed it.

Now she comes back on Friday and she wants me to meet her family, celebrate my birthday even though I don't want to, and go on dates and she has stuff planned till late September.
I have been filed with insecurities because of many reasons, and I was wondering if it would be wise to tell her that I didn't like her friend. Wondering what happened in the two years(because we never talked about it. She just said she matured, and she wants to be with me. Also her friend told me her ex made her pure horny, but with me she gets that ""butterflies in the stomach"" effect.) What kinda relationship this is?(Serious or casual since we known each other for so long.) 

I'm just very confusing and need help, because I do like her, but I'm terrified of falling for her again, just to get my heart broken again, even though this time around I know her direct family already and everyone keeps telling she is crazy for me now.

We tried dating, 3 years ago, but apparently she was pretending to like me, because she wanted it to work out, but she couldn't do it and it ended in a week. Broke my heart. The next year we made up as friends but were still distant. Her high school crush went after her and she accepted and they kissed/went out. I dated another girl and she knew. I moved to a different state for a job. The first time I came back, we were great as friends, she had broken up with him, I was single and we hung out like old times! At the end of my three month vacation she confessed to me she had messed up and that she was sure this time she had feelings for me, and that she had matured a lot in the past three years. I said no, mainly because she broke my heart and I was leaving again. I left for another half a year and came back for three weeks during Christmas. We had kept contact and we hung out a lot. We went on a trip with out other friends who are a couple and in that trip we kissed and decided to do the relationship. 

I said yes because I only had half a year left. We talked during long distance, and I went to her for Valentine's day and it was amazing!

I've got my housing set, started packing. However, I'm from a relatively small place in Texas so this is going to be an interesting transition. I've visited the city several times before, so I'm not totally unfamiliar with the Strip at least.
Does anybody have tips of any sort? Could be about day-to-day life, places to visit/avoid, things I should take, buy, prepare for?"
35kr23,1,2015-05-11,Student trending towards being well-situated financially - how can I make this process smooth?,Qianpou,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35kr23/student_trending_towards_being_wellsituated/,"So, I had the whole grew up poor, but managed to go to college story.

Currently I'm at around $9000 for Perkins/Subsidized loans after two years of college. I've maybe around $1800 in my bank account right now and about $500 in savings. Realistically, I don't think I have to take out any more loans at this point. I'll be living off-campus next year, and that'll be pretty huge towards decreasing my total expenses (at least, I hope so)

Future career path is trending towards some sort of software engineering. I work at an internship for around $21.50 an hour part-time right now, will be working full-time in the summer, and I'm hoping to be rehired come Fall. 

Now my future expenses:

For some reason, after coming to college, I just starting being a shopping addict (normal for people coming from poor backgrounds,  I think)? And I still sorta am - I'm planning on spending a good amount of my wages during the summer on clothes (~$800 budget or so in mind), furniture/appliances (will be buying a good amount of these with a roommate, not sure how much I plan on budgeting), and inevitably some other shit always pops up.

Will start to lease an apartment with a few others, this'll probably end up being like $580 a month, and I eat for maybe $350 a month.

On another note, I kinda want to start thinking about getting a car at this point. It takes roughly 1 hour to get to work, which means 2+ hours of my time is being spent on transportation every work day.

Advice for someone in my situation? Hoping I'm in a good place. I feel fairly confident that I'll be secure in finding an actual job in the future.

Not sure what my options are at this point, any sort of investing I should be doing, what budgeting/future savings/etc. options are available to me right now, whether I should consider spending a large chunk of my summer income towards funding a car, whether I should consider taking out more subsidized loans towards funding a car, whether I should seriously reconsider my spending habits, etc."

Just a few months ago I was finishing up my first internship and got an offer for a 4 month placement in Vancouver or Toronto. They had a location in Seattle so I asked for it and got it. I was excited at the time.. Experience living alone, new friends, close enough to go home every now and then... And now that the day is tomorrow.. I don't want to leave anymore. After visiting Seattle for a couple days, I feel like I'm going to seriously miss Vancouver. I feel a mixture of being scared and depressed at the same time. I don't want to leave and have to grind through 4 months of work without being in an environment I've grown so comfortable with. I don't want to miss all the events that would be going on through the summer when not many people have school. I think the most I'd miss are my parents, SO, and close friends. I will also miss everything Vancouver has to offer, as from my limited time in Seattle, there are almost no equivalent areas at all. Seattle seems so much more.. bland and spread out unlike Vancouver where everything is near each other... I barely saw anyone on the streets in Seattle after 9pm on a Saturday.. I don't know what the crowd in Seattle would be like, and I don't know if I can find that type of comfort there. I think it's something reoccurring for me.. I feel like I get really attached to things, emotional, and sentimental... Yes it's only a city 3 hours away, but I get to the point of tearing up whenever I'm thinking of the situation now that it's literally tomorrow. I just need to get this out. I'm hoping that the group of people I meet will be able to make me feel comfortable.. and to open me to what Seattle has to offer.. Thanks for reading..."

35l9hg,6,2015-05-11,Replica vs. Genuine -- Audemars Piguet Survivor (Noob Factory Replica),letmecheckmywatch,RepTime,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepTime/comments/35l9hg/replica_vs_genuine_audemars_piguet_survivor_noob/,"Another Genuine vs Replica guide of an AP Survivor. This was taken from repgeeks, and credit goes to the user [TheBattler](http://www.repgeek.com/member.php?u=10393) and can be found [here](http://www.repgeek.com/showthread.php?t=189182). 

I shortened it to get straight to the point. This won't be as long or as detailed as the rolex review. 

&amp;nbsp;
------------------------------------
&amp;nbsp;


Detractors say it is a ridiculously large, ugly, overpriced and overproduced limited edition. Commentary that is eerily reminiscent of what was said in regards to the ref. 5402 Royal Oak that was released nearly half a century ago. An offering of 1000 pieces doesn’t exactly qualify it by purists’ standards as “limited”. Although it can be, when you take into account that AP mass produced 25,000 other watches the same year the Survivor was made.

Rare enough in fact that it has steadily increased in value over the past 5 years, NOS pieces currently trading for up to 50% over the $35,000 msrp. 

None of these challenges stopped the infamous Noob Factory, from creating one of the greatest replications we have ever seen. 

Without much further ado, I present to you the “most expensive” Gen V Rep comparison ever posted on the forum.


&amp;nbsp;

[Front shot](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/1.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;

This was not intended as the strap comparison shot, but it does a good job I think of showing the slight variation between them. Firstly, discredit the color difference, the photo shows more contrast than is available in real life. Both of the straps are black, the rep strap is not as black as the gen, but it’s only about a shade off. 

The square engravings running down the strap are a slightly more miniscule tell. The squares on the rep are more raised and in a tighter bank, there is no space between squares and the deep indentations made on the strap. As for the gen, the squares are less raised and in a wider recessed bank.

The construction of the rep strap is 1:1 with the gen. It is just as stiff, although it somehow exudes a feeling of quality. 

The Verdict on the strap is that I wouldn’t spend $250 on a gen one. The strap flaws aren’t even side by side flaws, they’re side by side macro flaws, it goes without saying that no one is getting called out over the 3D Squares on the rep strap. But I’ve made it known that reps are for yourself not others, for myself however the rep strap is good enough. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Front shot](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/2.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;


As we get closer to the watch, the tuxedo bezel starts to take away your attention from the massive twin chrono pusher guards. It is hard to describe how close they really are, although you can plainly see that the vertical accents on the rep are more defined. 

This was very difficult to photograph, the bezel is brushed ceramic and refracts light in a deceptive way. It is a beautiful bezel and I prefer the rep’s. The biggest difference between the bezels can be seen @3 and @9. Just to impress upon you how close these are in the hand, if I was offered a gen bezel for $250 I would pass on it (unless I was given the option of reselling of course : ) ). 

Furthermore, The biggest tell on the Survivor (and impossible to fix) is common knowledge, the far DW placement. It is unique on the Survivor because it is further accentuated by the white ring of second markings under the tachymetre. As you can see there are no markings on the right side of the rep’s cyclops which is incorrect. A definite tell. 

Texture on the gen mega tapestry dial is ever so slightly more raised and half a shade less black. I have no idea how AR’ing the rep crystal would match the color, but the texture would definitely put it on par with the gen. 

(Footnote: I offered both pieces to 2 people in our group, with the task of spotting the differences between these 2 watches, 1 gen and 1 rep. After a semi thorough inspection, the shade of the straps were all that they could find different.) 


&amp;nbsp;


[Another Picture](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/3.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;

This shot clearly shows the tell plaguing all Sec @ 12 ROOs. The case and case back are too thick. It is about a 1.6-1.8mm difference. 

Out of all the ROOs, The Survivor conceals this flaw the best. There are just too many textures and finishing to get called out without a side by side with the gen. There is also no aspect reference to the pushers since they are concealed by the PGs. Notice the pushers are rounded on the rep and look identical, the slight asymmetry in the gen’s pusher to crown placement getting lost in the finishing. 

Ignore all light variation between case and pushers, they are both the same color. 

&amp;nbsp;

[Another Pic](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/4.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;


This Caseback is as good as you’ll ever see on a ROO. The rep’s coating has held up even better than the gen. The screws on the rep are a teeny tiny bit bigger to account for the thicker case and therefore longer screws, not a flaw, just a necessity because of the a7750 Sec @ 12 movement. 

The camera flash is making the rep screws look bigger than they really are, I stared at the caseback for 10 straight minutes while taking photos and could not find a flaw. 

If you look closely at the gen crown however, you’ll spot a teeny tiny purple dot. The more eagle eyed amongst you probably spotted that on the earlier shots. 

That tiny purple dot is a jewel. On all the crown holes adjacent to the case there is a tiny jewel, similar to a movement jewel. 8 jewels in total on the crown. I caught this detail while taking flash photos and a trace of purple glare sparkled at me. 

Color me impressed with AP. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if the sum total of 1000 Survivor owners have never noticed this detail. 

P.S. You can be sure I’ve already begun to source the appropriately sized “Crown Jewels”. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Another pic](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/5.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;

Look closely at the case lug screws. Gen is slightly recessed and Rep is totally flush. Also gives the impression they are of different diameter, which they probably aren’t because gen screws fit fine. A seemingly simple mod, that I wouldn’t bother with frankly. 

[Check it](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/6.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;

A nearly identical side profile height / width. 

[Height/Width](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/7.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;


Nearly identical side grips, taller on the rep. Sides of bezels look identical, sorry for the bad angle. Case lug screws look a decimal of a millimeter bigger on the rep here, further accentuated by the stripped black coating on the screw. 


&amp;nbsp;

[Side Grips, Case](http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h374/TheBattler/8.jpg)
&amp;nbsp;



There are $50,750 worth of watches in this photo. 

The 3 areas of interest I couldn’t illustrate in the shots were: Crystal Clarity, Weight and the purpose of the PGs. The Crystal clarity on the rep is as reported and disappointing. In the photos it looks very close to the gen, but it does refract more light and it is indeed cloudy. The weight is surprisingly very close. There was no discernible difference at all in weight. Definitely a nice surprise given the rep is nearly 2mm thicker. It’s probably balanced out by the weightier movement in the gen. 

People love those Pusher Guards, the reason why they’re there is because of the butter soft pushers on the gen. Who would want to risk the wager of a private yacht race between you and your old friend Prince Mohammed, because your AP cal. 3126/3840 powered chrono was activated accidentally by your current intern turned girlfriend? 


&amp;nbsp;

Timing performances are totally out of the scope of this review though. 

The simple and obvious truth is that we get to pay 1% of what the 1 percenters pay for a Survivor. 
Sure, it’s not a 100% Survivor, movement aside it’s a 90% Survivor. The burden of a choice we all bear however is if we’re going to hand over the extra $49k for that extra 10%. I’m going to go out on a limb here and bet that at least half of you will not choose the gen. 

The number 8 is the most significant numeral in Chinese culture. In Mandarin, the word for eight sounds similar to a word that translates as “prosper” and “wealth”. It is the Chinese peoples’ lucky number, 88 is written on newlyweds’ doors’ for double luck and double prosperity. The number 8 is also the amount of steps towards the path of enlightenment in the Buddhist faith. 

Thus it is no coincidence in my eyes, why the Noob factory chose such a masterclass of design and craftsmanship to reverse engineer and replicate. To such a high degree and to such a high cost. The Survivor is a metaphor for China. Ancient design and traditions meet an evolved and modernized platform.

That's it folks. Hopefully you see how accurate these super reps are. These are nearly identical! 

You can find the AP Survivor right [here](http://www.timepalace.net/royal-oak-survivor-dlcceramicle-blk-a7750-sec12-p-691.html). I have a couple Hublots and APs coming from Time Palace that I will do reviews for in the next week or two.

This is how my career has transpired thus far:

- Graduated with a CS degree from a private university in the US, also went to school overseas

- Did a help desk internship at a cement factory. It was filthy but I kinda liked it. They didn't have the money to offer me a full time gig.

- Was a PC technician at a multi billion dollar corporation. I was a contractor which meant no healthcare, no PTO, and got treated poorly. Got laid off with all my peers after a year (they did this yearly). A very dark period where I gained around 70 pounds and took sleeping pills with alcohol while living alone. Depression is real.

- Went back to the cement shop for a few months because they had some contract work. Still liked it there.

- Went to small local company for some development work in VB. Was met with sexism and my job description changed 4 times in 6 months. Myself and my peers were constantly berated and they told me it was normal. Got up and left one day and never came back.

- Needed a job so a friend gave me job doing QA at a large software shop. It was basically an internship. Discovered that I was quite good at QA and I liked the company. However, the company wanted full timers to have a masters degree and I wasn't going to pay for one.

- Another ""permatemp"" job at a major healthcare provider doing QA. Terrible place to work. A year in I fell incredibly ill and nearly passed away. I was fired for taking too much time off. I was working in a hospital at the time strangely enough. I could write a book on my experience here. Pure hell.

- Landed a job at a start up doing QA/SDET. Wonderful place to work for years. Then we started to lose money and now we're at each other's throats. The days are winding down and the environment just gets more toxic as we near the end.

I've been looking for new positions and it's pretty brutal out there. One place wanted to schedule an interview with me but then blew me off because I had a typo in an email (I was typing on my phone because they contacted me while I was at work). That was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back.

I want to get out of this shit industry. The attitudes, the expectations, the exploitation... all of it is a nightmare. I've been having nightmares and my hands shake due to the stress I'm currently under at my current job (on top of looking for a new one). I can't take it anymore. "
35lo43,4,2015-05-11,Just started a new retail job and I already kind of want to quit. Are my reasons valid?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/35lo43/just_started_a_new_retail_job_and_i_already_kind/,"I finally got a part time job to save up for a car while in college. I searched everywhere including dozens of craigslist applications and even my college all of which came up dry. Finally I got a retail job at a store in the mall and I thought it would be better than my last one, and it was for a while but now the company is doing some stuff that I don't like.

First off they gave us a 5 page packet to read on selling to customers. One of the lines gave an example of a man coming in saying he can't buy something because he has to pay his mortgage before it defaults. The very next line, and I kid you not, said we are supposed to sell to him anyway and persuade him his payment can wait, we sell board games btw (in their defense my district manager crossed this line out but it was still sent by our main boss). A couple other of my favorite stupidities in that packet where we aren't allowed to say sir or ma'am. I was raised to say that whenever possible how can they force me not to? The packet also said that 95% of people hate being called Mr. (Insert name) no matter if it's in retail or business. If I can't say Mr. and I can't say sir what am I supposed to say? Lastly apparently if a customer says they aren't interested in something my line is supposed to be ""ok I will put this up at the front for you."" What? I don't really want to be apart of a company that has such silly ideas. 

Next is just the work itself. I'm a person who will generally believe you have to crawl through the shit to make progress. Work is tough I get that. However this is hardly work. We are in a mall and parents routinely drop off their kids while they shop. We have to constantly call security on unattended children and they make my work life hell because holy shit do they make a mess. Now that would be fine if we had time to clean up but if we don't close within a half of an hour we are supposed to clock out and then continue to clean. Today I was there 45 minutes after close and had to clock out at 30 minutes so I had 15 minutes of unpaid work I was there for. Is that even legal?

I don't know what to do. The job seems pretty cool and the people are alright I just feel it's going in the direction my last job did and It's going to be hell. It's only my 3rd week and I feel I should stick it out but we only get a small amount of time on this planet do I really want to waste it here? I would look for a job in my field (IT) but I haven't even been able to find unpaid internships let alone paid work. 

Any advice? Maybe I'm just too soft or picky and if I am by all means tell me. I just want to make the right decisions "

So as the only resident intern with web dev experience, I've been tasked with setting a wordpress site. Sounded pretty easy to me until I asked some more questions. 

The company we are setting it up for is going to be hosting the site on their own servers. When I asked about them setting up cPanel (the way I usually install Wordpress), they gave me FTP log in information instead.

I'm a bit confused where FTP comes in to play. Do I just use it to install Wordpress on their server and then use the www.example.com/admin to log in and edit the site?

35m7ds,2,2015-05-11,LemonFakes Maryland [In State] Review: Reprint Edition!,biigfuun,fakeid,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/35m7ds/lemonfakes_maryland_in_state_review_reprint/,"[Original review here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/347jr6/lemonfakes_maryland_in_state_review/)

*Both the ID, duplicate, and reprint were given to me for free to review in-state by LemonFakes, however all of the following opinions are of my own.*

**Communication: 10/10**

A few days after I submitted my first review /u/lemonslittlehelper messaged me ""if you received a free reprint, would you write a better review? We had some issues w/ printer / photoshopping but we are diligently working to improve on those issues. Let me know."" I agreed and said I would write a better review if the quality was better and he assured me I would have a better version by 05/08 and even double checked with me about the county abbreviation as some others and I pointed out that it was a glaring problem.

**Speed: 10/10**

I was told I would get it by 05/08 and received it today 05/11. The delay was most likely because my campus post office is shit. 

**OPSEC: improved/10**

Yeah yeah as long as it got to me it's a 10/10 I know I know. Anyways it was definitely an improvement this time as I didn't automatically know what was inside. 

**Overall Quality: 6/10**

The colors, crab, and signature are still fantastic. There was a definite improvement on the sex/height/weight/etc. text on the bottom so now it isn't so washed out. Plus the county abbreviation was fixed, which to me was the biggest issue with using it in state. The photoshop is *marginally* better. I don't know what else to say, it's a pretty decent ID. 

**Holos: 8/10**

Same generic holos found on every Maryland ID. Nothing too special. No change from the original prints.

**UV: N/A**

I *still* don't have a UV light. Sorry fam. 

**Photoshop: 2/10**

It is so much improved since the original print, however there are *still* issues. My head is a bit smaller than I should be, the ""shadows"" are jagged and obviously faked, and there is *still* a subtle white outline. At least I don't look like a ghoul anymore? Idk.

**Scanning: 10/10**

Scanned perfectly on PDF417, BCS, and idScan.

**Overall: 7/10**

It's nice to see that LemonFakes takes reviews seriously and was quick to offer reprints and admit his faults. I really wanted to be able to love this ID and not be afraid to use it in state, but I still don't think it is good enough to be passable in state. However I will do my duty to this sub and attempt to use it here before I leave for my internship this summer.

35m801,2,2015-05-11,Summer funding challenges,lrenaud,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/35m801/summer_funding_challenges/,"I'm running into an issue driven by my Professor being somewhat stingy with funding.

Three students in my research group (myself included) are all finished with our classes and ready to take our preliminary exams so we can go ABD. Normally we would schedule our examinations for next Fall, and take them at that point and move forward, but to save the cost of our tuition our professor wants us to take them during the summer examination session available in August. This means we're effectively taking our exams a semester earlier than our schools graduate student handbook recommends.

I'm not really wild about front loading my exams, but I understand the financial benefit and why my professor finds it desirable. The catch comes in that to do our prelims over the summer, we have to register for 2 credits and pay an extra $1000 over the summer. When we asked our professor if he would pay this cost, he very firmly told us he would not. 

This has put us all in a bit of a financial quandary. Beyond the extra cost, our income over the summer tanks as our professor keeps us around on hourly wage, with an income just barely enough to keep us afloat until the fall semester funding starts up again in August. On top of this, I was at least personally told that if I took an internship offer I had this summer (which would actually have given me the financial means needed to pay for this crap) that I would be looked on unfavorably by my committee at prelims. The department is small enough that if he told the committee he wanted me out, they would fail me just so he didn't have to have another reason to remove me.



Thus far I've been bitching, but what I'm looking for is some advice on how to politic this one out.

My frustration is compounded by the belief that in spite of a certain number of misgivings I have about a in how my professor manipulates my program, I'm far enough into my degree and my research that moving schools/advisors isn't something I'd like to attempt. Long term I still thinking riding out the bumps my relationship is a worthwhile hurdle in pursuing my research and my degree. The question becomes then, what is the best way to go about getting some help for this one, without totally pissing off my professor in the process?

tl;dr Prof wants me to pay $1000+ now, so he can save $10,000+ later. Looking for advice on how to handle it without pissing him off to much."

Fast forward to now, I got an internship in Chicago and will be spending my whole summer there. 

Anyone have advice on places that I definitely should/should not use the ID?  I don't go to bars or anything much, there are just a couple concerts that are 21+ that I really want to go to at the Mid and Studio Paris. If anyone had any experiences with the bouncers there that would be much appreciated.

For what it's worth, some background - I got the ID a year ago and have used it dozens of times without being questioned once - everything from notoriously strict (lol) supermarkets in massachusetts, to clubs and bars in hollywood, to even some of the 'toughest' nightclubs in vegas.  

really would appreciate any advice, especially if anyone has any places in the area that are notoriously strict/lax.  thanks again"

35mls9,4,2015-05-11,My [24M] mother [63F] caught my step-father [43M] messaging other women. Not sure how I can ever look at him again.,Indfanfromcol,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35mls9/my_24m_mother_63f_caught_my_stepfather_43m/,"So to start off, yes, my mother is a cougar and married exactly 20 years younger. Not only does she not look her age, but we also lived in a military town. So the men to women ratio is high.


However, my mother has been married to my step-father for a little over 10 years now. I grew up with my step-father being my hockey coach and being there a lot in general for me (I also have a strong relationship with my father, but my step-father was great for the most part). 2 weeks ago, my mother called me because she caught my step-father messaging women on yahoo instant messenger. 


He hadn't deleted his history, so she read the things he was texting like ""what turns you on sexually"", ""I like a woman that sucks my cock"" and much more. He also sent the woman a dick pick. He also told her he was single, and that he has a wife but it became a chore sexually to be with her. When they met, she also was no longer able to have children (which made him extremely upset even though they still got married), and he texted the woman ""I would like to have kids with the right woman"". That to me was a big slap to the face.


The worst part about this all is that he was most likely sexting a scammer. She was from ""Ghana"" and asked if she could send him some money so she could buy a plane ticket to come see him. So at some point, I am not sure if he really thought he was talking to a woman who was attracted to him, or more likely he was just using her for sexual thrills.


Well, the next weekend my mother came to see me. I live 500 miles away finishing up my degree, and had finals coming and couldn't come see her myself. It was nice to try and get her mind off things and just see her, but we talked and she decided she is going to at least attempt to work things out, which I commend her for.


At this point though, I am not sure how I can ever look at my step-father again. I know I am a moma's boy, and love my mother to death. How he hurt her and the things that he did and said, I just am not sure how I can forgive him. Which makes me feel like an ass, because this isn't about me. If my mother can forgive him, so should I. But how can I do this? 


I won't be able to go see them at all anytime soon. I start my final semester (summer semester) soon and then I graduate. So the first time I will see him will be at my graduation. I also start an internship this summer that leads into a full time job once I graduate. Combine that with also planning a wedding with my fiance, I won't see him after that until my wedding.


 So realistically, I won't see him until two of the most important moments in my life, and at the current moment I don't want him at either. But I don't want to hurt him and my mother's relationship, so I know I need to invite him to both. I know I am being selfish, and could use some advice on how to move past my anger in order to be there for my mother.


**TL;DR**: My stepfather emotionally cheated on my mom on yahoo messenger. Didn't delete history and mother read it, and they were very hurtful. My mother decided to try and work things out, but sure how to get past my hatred of him in order to be supportive for her.


EDIT: I forgot to add what all they have been through. My step-father was medically discharged from the army due to brain damaged he suffered from his convoy being hit by an IED. Well, for 3 years, his doctor on the military base had him on so much physciatric medicine, during the day he would maybe say a total of 5 words. He was almost in a zombie like state. They got him off all the medicine, and then he started having narcoleptic seizures. He could no longer drive. So he couldn't take himself to work, school, or his doctor appointments at the VA 2 hours away. So my mother tried doing all that, but it got too much. So I left my university for 2 years to everyday drive my step-father to work, to school, back to work, then pick him up from work. Also, he had weekly doctor appointments in town, and every other week I drove him 2 hours to the Atlanta VA. I left back to my university once his seizures were under control. So I guess I feel like also she has been there so much for him, and this is how he repaid her."

My entire life I've been running from my problems, and avoiding people out of fear of judgement. Now I'm out of places to run and hide and have no choice, but to face my problems head on. I don't know if I can do it, I don't know if I'm strong enough. It all started in 6th grade when I found out the girl I had a huge crush on liked me too. Even though I was ecstatic and liked her a lot too, I was so nervous about asking her out even though I knew she was going to say yes, that it took five of her friends goading me to eventually ask her out. Great, my first girlfriend. The only problem was that I had no idea no to talk to a girl. I still don't. So what did I do? Did I ask my parents for advice? No. Did I at least try to talk to her no matter how awkward and forced? No. I fucking ignored her for 2 or 3 months straight until one of her friend informed me that we were broken up. I was devastated, but utterly helpless to do anything about because little did I know I had social anxiety. This is the biggest regret of my life because it is the first time I can remember that my anxiety had a negative impact of my life, and I believe it is the catalyst for a series of events that led to me missing out on the formative years in my life. 

Looking back, I can't believe some of the shit I used to do. I hid in the bathroom during lunch, I avoided people I knew in the hallway, alienated people who liked me and wanted to be my friend, I would drive around in my car for hours on the weekends so my parents thought I had friends. Also, here's the real kicker. I've had a cellphone since I was in sixth grade, but didn't start using it until I was a freshman in college. I was always too scared to ask people for their numbers and the thought of talking on the phone or texting someone terrified me. Also, when people would ask me for my number I would tell them I didn't have a phone because I was afraid they would look at my contacts and think I was a loser for having nothing in there. In retrospect, people thinking you don't have a phone when you're in high school is way worse, but somehow my anxious brain thought this was the best way to protect myself.

Oddly enough, even though I had no real friends, I was never picked on in middle school or high school. Maybe, it was because I'm a pretty big kid who has a fair amount of muscle, or maybe people just felt bad for me. Sports was the only real social interaction I had in high school, and at the time I felt like it was enough. Even so, high school was the worst years of my life and I felt a great relief when it was finally over.

For me, college was a chance to start over and reinvent myself. I was going to a place where nobody knew me and I felt like the possibilities were endless. I would like to think over the last three years I've gotten a lot better socially. I've been lucky enough to make some great friends, and being immersed in that environment forced me to face a lot of my problems. However, there's been many a day where I've struggled to leave my dorm, go to class, go to parties, and meet new people. I've gotten better at talking to girls (thanks alcohol), but I'm still a virgin despite having a lot, a lot, a lot of opportunities to lose it, and that's is probably the thing that bothers me the most. Looking back, there's been so many times when it was obvious that a girl was into me and wanted to sleep with me, but I got too nervous, too anxious, or was just oblivious until later on. Also, I'm kinda scared to sleep with a girl because I don't want her to know I'm a virgin, or not be able to please her, or finish too early. Now, I'm going to be a senior and if I don't lose it next year, I just know it's going to be nearly impossible to lose it after I graduate. But honestly, I don't even think being a virgin really bothers me that bad deep down. It's the stigma of being a virgin and people judging me that makes me feel depressed. What I really desire the most is a relationship and the intimacy that comes with it, but I don't really even know if I'm capable of that.

Anyways, the thing that's causing me the most anxiety right now is trying to find a job. I'm 21 and I've never had a job before. How fucking pathetic is that. It's not that haven't wanted a job in the past either. It's that I'm fucking scared to go apply, or that I won't be able to do the job, or that I'll mess up and get fired because of my fucked up brain that makes it impossible to think clearly and talk to people. The past two summers I've feigned looking for a job. I lied to my father about applying to places and never hearing back, blaming the economy and poor job market. An internship is out of the question too because my grades are shit and I have no experience. I know I should be getting better grades in school, but I go through periods of depression that make it hard to function and can't study, and I get terrible test anxiety even if I know the material.

Somethings gotta give. This time next year, I will be entering into the real world. If I don't get a job this summer, and a girlfriend this year, I feel like I never will. Right now I feel like a spoiled, entitled piece of shit living of my parents hard earned money. I want to do more to help out, but right now everyday is a struggle for me mentally. Every mundane task feels like climbing a mountain. I love my father for everything he does for me. He is the glue holding my fragile family together right now, but I don't think he has any clue that I even suffer from any form of anxiety. I guess I do a good job of hiding it. Mental illness runs on my mothers side of the family. Both my brother and mother have anxiety. My brother who is 24 is able to hold down a job and has had multiple girlfriends despite it, even though he self medicates with marijuana, and is currently going to therapy to painkiller addiction. My mother on the other hand has been suffering from dementia for the last five years at only 55. I don't wan't to be anymore of a burden to my father, and my problems definitely pale in comparison to my mothers, but I feel like I need help too. I just don't know how to reach out or have anyone to talk too.       

I've been lying to myself for a long time, and I wish nothing more than to be able to go back and time and get help sooner, but I can't. Denial is the most powerful defense mechanism in the human mind, and because of it I've been wearing a mask for the longest time, but now the mask must come off, and I must face my true self. If I don't quell my anxiety soon, my problems will never be solved.

I have so much potential, so much love to give, I'm smart, I'm attractive, I'm fit, and goddammit people like me. I just wish I could convince myself it was true. I want to help everyone else who feels like me. Give them a hug and tell them it's going to be ok, but I can't until I get better first. I need help.

35mriw,4,2015-05-11,"No-start Date, Mixed Information, Guilt-trips, and more. My current dilemma as a Big 4 intern starting full time this summer.",ConcernedIntern,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/35mriw/nostart_date_mixed_information_guilttrips_and/,"Very long story and I apologize. I really need some insight here so I'd appreciate anyone who can take the time to read this and provide their thoughts.

I interned last spring for the 2014 busy season at a Big 4 firm. It was a fantastic experience.  I loved the work, the employees, the culture, and entire setup of my internship.  A full time offer ensued for all the interns and we were given a start date of ""sometime in September."" Our recruiter told us they have very limited slots available for people who wanted to start earlier, and upon hearing this, me and a few other interns spoke with our recruiter to ask if a September start was guaranteed since we had travel plans, CPA schedules, etc.  Our recruiter explicitly informed us that *starting earlier than September would not be required* - so far so good.

Fast forward to March of this year.  So far, across the country everyone I knew who was starting their full-time position at a Big 4 was given their September start date, and a few opted for an earlier start.  My group had yet to hear anything from our firm. Towards the end of the month we received an email asking our preference for starting. The email once again stated that *starting early was not a requirement* and that only a limited number of spots would be available for starting early.  Since I anticipated several trips and events over the summer, and the fact that I did not have a lease/place to live in the city I am interning, (as well as being told numerous times I wouldn't have to start early) I responded with my September preference with the understanding that I'd be starting in September. 

A month goes by with no contact - It is now the end of April.  I, along with a few other interns, received calls revolving involving us starting June 1st. Everyone was contacted by phone and different stories were told to all the interns.  Some interns were asked if they could start early, others were told that they *have* to start.  Naturally, we were all taken aback by this information. We have all been planning our summers the same way all the other September-start interns have - finding work for the summer, planning trips, scheduling exams and study schedules, RSVPing for weddings, etc. etc.  

When I received the call telling me they needed me to start full time within the month (June 1st), I was legitimately shocked and my mind was racing just trying to figure out the logistics of how I'd get my life in order within the month. I didn't have an apartment in the city, I had a job lined up for the summer in my hometown, I had several trips booked and planned, and I wasn't even finishing up school until the end of May.   On the phone I calmly said I was a bit surprised at the information, and briefly explained my situation in an attempt to figure out how I could make this work.  I was met with a response that kind of shocked me - my recruiter explained that they were ""extremely disappointed"" with how the interns were acting, and that they're running a business and client service is priority number one. Very cold. It felt I was being yelled at for explaining my current situation in light of the recent news.  They wanted me to confirm I'd be starting June 1st immediately on the phone and I just said I'd need some time to figure out a few aspects of my situation. The phone call then awkwardly and abruptly ended when the recruiter said they'd get back to the interns by the end of the week with start-date information.  Speaking to other interns in my class, everyone had a different story and different experience.  Some interns weren't even contacted at all to start early.  Some people were given an option coupled with the recruiter stating ""we support whichever decision you decide to make, no worries!"" Mixed information from everyone with people being contacted strictly by phone at different times.

2 weeks have now passed with no start dates given to anyone. I still haven't found a place in the city and I have absolutely no idea what I should be doing.  People who have reached out have yet to hear a response. I can't wait to work at my firm and I'd like to consider myself a very flexible, hard-working, motivated intern willing to put in the time and grind into anything but I can't help but feel wronged in this situation. I wish they would've told us we may be required to start in June - I would've gladly prepared appropriately!  All my peers outside of my firm have known what's going on for months and when they'd be starting.  I'm here left feeling guilty that I didn't immediately agree to start June 1st on the phone and I feel I'm leaving a bad impression for finding issue with how things are going down.  Am I being unreasonable in thinking this is somewhat uncalled for? We were told (as well as it being implied) that we'd be starting in September! June 1st is in 3 weeks and I have no idea if I'll be working and living in a different city or if I need to cancel my work/travel/study/event plans for the immediate future. I don't even know how I'll find an apartment between now and then since I'm still in school. Our recruiter basically told several individuals that they were extremely upset with us and were given a very cold shoulder for the first time ever.  Are we all just being spoiled brats? Thoughts? Advice? I just want to make a good impression and not have all my plans my last summer crumble in front of me! pls halp.

I don't have any school projects saved because I honestly never thought they would be worth a damn in an interview seeing as they're mostly for learning programming. The other problem is that I'm not particularly fond of coding for myself. After all the programming and studying I do for school, I really don't want to do that much outside of it. I like working on projects for others, but I don't really have many friends that need applications built, and there's no one I know that needs system programming done. I'm currently seeking an internship as a developer so that I can code for rent (right now I work for one of the IT giants as a backup specialist), but until then, it's difficult for me to find the drive to code outside of class/work unless it's for someone else. Do I have a future as a programmer, or should I start considering alternatives for a career?

Just a note: It's not that I don't find coding enjoyable, but at the end of the day, I would much rather indulge myself in one of my other hobbies like cooking than code more."

I'm a Bible College student slowly coming to the conclusion that I no longer believe. I've seen a lot here about the depression and anxiety that comes with de-conversion, both of which are the case with me currently, but that's not exactly why I'm posting today.

I wasn't raised Pentecostal, I chose it on my own when I was 16. For several years I was very zealous with street evangelism and preaching, and I enrolled in bible college in 2011 to major in Urban Ministry. I'm now about to enter my senior year, and I'm starting an internship in a few weeks with a church in Philadelphia that will be expecting from me a high level of enthusiasm for that which I was passionate about before. Of course, I'm now very apathetic about all things regarding the spread of Christianity and ministry in the church, just as I am supposed to be beginning a career in those areas. 

I'm still passionate about the inner city and want to do positive things in that environment, I'm just pretty sure preaching the Gospel in urban neighborhoods is not what I want to be doing at this point.
  
I'm wondering if there's anybody here that can identify with the side of de-conversion that includes losing your sense of purpose in life and if so, what you've found to be helpful to you in regaining your identity apart from Christ. I guess I'm just in an awkward spot in my early 20's and not sure what to do next after being involved in ministry for so long."

35n6xd,14,2015-05-11,Disney World; Where Dreams Come True [Mf] Str8 [oral] [true],dirtydaddysgirl13,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/35n6xd/disney_world_where_dreams_come_true_mf_str8_oral/,"Working at Disney World (on an internship) was a real trip. I worked in a merchandise location, but for the sake of discretion I won’t say which one. The buzz of the lighting was getting on my nerves and the faint sound of jeopardy on the break room tv was not helping. The uncomfortable booth was dirty when I sat down, and if I hadn’t cleaned it off, it would still be covered in trash. As I sat there, (not really) enjoying my short break, I began to wonder if that hot maintenance guy had seen me. 

For the past 6 months, I had been eyeing this maintenance guy and I still didn’t know his name. But, I didn’t need to know, looking at him had been enough. His tall and sturdy body was almost reminiscent of “dad” body (if not for the definition of his arm and chest muscles), but that was all the better in my opinion.  My time in Florida was about to be over and I had been hoping to casually bump into this mystery maintenance guy to, well, live a little. Just thinking about his thick forearms and big hands already had my imagination wandering away with itself. I had given him a lot of thought over the past few months and was familiar with the road I was going down. Although I had been trying to flirt with him for months, I wasn’t sure if it was sinking in, he always seemed interested, always flirted back, but had never given me his number. I assumed he was married. Not many guys are this hard to get for me. My long brown hair, slender frame and bubble butt made it easy for me to get who I wanted. Granted I did wear a pretty baggy costume (that’s a Disney term for uniform), but that was because my tits are pretty big (we are talking 36DDD) so, the only costumes that fit me were huge. Come to think of it, he couldn’t see any of my physical features under here. I started to think that maybe if he knew, maybe then…

   I heard footsteps approaching and opened my big green eyes. There he was, just standing in front of me, package at eye level. I could see the outline of his cock in his pants. I felt my heart speed up and my mouth started to water. As my eyes traveled up his body, I wondered (for the millionth time) what his costume was hiding. The top buttons were undone and a few chest hairs were showing. His big eyes looked…flirtatious. With a half smirk on his face, he handed me a piece of paper. I didn’t think it was real but I had to accept that it was. Written on the paper was his phone number and it said “text me, now, if you want to have some fun.” I immediately ran my fingers through my long dark brown hair and bit my lip a little. I wasn’t sure what to do, although I knew I wanted to. 

Minutes later, I was walking to a small electrical closet by the employee entrance. As far as I knew, that little room wasn’t even there until he suggested it. I checked over my shoulder to make sure nobody was watching me approach the door. As soon as I touched the door, he pulled it open and pulled me in. The room was larger than I had imagined it would be and much hotter! His shirt was already unbuttoned as he pressed me into the door. I pushed back on his chest and could feel the already forming beads of sweat on him. I slid my hand down his chest and stomach, pleased to find a trail of hair, undoubtedly leading exactly where I wanted to be. He grabbed my hips and gasped feeling my waistline. I moved to grind my hips into him. His hands moved across my body and unbuttoned my shirt. My pussy started throbbing as he exposed my body. His eyes got dark, animalistic. Pure need. My body began trembling as he unhooked my lacey blue bra. He buried his face in my titties. As he sucked licked at my nipples I reached down and stroked his cock. It was way bigger than I had imagined and I could feel myself getting wetter and wetter. I unbuckled his belt and started to pull his dick out. Suddenly he pulled me off of him and flipped me over. Before I could register what was happening my pants were around my knees and I was bent over.  I could feel him teasing me with his cock about to be inside me. He pushed his dick into me, really slowly listening to my moan. He did it again, a little faster, and then again faster and faster. “Baby, you’re so tight,” he said as he humped me hard. It was true, he was huge, and I was surprised he even fit in me. I was moaning, damn near yelling. All of a sudden he clamped his hand over my mouth. Someone was coming down the hallway. I froze, terrified and so turned on I could barely breathe. Loud music began playing and he started fucking me again, smacking my big round ass. He leaned in and told me what a dirty slut I was. Normally, I would have been pissed but I was so horny I moaned and felt my orgasm building. His hand still clamped over my mouth I finished. I turned around and sank to my knees. Taking him into my mouth and sucking. Tasting myself all over him was so hot.I started coming again and then I could feel his building. His muscles tensing and cock throbbing in my mouth, he came. With a load grunt, thick ropes of cum coated my mouth, and spilled down onto my tits. I swallowed and stood up.

I checked my watch and saw my break was over in 2 minutes, I had to get out of there, but I was covered in his fluid and I could feel mine leaking down my leg. I quickly removed my panties and cleaned myself up, storing my come soaked panties in my pocket until I could get to my purse, I buttoned my shirt up and opened the door. And on my way out he said, “I guess Disney is where Dreams Come True. Same time tomorrow?” I turned back to him and replied, “ Anything your cock desires.”

35nae7,1,2015-05-11,When does short term opportunity cost overcome long term benefits?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35nae7/when_does_short_term_opportunity_cost_overcome/,"Posted a few times on here before, and consider myself pretty financially smart/sound.  20 year old, I make $20,000 a year as a part time retailer worker at a company that treats me right.  $14.17 an hour, averages to $22,000 a year, they pay my medical benefits, and $4,000 a year tuition.  I am going to a state university 100% debt free, and have $25,000 invested in stocks/funds I won't touch until retirement, $20,000 invested short term for when I want to start a life in 5 years, and $10,000 cash in an account, for a total of $55,000.  

I am a Computer Science major, and have done a few side projects and events to give me a little above average Resume, so with this field and my growing credentials, I don't anticipate having much trouble finding a job.

One thing I really want to do is an internship either during my Junior year, or the summer before Senior year.  However my current scenario is 100% financially secure.  If I were to get an internship at a tech company, I would lose that semesters $4,000 tuition reimbursement, and be kicked off of the medical plan for not working enough hours.  My parent's said they would pick me up, but I would still need to pay several hundred out of pocket.  So I calculated me taking a few months off of work for an internship to be $6-10,000 lost due to benefits and other perks.  However getting an internship would solidify my already sound looking resume.  PF is always talking about making sure that you are secure now before focussing on anything in the future, but as a young, inexperienced user, I need risk evaluations.

I'm lost at what to do.  Obviously I am in a good financial state, 0 debt, $55,000 in mostly safe assets, and going to college debt free.  Short term, I may have to dip into savings, and mentally struggle knowing that I'm losing money month - month, but long term it has the opportunity to pay off."
35nb2g,2,2015-05-11,Me(22m) and my gf(21f) had a rough half year because of distance.,saintmrdog,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35nb2g/me22m_and_my_gf21f_had_a_rough_half_year_because/,"So a little background: We have known each other for 8 years. We are best friends. We tried dating, 3 years ago, but apparently she was pretending to like me, because she wanted it to work out, but she couldn't do it and it ended in a week. Broke my heart. The next year we made up as friends but were still distant. I moved to a different state for a job.

The first time I came back, we were great as friends. At the end of my three month vacation she confessed to me she had messed up and that she was sure this time she had feelings for me, and that she had matured a lot in the past three years. I said no, mainly because she broke my heart and I was leaving again. I left for another half a year and came back for three weeks during Christmas. We had kept contact and we hung out a lot. We went on a trip with out other friends who are a couple and in that trip we kissed and decided to do the relationship. I said yes because I only had half a year left. 


We talked during long distance, and I went to her for Valentine's day and it was amazing! Fast forward to today, she's met a new friend while she was in a different state as well(for an internship) and she is the devil. She has gotten in the way of our plans and a bunch of stuff. Anyways, I visited her on my way home from where I was coming and originally I was gonna stay the night with her, but then I learned that this new ""friend"" moved in with her two days prior to when I was coming so she canceled the me staying part because this friend gave her crap about her being there only one week. We had a huge fight about it, because I didn't know at the time her ""friend"" had ruined our plans and she didn't tell me right away(unlucky communication mistake) I arrived at her city, and took her out for dinner, and we talked, but it felt much different than valentines. She kissed me when I arrived and left, but when I asked her to make out she said she didn't want to even though we have in the pass and she's enjoyed it. Mind you this was outside her apartment and her ""friend"" was inside waiting for her. I also learned that she was on her period, don't know if that was part of it.


Now she comes back on Friday and she wants me to meet her family, celebrate my birthday even though I don't want to, and go on dates and she has stuff planned till late September. I have been filed with insecurities because of many reasons, and I was wondering if it would be wise to tell her that I didn't like her friend. Wondering what happened in the two years(because we never talked about it. She just said she matured, and she wants to be with me. Also her friend told me her ex made her pure horny, but with me she gets that ""butterflies in the stomach"" effect.) What kinda relationship this is?(Serious or casual since we known each other for so long.)


I'm just very confusing and need help, because I do like her, but I'm terrified of falling for her again, just to get my heart broken again, even though this time around I know her direct family already and everyone keeps telling she is crazy for me now.


tl;dr: Dating my best friend, and it was a tough half a year because of long distance, coming back together need help clarifying the relationship and wondering if I'm entitled to asking some serious questions."

I completely bombed the final and now have to retake the whole course.  I don't know what happened, I was making a B the entire semester and then the final came.  I pulled an all-nighter before and I had already had an 8AM differential equations final directly before it and I blanked out, couldn't remember a single thing, failed it, and it brought my grade down to a D because of it.  I feel completely demoralized, I loved the course, the instructor, and put so much time and effort into it and then just froze up at the very last moment.  I've never had to retake a class before, and I feel so embarrassed for having to.  I guess I was asking for it, I took a pretty heavy schedule (Circuits, Diff Eq, Engineering Stats, Linear Algebra, and another non required upper-division course).  But, because this happened in my major specific class I feel horrible.  I have 3 semesters left of college, I haven't had an internship or any comparable experience yet and I don't know how the hell I'm going to explain this to anyone... The only thing I have going for me is that it's offered in the summer and I signed up for it today.  I don't know though, maybe I'm just being too hard on myself, I'm just so worried about what it will do to my GPA (3.4) and that it's going to just inhibit me going forward..."
35nfzm,1,2015-05-11,How can I take advantage of having a mentor/internship?,LordLeviathan,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/35nfzm/how_can_i_take_advantage_of_having_a/,"**TL;DR:** What can I do to get the most out of having a mentor and interning with a tech startup?

**The Meat** (Sorry for the length. I just want to give as much detail as possible in order to get the most help as possible)

I'm 21 and just finished my junior year of college, studying to get a BS in Economics. My dream is to start my own business at some point, a software company probably. In January, I really wanted an internship to gain some experience, and so I googled for tech startups in my area and sent out cold emails to the ones I found interesting. I romanticized the startup environment, and since they were smaller, I felt that I would be able to move horizontally through the company and learn as much as possible. Eventually, the CEO of one emailed me back and I landed an internship with a startup cyber security company. I've been here since February.

The Chief Business Officer for this company is a ""CEO Mentor"" by profession. Mentoring is his job and what he loves to do, as he also mentors younger CEO's in the area starting their first business. He has really taken a liking to me and wants to help me. 

This is where the title comes in. I'm not really doing much with my internship. I basically get paid $10/hr to browse the internet. I've sent out a couple company-wide emails telling people that I'd love to help them with any projects they have, and sometimes the CBO will find somethings for me. These normally consist of going through spreadsheets and finding contact info for potential customers, but other than that I don't do much.

Him and I have weekly, 1-on-1 meetings because he wants to know how he can really help me the most, but I'm not sure what questions to ask or in what way he can help me. I'm very grateful for this opportunity and  want to take full advantage of it, but I'm not sure how."
35nkk4,1,2015-05-11,The truth is my weapon...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/35nkk4/the_truth_is_my_weapon/,"I need to start to live for now. I think the only way to do that is to air out my past – to lay the pain out on the table, cards exposed. I have a way with people – the way is “I’ll give you some of me, but you can’t have all of me.” It’s been my protection to wall pieces of myself off so they can no longer bring me pain. But that method only works for so long. Eventually it all comes welling up and if you open up to take a small peek it all comes out at once – it’s spewing, bubbling, boiling. It’s so painful that at times you feel like you may actually die.  

	I don’t have many good memories of my dad. The few decent things I can remember were taking turns reading chapters of Nancy Drew books together or going fishing. The rest of my memories are pretty sad. They are filled with years of mental abuse and a couple of instances of actual physical abuse. He was an angry person and based on my most recent interaction with him – he still is. 

My most vivid memory (not just of him but in general) was of him placing bruises all over my mother’s body in the kitchen of our old house after she had given him divorce papers. I remember her breaking the window and screaming out for help.  And I remember standing there, watching, unable to do anything for her. My older sister made it to the phone and called the police and they came to take him away.  The police only held him overnight but by that time we had cleared out and been taken to a battered women’s shelter.  I can’t remember how long we were there – it must have been at least a few months. I watched the 2000 presidential election and spent a Thanksgiving and a Christmas in the shelter.  We were enrolled in a nearby public school and my sisters and I took the bus to and from the shelter. I was ashamed to be picked up and dropped off there – even more so when a boy on the bus pointed out that I was getting off at a shelter for women and the majority of the bus laughed.  My shame was so great that I would spend the weekend dreading going to school and had a routine of being sick on Mondays (sometimes I was actually sick and other times it was an act). I constantly tried to hide, to make myself small, to go unnoticed. I became somewhat of an expert in that aspect so much so that at times I feel that way even today – without even really trying.

When did we leave the shelter? I don’t remember. I know my mother waited until she had a restraining order out against father (currently having issues writing the “D” word – bear with me). We went back to the house. My mom had us stay in the car while she went in to make sure he wasn’t there. That moment was extremely nerve-wracking – once again we were powerless to do anything should anything have happened to her. I later learned she entered the house well armed (you go, mama).

	My timeline is screwed up this point forward and some things are blurry, but I’ve tried to put it back as logically as possible. The restraining order didn’t seem to last that long. Before long, they were legally separated and he got us for weekends. I don’t think I ever felt safe during those weekends. Soon enough, he weaseled his way back into the house. I don’t think mom felt financially stable to take care of 4 girls all on her own. He was decent for a while. But it seems angry people can only hide for so long. Eventually something will trigger them back to their old ways. I’m not sure what the trigger was, but he started drinking, gambling, cursing more, etc. I saw the changes. I saw the anger coming back. Every time I would speak to him, he would put me down and make me feel like I was not good enough. So I did the only thing I could think of to protect myself. I stopped talking to him. I became unresponsive to questions/conversations.  I would wake up hours before him in the mornings to get ready for school and then crawl back into bed when I heard him waking up only to get up again and continue my routine once he left for work.  There were always a few hours after school when he was not there but as soon as I heard him coming home I would go into my room and hide in my closet with a book or magazine or homework and stay there until I knew he was settled on the couch in the living room for the night.

I became his target for anger. If he had a bad day, he would take it out on me – verbally abusing me. He would say things like, “You used to be so smart” or “you’re not a good daughter” or “you should be punished for acting like this,” etc. Even his jokes were jabs at me. He would constantly pick at me just to get a response. I continued my routine of not speaking to him. I would not give him the satisfaction of a response from me. Not even when he made claims that he loved me. I was past the point of loving him. He had done too much, caused too much pain, shown his true colors. He was not going to change. 

His anger at me reached a high point the beginning of the summer before my junior year of high school.  I remember getting up early before anyone else that morning and starting up the computer. Maybe 15 minutes later, I heard him starting to stir in the next room. Instead of going to hide like I usually did, I decided to stay on the computer and continue doing whatever I was doing. He stopped on his walk past me to the restroom, stared at me for a few seconds, and said, “love you.” I didn’t respond. I didn’t believe it. And what happened next proved that I was right. After a few seconds of silence and of me staring pointedly at the computer, I was hit clean out of my chair.  He had punched me in the nose with a closed fist. The disturbance woke my mother and sisters. I spent a few moments in my room crying and then made the decision to leave. I pulled out a suitcase and packed all that I would need for the summer (I had an internship that was starting in a month’s time at NASA). My mother and sisters were crying as I put my things in the car, but they never asked me to stop and stay. I had to get out and they knew it. My dad told me I wouldn’t be able to find a place to go and if I did I would just be a burden on them so I might as well stay. 

I didn’t know where to go from there, so I just went to the local park and sat under a tree for a little while. I had to find a place to stay because there was no way I was going to go back to that. I knew it would only get worse if I allowed him to hit me and then submit to staying under his roof. I watched it happen with my mother. I called a friend and she and her father came to talk to me. They knew an older couple that had a place in the country. I stayed with them for the month I was waiting for the internship to begin. I did everything I could to prevent myself from becoming a burden but they never made me feel like I was a problem. They enjoyed my company and I enjoyed theirs. I wish I could remember their names so I could say thank you to them today. (In my attempts to forget about my past, I suppose I suppressed their names as well – certainly makes me feel guilty).
	
The summer internship passed. I heard from my mom that he was starting to lash out at my older sister. He found a different target while I was gone. I felt guilty and afraid he would do physical harm to my mom and sisters with me gone. When the internship was over, I went back home. Things were “normal” that school year as far as I can remember; it was back to not speaking to hiding when he woke up or got home. The end of the school was approaching when I heard him say something threatening to one of my sisters. I told him that if he did anything to her, I would call the police (something that should have been done many times before).  He went red in the face, stood up quickly, and yelled, “The day you turn 18, get out of my house!” My 18th birthday was less than a week away. I don’t remember how long it was after this that my mom finally gave him papers again. But I know he was finally gone for much of my senior year.
	
There are more memories than these. There were several instances of holes being placed in walls by fists and thrown objects. There were times when my mother was pushed down. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of gambling. There were many instances where I begged my mom to divorce him again. To have someone there so he couldn’t hurt her again. I don’t remember all off it. Bad memories become blurry and out of place when you keep them locked away for too long.
	
My first year of college was pretty good as far as memories go. It wasn’t until my sophomore year that the next terror came in. I hadn’t dated at all during high school or my freshman year and by the beginning of my sophomore year I tried to open myself up to more possibilities. Sadly, the first possibility wasn’t so great. I went to a party hosted by some friends I had met in the dorms. I drank way too much and ended up being followed downstairs by a guy while I was helping friends clean up. I remember him kissing me continuing to follow me around. Not that I minded, someone was actually giving me attention for once. But I felt something was off about him. I begged one of my friends to drive me home so I could get away from him. The next morning I woke to a text from him asking me when we were going to hang out. I didn’t even remember giving him my number. (This would be at least one good reason for why I tend to steer clear of alcohol, kids).  I didn’t oblige at first, but he convinced me to meet him because I had “promised” the night before that we could go out. (I’m currently screaming at myself, “damn, you dumb push-over.”)
	
We saw each other several times. We went on a few dates. I introduced him to my friends and he introduced me to his. But I was clear on one thing with him – I was going to remain a virgin. One night, we were alone in my apartment and put in Hercules (don’t ask why I remember the movie…). He was lying on the couch and I was sitting in the chair next to him. I went to lie down next to him on the couch. The next thing I knew I was being forced down. He held my head back and forced oral sex on me. I was paralyzed with fear. I could do nothing to save myself. He was much stronger than me and if I fought back I was afraid he would do worse to me. So, I let it happen.  Afterwards, he went into my kitchen and started eating my roommate’s food while I cleaned up the mess he had left all over my couch and me. He left soon after that. Again, I’m not sure of the chain of events from this point until we finally cut contact with each other. All I remember was a final text from him, “I’m deleting your number. Enjoy your couch stain.” Needless to say, that was the first and last bit of dating I did for several (3?) years.
	
It may surprise some that this next part is the most painful for me currently. About a year and a half ago, I finally met someone I could be with. I don’t think I can go into too many details without having yet another emotional breakdown. Even now tears are starting to flow.  He quickly learned about all of the aforementioned pains. He was the first and only person who knew all of these things. He was a comfort when they were hurting me and he was the protection and happiness that prevented me from hurting. I’d never loved someone before. I gave him every bit of me. Heart, soul, body…all of it was his. But he was screwed up too. Not even 6 months into our relationship, he cheated on me with one of his friends. I knew he was starting to act strange. Whenever he spoke of his friends he would call them by name but he never said her name to me when he talked about her – she was just “one of my friends.” He started taking more trips to his hometown to visit his friends and many of these trips turned into trips to the town where she lives.  I’m not giving tips to possible cheaters, so don’t ask how I knew. Anyway, none of this proved he had cheated. I called him the night I saw he was in in her hometown to see what was going on, he played dumb saying he had been in his hometown for the day until I told him I saw that he had been in her hometwon. He became frustrated and asked me why I didn’t trust him (btw I learned this was AFTER he had cheated on me that he made me feel guilty for not trusting him). I dropped it for the night, but he was still acting shady in the days that followed. He stayed the night with me and the next morning I gathered the courage to finally find out what was going on. I looked on his phone at the messages he had with her and found out very quickly that he had slept with her.  I woke him up and asked him to be honest with me and asked if he had slept with her. He said no. I showed him the message I found. To day, I wish I had let him run like he tried, it would have saved me a lot more pain. But instead I asked him to stay and explain himself. He told me he had gone into our relationship expecting it to end and that he had never felt like he loved me (despite saying those three words to me almost every day). I found out from her that he had told her we had broken up the night they slept together. We never broke up as far as I knew. His excuse was that he was seeing our relationship in black and white, like it was over before it was actually over. 

I can’t go into the years worth of on again off again rollercoasters we went through after all of this. It was exhausting. I could never trust him and he was unwilling to help me trust again. I wanted so desperately for things to go back to what they had been before he had cheated. I wanted the bliss back of having that person who I loved, who loved me back, who made me happy, who made me feel comfortable and safe.  The rollercoaster was finally too much a few months ago. He instead said that he wanted us to be friends. I accepted this. I couldn’t take the pain of the back and forth. There were periods that we couldn’t be around each other because it was difficult to get over the physical aspects and the feelings we still had. I had several moments where I asked him to leave me alone for a while. Up until the last one he said the same thing, “I understand. I’ll be around when you change your mind.”

He made a promise to be my friend. I was okay with that because I needed that person in my life that knew why all of these parts of me were broken and still accepted me.  But now he doesn’t speak to me. I’ve become wild with finding a way to get him to speak to me. I’ve texted, called, emailed, etc. I’ve even driven to his house on a few occasions in moments where I couldn’t take it anymore. He ignores my very existence. The pain of him cheating and lying to me was nothing compared to losing his friendship. My safe place has been ripped away from me. With him all of the emotions stayed on the surface. They were in clear sight but they were manageable because I knew I had someone who cared for me and understood me. Now that I have opened the door for these pains and he is lost everything is bubbling over. The pain is unstoppable – it bombards me daily. It is scalding hot and a mess. One I cannot seem to clean up. This loss has placed some terrifying thoughts in my head. If I’ve lost him, what is stopping me from losing the next one who comes along? This is the fear that had driven me the past few months to try every way I can think to get him (not him, but that protective figure) to come back around.  Every attempt is a disappointment that leads to even more terrifying thoughts. I’ve thought of cutting myself, hanging myself, overdosing on pills, driving my car into a body of water or a tree, etc.

I cannot have a place of safety in someone who does not care for me.  I’ve wanted to crawl back into myself. I want to hide it all away. But clearly, hiding is no longer the answer. I need the people in my life to understand what I am going through. I need to stop hiding. I need to get better. The answer is not to confide in just one person or to confide in only myself. It is to confide in all. I’m showing the hand I’m playing with, terrifying as that is.
I’ll focus on what I do have. I have a wonderful mom, sisters, stepfather, stepbrothers, and other relatives. I have the best roommate and friend I could ask for – I know I’ve been worrying/frustrating you lately. I have friends both near and far – at work, school, here, back home, and scattered throughout the country. I have a wonderful guy I am dating. I’ve been afraid of getting close to you for fear that I would only lose again. This is an attempt to prevent the fear of loss from holding power over me any longer.  I am smart and capable. My Master’s degree is coming along and I am able to continue learning. I may have had difficultly keeping focus this semester due to everything that is going on in me, but I know I can finish and do well with it. I have a wonderful future ahead (wherever/whatever that may be) and I will continue working toward it.

TL;DR - dealt with mental and physical abuse from my father, rape, cheating boyfriend, loss of loved ones - won't deal with it myself anymore.

Most proficient language is C++, as its what was taught at university.  With the knowledge gained in the course new languages could be picked up quickly.  Familiar with Python, Javascript, Java, HTML5, CSS, Git, Bootstrap, QT, CMake, and few others.  Very confident in my knowledge of the underlying concepts of CS, particularly OOP.  

My interest about the technical side of computers and how they worked began at an early age, 7th grade.  Gifted books on Linux, HTML, and Visual Basic by my grandfather who was a programmer at honeywell, I followed the books step by step, created the sample programs, and got familiar with the concepts.  Triple booting my Macintosh in 9th grade, writing small programs to automate homework tasks.  I created websites to access content, games, and proxy servers that my school banned.  That familiarity and the knowledge gained through high school helped me excel in my college courses, receiving an A in both CS1 and CS2.  Many of my peers would ask me to tutor them, which helped solidify all the concepts.  

I’ve always prided myself on how I approach problems.  Many people tend to think in one way but i’ve always seen them from many angles, which help me solve them better and faster than committing to one way.  I love puzzles and get extremely dedicated - borderline obsessed - with solving a problem after its been started. 

I have a resume ready to go but would rather not post it publicly on reddit.  Please PM with me for a copy or to ask any question, technical or personal.  

I would love to relocate somewhere beautiful, preferably the west coast, but everything will be considered.  I love to code but would also consider any position in the field.  I feel I would bring a great young energy to your team.  I am an easy going guy and love new experiences! "

After 4 years of smoking weed, with only a single tolerance break of 2 months (taken after my first year of smoking, had an internship that I wasn't sure would drug test me or not - they didn't so I started again &gt;.&gt;) I have come to the decision that it is time to me to give up my favorite thing to do in this world - taking dabs.

I started smoking weed first, but after that previously mentioned tolerance break failed to really increase the intensity/length of my high, I started to dab. The thing is, I don't regret starting to smoke weed. In fact, at the time I started, I'm pretty sure weed is the only thing that made me become less oblivious to the outside world and helped me step out of my box. After a certain point, however, I feel that I've developed an addiction to it.

As I stated previously, I dab. For those who aren't in a medical state,  Dabing involves smoking concentrated THC on a hot nail. It's odor-free (it smells but goes away in 5min and doesn't stick to cloths/walls) and super intense, jam packed with 80%+ THC. I am a secret stoner because of dabs. I smoke more than any fucking stoner in my dorms who's gotten written up for smoking their stupid bong indoor 11 times... I'm that good. I've become a stoner ninja almost. At this point, I smoke about a gram a day. If I could, I would smoke more. But being in a dorm limits that, not to mentions I'm in school and can't study with scrambled brains.

My problem is that I'm a pretty successful successful stoner, but because I choose to use weed as a crutch for my life, I end up missing out of big opportunities. I always end up settling for doing ok instead of holding myself to the same standard I once did, before I developed my addiction, because I'd rather be too stoned to function than take job opportunities or do better in school. Again, not saying I'm a failure or anything and I don't feel like one (had 2 internships at 2 start-ups), but I just limit myself by taking a dab instead of using that time of review for a final, or taking  dab instead of finishing this HW that's due at 12:00AM but now I'm too high so I take a nap and fuck up... or maybe send out a resume, but nope too stoned... need to take a dab to even myself out...

I don't want to continues buying a gram everyday and telling myself, ""Ok, this is the day. Today we quit for good!"" and then running to the club the next morning(skipping class to do so) and getting high to consul myself for fucking up... My problem is those first days. How do you make the emotions stop? How do you make the flashing of all our life's choices while trying not to think about dabing? It's not like it consumes your day completely, but just distracts you enough to ruin it. Also, it's literally all i've grown to love. Losing weed is going to be like loosing a friend, as sad as that may sound to some.

But I recognize that it's time to make a change. I just need help doing so. I'm not sure where to begin or what to do instead of dabing. I'm mostly scared because I don't know how to deal with my emotional issues in any way other than weed anymore, and it'll be hard to relearn (and for some emotions, learn for the first time.) I smoked from 18-22, some of the most important developmental years for people. Hopefully I didn't mess myself up forever, but I really want this brain lag to go away and the fuzzieness to clear.

Any advice would really help. Also, I have my bong and such, still wax left also. I'm so tempted to finish it but feel too guilty at the same time.

35o1a4,6,2015-05-11,Should I take my bike or rent? Summer Internship in NJ/NY,jpimntl,cycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/35o1a4/should_i_take_my_bike_or_rent_summer_internship/,"Hello to all, 

I'll be an intern this summer at an accounting firm in NY and Will be living in NJ. 

I'm still debating myself on if I should take my bike or should I rent one. 

Considering these expenses:
I don't own a bike bag, Would need to buy one or go to my LBS so they pack it in a box
I live in Puerto Rico, So I would need to pay the airline fee twice (round trip)
I for sure would need to take it to a LBS in NJ/NY so they put it back together cause I don't know how to. 

Some friends have told me to rent a bike and just take my shoes/helmet/gloves, etc. 

But what is the price of renting vs taking my bike?
For sure I won't have huge amounts of time for biking. 

Should I join a spinning gym? Someone mentioned flying wheels or something like that. (Any suggestions welcomed)

I just want to make sure I stay in shape as much as possible and not be 2 months without riding at all. 

Thanks. "

35oeko,4,2015-05-12,TIFU An Unpaid Internship,throwaway_sfr1986,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/35oeko/tifu_an_unpaid_internship/,"This still weighs heavily on me, and I live in a small U.S. state where everybody knows everybody, so I want to vent this out in private.

I had fucked up an unpaid internship with the state parks department during the summer of 2014. I had a internship with a museum that focused on 19th century interpretation. I was in the background, working in the archives.

One day, I decided to go to the museum. I made a remark about something the interpreters were eating for lunch. I was curious about what I saw there, because I didn't know they had that food item for the time period. (The museum has a period kitchen that actually works.) One woman got very offended, and it snowballed into an almost-fight. Not quite there, but very tense. She felt like I was being rude to her by questioning what she had, while I was mad because I felt like she was being rude to me because I was genuinely curious about the history of food. It's not something I've studied. But in any event, I should've handled that better.

The directory of my internship basically ""fired"" me (I was never an actual employee) over the phone two weeks later. No one ever approached me about it. He didn't just vacate me from the internship- he made some incredible personal remarks to me. See, I was a volunteer at the same museum 10 years ago, when I was in high school. I got bounced because they thought I was distractedly rude and disruptive to the interpreters. But in the mean time, I had undergone four successful internships, so that's what I put on my resume, not my high school volunteer work from a decade ago. 

But he basically called me a liar for not bringing this up (even though, again, it was high school), and then he brought up all this various gossip that people have had about me going back to say 2004-2007. He then kept repeatedly telling me that I have a bad pattern of behavior that I keep repeating, and told me that people find me ""off putting"" and ""creepy"". 

It was batshit insane how he went off on me, especially because the guy was going off of second-hand gossip from memories that were a decade old when I was in HIGH SCHOOL that he wasn't around for, and the feeling was that because I ""harassed the volunteers"" that day it meant that I was same ol' me, i.e. basically the Devil.  

Then he basically told me all these complaints that my supervisor had for me- that I thought I was too good for the internship, that I rolled my eyes at having to do basic tasks, and that I wasn't working hard enough. This after I had basically cleaned from top to bottom the entire archives, wrote a 12-page cleaning manual for said archives, handcounted 5000 slides, etc. My supervisor was a nice chick to my face, but apparently couldn't tell me that she wasn't happy with my performance because she said maybe three critical comments to my face the entire time I was there.

Then he basically told me that ""my reputation"" proceeds me, and that it's a small job field in a small state, and since then I've basically felt like the only way I can do anything professionally in my field I have to leave the state. I'm essentially blacklisted by the state parks department.

Since then I've volunteered with a small historical society to keep my degree relevant, while working odd jobs to pay the bills. I'm actually pretty well-loved by them, and they trust me enough to have a key and open and close the museum. 

As for ""lessons"", I think the biggest thing I took from this is that I was pretty arrogant going into this. I thought that because I had 4 successful internships, this would be a piece of cake, and I also thought they wanted my feedback about how things could be run because I did have some very positive volunteer/intern experience. I also thought that because my original fuck-up with the museum was ancient history- 10 years ago- they were over it, and I was VERY much wrong, and I got the feeling that the administration felt like I had ""conned"" my way into the internship and were therefore looking for any kind of slip-up to justify ""canning"" me. Finally, at the end of the day, if you feel a co-worker is being rude to you, don't be defensive and rude back and just walk away.

In hindsight, it was just an unpaid internship...but it does mean that I can't get considered for any position in the State Parks department, and I feel paranoid that if I try to apply for a position in a department that's related to State Parks and this director finds out about it, he'll try to talk them out of hiring me.

I'm upset about it still, but I feel like I got some pretty good lessons out of it. It's made me much less trusting of people, though.

35oj32,1,2015-05-12,My new job isn't what I expected.,Telulu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/35oj32/my_new_job_isnt_what_i_expected/,"Some background- I just started my first fulltime job. The way this company's computer department works is you interview you and if they hire you, they decide which team to put you on after they clear you. (As opposed to applying for a DB Admin position or Web Developer position specifically.)

My resume includes various mobile apps, usability studies, and interactive technology. In a placement meeting, I spoke with a member of the mobile team who seemed to like me enough to 
give me his contact info. I was pretty happy but didn't hear anything about my placement after that. 

When I walked in my first day, I expected to be somewhere on that mobile team. (""They were the only team 
I spoke with so where else would I go?"" is what I thought.) Instead they put me on a database project. 

While I did study basic database stuff and worked a little with some on my internships, it was not something I took interest 
in or looked into further. I don't know what it was that screamed database on my resume and in my interviews, but I'm afraid it's so out of my comfort zone and skill set that I'll do a bad job. I just got sucked into a lease and have school loans to pay 
off, so quitting is not an option for me. 

I feel self-conscious talking to my manager and mentor about it because a) they don't know anything about me and my resume (and have told me as such) and b) apparently I'm replacing 
someone who left in a hurry and they ""really need me to fill in for him,"" so I feel guilty for even having these thoughts.

I also have reason to believe I was already placed on this team even before my placement meeting (completely defeating the purpose of the meeting imo.)

tl;dr- New job, placed on team I don't know much about and don't think I'm suited for, afraid I'll do poorly, current team 
was short a member and I'm expected to fill some big shoes = guilt trip

So my plea for advice- Should I talk to HR who arranged the placement meeting and see what happened about that meeting? Or talk with my manager? Should I contact the mobile guy to let him know that I still have an interest in his team? Should I just suck it up, stop whining, and settle with my position because ""it's a job"" and I really need it?"

However, I'd love to experience the full range of local cuisine along the way, and I prefer to get recommendations from locals rather than Yelp!

Breakfast will probably be whatever we snag at the motel or dinner leftovers (I'm not a big breakfast person anyways). So I'm looking for lunch recommendations in between cities (and coffee too-- I'm a total coffee fiend), and dinner recommendations at the end points.

Day 1: California (Bay Area) to Salt Lake City. This is the longest drive (approx. 10.5 hours) so my buddy and I will be pretty tired and probably famished by the time we arrive. We plan to just eat whatever's in the cooler for breakfast/lunch/snacks, and only stop for occasional stretch breaks. I have no idea what Salt Lake City cuisine is supposed to be...

Day 2: Salt Lake City to Denver. 8 hour drive, probably will take Highway 80. Lunch somewhere in between. I assume Denver has some good breweries.

Day 3: Denver to Kansas City, taking Highway 70. 9 hour drive. I've heard good things about Oklahoma Joe's for BBQ.

Day 4: Kansas City to Louisville, passing through St. Louis (lunch.. more BBQ?). 9 hour drive. Might or might not be tired of BBQ by the time dinner rolls around.

Day 5: Louisville to Charlottesville. 9 hours. Major city along the way seems to be Charleston.

I have absolutely no professional experience other than a few internships I've completed during college. To be completely honest, I'm not very confident in my technical interview skills, or my GPA, but the company really liked my passion and drive. I don't want to divulge too much information, but I can tell you that the position is located in Southern California. The research I've done is a little all over the place in terms of median salary for my experience and position, and I'm not sure how to really interpret it. I'll be living at home for a couple of years so the salary seems reasonable to me, seeing as I'll be getting some much needed experience in the field. I'm also young, single, and have no kids. I really like the other aspects of the company in terms of health insurance, paid time off, work/life balance etc... 

I really like what the company has to offer, and I feel it's a place I can get some much needed experience from, and grow as a developer. I'm eager to learn more about their framework and work with the primary language they use.  Is it naive of me to think I can just take the offer at possibly a little less than market rate, gain as much experience as possible, and then move on if I'm unhappy? I'm leaning towards accepting it and getting down to business, but I wanted advice from some of you more experienced programmers. I would appreciate any insight!"

I am looking at a career in finance and am in need of a lot of advice on the path I should take.

Background: I am from a city in South India, finished my schooling studying Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and Math. After this I graduated with a BA in Corporate Economics from a fairly well reputed university. Throughout I have excellent scores in math, statistics and econometrics (average of 99%) and an overall score of 8.2/10. I was ranked third in my uni. 

I went on to do an internship for a year with EY in corporate tax consulting. I was pretty good, worked directly with my senior manager and learnt a lot. 

Since my BA was not much I started doing Cost and Management Accounting from the Institute in India, which I later realised was a fairly misguided choice. However, I didn't ditch it, and am scheduled to complete this June. My experience makes me fairly sure I will finish.

In the mean time, I had to move to Dubai last year and have had NO LUCK finding a job. I am now doing my ACCA as my CMA is hardly valued here. 6 papers down, 8 to go. Cleared everything so far in one attempt so hopefully I will stay on track and finish in 3 more exam terms.

Since my move here (due to family reasons) I have had NO LUCK finding a job. I have recently interviewed at 2 big national banks for risk analyst/ data analyst positions, cleared technical interviews and then been told I didn't get approved by senior management due to lack of experience. 

My problems are just that I have not much experience and more importantly ZERO contacts. Its very brutal for people in my place here with an Indian passport. I have been told this on my face. 

I need a network. For this reason, I would like to go to a really good school. I also went to a well rated but shitty school back in India (All other qualifications have come/will come through studying from home) and really really would like to experience what it is like to go to a really good school and build a network. 

Since I don't have the experience for an MBA, and am very good at math, I am looking at Masters in Finance, Business Analytics, Risk Management, etc. And ideally 1 year courses. I would like to look at schools in the UK and have short listed the following. 

LSE, LBS, Oxford, Bath, Warwick, Manchester.

My CV I would like to think is fairly good - lot of volunteer work, excellent grades, lot of extra curricular activities. I will take the GMAT and go forward only if I score around 700. 

My questions:

1. Is this a good idea? Aside from the qualitative reason that would like the experience once in my life of going to a good school. Or is it so stupid, that I somehow get a job, stick to it for a few years and then do an MBA.

2. Any schools I have missed? In the UK.

3. As someone with an Indian passport, from Dubai, would it be likely that I can land a job post graduation there? Assuming I do really well in the course and complete my ACCA by then? Also would the starting salary be enough to support my SO until he finds a job. (Hoping it won't be too bad as he did his masters there and has a good job here now so he will be experienced, but thinking worst case here.)

I know the usual question here is what my goal is, but the problem is Im not restricted to one specific thing as I haven't seen everything there is. I was good at tax consulting, I've done a little internal control and liked it. But I am leaning towards risk management and audit type of work.

In the mean time, yes Im still looking for jobs, even internships.

Thanks a lot in advance."

So, can anyone suggest me some IT companies list which take students as an intern. I tried googling it but I thought getting answers directly from people of Japan would be better than mere googling it.

I went through a series of interviews with this recruiter, then with their client -- finally, last week, I had a series of face-to-face interviews, on-site, with the client.

Now, the recruiter has been calling me back several times, with the assumption that if the job is offered to me, I will take it. I said *I will have to think about it*, and they seemed really put off, to the point where it was uncomfortable on the phone. 

On my end -- this job isn't exactly what I want to be doing, but it is a company I would like to work for, in the geographic area I want to live in. And I still really don't know if I will take the job if offered. I am worried I am came off, to the recruiter, in our conversations, as if I would take the job, for sure. But when I pushed back on that, as I said above, it seemed like they were very taken aback. 

So -- how do I deal with this, exactly? I tried to leave at...*If the salary is right, I will take it...*, but I'm not even sure that is really true. I just got flustered on our last call, because, in my opinion (and I have been working in the defense industry, with former military/current Service members and have been brow-beaten, yelled at, and raked back and forth over the coals), the recruiter was really putting pressure on me to make a split-second decision and wasn't  giving me any time to think.

I worked in a merchandise location, but for the sake of discretion I won’t say which one. The buzz of the lighting was getting on my nerves and the faint sound of jeopardy on the break room tv was not helping. The uncomfortable booth was dirty when I sat down, and if I hadn’t cleaned it off, it would still be covered in trash. As I sat there, (not really) enjoying my short break, I began to wonder if that hot maintenance guy had seen me. 
For the past 6 months, I had been eyeing this maintenance guy and I still didn’t know his name. But, I didn’t need to know, looking at him had been enough. His tall and sturdy body was almost reminiscent of “dad” body (if not for the definition of his arm and chest muscles), but that was all the better in my opinion. My time in Florida was about to be over and I had been hoping to casually bump into this mystery maintenance guy to, well, live a little. Just thinking about his thick forearms and big hands already had my imagination wandering away with itself. I had given him a lot of thought over the past few months and was familiar with the road I was going down. Although I had been trying to flirt with him for months, I wasn’t sure if it was sinking in, he always seemed interested, always flirted back, but had never given me his number. I assumed he was married. Not many guys are this hard to get for me. My long brown hair, slender frame and bubble butt made it easy for me to get who I wanted. Granted I did wear a pretty baggy costume (that’s a Disney term for uniform), but that was because my tits are pretty big (we are talking 36DDD) so, the only costumes that fit me were huge. Come to think of it, he couldn’t see any of my physical features under here. I started to think that maybe if he knew, maybe then… 
I heard footsteps approaching and opened my big green eyes. There he was, just standing in front of me, package at eye level. I could see the outline of his cock in his pants. I felt my heart speed up and my mouth started to water. As my eyes traveled up his body, I wondered (for the millionth time) what his costume was hiding. The top buttons were undone and a few chest hairs were showing. His big eyes looked…flirtatious. With a half smirk on his face, he handed me a piece of paper. I didn’t think it was real but I had to accept that it was. Written on the paper was his phone number and it said “text me, now, if you want to have some fun.” I immediately ran my fingers through my long dark brown hair and bit my lip a little. I wasn’t sure what to do, although I knew I wanted to. 
Minutes later, I was walking to a small electrical closet by the employee entrance. As far as I knew, that little room wasn’t even there until he suggested it. I checked over my shoulder to make sure nobody was watching me approach the door. As soon as I touched the door, he pulled it open and pulled me in. The room was larger than I had imagined it would be and much hotter! His shirt was already unbuttoned as he pressed me into the door. I pushed back on his chest and could feel the already forming beads of sweat on him. I slid my hand down his chest and stomach, pleased to find a trail of hair, undoubtedly leading exactly where I wanted to be. He grabbed my hips and gasped feeling my waistline. I moved to grind my hips into him. His hands moved across my body and unbuttoned my shirt. My pussy started throbbing as he exposed my body. His eyes got dark, animalistic. Pure need. My body began trembling as he unhooked my lacey blue bra. He buried his face in my titties. As he sucked licked at my nipples I reached down and stroked his cock. It was way bigger than I had imagined and I could feel myself getting wetter and wetter. I unbuckled his belt and started to pull his dick out. Suddenly he pulled me off of him and flipped me over. Before I could register what was happening my pants were around my knees and I was bent over. I could feel him teasing me with his cock about to be inside me. He pushed his dick into me, really slowly listening to my moan. He did it again, a little faster, and then again faster and faster. “Baby, you’re so tight,” he said as he humped me hard. It was true, he was huge, and I was surprised he even fit in me. I was moaning, damn near yelling. All of a sudden he clamped his hand over my mouth. Someone was coming down the hallway. I froze, terrified and so turned on I could barely breathe. Loud music began playing and he started fucking me again, smacking my big round ass. He leaned in and told me what a dirty slut I was. Normally, I would have been pissed but I was so horny I moaned and felt my orgasm building. His hand still clamped over my mouth I finished. I turned around and sank to my knees. Taking him into my mouth and sucking. Tasting myself all over him was so hot.I started coming again and then I could feel his building. His muscles tensing and cock throbbing in my mouth, he came. With a load grunt, thick ropes of cum coated my mouth, and spilled down onto my tits. I swallowed and stood up. I checked my watch and saw my break was over in 2 minutes, I had to get out of there, but I was covered in his fluid and I could feel mine leaking down my leg. I quickly removed my panties and cleaned myself up, storing my come soaked panties in my pocket until I could get to my purse, I buttoned my shirt up and opened the door. And on my way out he said, “I guess Disney is where Dreams Come True. Same time tomorrow?” I turned back to him and replied, “ Anything you cock desires.”"

1. I was wondering if anyone here from NYC that can tell me more about the data science scene there. I'm really looking into finance of things rather than the technology. Perhaps use data science as strategic way of research and analysis. I'm still in undergrad, and I was wondering if they provide lots of internships there. I can't think of any other place than NYC for finance data science. SF,LA,SD,Boston,? Maybe Chicago but I'm still not familiar with that scene.  
2.How do I get my masters paid for? I know most data science jobs need masters or phd, and I don' get why people would do that without even getting the experience. That's why I'm a little worried by internships as I plan to make it into a full time job through internship. Do companies pay for your Data Science education? I know some are offered online i.e. Berkeley. So it maybe a good investment just to intern at one specific company that I like for a long time. I don't know if I want to get a PhD at all to be honest. Well, at least not for awhile. Thanks guys for the inputs! "

35pv3i,5,2015-05-12,Seeking advice on career in statistics.,statstu83,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/35pv3i/seeking_advice_on_career_in_statistics/,"Greetings. I am US based. I want to change my career (from pure computer science to computer science+statistics). I have a masters degree in CS and few years work experience. I’d like to get a masters degree in statistics. And then I’d like to get a job in a 100% statistics domain, analyzing data and programming in R/SAS/python etc. I am open to any statistics industry and jobs anywhere in united states.

NOTE 1 - I am not looking for CS jobs. I am looking for jobs in data science and statistics - which almost always require MS in statistics (or higher).

NOTE 2 - I’d like to pursue MS in statistics not a phd in statistics.
So purely from the perspective of getting called for a job interviews after getting my MS in statistics, here are a few questions:

Question 1 - if you are the hiring manager, would you select me for an interview if you see this job applicant profile - someone who wants to switch their career to statistics and who has zero professional work experience in statistics and who has strong computer science, programming background, and a newly minted masters degree in statistics. If you absolutely must have work experience in statistics, how do i go about getting a job in statistics without any degree in statistics? Does a summer internship (during masters) count towards work experience in statistics? Does teaching assistant, research assistant work at university count towards work experience in statistics?

Question 2 - if the job ad does not explicitly state it, does it matter if my MS statistics program was not from top 20 universities? - I am not applying to the top 20 schools because of their extremely low student acceptance percentages (some top schools have percentages as low as 2% and 3% - yikes!).

Question 3 - Do you know any specific graduate statistics programs to avoid based on their coursework/bad past experiences? i.e too “theoretical” or “outdated” or “ill-equipped computer labs” etc? I looked on yelp and found some general reviews, but unfortunately not a single one was specific to masters statistics programs.

Question 4 - I trust reddit more than job websites when it comes to salaries. Would like to know the average base salary for a fresh MS statistics grad in the following regions in united states: 
northeast - 
northwest and CA - 
south and FL - 
midwest - 
mid-atlantic and NC -

And finally... Question 5 - What are some of the best companies to begin your career in statistics, where one would get to learn the most (on the job learning), and be surrounded by good ""mentoring"" co-workers and managers?

I’d very much appreciate your advice and candid answers to these questions. Thanks very much."

I had not planned on making any public statement on the matter, fearing that doing so would only throw fuel on the fire.  Unfortunately, I’m not longer sure that is a viable option.  Assuming that Magic authors may make a point to talk about my circumstances over the coming days, I feel compelled to make some sort of statement on the matter.  


For those unaware of what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the following:


This weekend, I made the top 8 of Grand Prix Atlantic City.  At some point near the start of the top 8, Drew Levin, ostensibly driven by a motive to promote public safety, used Twitter to highlight my criminal history.

You can find the article here: http://www.readthehook.com/95057/news-uva-rape-case-student-accepts-lesser-charge


Before I get to what I hope to accomplish with this post, I am going to take a moment to stress what it is not intended to accomplish.


The purpose of this post is not to dismiss or minimize my conviction in particular, nor is it to downplay sexual assault in general.  For this reason, I do not plan on discussing in any depth or detail any aspect of the circumstances that surround the original incident. 


The purpose of this post is not to act as an AMA (or “Ask Me Anything” to those unversed in Reddit-ese).  I will not be answering questions or otherwise contributing to the commentary below.  I’ll be frank; unless I am strongly urged to do so by my friends, it is unlikely that I will return to this thread to read the comments at all.  


The purpose of this thread is not to get you to like me.  Don’t get me wrong.  If that happens, that is wonderful.  Ultimately, however, if you remain unmoved, so be it.  That is your prerogative.  


What, then, is this post intended to accomplish?  



The purposes of thread are two-fold.  


First and foremost, I hope to address the sole connection that I have heard people make between my conviction and my participation in Magic: the Gathering events: the issue of public safety.  To that end, the only way thing that I can think to do is to discuss the positive strides that I have tried to make over the past decade of my life.  These statements, because they are inherently self-congratulatory, will likely come across as across as those of a braggart.  If that irks or offends you, I apologize.  I will try to be brief, but be forewarned.


Second, I have seen some misinformation bandied about, both by supporters and detractors, in the various forums in which people are discussing my circumstances.  I will try to bury these mistakes if I can with more accurate information.

___________________________________________________________________________


I was 18 (very close to 19) in August of 2003 when the underlying incident occurred.  In April of 2004, I accepted a plea bargain offered by the prosecutor in this case.  I had rejected his previous offers; however, I ultimately accepted this offer at the advice of my attorney who encouraged me to do so in order to mitigate the risk that my charges entailed.  After having focused on criminal law in law school, I am profoundly thankful for this advice.


The plea deal entailed pleading guilty to aggravated sexual battery and serving three months of an eight-year sentence.  Its start date was delayed to allow me to finish my semester at UVA.  The sentence also allowed me to serve my time in a work release program so that I could continue the internship that I had been preparing for months.  


In May of 2009, I met my future wife.  We have been together ever since and happily married since December of 2011.


In 2011, I applied to law school.  Perhaps I was (and still am) naïve, but this vocation felt poetic.  I ultimately decided to attend the University of Richmond.  I had written my application on my conviction, how it had affected me, and how I meant to use it as a stepping stone to better myself and the community around me rather than a ball-and-chain.  

Based on my application, the University of Richmond offered me their John Marshall Scholarship, a merit-based scholarship that covered almost all of the tuition required to attend.  This decision by the school proved to rile people in much the same way that my current existence is riling people in the Magic community.  You can read about the school newspaper covering the issue here: http://www.thecollegianur.com/article/2013/11/richmond-law-school-set-graduate-registered-sex-offender.  You can read a response to the original article by a law student here: http://www.thecollegianur.com/article/2013/11/law-student-responds-collegian-coverage-zachary-jesse.


I won’t tout most accomplishments that I had while at law school as they don’t seem particularly germane.  For those that read either article and had questions on how I became justice on my school’s Honor Council, the answer is that I was voted on by my peers in two separate elections.  


In 2012, at the suggestion of my summer employer after my first year, I applied to have my civil rights restored.  This process, at the time, required an extensive application.  That request was granted in 2013 by then-governor McDonnell, ironically.


Since and during law school, I have tried to live up to the promises that I wrote about in my law school admissions essay.  I logged approximately 100 hours of community service and pro bono volunteerism while at school.  


I currently devote about 30-40 hours a week giving back to my community.  Once a week I help sort incoming donations at a local organization that helps homeless people in the Richmond area reenter society.  I spend another 30+ hours a week volunteering my time at two legal aid offices that provide legal assistance to people that fall below the poverty line.  Because of my longtime involvement with my local neighborhood board, I was approached by members of said group who asked that I fill a vacancy.  I currently serve as secretary for the board, am the neighborhood liaison with the local university (VCU), and head a task force designed to beautify our neighborhood.  


One misconception that I have seen bandied about is that I am a member of the Virginia State Bar.  This is not quite accurate.  I have taken, and passed, the written portion of the Virginia Bar Exam.  In December of 2014, I had a hearing before the Virginia Character and Fitness Committee to determine whether I possessed the requisite good character to practice law in the state of Virginia.  Based on my community involvement and scholastic achievements in law school, the C&amp;F Committee did not deny my admission; however, they also did not immediately approve it, asking that I return in six months to give them time to reassess.  I’m not sure as to whether it affected their decision or not, but my hearing occurred literally days after the notorious and now-debunked Rolling Stone article about rape culture at UVA (For those curious, no, I was not mentioned in this article). 


There have been some murmurs that I have tried to hide my conviction somehow.  Even presuming this were possible, this could not be further from the truth.  I inform the people that need to know, as uncomfortable as that may be sometimes.  When law schools asked for additional information on the incident, I disclosed as much factual information as I could.  I told my wife about my conviction on our second date.  I inform not only potential employers, but also the various groups that I volunteer.  This includes MTGCardMarket, the company whose shirt that I wear at events, and who have been very supportive throughout this entire process.  I am not perfect, but by and large I ensure that I tell the people that need to know.


I have written this to hopefully convey that I have attempted to make amends by giving back.  If you chose to continue to dislike me, feel free to do so.  If you’d like to shun or vilify me, I can’t stop you.  I will continue to do what I am doing.


Finally, to more squarely address the ultimate issue: I do not believe that there has ever been an allegation of sexual impropriety levied against me at any Magic: the Gathering related event.  To those of you that feel unsafe, I can sympathize.  Understand though that I am allowed to go to concerts, to ride down bike trails, to otherwise interact with people on a daily basis in the outside world, just as other people with my criminal stigma are allowed to do.  Since my conviction in 2004, my most serious run in with the law has been receiving a speeding ticket in 2006 and a ticket for an illegal U-turn in 2014.  


Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Second, I have seen some misinformation bandied about, both by supporters and detractors, in the various forums in which people are discussing my circumstances.  I will try to bury these mistakes if I can with more accurate information.

___________________________________________________________________________


I was 18 (very close to 19) in August of 2003 when the underlying incident occurred.  In April of 2004, I accepted a plea bargain offered by the prosecutor in this case.  I had rejected his previous offers; however, I ultimately accepted this offer at the advice of my attorney who encouraged me to do so in order to mitigate the risk that my charges entailed.  After having focused on criminal law in law school, I am profoundly thankful for this advice.


The plea deal entailed pleading guilty to aggravated sexual battery and serving three months of an eight-year sentence.  Its start date was delayed to allow me to finish my semester at UVA.  The sentence also allowed me to serve my time in a work release program so that I could continue the internship that I had been preparing for months.  


In May of 2009, I met my future wife.  We have been together ever since and happily married since December of 2011.


In 2011, I applied to law school.  Perhaps I was (and still am) naïve, but this vocation felt poetic.  I ultimately decided to attend the University of Richmond.  I had written my application on my conviction, how it had affected me, and how I meant to use it as a stepping stone to better myself and the community around me rather than a ball-and-chain.  

Based on my application, the University of Richmond offered me their John Marshall Scholarship, a merit-based scholarship that covered almost all of the tuition required to attend.  This decision by the school proved to rile people in much the same way that my current existence is riling people in the Magic community.  You can read about the school newspaper covering the issue here: http://www.thecollegianur.com/article/2013/11/richmond-law-school-set-graduate-registered-sex-offender.

I won’t tout most accomplishments that I had while at law school as they don’t seem particularly germane.  For those that read either article and had questions on how I became justice on my school’s Honor Council, the answer is that I was voted on by my peers in two separate elections.  


In 2012, at the suggestion of my summer employer after my first year, I applied to have my civil rights restored.  This process, at the time, required an extensive application.  That request was granted in 2013 by then-governor McDonnell, ironically.


Since and during law school, I have tried to live up to the promises that I wrote about in my law school admissions essay.  I logged approximately 100 hours of community service and pro bono volunteerism while at school.  


I currently devote about 30-40 hours a week giving back to my community.  Once a week I help sort incoming donations at a local organization that helps homeless people in the Richmond area reenter society.  I spend another 30+ hours a week volunteering my time at two legal aid offices that provide legal assistance to people that fall below the poverty line.  Because of my longtime involvement with my local neighborhood board, I was approached by members of said group who asked that I fill a vacancy.  I currently serve as secretary for the board, am the neighborhood liaison with the local university (VCU), and head a task force designed to beautify our neighborhood.  


One misconception that I have seen bandied about is that I am a member of the Virginia State Bar.  This is not quite accurate.  I have taken, and passed, the written portion of the Virginia Bar Exam.  In December of 2014, I had a hearing before the Virginia Character and Fitness Committee to determine whether I possessed the requisite good character to practice law in the state of Virginia.  Based on my community involvement and scholastic achievements in law school, the C&amp;F Committee did not deny my admission; however, they also did not immediately approve it, asking that I return in six months to give them time to reassess.  I’m not sure as to whether it affected their decision or not, but my hearing occurred literally days after the notorious and now-debunked Rolling Stone article about rape culture at UVA (For those curious, no, I was not mentioned in this article). 


There have been some murmurs that I have tried to hide my conviction somehow.  Even presuming this were possible, this could not be further from the truth.  I inform the people that need to know, as uncomfortable as that may be sometimes.  When law schools asked for additional information on the incident, I disclosed as much factual information as I could.  I told my wife about my conviction on our second date.  I inform not only potential employers, but also the various groups that I volunteer.  This includes MTGCardMarket, the company whose shirt that I wear at events, and who have been very supportive throughout this entire process.  I am not perfect, but by and large I ensure that I tell the people that need to know.


I have written this to hopefully convey that I have attempted to make amends by giving back.  If you chose to continue to dislike me, feel free to do so.  If you’d like to shun or vilify me, I can’t stop you.  I will continue to do what I am doing.


Finally, to more squarely address the ultimate issue: I do not believe that there has ever been an allegation of sexual impropriety levied against me at any Magic: the Gathering related event.  To those of you that feel unsafe, I can sympathize.  Understand though that I am allowed to go to concerts, to ride down bike trails, to otherwise interact with people on a daily basis in the outside world, just as other people with my criminal stigma are allowed to do.  Since my conviction in 2004, my most serious run in with the law has been receiving a speeding ticket in 2006 and a ticket for an illegal U-turn in 2014.

35q0yx,1371,2015-05-12,In light of recent discussion: a post by Zach Jesse,ZachJesse,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/,"I had originally hoped that issues concerning me would not become as viral as they clearly have.  I had not planned on making any public statement on the matter, fearing that doing so would only throw fuel on the fire.  Unfortunately, I’m not longer sure that is a viable option.  Assuming that Magic authors may make a point to talk about my circumstances over the coming days, I feel compelled to make some sort of statement on the matter.  


For those unaware of what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the following:


This weekend, I made the top 8 of Grand Prix Atlantic City.  At some point near the start of the top 8, Drew Levin, ostensibly driven by a motive to promote public safety, used Twitter to highlight my criminal history.  Specifically, he cited to an article by The Hook, a periodical local to Charlottesville, Virginia, which discusses a plea that I took in 2004 to aggravated sexual battery when I was 19 years old.  You can find the article here: http://www.readthehook.com/95057/news-uva-rape-case-student-accepts-lesser-charge


Before I get to what I hope to accomplish with this post, I am going to take a moment to stress what it is not intended to accomplish.


The purpose of this post is not to dismiss or minimize my conviction in particular, nor is it to downplay sexual assault in general.  For this reason, I do not plan on discussing in any depth or detail any aspect of the circumstances that surround the original incident. 


The purpose of this post is not to act as an AMA (or “Ask Me Anything” to those unversed in Reddit-ese).  I will not be answering questions or otherwise contributing to the commentary below.  I’ll be frank; unless I am strongly urged to do so by my friends, it is unlikely that I will return to this thread to read the comments at all.  


The purpose of this thread is not to get you to like me.  Don’t get me wrong.  If that happens, that is wonderful.  Ultimately, however, if you remain unmoved, so be it.  That is your prerogative.  


What, then, is this post intended to accomplish?  



The purposes of thread are two-fold.  


First and foremost, I hope to address the sole connection that I have heard people make between my conviction and my participation in Magic: the Gathering events: the issue of public safety.  To that end, the only way thing that I can think to do is to discuss the positive strides that I have tried to make over the past decade of my life.  These statements, because they are inherently self-congratulatory, will likely come across as across as those of a braggart.  If that irks or offends you, I apologize.  I will try to be brief, but be forewarned.


Second, I have seen some misinformation bandied about, both by supporters and detractors, in the various forums in which people are discussing my circumstances.  I will try to bury these mistakes if I can with more accurate information.

35q26v,101,2015-05-12,The Adventures of Luna Part 3: Thats No Moon,OfficeShitLord,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/35q26v/the_adventures_of_luna_part_3_thats_no_moon/,"I stand before you all today with 2 fresh tales of Luna's adventures.

It has dawned on me that Luna is not a moon, she is a unit designed by the Beetus Empire to wreak havoc on the innocent and pure. Nothing is safe, if you find yourself near her path of destruction you will be destroyed. 

Recently a co-worker was celebrating his birthday, we'll call him Jay. Our company puts a great value on the people it employs, so birthdays never go unmentioned. The usual hoopla of a cake, some treats and a card signed by everyone. You also get to take your birthday off, which is a nice touch. As this was a significant birthday for him the company went a little bigger with the cake and treats.

It's worth mentioning that Jay asked me for some advice in terms of diet and working out a couple months back. I sorted him out and he's been
coming to the gym with me when our schedules match. He's looking and feeling a lot better, which I couldn't be happier about. So I take Jay downstairs while everyone else gets the conference room set up. We head back up and Jay could not be more delighted with the effort. The guy's face lit up like Christmas.

So after opening the card followed by handshakes and hugs all round it was time to cut the cake. There was easily enough cake to give everyone 2 portions 
with some to spare for his wife and kids at home. Jay had seemed nervous about the cake and treats situation, but I reassured him that one day of indulgence 
isn't going to destroy all the work he'd put it over the last few months. If you can't have cake and a few beers on your birthday then when can you? 
So just as Jay is slicing the cake up Luna starts warming up the death ray:

&gt;Luna: So OfficeShitLord and Jay can give us their slices yeah?

&gt;Jay: Huh? Why?

&gt;Luna: Won't you melt if you eat sugar or carbs *snickering*

&gt;Jay: Same way you'll melt if you don't eat them?

&gt;Luna: That's not fair, I'm still recovering from my broken ankle. I still need to bulk to increase mass and aid recovery!

&gt;OSL: Jay's worked hard, we're all allowed to indulge in something sweet from time to time. Especially on your birthday!

&gt;Luna: What about your sugar spikes? How many crunches will you need to do to burn that off Jay?

&gt;Jay: I can have a day off Luna, here's your cake

&gt;Luna: Just be careful you don't fall back, you could easily end up eating the whole cake and getting fat again!

I shuffled her on as quick as I could, I wanted that toxic orb out of the way as soon as possible and keep the line moving.
Jay was fine, he'd learned how to brush her off. We all enjoyed ourselves and the chance to unwind then. Luna orbited around the snacks table for the rest of the party,
but her damage had not yet been done. As fun as the party was I eventually had to get back to my desk because I'd a late one planned.
Around 6pm Jay was getting his stuff ready to go, he called me from the kitchen - his cake was gone. 

I checked around and no sign of it in the conference room or kitchen. I rang a few of my co-workers to see if anyone knew where it was at. Our manager asked Luna
to pack it up and put it in the fridge on her way out. Clearly she thought the manager meant *her* fridge. The most annoying thing of all was that there were maybe 6 slices 
left in that bad boy. Jay wanted some for his wife and kids.

Needless to say Luna got tore a new one for her ""misunderstanding"" the following morning.

Our next tale is truly one of pure destruction. Damage was done, conference calls were cancelled, innocence was lost.

It was a quiet morning. I was in the office at 8am, coffee in hand preparing for a fairly important conference call with a big client. 
I was 2 hours and several coffees into the call when it happened. I was mid sentence, explaining our projected approach to a new project 
when the loud crack and thud pierced the walls. It caught me off guard, had a bomb just dropped? Worse, a moon fell from orbit.

Less than a second later the shouting started, it seemed longer as I was still caught in the initial shockwave. The shouting turned to screams.
I had to hurridily apologise and excuse myself from the call. Rushing out into the office I saw my cow-workers converging for the toilets. This was the site of impact.

Luna had been in the toilet and for whatever reason she shifted her weight on the seat. Her weight cracked the toilet bowl, 
sending her crashing to the ground. In her panic she reached for the wash basin, which was no match for her gravitational pull. She lay on the floor in a mess
of water, blood, waste and shattered porcelain. 

An ambulance was called, it took two paramedics and myself to raise her from her crater. Some stitches were 
needed but the true destruction was in that small toilet. The scene looked like news footage from war torn Baghdad. Maintenance quoted the guts of a week to
repair the damage. Luna *demanded* 2-3 weeks off to recover, for it's not possible to sit at a desk with stiches in your thigh. She was told she could work from
home for 2 days before returning.

The look in our interns eyes as she witnessed Luna, half naked and wet on the floor is not something I will ever forget. That look of horror and lost innocence will
stay with me until my final moments."

I am graduating in a few days from chemical engineering. I was unable to land internships during sophomore and junior year. At that time I had a 3.4 GPA. Now I have a 3.2 GPA from a state university. Let me know If you think the specific uni is important.  
Currently, I am also having trouble finding a job. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to apply for internships as well as full time positions?  
Originally I was looking only in the petroleum industry. Now, I have expanded to the food, pharma, and 3d printing.  
Is searching/applying online the best way to go about this? I have not had much luck with this so far.  
I'll be taking the FE this summer. I plan on taking the PE soon after that. Anything else I should be doing?  
  
TLDR: Should a recent graduate apply for interships as well as jobs?"
35q4yj,167,2015-05-12,Give Jimmy a Chance! (Or: How I Learned to Expect Nothing and Love The Intern),Shisno_,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/35q4yj/give_jimmy_a_chance_or_how_i_learned_to_expect/,"**Foreword:**

Since we just recently celebrated VE day, and with memorial day just around the corner... I figured I would provide an exciting tale involving WWII vet's wife.

For reference to this woman's origin:
https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/30dlcf/the_tale_of_the_awesome_wwii_vet/

**Our cast includes:**

Me - Shisno / Me

Jimmy - Our ever faithful busy times helper / intern.

Cheryl - The WWII vet's wife


It was the middle of the summer.  Sweltering hot, humid ninety plus degree days almost the entire week.  I had begun running a few service calls for the day.  After which, back in the store to wrap up the last four hours.

I arrived at the shop around lunch time.  I had already done around $1,100 worth of business for the day; I was feeling rather satisfied with myself.  I pulled into the store, spotting Cheryl's van immediately.

&gt; ""Oh shit, Jimmy's all alone in there!""

I race inside, and sure enough Jimmy is nowhere to be *seen*.  Instead I find Cheryl, beating on the bathroom door and screaming obscenities.

&gt; Cheryl (screaming): ""NYARGUGH MAKKA SHAKKA TELEKU!!!!""

&gt; Me: ""Cheryl, what's going on?""

&gt; Cheryl: ""Oh, Shisno_!  I'm glad you're here.  This little moron was supposed to clean my computer.  But, he ruined it instead!""

I had been to her house a few times at this point, and she had begun warming up to me.  Over time, I had begun to understand her clipped, guttural dialect of ""English"".

&gt; Me: ""Cheryl, is that your computer on the bench?""

*nods*

&gt; Me: ""Ok, let's take a look...""

I then proceed to open the case and very quickly discover that Jimmy had left the P4 connector unplugged from the motherboard.  I plug the cable back into the motherboard, and test boot the computer.  Of course, it loads right into windows.

&gt; Cheryl: ""This is why I only want you touching our computer when I bring it here!""

&gt; Me: ""I assure you, it's a mistake I made a few times as a rookie.""

&gt; Cheryl: ""BULABAL MIKTASH""

&gt; Me: ""No, really!  But, thank you for the vote of confidence.""

I then carry the computer out to the van, and chat Cheryl down from her rage high...

&gt; Inner Monologue: *Was that?  No... he couldn't be so foolish.  Yes, there it is, movement in the blinds!  The poor little bastard is watching us!  Oh god, no!  Cheryl noticed too!*

&gt;Cheryl: ""HAGABADLA! NYUK MONDUR TINESHUUN!!!!""

*honk honk honnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnk! goes the van's horn...*

&gt; Me: ""Don't worry, Cheryl... I'll be ripping him a new one once you're gone.""

&gt; Cheryl: ""Ok, Shisno_!  Have a good day!

Smug satisfaction is apparent on her face, armed with the knowledge that I will be finishing the dirty job of murdering Jimmy in her stead.  Finally, she practically peels out of our driveway and heads for home.  I make my way into the store, to find Jimmy waiting for me; tears were streaming liberally down his pimply teenage face.

&gt; Jimmy: ""That woman is a monster!  She threw boss` plastic coffee mug at me!""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, she can be a bit coarse at times.""

&gt; Jimmy: ""Coarse!?  She was trying to beat down the bathroom door!""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, you can't show her fear.  Otherwise, she will strike for sure.""

With that, I coached Jimmy on double checking his connections when he gets done cleaning a PC.  Afterward, vet stopped by to make an apology to the kid.  I had to intercede when the flask made an appearance, and took the kid's shot for him.  Sometimes, you just have to take one for the team, I guess.

**TL;DR** Moral of the story: Don't leave the intern alone when one of your more *demanding* customers is expected to visit."

I've suspected for quite a while, but I woke up to my girlfriend wanting to have sex with me this morning, and while it was a pleasant experience, it was very hard to get it up and I could only think about my porn and fetishes the entire time. Upon reflection, most of the time I have sex with her (which is growing more infrequent) I think about my porn, because its difficult to get aroused otherwise.

The tragedy is that my girlfriend is absolutely beautiful, and she doesn't deserve to be treated this way. Thankfully it hasn't really impacted our relationship too much, but I've decided that I still need this to change. I'm going to be gone for 10 weeks this summer on an internship, and I'm not going to see her at all. That will make it pretty difficult to abstain, and at the moment, I'm having a really hard time deciding whether or not I should delete all of my porn that I've built up and saved over the years. I'm really quite attached to it now.

Any advice for someone starting out would be much appreciated. Should I attempt to abstain from MO the entire summer? I think I could possibly do it, but as someone who also works hard to control their weight, I know that I am susceptible to relapse.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I'm looking for an accountability partner to do a standard challenge for 90 days. I'm comfortable with text and reddit messages, preferably with someone close to my age.

35qlw0,19,2015-05-12,My (21F) roommate (21F) has just informed me she is five months behind on bills because of her new lifestyle. She is ruining her life. Should my friends and I confront her?,wyd71,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35qlw0/my_21f_roommate_21f_has_just_informed_me_she_is/,"Okay, so a little background information. I have been living with my best friend/roommate, Mandy, and another roommate, Ben (24M), in a house for the past year. Mandy and I have grown close very quickly. I was going through a rough time when I moved in and I felt very welcome by Mandy and her friends. Over the past year, these girls have become my best friends. 

Halfway into the semester, Mandy and her boyfriend of four years breaks up and Mandy starts getting into the rave scene. We all attended a few shows here and there together but Mandy got really into it. This was new and unusual for Mandy since she previously never went out, would always be in bed by 10 PM and led a pretty quiet life working multiple jobs and going to school. She befriended a lot of people in the scene and was going to raves two of three times a week in a city about an hour and a half from where we live. She also has work and attends university, so as you can see, taking these trips throughout the week has caused a huge strain on her work ethic and her life in general. 

First of all, she has basically stopped caring about her looks or hygiene. She doesn’t shower nearly as much as she should anymore. She visibly looks like she hasn’t showered (doesn’t change clothes, greasy hair, sweaty, no makeup or smudged makeup) and talks all the time about how she hasn’t eaten all day and feels like a “zombie.” She is unreliable (whereas before, we’d always refer to her as the “mom” of the group) and doesn’t bother keeping plans or showing up to important birthday/events going on with our group of friends, but she has time to go to raves multiple times a week. I know she is doing a lot of drugs during these events, too. She has lost a lot of weight. I don’t know the extent of it since Mandy has been careful not to disclose certain details of her new life to us or “sugarcoat” things. For example, she is currently doing an internship and she’s told me multiple times it’s going really well, but one day, I talked to a girl in her class who got her the internship as she was also working at the same place, and she told me that Mandy actually got “fired” or lost the internship because she was very unreliable and wouldn’t show up sometimes and basically half assed her work. Another friend in our friend group, Sarah (20F), who also babysits for the same family that Mandy does, has also told me the family has raised suspicions about firing Mandy for the same reasons she got fired from her internship – unreliable, always late and doesn’t try with the kids anymore.

The final straw, however, and the reason why I’m making this post is, today in class, Mandy texted me and told me that she was five months behind on the internet/cable bills. I was confused because Ben and I pay Mandy who pays the internet/cable and utility bills because they are under her name and we have been paying her the amount she told us we owed without fail. This system has worked for us in the past as we were all good friends and we trusted her to tell us the truth and not demand to see the actual bill or anything. It turns out, for the past five months, she has been taking me and Ben’s internet/cable money and using it to pay her portion of the utilities and neglecting the internet/cable bill altogether because she didn’t have the money for it and thought “having electricity is more important than internet or cable.” I WAS LIVID. Not only was she being a shitty friend, using drugs irresponsibly and excessively, got fired from her internship, about to get fired from her job, but then she also told me that she has been doing poorly in school the past semester and wasn’t going to have the grades/GPA she needed to continue her course and faced academic probation.

I immediately called Ben and relayed the information about the bills to him and he was pissed as well. I also texted a few of the girls in the group and asked to talk to them later. I can’t help but just be outraged at how things have come to this point with Mandy. How has she just done a complete 360? Our friend group doesn’t really know what to do. Should we confront her? I think we’ve avoided confrontation because we thought it would be “just a phase” but it’s almost been a year now, and Mandy is still heavy into it and its ruining her life and I hate to see her like this. Any help or advice would be appreciated, thanks.
   
**tl;dr**: My roommate/best friend has gotten into the rave scene and has become a shitty, unreliable friend, as well as lost her internship, may get fired from her job, is flunking out of school, and is five months behind on bills that she's been using me and my roommate's money to pay. What should we do? How do we confront her?"
35qryz,7,2015-05-12,Take audit offers? Or try again in the fall?,kikomeprease,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/35qryz/take_audit_offers_or_try_again_in_the_fall/,"Hi guys,

I am currently a senior with a major in accounting graduating this June from a non-target UC school (undergrad). The whole year I've been focusing on recruitment for audit positions at Big4/mid tiers - I am happy to say that I've been able to lock in a few full-time offers :)

However, after starting a pro-bono consulting organization for non-profits at my school last quarter, as well as speaking to a few of my friends currently in consulting...my interests are definitely shifting. To keep things short, the work just seems so much more interesting -- more substantial than the type of work I'd be doing in audit. Working for non-profits has been such a rewarding experience and I want to shift my professional focus towards consulting.

The partner at one of the Big4 (Gay Magazine) has mentioned that I would need to stay in Audit for about three years before making a shift into their advisory practice (I've heard that this service line is particularly weak as well). Of course I would need to finish up units and obtain my CPA too, something that I don't think aligns with my long term goals anymore.

My question is, would it be a bad idea to basically reassess everything and try for actual consulting firms again in the Fall? Do firms typically reject recent graduates? Currently I have an internship at a boutique executive transition/search firm, and I plan on practicing cases/coding/learning excel throughout the Summer, so it's not like I'd be sitting at home doing nothing. My GPA is not too strong (Cum ~3.4 Accounting ~3.6), but I do have a lot of self-start experiences, relevant publications, and leadership experiences that I feel makes me at least a competitive candidate. 

Or should I just take the Audit position and tank the three years? I could really use any advice and appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and help.

Thanks so much.

Anyways this gives me 2-3 weeks with nothing to do, I would like to do a home job, like freelance programming, and hoping you guys knew a good source to do that, and just jump right in to it.

Alternativly I was considering working Open Source, and personal projects while I wait, but I don't exactly have the funds to be sitting around, and finding a summer job for two weeks is nearly impossible.

Thanks,

35qv8u,1,2015-05-12,"I [23M] have a complicated situation with the woman I love [23F]. She's now seeing someone, and I thought we were still into each other. What do I do?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/35qv8u/i_23m_have_a_complicated_situation_with_the_woman/,"I'm really upset and antsy right now, so please forgive me if I don't communicate myself well.

I am very much in love with a woman that I have known since we were kids. We met at a summer camp and got to be good friends through e-mail. I've known her since I was 13, but didn't develop feelings for her until we both started college. We fell for each other in 2010, and started a long distance relationship that lasted through 2013. For some dumb reason, I decided that I didn't like ""long distance"", so we broke up. Over the next year we hooked up a few times, but I didn't want to get back together with her because I felt like I was holding her back career wise. She was on track to finish college before me, and I wasn't sure that I'd be able to follow her when she left for grad school.

I should note, that at this point in our relationship, we really liked each other still. We didn't have a bad breakup, and were good friends through it all. Even when she got a temporary job across the country, she and I were still really close (this is last fall/summer). At Christmas, we shared a really awesome kiss.

Here's the current situation:
Around Christmas time, we had been talking about me coming to visit her across the country. I had told her that I would really like to come, but that I had to find an internship for the summer. If I didn't find one during the term, then I'd have to spend spring break doing it. She seemed to understand, and all seemed well. I ended up finding an internship with that time, so it was well spent.

Recently, I have been feeling really really strong feelings for her, like ""she's the one"" sort of feelings. She just recently told me that she'll be doing grad school relatively close to me, so I figured that I should tell her how I feel, and that I think we should date again.

Lo and behold, I come out and tell her this, and she tells me that she feels like she's been burned by me seeming disinterested, and that not coming to visit her over spring break was the last straw. Furthermore, she tells me she's ""seeing someone"" that she may want to pursue (if only for the short time that she'll remain across the country.

I am utterly devastated by this. Just last term, she was talking about me moving to wherever she was going to go to grad school (mostly just day-dreaming, mind you.) I have not thought of anything else since she told me this. Before today, I had resolved to show her that It was not my intention to burn her by seeming disinterested, and she seems like she's willing to give me a shot. 

On the one hand, I am 100% sure that I am in love with her. I have thought about marrying her for so long that I have convinced myself that it was going to happen. On the other hand, I feel betrayed that she never even told me that she felt ""burned"" and decided to go seek male companionship elsewhere. It feels like she didn't tell me about any of what she was feeling on purpose.

I told her everything that I feel for her this morning. She said that she was surprised that she'd had it wrong. I have a skype session scheduled with her tomorrow afternoon so that we can work this out. I don't think I can take watching her fall in love with another man, and if she won't even consider giving me another shot, I don't see how I can even be friends with her anymore.

Am I the bad guy here? Should I just leave her be and begin (the very very long process) of moving on? If I really really love her, should I fight to gain her trust and affection back, or am I just torturing myself with something that is out of my control?

I hope some of that makes sense. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions (I am practically shaking with conflicting emotion right now, so any vagueness was unintentional.)

TL;DR: Girl I'm in love with and I were sort of ""in love"" before I cancelled a trip, now she feels burned and is seeing someone. I am devastated and don't know what to do.

Edit: I should re-iterate that she has said that she admits that she was mistaken, but she feels overwhelmed by this. I don't know what to make of that, but the point is that she does still have feelings for me."

35r0bx,5,2015-05-12,My last post reaching out because of the same guy breaking me.,thebuttcake,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/35r0bx/my_last_post_reaching_out_because_of_the_same_guy/,"I feel myself falling slowly into my depression, like it's beginning to gradually get ahold of me again. Everything seems to be going well for me. I have a good job that I enjoy, with coworkers that make me laugh all the time. I have perfect grades and recently landed an internship. Yet I feel like my days are dragging by, with no purpose because my sense of purpose was the boy I was with for so long. He was in my life for almost five years now, and as a teen that's a significant amount of time. Our relationship was stronger than ever but unfortunately we were long distance. 


He lost hope for us and we broke it off. But damn I just can't stop crying over him. I dream about him every damn night. I contemplate texting him every day but know it's useless. He no longer wants me. This isn't the first time he's hurt me so badly. If anything, all my friends are glad we are no longer together, because they say how much he made me suffer. But no one knows how wonderful we were when we were happy and strong. I would've done anything for him. I'm not too sure he would've done the same. 


I know my only choice right now is to get over him because he simply wasn't ""the one"", no matter how hard the memories try to convince me otherwise. It also doesn't help that I'm a very jealous person and can't help but think he's with someone else now. All this leads me to think so low of myself. I need help getting over him, simply put. I feel absolutely miserable without him. "
35r7gd,1,2015-05-12,I [23M] pushed away my SO [F22] of 1 year until she had no choice but to break up with me,throwwayaway928,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35r7gd/i_23m_pushed_away_my_so_f22_of_1_year_until_she/,"Backstory first.  I met this girl (We'll call her Amy) during my junior year of college, and within two weeks of our hanging out together I was infatuated with her. We spent nearly everday that semester together, and started officially dating about a month before summer started. We were apart for two months that summer because I was traveling and she was doing an internship, and the distance only made us stronger.


Our senior year started and I had a place off campus with some friends; Amy was living on campus.  We were spending even more time together than the previous semester, and she would stay over 5-6 nights per week (we never hung out at her dorm, always my house). November came and Amy asked to move in with me, saying that we practically lived together already, which was true.  I hesitated because it felt like it was too soon, and that hurt her badly, but I gave in because I loved her and knew she was miserable whenever she wasn't staying with me.


She officially moved in after New Year and things were going fine.  I was determined to make it work, as a breakup while living together would be disastrous, my friends warned me.  Then, sometime in January, our sex became less frequent, from every other day or so to once a week.  We would fight more, usually because I would get depressed, sullen, and resentful.  I've suffered from depression for 6 years, and Amy knew that when we got together.  Our fights would proceed something along the lines of: Me: ""I'm  not going to class this morning.""  Amy: ""You skipped yesterday, I   think you'll feel better if you drag yourself out of bed.""  Me : ""Leave me alone, I can handle my own affairs tyvm."" Amy: "" I'm just trying to help, I know that you tend to avoid your academic responsibilities when you get depressed."" Me: ""Whatever, I wanna go back to sleep.""

This would happen every couple of weeks or so. Then at the end of February, the sex stopped. Amy said she didn't feel attractive anymore, that she was feeling depressed, and that her libido was basically absent.  This was frustrating for me -- I don't need sex all the time, but I refused to accept that a couple our age, 10 months in, should be having sex less than once a month.  When she would reject my advances, I would become sullen and cold towards her, which of course made her even more turned off by me.  I'm not defending my actions here, because I recognize my immaturity, I'm just stating facts.

My emotions for her have been gradually waning since then. I went from seeing her as the love of my life to a close friend.  This past weekend when we graduated, I got really depressed, aprtially cus of a frustrating assignment.  Amy was concerned and would reach out to me, and I would tell her to leave me alone and go about her day as if I weren't there.  I would be sarcastic and downright mean to get her out of the room.  Eventually she said she had enough. She had warned me before that she wasn't gonna put up with me if I was gonna treat her like crap.  So she said that we were done being BF-GF, and that when our lease expired at the end of the month we were done as friends as well.  She said ""I hate you!"" to my face: that stung, but I know I deserved her hate.

Now I'm not sure what to do.  Part of me wants the freedom of being single now that I'm a college graduate.  Part of me thinks I should beg her to take me back and apologize for wronging her.
I'm sleeping in the basement and we haven't spoken in two days.


   
**tl;dr**: I have been feeling less love for my GF the past few months.  When I got depressed last weekend I acted like an ass to push her away.  She officially ended it, but I basically forced her too by being a miserable bastard. Idk what to do next."
35r8m1,0,2015-05-12,My internship thinks I'm working in the summer.

I got caught off guard because I was applying to summer internships, so I wasn't sure what to say. I basically told her a very vague answer and she assumed I'm working in the summer. The reason I didn't give her a straight answer was because if I did get a summer internship, I would quit, but if I don't, I'd stay at my current internship. I didn't want to tell her that I was applying to other places and waiting back to hear from them.

Now, I think I might have another summer internship (they contacted me this week..) but I'm not sure how to tell my current internship I want to quit by June... The first time she asked me I told her I was taking summer classes so i can't do full time. I was going to tell my current internship and basically say my summer courses are going to be very overwhelming and i don't have room to work there in the summer... Is this ok to say?  I don't want to mention i got another offer because I already told her i was taking summer classes.."
35r9hj,5,2015-05-12,Looking for roommates!,jollypoop,phoenix,https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/35r9hj/looking_for_roommates/,"Hey /r/phoenix!

I'm in the planning stages of moving to Mesa or Tempe, and as much as I'd like to have a one-bedroom apartment, it may be more financially bearable to get a place with roommates (to split the cost of electricity and internet).

I know that CL is the go-to for this kind of stuff, but I just wanted to give finding some cool roommates a shot on /r/phoenix before turning it over to craigslist.

That being said, I'd be super content with living in a 2 bedroom / 2 bathroom with one other roommate or in a 3 bedroom / 2+ bathroom with two roommates. Budget-wise, I can go up to $600 a month, before utilities. Either the first of June or the first of July is when I'd want to move in, preferably for a year-long lease.

About me: I'm a 21-year-old male attending ASU (undergrad), and I'll be graduating in the spring of 2016. I'm pretty studious and definitely would not identify as a party-fiend. I work 24 hours a week, and there's a chance some of that time would be spent doing an internship over this summer. I would not be bringing any pets to our arrangement. I cook whenever time permits and I watch a healthy amount of netflix and drink socially and am a non-smoker.

I don't care if you're a guy or a girl, as long as you're clean and respectful. We don't have to be best friends, either, but I think it's valuable to live with someone you're comfortable kicking back and having a beer with.

So between now and the end of May, I'll be looking for a suitable living situation, but if you find that you're in the same boat as me or know someone who is, I'd love to meet up to briefly get to know one another and maybe we can do this whole roommate thing.


As an aside, I frequent /r/malelivingspace, if that gives you any kind of indication of the kind of living decor I'd like to share with my roommates.


TLDR; PM me if you or someone you know is looking for roommates in Mesa/Tempe! I'd love to meet to chat about potentially becoming roommates."

My name is Nick, 22M, a recent graduate from Berea College in Kentucky, currently living in Lexington, KY. I'll be moving up to Columbus for a design internship this summer, and to prepare for that, I'm looking to have my housing situation established before then.

So this is what I'm currently looking for:

* A bedroom, as this will probably be the best that I can afford. So likely someone who is subletting there room for the summer, or already has one available. 
* I'm specifically looking for something around the $500 range, preferably with utilities included in that amount (water, electric, internet/wifi, etc.)
* Has a washer/dryer, or washer/dryer units nearby
* Off-street parking would be preferable, but not an absolute must. 
* Somewhere in or around north of OSU, since the internship is located within this part of Columbus. To give you an idea, it's south of the OSU airport.
* In a quiet, peaceful neighborhood would be great, since I'll be working full-time the 10 weeks that I'm here

That's mostly what I'm looking for. If you have anything or know of anything out there that fits most of the above criteria, you can leave a comment or message me here!"

35rcco,3,2015-05-12,I think I’m finally comfortable with calling my mom an N,HawliBear,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/35rcco/i_think_im_finally_comfortable_with_calling_my/,"I’ve spoken about my family life on reddit for a while, and often get recommended to visit this subreddit. I’ve lurked here for over a year, but I never felt comfortable calling my mom an N. My reasoning is that she loves me, she was never physically abusive, she never did things to attempt to ruin my life.

But NPD isn’t an all or nothing thing, it’s a spectrum, and I think I’ve finaly reached the end of what I can deal with, with her.

Relevant background: Nmom hates my (Maybe N-Maybe just an asshole) Dad. Dad hasn’t spoken to me in over two years by his own choice. I have had extremely long curly hair most of my life. I get my hair from her, and our hair is pretty fabulous. It is the first thing people notice about us, and it is beautiful.

A few months ago, I decided to do something adventurous before I leave college, so I bleached my hair and dyed it bright red. It was fun, pretty cool, and I got loads of compliments on it. I also have a septum piercing, which I always put up when I came to visit my mother because she hates it (i.e., yelling at me in the yard of my SOs house because of how “ugly” it is and how I’m ruining my looks).

When I came home for spring break, I obviously couldn’t hide my hair, and I chose to not hide my septum ring. She never blew up, but it was tense. In private, she’d berate me for “ruining” my hair, but in public discussed how edgy I was and how I had fun “Little Mermaid” hair.

A few weeks ago, I decided to cut my hair drastically to removed some damaged bits, and to just experiement. My hair had been to my lowerback for over six years, so I wanted a change. I cut it to my mid-neck/shoulders. I also decided to shave a little less than a quarter of it on the left side. I left enough on top that I could cover it, but I normally wear it in a pinned back braid so my shaved side could be seen.

When she saw my short hair, she was upset, but we were in front of her friends so she kept it together. When we left their house to pick up my little sister, she freaked out and asked if I was trying to kill her. I kindly informed her that I like it, and it wasn’t up for discussion. I didn’t expect her to like it, but I wasn’t going to talk about it.

The rest of the day went okay. My step-dad saw it, made a funny comment about not liking it, but we went on our way. NOTE: I’m fine with hearing they don’t like it, I just don’t want it to become a *thing*

After my stepdad went to work that night, I took a bath. My hair is short enough I can wash it in the tub, so I ended up talking to my mother about how convenient my hair length is now. She looks at me and says, “This is devastating. This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.” My mother was raised in an abusive home, she was in an unhappy marriage for thirteen years that ended in divorce, she’s dealt with a lot of shit in her life. But my hair is the worst thing that’s ever happened to her.

I don’t engage her, save for telling her that she’s overreacting because it’s just hair. It grows back. She follows me into the hallway and keeps asking how I could do this to her, saying that people stare at me, etc. etc. She brings up my cousin (a top ten contestant in the Miss USA contest a few years ago), “You think *cousin’s name* is pretty! How could you think this is pretty!” I say my standard line: “There’s lot of versions of beauty in the world. I don’t have to look like *cousin* to be beautiful.”

She won’t stop though. She keeps going on about how could I do this to her. I keep reiterating I did nothing to her, I did stuff to me, but she won’t stop. It’s like it can’t stop. When I said, “Hair grows back,” she snapped, “BUT WILL YOU EVER GROW YOURS BACK. I HAVE NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.” 

I snap. I eventually just say, “God, you’re like  a fucking puppet master. You sit back with strings in your hands and when people don’t behave like you want, you lash out. I don’t play the game anymore, and it drives you fucking insane.” Bad move on my part. I should have never engaged her.

This turns into an hour long talk/screaming match/argument about all the times she just dismissed my feelings and how she doesn’t even remember them because she can’t handle for a second that she could be mean or cruel. I bring up my cutting as a teen; when she found me cutting, she just told me: “You know you’re gonna have scars now, right?” My bisexuality: when she read messages between my friend and I, she told me I wasn’t bisexual I was just bi-curious and wanting to be with woman is gross (I came out to her in the conversation too, awkwardly). 

At one point, she said, “When you came home with red hair and a nose ring I was so worried about you.” *(I’ve had the nose ring for over a year)* I retorted, “What? I dye my hair then I’m going to start smoking meth?” “I’M NOT WORRIED ABOUT DRUGS OR ALCOHOL.” I have a 3.7 from a university in our state and I’m a member of the honors college, I’m almost completely financially independent, and I just got a really prestigious internship for this summer. But, in her mind, I’m throwing it all away so I can have weird hair, which isn’t that weird right now. I jumped on the tail end of the shaved side trend. I’m by no means unique in this.

I brought up how she controlled how I dressed in high school, how she shamed me and made me feel like shit for having sex in high school. And she couldn’t even listen in a meaningful way. “Oh, so I’m just a horrible mom?” I shot back, “That’s not what it’s about at all. It’s how you’ve hurt me by making everything about appearances and superficial things.” “Well, I guess I’m just the worst. God, I bet you hate me so much” None of this was sincere, she kept scoffing and looking at me incredulously.

She kept saying, “You have memories problems, you probably just remember it wrong,” or she’d pull out key words and say: “I NEVER SAID THAT.” When she sat down and started to go through what I said and justify it, I said, “We’re at the part of the conversation where you invalidate my feelings and justify your actions, so I’ll let you do that by yourself.” I then left and had a friend pick me up for a late night drive.

She sent me a text that said: ""I cannot undo all the things I've done to make you unhappy,  i can only say that I will do better. I love you."" My response: ""You can't do better if you never sincerely admit that youre in the wrong.""

It’s been two days. She keeps waking me up at 7 am to tell me she loves me and won’t leave until I say I love her too. Other than that, we’ve had no communication.

I’m so exhausted. I used to think she was just controlling, but I think I finally get that I’ll never be a real person to her. I’m proof of her good motherhood and physical extension of how she wishes to present herself. This behavior doesn’t even have anything to do with me, it’s just her bizarre need to make everything about herself.

TL;DR: I shaved part of my head, but you’d think I killed someone.

My specialization is Telecommunications Networks, with an emphasis on Information Technology (but lots of Electronics in the first years, too). My first job out of college was at a corporate IT firm, doing database CRUD related stuff. But now I started asking myself: is an unspectacular IT career really what I want to do? I No, it figured to me that I want to actually be an Engineer. My math/physics background is there. I enjoyed courses on 'Signal Processing', Digital Electronics during college years.

**With less than a year since I graduated, and with a few months of IT experience, I wanna stop going this direction, and go back to pursuing a career in Engineering. I'm attracted to Digital Design, FPGA's, VHDL**, and its applications in communication/radar/space  systems.

Is this a crazy thing to do? Is it doable? And how should I go into getting an entry-level job as an Engineer? My thirst for knowledge is very high at the moment. I do know I've got to catch up a little bit. but hoping the learning/experiencing curve will be steep.

**UPDATE: 

Industry sectors of interest: Telecommunications, Semiconductors, Aerospace, Semiconductors.

**Steps to take:** 

* Rewrite my IT-focused resumes to Engineering resume. Change my LinkedIn profile accordingly.
* Start following relevant companies, to get myself back to speed with the latest in the industry
* Read. Learn. Research. Gain in-depth knowledge in a few specific subjects.
* Actively pursue an entry-level Engineering position, or even a paid internship.

I am twenty-six years old and attending graduate school in Atlanta. I have had mental problems my entire life, and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, severe depression, insomnia, and mild psychosis when I was thirteen. I have come to be able to manage my depression decently, as I am so familiar with how it feels that I am able to separate it from myself as a whole, and having a bad day is more akin to being physically ill than anything else. My anxiety, however, is crippling, and continues to get worse every day. I am terrified of driving and basically have a small panic attack any time I have to drive somewhere – which is often, because my boyfriend is disabled and cannot drive, so I really have no other options for 90% of the things I need to access. I cannot adequately express in words the abject horror I feel when behind the wheel of a car. Most other everyday activities that involve leaving my home are also exceedingly difficult. I feel like I am going to pass out every time I go to the grocery store. It can take days for me to get myself to make even an important email or phone call. I do not trust any of my decisions or perceptions because of how much anxiety distorts the way in which I engage with the world, and often end up doing things that seem very irrational to anyone else. 

I also have problems with my back – I was diagnosed with a herniated disc in my neck when I was sixteen, and in the past six months have developed excruciating pain beneath my right shoulder blade that occurs any time I am working with my hands/arms. Because I am in graduate school for art, this has made doing schoolwork very, very difficult. I am actually taking this quarter off because I simply do not have the physical ability to work on art right now. I can't even do something like wash the dishes without ending up doubled over in pain. 

What further complicates all this is that when I went off of my father's insurance when I turned 26 last August, I did not understand anything about how insurance worked (and still don't understand much). I could have signed up for Obamacare but was led to believe that getting insurance through my school was a better option. It was not; it's fixed indemnity insurance and it's fucking terrible. It hardly pays for anything, and it doesn't even count as insurance under the new guidelines. The only reason I didn't have to pay a penalty on my income taxes is because I don't make enough money to have to file them. I get a dispensation from a trust fund that my grandparents set up of about $460 a month, and this is what I live on because I can hardly complete my schoolwork, much less hold down a job. 

Once I got my “insurance,” I visited an orthopedist who for about $500 did not even really examine me, and completely blew me off due to my age. He did refer me to a physical therapy clinic, where I racked up $1,000 worth of bills for six sessions that did nothing. I would not have continued to visit them after the first time if I had realized it was that expensive, but I misunderstood what the people at the front desk told me, and though that the amount my plan gave me to spend per session was covering the entirety of the sessions. This is a recurring theme here. I am an intelligent person, but my anxiety causes me to feel overwhelmed and baffled by most situations in which I have to get and process information from people. I got the orthopedist's assistant to issue me a new prescription for physical therapy, (and it was only at this point that anyone mentioned that the place they'd referred me to was a specialty clinic and therefore more expensive than most) but I have no idea how to find a physical therapist that I can afford. Every time I try to call doctors, they will never tell me how much it is going to cost. I do not understand how to explain my insurance to them. I called the insurance representative and have repeated exactly what she said to tell them and they still have no idea what I mean. I am also extremely limited in what doctors I can go to, because I am simply not able to drive any significant distance within the city.

This is basically the same problem I am having with finding a mental therapist. During my previous quarter of school, I was seeing a counseling intern at my school who was of very little help. If anything, she made things worse overall, because I would tell her about all my problems and she would have no concrete suggestions for me, basically just sympathy, so it made me feel that much more powerless. I tried to request that I be allowed to see one of their actual therapists, but they are making me see her at least one last time in spite of the fact that I explained that it would be a very stressful experience for me to have to explain to a counselor why I do not want to see them anymore, and also that I would rather not use up another one of my limited number of sessions with her. Well, I've got an appointment with her for the 19th, so hopefully things can at least move forward from there. But once I use up my free sessions with the school, I'm in the same position there that I am regarding a medical doctor – I have no idea how to find someone who is close by and can provide me with the services I need at a price I can afford. To add to this, I am transgender, so I also need to find doctors/therapists who will treat me like a human being and not chalk my problems up to that, because I have been on hormone replacement therapy for three years now and so it is not negatively affecting my mental state any longer. It is, however, just another thing I have to pay for.

Regarding medication, I was on Lexapro of varying dosages from the age of fifteen until last December – I had tapered down to 5 mg already, but I couldn't afford it any longer once I turned 26 and was no longer on my father's insurance. Frankly, I also didn't feel like it was helping. It may have helped my depression a bit, but as I have said, I am much more capable of managing that. My anxiety was terrible regardless. I believe I need to get on some kind of anti-anxiety medication, but that is such a daunting prospect not just because of the issues of doctors and finances, but because of how much trial and error it might take to find something that works. I fear I'm going to spend months cycling through various things that either make me worse or turn me into a zombie when I am at a point in my life where I really, really need to be as functional as possible. I have just started an internship at a gallery, and I am hoping to do my thesis show in the fall. I think that my situation will improve a lot once I have graduated, because I won't need to be near the school and can perhaps move to a suburb where it will be less expensive to live and driving will be less awful. However, for that to happen I need to actually be able to make it through this last stretch of school. This time period was supposed to be my recovery period; my opportunity to get myself in order physically and mentally. But it's been a month and half now, and nothing has improved. 

There is now, in fact, an additional problem! About a month ago I started to get occasional mild chest pain and sometimes a sort of shuddering sensation. This has now developed into heart palpitations. It's put my anxiety into overdrive, and it's also made me unable to do my hormone shots because I'm just too freaked out and I don't think I can do it without passing out. I also, after a period of a couple weeks where my right eye was constantly twitching, developed a weird feeling of pressure in my right temple, and a bulging vein there. I have also been having strange pains on the right side of my head. I know that all of this is stuff that can be caused by anxiety, but I don't understand why it would happen now when my anxiety's been consistently terrible for quite some time. It also seems to occur at times when I am calm and my mind is occupied, not just at times when I am freaking out. So, of course, even if it is just caused by anxiety, it's not going to get better until I get reassurance that there's nothing physically wrong. After more terrible experiences trying to find doctors and making nerve-wracking phone calls, I've just made an appointment for Thursday with the closest possible one. So there's me spending more money I don't really have on a doctor I'm not confident will take me seriously at all.

I wonder if maybe I am eligible for Medicaid, or if maybe I can get on Obamacare under one of their exceptions for special circumstances, but again, no idea how any of that works, and no luck thus far trying to figure it out. I tried to put in an application for it and said that I thought I might qualify as disabled, but it was automatically rejected. And of course, another catch – I am still a legal resident of Florida, my home state. I maintained residency at my family's home because Florida laws allowed me to change the gender marker on my license without having had surgery. I also have just moved so many times since coming here for school. I don't know if I need to switch my residency, or who I need to talk to, or...anything. That's the tl;dr of this, basically. I need help and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Plan thus far:

- Visit doctor on Thursday and try to get these recent physical things sorted out. See if maybe he has a suggestion for a physical therapist?

- Try to call a few physical therapy places, as unpleasant and confusing as it is. Maybe get myself to do one a day.

- Try my very best, in spite of how much I resent having to do it, to explain to my counselor (and hopefully her superior) what I need out of counseling and what I need help with. Try to figure out what is within their power to help me with, and who they might be able to point me to to help with the other stuff. Hopefully, I can work on getting medication through them, or they can help me find someone who can get me started on that.

But I still have no idea what to do about insurance and money, or about being a functional human being in the short term. I really appreciate if you've read all this, and would be even more appreciative if you have any kind of feedback or suggestions."

Today is my due date, I woke up at 2:50 with pain in my pelvis and hip joint thay made me feel like I needed to go to the washroom. After a fee trips to the washroom and the pain not changing I decided to wake my SO so he could try tracking them. At this point it didn't feel like the pain was letting up it was excellerating in waves but never settling which was something I expected contractions to do.

We went into the hospital at around 4 am because it was just unbearable and so frequent. After being seen by the nurse and put onto the monitors in triage we can obviously tell these are contractions, they spike and fall (yet I'm not feeling this *fall*). I get checked by a nurse and an intern to hear I'm 2 cm (1 more than at my sweep last thursday). The doctor decides that I can go into a labor room, and I work on getting through the pain using the birthing ball and the shower which helped a tiny bit but not for long. Nurse offers me morphine after I get out of the shower and I decided to go for it. I continued to feel my contractions for 30-40 minutes until I finally fell asleep. Woke up and wasn't feeling my contractions anymore. Assumed ok? MAYBE the morphine worked.

New doctor starts his shift at 8, checks me, I'm only at 3 and since I'm not having painful contractions I have two options. Either go home and rest/try to break your own water/speed the process since my waters are bulging OR I can stay at the hospital they could have broken my waters and put me directly on pitocin. 

I opted to go home and see if my body will try again when it's ready.  What I don't understand is what the hell I was experiencing this morning if it didn't progress, I'm so frustrated I really thought I would meet my baby boy today :(

TLDR- Firt Time Mommy and experienced contractions from 3 am to 6:30 am before they faded after a morphine shot and a rest session. Waters bulging and 3 cm dilated, want to do this without pitocin, and at a loss as to why it all stopped suddenly."

35rn3w,26,2015-05-12,3:44 AM,Sam-TenThirtyOne,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/35rn3w/344_am/,"I was in bed with my eyes closed but not asleep.  I was not entirely sure how long I had been awake or if I had even been asleep at all.  The only thing I knew for sure is that I did not want to look at the clock, because if I did I feared it would say what it has said for as long as I can remember... 3:44 AM.  I did not think anything of it when I first began to notice that every time I would wake up in the middle of the night, it seemed as if by coincidence it would always be 3:44 AM, not 3:43 or 3:45 but 3:44 every...single...time.  

I can't pinpoint exactly when this started as I have always woken up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or get a drink and I didn't always notice the time or in some cases I am sure I did not even look at the clock.  What I do know for sure is it keeps  happening and I can't quite pinpoint when it started and it's beginning to fill me with an uncontrollable sense of dread.  It happens the same every night, I wake up suddenly look at the clock, see it's 3:44 and I am filled with an overwhelming sense that something is wrong but can't place it or understand why I feel this way.  I dismissed this as me just being a creep the first few consecutive nights but as it continued each day I started to feel as if this was not simply a coincidence.  

Tonight was the first night that I felt afraid to go to sleep, not afraid of sleeping but fear of waking up and seeing it was 3:44 again.  I told myself that if I woke up I would simply not look at the clock, if I don't look at the clock I could tell myself it's not 3:44 it could be 2:30 or maybe even closer to my alarm going off, either time would be just fine as far as I was concerned.  As I lay there with the thoughts of not looking at the clock I had the feeling of dread come over me but this time it was different than before.  The feeling was a strong sense that somebody was looking at me, no not just looking at me, waiting for me, specifically waiting for me to do something and I felt that something was to look at the clock.  I did my best to hold off my paranoia and kept my eyes closed for what seemed like hours,  there was no way it was going to be 3:44 when I opened my eyes I was sure of it.  I rubbed my eyes and looked at the clock...it was 3:44 AM.  

Then there was the dream, is it really reoccurring or do I just think it is?  It's like that feeling you get when you experience déjà vu and you are not completely sure if you have actually been there before or maybe you saw it on tv.  I feel like I am having the same dream every night before I suddenly wake up, but I can't be positive in the same way I can't be positive how long I have been waking up at 3:44 AM.

It starts the same every time...
I am laying flat on a gurney of some sort.
I am moving through hallways (I think) but I can't see who is pushing or pulling me.
I know somebody is there as I can feel their presence, like when you feel someone watching you.  I can almost make out silhouettes or shadows but nothing solid.
I stop moving and I can here muffled whispers which begin to change this dream into a full blown nightmare.
For some reason the whispers sound angry or sad, I am not entirely sure why but this is unsettling to me as I can't determine which it is...either one seems to fill me with dread.
A bright light suddenly is in my face blinding me temporarily until my eyes are able to adjust.  The light is so bright that even after my eyes adjust I have trouble making out my surroundings.
The whispers stop and then I notice the cold.  I am able to lift my head and look down and can now see I am completely naked and the cold I am feeling is my bare back against what I assume is stainless steel.
I am unable to move as if I am strapped to the gurney but I can't see any straps holding me down.  I can move my head around but not my arms or legs.  This adds to my panic as I call out and ask to be released.
Nobody ever answers my cries for help but somehow I know that I am being watched, or perhaps observed is a better word.
A shadow enters the room and I can hear the whispers again, something is put in my nose or throat, maybe both I can't tell for sure as fear consumes me.
I am surrounded by shadows and whispers that seem to be closing in and getting louder and louder.
When my fear reaches it peak I suddenly wake up....it's always 3:44 AM.

I was exhausted, I could not even think straight. I started to feel my self unravel from lack of sleep mixed with this overwhelming fear of that number...or is it the time?  Either way I was rattled and could feel myself slipping into craziness.  Why am I so afraid?  What am I thinking it could be?  Why the overwhelming dread?  Was I simply having panic attacks induced by my own wild imagination?  I never wanted to admit or think about what the fear may be coming from but I feel it is time to come to terms with these thoughts and face these fears head on.  I am fairly certain I am being watched for potential abduction or perhaps I am in fact being abducted by aliens.  It sounds crazy even to think this is happening but deep inside I know this is why I feel the overwhelming sense of dread.  I can't quite figure out what 3:44 AM has to do with this but it means something...and I plan to find out...tonight.

I have tried previously to stay awake and wait for 3:44 but to no avail.  For reasons I can't quite explain I always fall asleep or have no memory of actually falling asleep but every night I have the dream and I wake up at the same time, tonight that changes.

I am going to stay awake no matter what happens tonight, come hell or high water.
I set at the edge of my bed for hours looking at the clock, hypnotized by its glowing red digital numbers that changed every 60 seconds, trying to remember how long this has been actually going on.  I am fairly certain it has been at least several days or maybe weeks, but who knows for sure, time seems to be blending together.  For the life of me I can't remember anything I have done recently except the waking up.

I look at the clock and it's 3:34 AM...almost there, won't be long now.

I can't remember going to work...or eating...or daytime....what the fuck is happening to me?  Is this what going crazy feels like?  I tell myself it's simply lack of sleep but struggle to grasp my sanity and/or grip on reality.  Why can't I remember anything other than waking up?  What did I do today?  After I woke up at 3:44AM did I go back to sleep?  I can't remember.

The clock is now at 3:39 AM.

Every time the minute changes it's like a hammer being slammed into metal.  Every minute closer to 3:44 I feel the dread creeping up on me like the tide coming in at the beach.  If these aliens want me they are going to have to come get me wide awake and crazy, ready to fight for my sanity.  Think, what is the last non-sleep thing I can remember.  

3:42 AM.

I feel them watching me, closing in....""What do you want!"" I scream.  No answer but I could feel several eyes on me.
Remember...why can't I remember....wait I remember driving...yes I was driving to drop off a package at the post office.  

3:43AM.

The fear was stronger than ever as the time approached the witching hour, this is the moment of truth.  I could almost see someone or something closing in on me...I could hear voices but could not make out what was being said.  What happened after the post office, what was it!?  And then it all came to me....I never made it to the post office...there was an accident.  And then I was blinded by a bright light and a sound that sounded like electric current....the fear peaked and when it was almost to much to bear it was gone.

It was 3:44 AM.

""How is he? Is he going to be alright?"" The woman asked.  
""I am sorry we did everything we could.""  The doctor said solemnly as he motioned for a nurse to come help console the family.  ""He went into cardiac arrest and we did everything we could to revive him, I am truly sorry.""

The woman collapsed to her knees with her face in her hands...several family members rushed to comfort her.

""That's the part of the job I hate the most.  It's a damn shame really.  By all practical medicine standards he should not have been alive after that accident.  The EMT said he was shocked anyone was alive in the wreckage he saw at the scene.  He was a fighter."" Whispered the doctor.
""What happened exactly?""  Asked the intern.
""Sounds like a truck driver fell asleep behind the wheel.  18 wheeler versus a Honda Accord typically does not end well for the Honda driver.  This was no different."" said the doctor softly.

""It sounded like he asked us what we wanted...what was that all about?"" Asked the intern curiously.

""Not sure, but he sure sounded pissed."" Cracked the doctor.

""Uh doctor....I seem to have missed the time of death on my report...do you have it?""

""Sure....time of death 3:44 AM.""

35rniz,5,2015-05-12,Ruined my Sense of Achievement,iSquash,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/35rniz/ruined_my_sense_of_achievement/,"Hi all,

I'm relatively new to this whole thing and I feel extremely guilty about posting about my Nmom (which I'm sure is ingrained from her) but I just had a flashback to something that had happened to me in college and has been really bothering me as of late.....

After my freshman year of college I had landed a prestigious internship in a Harvard Cardiac lab. Everyone in my family was thrilled and my NMom was bragging to everyone about how smart her daughter was. This was an extremely rigorous internship and not only was I working very hard, I was commuting 4 hours every day so I could be there - as a result when I got home I was very very tired. Of course whenever I would get home my Nmom would give me a huge lists of errands to run for her, even though she was on summer vacation (she was a college professor), and had done nothing all day. Whenever I would ask to relax for a little bit, or to do them later, she would yell at me and tell me that I have no right to be tired, and that I'm a bad daughter, and that she does so much work during the year and she deserves to have a break. This caused a great deal of tension between us throughout the remainder of my internship.


Finally at the end of my internship, my colleagues and I were to give a presentation about our research to our family and friends. I was one of the last ones to present and overall my boss told me a good job. When it came to ask questions about the talk, my boss asked my NMom if she had any questions or remarks about my talk. All she could say was ""Now that this is over, are you going to stop being such a bitch."" Needless to say I was mortified in front of my colleagues and boss and had felt all sense of accomplishment drain from my being in an instant. 

This is the end of the story. I don't know. I have been feeling a lot of anger and then guilt of feeling angry toward my NMom. It's been extremely difficult to deal with - especially with mother's day just passing. She recently asked me why I am so angry when I talk with her....which made me feel even more guilty. Any advice on how to deal with these feelings? Am I overreacting? Am I wrong?

Thanks for reading."
35rpxa,0,2015-05-12,Senior Project: Red Harbinger Build,JesseDieToll,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/35rpxa/senior_project_red_harbinger_build/,"I am starting my senior project early, currently I am in the 11th grade.
 
I have always thought it would be amazing  to have a computer put into a desk with a glass case. I am currently a junior at Dubiski Career high school (I'll go into depth on my school and pathway a little later). Despite the cost I have decided to do something I've only had dreams about.
This image has had the largest influences on my current design
 
Accompanied by four pumps, the reservoirs will separate cold water and the warm to take the heat away from the components. I still feel that the PC should have airflow so that that PC doesn’t rely on one or the other (but the water cooled will be the ""primary"" cooling system if you will)
The PC it's self

The parts I use depend on the funding I get from GoFundMe, money I’m able to put into it and the school district puts into it.
CPU: AMD FX-9590 4.7GHz 8-Core
GPU:  R9 295 x2 8GB 
MB: Asus Crosshair V Formula-Z ATX AM3+
RAM: 16 Gbs 
Storage: 2tbs SSD/ 4tbs Hybrid

The computer will also have other features, such as a wifi hotspot and the monitors will raise and lower on a track.
My school

I go to Dubiski Career High School. At Dubiski there are different pathways, Engineering, IT, Health Science, Media Tech, Architecture, Business, and Auto Tech. I am in the Information Technology pathway, and for the past three years I have been learning how to build and repair computers, however as silly as it sounds our pathway has been influenced heavily on gaming. We have studied the effects of PC and console gaming on information technology as a whole, and it has had a larger influence than you'd think.
Senior Projects

Each student is required to complete a ""senior project in order to graduate. The senior project is a representation of all you have learned in your pathway over the last four years. My teacher and I have worked together over the last two weeks to come up with this, we are both really excited, and however money is a major issue. 

But Why are you starting so early?
I want to take the computer to competitions in December. These competitions are watched by tech corporations and colleges alike, another one of my goals is to get noticed for some scholarships.

So you expect us to just pay for a PC and us get nothing out of it?
Well I wouldn’t even get to use it for maybe a year, and even then I have agreed to let the school use it for showcases and advertising. But in the end I would get it, however I am planning on releasing all of my drawing and designs for the desk so anyone and everyone can modify or build their own. But short answer, I would most likely get the PC in the end. But I'm not claiming to revolutionize the PC industry just to have an amazing project so I can graduate.
It benefits more than me

 My school hosts the ""GPISD Experience"" where students show off projects and the district can show off their new (7 years) shiny school. This project would take part in this showcase, advertising my pathway. Students in middle school could see my work and be inspired to join a pathway and do better than me, and they will. At state competitions tech companies will see this project and sponsor my pathway, 10,000 can go a long way for a lot of people in the IT pathway even leading to internships. This may seem like big dreams for a small project but it’s happened in auto tech when they rebuild a tractor, it can happen to IT. 

Here is the part I wish I didnt have to post, Im not asking for it but I am giving you the option of donating to this (its expensive) every little bit helps. But even if you just read everything thank you. here is the option http://www.gofundme.com/u9f76ep8 if you so choose. Thank you for your time"

What's the best route for a MySQL cert. with no experience?,VainWyrm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35rumt/about_to_graduate_whats_the_best_route_for_a/,"So I'm about to graduate with a CS degree. I understand the material great, but with small children, a job, etc. I've only managed a ~3.15 GPA in my major. On top of that by the time I recognized the importance of database experience (after unsuccessful internship interviews) it was too late to take a class. So I'm planning on getting a MCSA cert. The professors I've asked are confident I can do it myself. Can anyone recommend materials/programs? My current plan is to just order materials from Microsoft, as it appears I can do, and use Amazon EC2 servers for practice. Is that a reasonable approach with no experience? I know there are intensive programs you can take, but they seem like they're more for corporations to train up someone in house fast, but for a hefty price for an individual to pay."
35ryew,5,2015-05-12,My [21F] ex [22M] is still controling me after 2 months apart!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35ryew/my_21f_ex_22m_is_still_controling_me_after_2/,"I'm going to give you some backgroung, so you can see how controling he was during our relationship: I dated this guy, B, for almost 3 years. As far as i can remember the first year was great, we were each other's first romance and everything was rainbows and roses! Then, the problems began. We started to argue a lot over things that don't matter and mostly because he had a really closed mind (for example, we once argued for almost 3 hours because he insisted that the only correct way to write is the ""normal"" way, which meanm with your right hand). I tried to listen to him or even see his side but he never tried to see mine and when i didn't agree with something he was explaining his argument would always be the same: ""You don't understand what i'm saying because if you understood you would agree with me!"". So basically, whether he had a closed mind or not, he always thought he was right and that everyone and specially me, his girlfriend, should think like him. Somehow i managed to date him for 2 more years but during that time it was always this way: him trying to make me think like him otherwise consider that i was wrong (usually leading to a fight). He also didn't like that i questioned things. Then the situations became more ""serious"", in a way... One time i was spending the weekend at his place and on sunday i was supposed to go to church with his family. On sunday morning he decided that my pants were too tight for church and made me wear one of his mom's dresses. After this day i started noticing he was always very critic about my clothing, if i bought something that showed a little more skin he would put a tantrum over it. He also started controling our actions in public until it came to the point when he would blackmail me to do things (for example, emotionaly blackmail me and make me feel terrible because i couldn't go to a weding with him because i had an internship the next morning). He would pretty much oblige me to have intimacy with him (not sex because he was religious to that point). It all came to a point when my family and i were afraid he would do something bad or that could hurt me because you could see he was very much ""addcited"" to me and to controling me.

I broke up with him. He had a hard time leting go, tried to bargain and for a long time believed i'd come back to him. I gave him space but told him i was open for friendship. After some weeks he received an offer to work abroad for 3 months. Before going abroad he told me he wanted to talk to me and i said yes. He picked me up at my internship and basically locked me in his car and told me he couldn't bear the thought of someone else having sex with me and taking my virginity because for a long time he believed it belonged to him. He said he wanted to have sex with me despite his religious beliefs. I oviously called him crazy and refused. He accepted that but told me that after the 3 months my mind could change.

Present Day!
It's been 2 months since B was abroad. We haven't talked much but the few times we talked i tried to keep it simple, short and very friendly. He's good as a friend and since he was there for a big part of my life i always thought i should try to keep the friendship. But most of the time there was no talking and no connection of any kind between us. This past weekend, though, i was on a important congress and he was there as well. We said ""Hello!"" but didn't exchange other words. It's important to mention that that day i was wearing some braids Lagertha style (from the vikings) because later that day he came to me and asked ""So, now you use braids?"" to which i answered ""Yes, to try new things"" and the conversation ended there. I went home and he went abroad again. I thought it was the end of it but 2 days after the meeting he called me and was very nervous to ask me something until finally he asked ""What did you mean with trying new things?"" but i left it without an answer because i was busy at the time and couldn't talk. Again, 2 days after that (today) he talks to me on facebook just to ask ""So the new things you're trying, are they alcohol, drugs, sex..? It's not my business so you don't need to answer""..since i agree it's not his business i didn't reply. Some hours later without a reply he tried to call me on facebook!

My problem here is...he spent a relationship of 3 years trying to control me more and more. Now that we broke up he is still trying to control me (I'm not even going to talk about how poorly he knows me after 3 years to think that i would go crazy and use drugs, alcohol and sex wercklessly)! He hasn't recovered from the breakup yet and it's evident. In about a month he's coming back to our country and i'm afraid of what might happen (specially because our last encounter in his car). I was trying to keep the friendship but i'm not sure if it's possible. What would you do? Ignore? Give him a piece of my mind?

  
tl;dr: Ex keeps controling me after a 3 year relationship of control; what should i do?"

My dream is to be able to play GTA V, DA:I, The Witcher 3 all at 1080p, 60fps. 

What I have below has left me with a few extra bucks for peripherals later. After this price point for the CPU/GPU I'm not convinced the extra money is worth it. (I'm not entirely convinced the extra $70 for the i7 instead of the i5 is worth it). 

**My main concerns**

* Will this be able to play the games I want to play at 1080x60fps?
* Are there any red flags with the case, motherboard, or PSU?
* Will I have overheating issues with the stock CPU heatsink/fan?

I can get Windows through my University for free, since I'm a Computer Science student, and right now I have a 1080p monitor, and a keyboard. I might look into another keyboard just for this computer later, but I won't be buying one now.

Thanks ahead of time, I really appreciate having a second pair of eyes to look at this.

35skoi,2,2015-05-12,College Student - not sure what to do in my life,NoMotivationGuy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/35skoi/college_student_not_sure_what_to_do_in_my_life/,"So a few months back I was academically dismissed from my college, and then reinstated for this current quarter (my college runs on a quarter system).

I felt like I was a different person. I had newfound motivation and have been studying harder this term than I ever had in previous terms. I've been doing well on all of my assignments and labs, and even well in my math classes that I struggle in.

However, the amount of stress that I've been under these past few weeks has been immense. It's been so bad that I've actually begun to have suicidal thoughts. I kinda realized it the other day that I actually was thinking about the different ways I could take my life. I was thinking about how I would do it, the pain I would feel, and how life around me would go on after I was gone, and I know I don't want to think like this. It scares me. I don't think I could ever go through with this, because I know how devastated my family would be if I were to (especially my sister), but it's still very scary for me to be thinking like this.

Honestly, I think what I really want to do is withdraw from all of my classes for this term, and just take a break from classes. I don't think I'm ready for it yet. Ever since my grandfather passed away last November, I've been a different person. It was a very sudden death and the first real family death that I've been old enough to really understand, so it's really impacted me in a difficult way. My mind hasn't been in the right place and I've just been thinking and living completely differently from how I was previously. It was the main reason that I was academically dismissed last term. I *thought* that I was over it, and that's why I attempted this term, but I was completely wrong. I'm not. I'm nervous to tell my parents about this, because I really don't want to disappoint them and I know that me getting dismissed last term was very hard for them to deal with. They want me to go to college and be successful, but I don't think I'm ready enough to finish my degree yet. 

The last day to withdraw from classes is this Friday, and I'm unsure of what to do. If I were to stay in my classes I probably would do alright, but there's no guarantee. I really think I want to withdraw from my classes and take a break, but I'm not sure how to really tell my parents this. The other big issue is that if I were to take a term off, I would likely be staying home instead of at my apartment by my college, which would mean that I would either need to find a person to sublet my lease for the summer, or just keep paying the rent for the months that I wouldn't be there. Finding someone this close to summer term would probably be near impossible, so I would be forced to pay my rent, which actually means my parents would be paying rent, even though I'm not even going to be living there. I mean, this actually would be cheaper than paying for a college semester and having it wasted, but still.

And also, I don't know what I would even do over the summer if I were to take a break. I want to get a job, but it's likely that most jobs would be taken by now by the highschool students there. I MAY be able to get an internship at my parents work, which is where I worked already during my freshman summer (freshman year we don't have classes during the summer term). But at the same time, I'm not sure if work is what I really need right now. I really want to spend the summer getting myself back together. I want to lose weight and get back into shape. I want to eat better. I want to get my drivers license (I was always putting it off in high school, and never have the time to do it now especially since I don't have a car at college to practice driving). I know that my parents are probably going to tell me to take a course at the community college over the summer, so maybe that would be a good idea.

So yeah. I honestly don't know what I'm looking for by posting here. I just needed to write this all down and let it all out somewhere. I guess I'm actually asking quite a few questions here:

Should I withdraw or should I stay(definitely leaning towards the withdraw though)? How should I tell my parents if I choose to withdraw? What should I do with my free time if I do withdraw?

I definitely dont want to apply until i meet all requirements because I want them to see that I can follow directions, but if its not possible for me to take my internship and transfer it to credits than I have only 2 choices: either change my entire degree of study (fuck that) or else I wont ever qualify to intern there and im fucked.

To make matters worse, a lot has happened over the past few months that has been, for lack of a better phrase, a living nightmare. Those of you who know me, they know what I'm taking about. (if your curious, PM me. I'm grateful that you would want to support me, I just don't want to dump heavy emotions onto everyone here.)

On top of that, this summer is filled with classes I need to retake, an internship that stars next week, developing project ascension, and being with my girlfriend.

That being said, you probably know where this is going. As many have done in the past, and will do in the future, I'm *not leaving the plounge.* I feel accepted here, and if it wasn't for this community, I would be in an extremely dark place right now.

This has proven difficult as nearly every Business Systems Analyst / Business Analyst role that I have looked into is very business-focused (lots of Excel work - which I would like to avoid). I've looked at over 20+ job openings and they all require strong Excel skills and nothing more, to my disappointment. Do you guys have any recommendations on other job positions to look into? I now have IT Analyst on my list, but I know the ""Analyst"" in the title usually means grunt work in the field of IT. I have basic programming skills (much stronger on the front-end) that I’d like to use, but anything with “Engineer” in the job title is pretty intimidating. What is a title besides Business Analyst that allows me to truly get the best of both worlds?

Some information about my background:  
I’m 23, so nobody likes me.

I only have one year of professional experience: I'm currently in a two-year long IT rotational program at a large IT company. In my first rotation, I was a Business Analyst - business requirements gathering, business process analysis, documentation, etc. In my current rotation, I am an Application Developer (in DevOps). I have two more rotations following this technical one, but I am set on finding a new job.

I graduated from a business school in May 2014, majoring in Corporate Finance and Accounting and (unofficially) Computer Information Systems. I had work study jobs as a Help Desk Consultant, Software Analyst/Hardware Technician, and Website Designer.

I completed an internship at a large insurance company as a Business Systems Analyst Intern and worked at a well-known university's help desk for two and a half years.

For one, I spent some more time getting my undergraduate degree from a state school because I didn't really know what I wanted to do and didn't want to waste a lot of money figuring it out. She, on the other hand, is very focused and completed an accelerated program at a private university; she is on track to finish a graduate program next year. She's extremely smart and I am so proud of her as her older sister. Another big difference between us is that I worked a lot during undergrad and made my own money.  Since she has been in this accelerated program straight out of high school, she has been completely insulated from the real world and has been spending my parents' money ever since. She once complained about an internship because she had to work eight hours a day! For lack of a better word, she's extremely spoiled. My parents of course have offered me assistance financially and I lived at home while going to school but I was more reluctant to take their money, especially knowing how much my sister's program costs. After I graduated, I worked for a while and eventually decided to take the same career path my sister was on and applied to the same school (as well as others with the same program)...and got in! My family was thrilled.

A couple of times, however, she has taken jabs at me that suggest that she thinks she's better than me. My thought is that I shouldn't use other people's success as a meter stick against my own, as long as the end result is positive. There is no one path to one's success, as long as that person gets there. The fact that she is finishing school before me, as my younger sister, really doesn't bother me and for some reason, I think that gets to her. For example, every time I say something pertaining to the program, she always has to say something to ""pull rank"" so to speak. I changed my email signature to something more professional to suggest my upcoming graduate school enrollment and she had to message me to nitpick about my wording choice...even though my email signature format was copied from previous correspondence with other students. Even when we discuss scientific articles with each other, she HAS to argue with me even if we agree on the same conclusion, as if she's asserting her intelligence over mine. I've never thought much about these individual incidents before...until a particular incident got me thinking. 

She was home for a weekend and we were talking about where our HS/old friends had ended up. The rest of her friends are all graduating from undergrad this year so we were talking about where they were going next. I forget how the conversation transpired but she said something along the lines of, ""well you wouldn't understand because most of your friends aren't very educated."" I asked her what she meant by that and she said, ""well, &lt;your best friend&gt; still isn't in school."" Full disclosure, I do have a number of friends around my age that have not graduated college yet. My best friend however, had to drop out because of serious health issues (in and out of surgery) and is just enrolling again this year. My sister knows that, and still named her as an example, which I think is unfair. I know that her small group of HS friends all went to universities straight after graduating HS but like I said, there is no one path to one's success. I ended the conversation calmly, but I said something like, ""You really think your friends are better than mine? That's a shitty way to think.""

Even after that incident, she hasn't stopped the small, hurtful barbs. I really think she needs to check her ego at the door, but she gets argumentative with me when I suggest she humble herself and denies any wrongdoing. I've talked to my mother about the situation, and she agrees with me and sees what is happening. She's even agreed to talk to my sister about her issues when she is home next weekend. I still don't know if my sister is harboring some kind of resentment towards me (perhaps jealousy or some sort?) but I really would like to figure it out so we can go back to being amiable. So Reddit, how am I going to approach this situation without setting my sister off?

TLDR; Younger sister said some hurtful things that suggest she thinks she's better than me and is always trying to ""pull rank"" on me, even though we are in the same grad program (where she is graduating before me). Help?"

I barely graduated high school on time. I tried to go to college directly after high school but dropped out after my first semester because I was beyond not interested. I started going back when I was 21 and I finished enough credits for my 2 year degree by 24 but never actually got it. I moved to another stated around this time and I didn't actually enroll again until the summer of 2012. I've been going to college at least part time, some semesters full time, since then and I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall. I have had above a 3.0 this entire time except this semester. Last semester I took 3 classes and ended up having to drop one and then this semester I took another 3 and it honestly looks like I might have to retake them all. Half way through I just completely lost interest. There was one day in particular where I went to school to drop everything, but my girlfriend talked me out of it. So I stuck with it but I don't think it's going to matter. Depending on how I did on finals I will have between 9-12 classes left to graduate. I decided to take the summer off but I am having a really hard time finding the motivation to register for fall if I have to retake everything. The other problems are that I'm just not interested in my major. I started as an art major but when I transferred I lost about 6 classes. I realized that I needed to go to school for something that can help me make money, not a hobby. So now I'm doing computer information systems and I feel super out of place compared to my class mates. They are all in the IT field already and while I did an internship, I just have almost no interest in the material. I feel like college just isn't for me and I'm going to graduate when I'm 35. I don't know what to do."
35sp7h,3,2015-05-13,I killed myself and failed,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/35sp7h/i_killed_myself_and_failed/,"Nearly four months ago, my existence as I knew it came to an end. 

For the past year and a half, I willingly put myself through constant physical, mental and emotional abuse. I didn’t know any different, how could I? I had never really dated before and it was new for me. I wanted so badly for things to work and I sacrificed everything — time, money, friends and family — for a girl who couldn’t seem to be bothered to think about anybody but herself. Rich, spoiled, daddy issues, immature, young, rude and privileged, she was nothing like me. In spite of the differences, I fell in love with her. 

When the hitting, spitting and criticisms started, I assumed that this would only ever be temporary; she loved me and would treat me right, eventually. 

Yet six months in and infidelity was a problem. You crept around with your ex-boyfriend, lied about it, got caught and then made me the bad guy. Everybody told me to leave you and I didn’t. Months later, my old crush reached out to me and I turned her down for you, for us. Only two months later you would cheat on me and begin another hidden relationship. 

The next eight months would be miserable as you never gave me the time of day and lied to me whenever you were bothered to spend time with me. I broke up with you and you demanded that I take you back only to dump me months later. 

Your family and friends deceived me and enabled you to cheat when distance was your enemy. In the end, I was the bad guy for telling you that I knew and wouldn’t be your friend. 

Since January, I’ve lost tons of weight, gotten into great shape, earned excellent grades, rekindled neglected friendships and transferred to a larger school. On top of that, I got published and got my dream internship. I realize that the relationship was toxic and counseling has helped. 

And yet it still hurts to know that all of this happened and that you chose the other guy over me. I still have not moved on and it sucks. For all of the bad experiences and changes I am still the same. I threw out my old life and changed in so many ways to improve, and I still can't seem to feel better. 

As much as I hate what happened, it still hurts me to think it's done. I transformed myself and bettered myself, but I still can't really get it together. "

After stretching out and nearly settling nicely into dreamland, I notice my ankle is itchy. I give it a good scratch with my toenail from my other foot. Ah, that's better.

Now it feels wet. What the hell. Being a warm night, I assume it is sweat and try to go to sleep. 

Soon, my ankle is soaked. I get up and stumble to the bathroom. I switch the light on and notice a ketchup stain on the wall. ""how the fuck did that get there?"" I wonder. 

I look down and my ankle and foot are COVERED in blood. What's worse is the fact that my ankle is *pissing out a fucking horizontal stream of blood*. I proceed to plug the hole with one finger, and call my girlfriend, all whilst acting like a wounded soldier on Omaha beach. I roll on to my back, bawling on the phone to my girlfriend, and realize my apartment looks like a murder scene. My pressure hose ankle has sprayed blood all over my white walls.

I lay on my back for a good 15 mins, trying to get the blood to stop. Legit thought I had somehow contracted haemophilia and this was the end. But naturally, the bleeding eventually subsided and I cleaned all the goddamn blood off my walls.


Now, with my ankle covered in bandaids and a big ass sock, I'm trying to get back to sleep and feeling like a buffoon for scaring the crap out of my poor girlfriend.

TLDR - scratched my itchy ankle, ended up causing what looked like a scene from Kill Bill"

I've been invited to an on-site interview for a summer internship which deals with the application of computer vision in the domain of traffic monitoring. 


There are many resources out there that one can use for general computer science / software development interviews, but as a CV specialist, I'm more interested in the kinds of questions that can be put forth regarding CV and its applications.  



FYI I'm a graduate student who has some experience with robotics as well as a CV course uber my belt, so I'm looking for questions that will challenge me at an appropriate level.


So, /r/computervision, what kinds of questions would you ask me? I'm looking forward to reading all your answers.


Thanks!"

I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science, and was unsuccessful in my search for a summer internship.  Thus, I have from at least May 15 to August 28 to devote to developing a personal project; depending on the scope of the project, I might decide to turn this personal project into my capstone project (the equivalent of a senior thesis) and extend the project deadline to at least May 2016.  So, I potentially have a lot of time to work on this.

I also have a lot of passion for the game and would like to somehow give back to the community.  Therefore, I would like to pose a question to the community here:

*What would you like to see in terms of a software contribution to the Dota 2 community?*

Now, by software contribution, I mean potentially any of the following:

* Web application
* Website
* Desktop application
* Mobile application
* Perhaps a combination of the above

Some questions to guide your suggestions:

* What kind of problems do you have using other software services within the Dota 2 community?
* What are some features your favorite services lack?
* What services just don't exist that you would like to see and use in the future?
* What difficulties do you come across while playing the game or interacting with the community that could potentially be solved by software?

I am currently halfway through my finals week, so I'm going to cut the post off here.  I will be actively responding to comments if there are any further questions about what I am trying to accomplish here.  I greatly appreciate any feedback the community can give me.  Let me know what you want to see!

Edit: formatting of the bullet points."

Now I'm too busy with work, school and sleep. Sometimes I wish I could just go back to being a student with no job, no major responsibilities and enjoy the carefree life once again. But I know that's not possible. I have car insurance, braces, rent, and food to pay for. 

Luckily I got my first internship half a year ago while I was still 20 years old. Turns out the job was a curse and a blessing. I enjoy working with everyone there, the company buys me lunch everyday, pays $27 an hour, and is flexible with hours. But trying to juggle work and school is really wearing me out. I guess I don't know what I want right now and am just trying to find the right balance to keep me happy. Maybe I just need to pick up a hobby on weekends or find something or someone to look forward to. At this point I feel like I'm close to my goals but at the same time not where I want to be at right now.

Just a little midnight thinking before I sleep and repeat my cycle again tomorrow. Thanks for listening"

We fight, but it's gone down a lot since we lived apart (minus summers) freshman and sophomore years of college.

I always supported her dating and tinder meet-ups. And normally she is accepting of mine. But since we moved in together in our first real apartment, she has been ""momming"" me constantly, and not just about dating.

I don't work until June because it's an internship (paid), but she sees me as lazy. But I have freelance work set up and I have been the only one really unpacking the apartment in common areas (tv, living room, kitchen).

Anyways, I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 10 mos who was 26. I have always been attracted to older men. I once went out with a man who was 34 when I turned 18. Yes it was extreme, but I am adventurous and prefer older men who are more established and know what they want in life (and can hold a conversation).

Anyways, I broke up on Sunday. And I am not one to weep or mope about a mutual break up. In fact, I feel relieved and want to move on. So I joined Tinder again and met someone. He is 29.

My sister was initially supportive, so I set up a coffee date at a nearby Starbucks in case he ended up being an axe murderer.

It lasted very long and I was having a lot of fun, flirting and making out. I texted her back occasionally, but honestly forgot because I was wrapped up in a good time.

I was out for maybe four hours and contacted her back 2 hours in that I was okay. She then proceeded to call me for 15 minutes straight, and I finally saw her calling. She flew off the handle and was loud enough on my phone that my date could hear her screaming.

She accused me of not loving her enough to know if I had gotten brutally raped or beaten by my date. And furthermore called him a ""dirty old man"". He is none of the above and I was mortified! He suddenly saw me as a child and I felt embarrassed that someone who was supposed to be supportive of my dating life was now acting like I had a curfew!

She ended the call by saying she didn't even want to see me when I got home and not to even knock on her door. She even ratted on me to my mother, and made it sound like I was going out with a senior citizen or something, and that I hadn't contacted her all night and was probably getting gang banged in an alley.

I am so furious about it. *Any tips on how I can help her see that I do not need to be ""mommed"" yet let her know I am thankful that she cares?* I mean, I just can't have her judging my dating pool just because she wouldn't date them herself. *Do you think it is because she sees me as an extension of herself and wants me only with people she could see herself with?* I'm really hurt right now...
   
**tl;dr**: Twin sister is trying to dictate who I date and how I live. Freaked out over older Tinder date."
35trsk,1,2015-05-13,"Tripping at the dinner table, and other strange happenings(x-post /r/LSD)",dinnertabletripping,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/35trsk/tripping_at_the_dinner_table_and_other_strange/,"Decided to write about a very curious trip that happened around the holidays a few years back. Not looking for criticism, just want to share a pretty crazy story with you guys.

""I walked outside to a crisp, beautiful Sunday morning. I thought ""Well, I don't have anything important to do today, and its a beautiful day, I might as well trip."", so I dropped a hit of lucy and began to walk down through the neighborhood to go trip in the woods. I passed my friend's house and he ended up being home. I heard a call to me and we sat on the back porch to smoke cigarettes. Pulled out a pipe and some bud and packed a bowl from my bag for us to pass time with. I was kinda getting fed up with waiting, and I figured the best way to kickstart my trip was through the magical herb of marijuana. It kickstarted my trip, and we went to go to a spot in the woods where our other friends would meet us. 

We arrived at the spot and met up with one other friend, and chilled in the woods. Mostly because we were bored, and I was perfectly fine with it while tripping. By this time, I was definitely beginning the come-up, and was enjoying watching the ground warp. We sat on a log going half way across a creek, and smoked jays as I watched the running water get disturbed by a stick sticking out of the water. The water broke apart from itself and flowed into timid ripples, forming a fibonacci-esce pattern. At this point in the trip, I began to realize something. A manifestation, an ominous stray thought, a string on the infinite continuum of thoughts had been plucked. My conscious called to me, “The universe is infinitely complicated.”. Anything can be infinitely and continuously perceived, from minor details to large characteristics, and possibilities of different thoughts are endless. Simple thoughts started as a thread that stemmed on, and on, and on, and on, basic details became intensely complex, as I grasped the idea that all humans as a whole have only scraped the surface of consciousness and possibilities of what we can perceive, sense, and view. The universe is only as vast as you’re willing to explore. This realization ultimately changed the way I would think about situations I was in for the better, and taking into consideration every possibility, reaction, and counter reaction. This, intern, eased my somewhat intense paranoia in my day to day life from then on. 

As I began my peak in the woods, we heard rustling from the other side of the creek, which was home to another neighborhood. My friend noticed kids on the other side moving towards us. As they got closer, we saw that they had BB guns, and were hiding behind the trees. At this point, I’m surprised I wasn’t bugging out, thinking the kids were cops and coming down to take us out. Then, when they started shooting at us, I’m even more surprised I was having an amazing time taunting the kids while hiding behind an uprooted stump. We ran out of the woods to meet with another friend, while dodging the onslaught of plastic beads flying towards us. The next few hours consisted of buying cigarettes, walking around, and smoking blunts. A good thing to note; cannabis definitely increases my trip for the better, I’ve heard many other things from different people, but I take comfort in the fact that it doesn’t affect me negatively. Maybe because I use cannabis almost every day. Who knows.

Anyway, to preface the next string of events, I was still living in my parent’s house. My parents are also very traditional, in that they like me home for dinner if I’m bunking with them. The typical “my house, my rules” rule. I totally forgot to tell my mother that I planned to eat out so I could enjoy my trip. I walked home through the neighborhood, watching people setting up Christmas decorations and lights on their houses while blasting electrical instrumental psychedelic music. It was a beautiful experience, and as a side note I’d suggest this to anyone who may be tripping around the holiday season. Although, while trying to control my posture and walk cycle, I found my self twitching with excitement and slight discomfort alike. I had been walking all day with a backpack, and my spine had begun to ache purely from the exhausting effort of tripping in the first place. 

Every part of my brain was focused on acting normal once I walked through my door, by that time I was still tripping. I sat in my basement, practically laying in my chair due to the discomfort in my spine. I sat, and waited to be called to the table. 

Thanksgiving leftovers. What was probably a normal proportion seemed like my plate was about to overfill. Eating while tripping was weird enough for me, but eating at a dinner table was taking it to a whole other level. Acting normal was increasingly complicated as I shoveled turkey into my mouth, which I could barely feel, and cut pieces of meat which I thought I could fit in my mouth without choking. It was horrifying. It was tedious. I danced on the extremely delicate line of good and bad trip. Being stoned at the table is one thing, but tripping at the dinner table truly kicked the intensity of the whole experience of gathering to eat up to a whole other level, especially when your father was a retired law enforcement officer. Worrying about my actions, like cutting my food, looking upward from my plate and staring at the pet bird, making sure at almost molecular levels that I was acting the way I was suppose to be acting while at the same time, not. While completely keeping my cool, I conversed with my mother while the space around her head began to fill with blue, purple and green square patterns and vectors and the wood table’s grains warping. It was like holding a glass of water while riding a skateboard, trying not to let any water drop from the glass. It was meticulous, convoluted, and just plain nuts, and somehow I handled it with such finesse. It was an experience that I’m somewhat glad happened, but I’m not interested in rehashing. It helped me realize my abilities of physical and mental control on psychedelics, whose purpose is to release the burden of control. After I was done, I put my dishes away, grabbed my shit and practically ran out the door. 

Ended up leaving after I ate to go to a friends house to do, what else, smoke blunts. Told my friends about the experience, which was hard due to me coming down and giggling randomly. I went home, and in a bout of insomnia, didn’t sleep all night. Went to school in the morning, completely exhausted and functioning purely on caffeine and sugar, on the verge of passing out all day. "" 

TL;DR - Dropped lucy, got shot at by kids in the woods (really), smoked a lot of weed, and ate dinner with my straightedge family while still tripping. Wild experience."

Now I can't decide if I should reapply again now that the cooldown period has actually passed. 

-------

I interned for one of the smaller top companies last summer. At the end of the summer I wasn't extended a return offer, and my mentor told me that I would probably be a better fit at one of the bigger, older companies because they move more slowly and allow their new grads more time to grow.

I agreed with him, and so decided I probably wouldn't reapply once the company's 6 month cooldown period after my internship was over. BUT about a month after I left, my school's recruiter contacted me and offered me an interview. I took the interview, though I was surprised as they told me they strictly didn't reinterview interns so soon after their internship, and afterwards talked to my mentor who'd told me he had negotiated an early interview for me, *even though* he had said that thought I would be better off elsewhere. I can't decide if he changed his mind or just really hoped that he was wrong.

I was so nervous about the interview that I failed it, and I've passed the 6 month cooldown period since that interview without finding a job. Should I reapply again and hope he was wrong if I do get the job, or do I run the risk of losing credibility at the company?"

I know how the process of recovering from one is like.

I dated J for only 5 months, but I felt like it was one of the best relationships I've ever had. And as typical and cliche it is to say that, I genuinely believe it to be true. However, I was his first girlfriend, and at the beginning of the last month when we dated he confessed that he was starting to get urges to date other girls. Both of us cried, and he said things that really messed with my mind, things like ideally he would want time to date other girls, and then come back to me, and that if we were older things would be different, and he was young, etc. He said that our relationship was great but he felt conflicted. 

We gave each other a few days break, and he eventually decided that he wanted to keep dating me. But J was graduating college soon, so 2 weeks later I asked him what was going to happen to us after graduation. He said he wanted to break up. Needless to say, I was devastated, but we eventually agreed to keep dating until his graduation date. However, I was really conflicted and insecure during the couple of days we tried to do this, and eventually kept trying to talk him into staying together (if he were to get a job in the same area, since I'm a junior and still have one year left). I could tell he was a little torn between how he felt about me and him not wanting to be ""tied down"" by me if hypothetically, he got a job in the same area, since we would still have to spend the summer apart because I had an internship elsewhere. 

But in a couple of days it culminated into him outright saying that we should break up, and that it was not working. 

It's been 2 weeks since then, and I can't help but replay the great times we've spent together and the words he initally said to me. I still have strong fantasies that in a couple of months he'll realize what a great relationship he lost and come back to me. I know it's incredibly unhealthy to do that, so I guess I'm trying to get some sense slapped into me, haha.. 

When I broke up before I knew the relationship was over, and was able to accept that pretty quickly. But since I feel like we broke up over stupid reasons (his immaturity, wanting to date other girls, etc.) for what was in my eyes a great relationship, I'm still having trouble letting him go, and genuinely believing that this relationship is over. I keep hearing stories about relationships that end because one person has the grass is greener syndrome, and then comes back eventually. 


TL;DR: Ex boyfriend broke up with me, I still have strong fantasies he'll eventually come back. Please help slap some sense into me. :( "

ok so, i really can't be arsed to do anything today so my plan was to hit the park and smoke a j. then i was going to walk around the park and drink water and listen to music. i decided to smoke on the bridge, cause less people go there so i won't be offending anyone who doesn't like it.

not long after  i got there, i was taking the j out of its holder and an old man came up near me. i put it back in my pocket and he said ""it's a fun game, isn't it? :)"" 

i was like ""yeah man, this shit is beautiful. you've gotta enjoy this weather cause it's probably going to rain tomorrow"" (general moan about the country)
after some small talk, he started telling me about himself and what he did for a living. 
He was a supplier for garden stuff, and he supplied garden supplies to the people who supplied the supplies to independently owned shops and centres.
i told him about how i'd love to live in canada after university, he seemed interested and asked me about some things. for the next 10 minutes he told me about an internship he had on the east coast of america. i was like ""fuck yeah wu tang"", but he said couldn't really get into rap. it wasn't awkward though, he just carried on talking 

then he started telling me about the places he had visited (please note he is self employed, so he can take holidays as often as he wants and generally for how long he wants. he was big on thailand. we had like 15 minutes of conversation just on his first visit to thailand. 

he then moved on to the wedding he was attending tomorrow. it was a gay wedding, and he himself was a gay man. he said he knew one of the grooms from childhood so he was quite excited for it.

erm, i think the next thing he told me about was how shitty it is getting to thailand. compact seats and all that. he told me about how much fun i would have, and about how he took a 17 year old muslim boy to thailand a few times. the first time he went he was mindblown and all this shit, the second time they couldn't see as much because they only went for three weeks. he seemed genuinely disappointed about this, so idk if i would say he was lying about it.

i can't be bothered writing down what he said for the next part, because it was simply him describing the best bits of his holidays - although beautiful, not really important :( 

after he told me about some cool shit in thailand, i said ""wow i'd like to go there one time"" and he immediately came back with ""you should, i will pay for it"" and laughed straight away
i just tried to get past that shit though, so i said ""haha, imagine"" 
and just started talking about a holiday i had

the conversation steered to thailand again, and he told me about a city in the north. he kept talking about how it was the best place he had ever been to, but only for four months of the year. tbh, it did sound pretty dope, but anyway      i said i would check the place out, and clarified the name of the city. he said he would write it down for me, so he got a piece of card out of his pocket. it threw me off a bit cause there was writing on it already. it later turned out to be his name, email and mobile number (but i didn't find this out until just before he left)

spoke some more about things, and then he started telling me about how rich he is. he has a two bedroom flat (he rents this out), a 4 bed house (lives in it with his husband/alone), has his business, has shares in several companies and has more than enough money to retire. he wasn't really boasting, it came off the back of conversation about moving to thailand - i suggested this cause he said he'd been there like 15 times or more

he asked what i was doing up here, i said i was about to smoke a joint and look at the park. i offered him some and he said he doesn't really smoke it, although he doesn't have a problem with it. some of his friends are heavy smokers, but the only times he had it were before he was about to have sex (but this was rare)

he told me to email him if i wanted to see picture of the city in thailand, but he only checks his inbox once a day; ""people text me if they need me."" 

he then said he needed to go, and pulled out £20 and tried to give it me. i was like wtf man and didn't want to take it, but he wouldn't move his hand so i just took that shit. he asked for my name and i was too shook (scared to look, cause aint no such things as halfway crooks) to think of a fake one. *he told me the money was for my holiday fund

he shook my hand and then walked away. i pulled my phone out, checked how many songs had played while he was there and then lit the joint and watched him get smaller as he walked away. that shit was weird though, i fucked off my walk in the park and I'm sad now. power walked home and told my sort-of-sister.

so can somebody tell me what his game was? 

EDIT: now that i have thought about it, i think my fake name has to be iqbal fernandez"

35uljg,16,2015-05-13,Discussion about the /r/rawdenim theme week concept,gravrain,rawdenim,https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/35uljg/discussion_about_the_rrawdenim_theme_week_concept/,"Hello /r/rawdenim, lets talk about theme weeks! 

So, we've had [a few so far](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/wiki/themeweeks) and I think that everyone here kinda gets the idea: I beg people to post pictures from a specific brand. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm trying to have as little of an impact into the lives of the people I solicit, so I do try and give them a few days notice and sometimes we get a lot of posts and sometimes not. It's a function of how many people in the sub own a pair from a company and have talked about it in the past. 

There are a few points that I do want to address as to my thoughts about some things that have been asked about the theme week concept:

**1. Schedules** - I do like the idea of scheduling brands out a few months so that if you wanted, you could plan a post for that theme week. Or remember to come by the sub more often that week if you were interested in that brand. *However*, I don't want the fact that we have a schedule to keep people from posting. We'd also have to come up with a fair way to pick a schedule. And getting people to agree about specifics like this is never easy.

**2. Ownership** - I would like to actually turn over the concept to the mods and have /u/RawDenimAutoMod be the one to post the theme week announcement. This will give the concept a little more legitimacy, and not have it be just some random dude (me) trying to get people to post pictures. I'm still willing to work on the back end though, with researching users with a pair from the brand for the next theme week and trying to solicit posts from them. So I wouldn't just be abandoning the project. Anyone else who wants to help should definitely let me know!

**3. The possibility for guerilla advertising** - Maybe I'm just being paranoid about having my fake reddit name dragged through the mud, but I see there being a possibility that some dastardly denim company, Company X, trying to buy their way onto the schedule and then hitting the sub with a bunch of basically targeted marketing with posts about their jeans. And this is another reason I want to move the concept owndership over to the mods. We are not a huge community, but almost 23k members is probably enough for fiendish Company X to have their intern spend an afternoon creating user accounts and pictures of product to target. 

This is a drawback to the schedule I guess. Again, maybe I'm just being paranoid.

**4. The possibility of not having any posts** - So when I choose Ande Whall and Studio D'Artisan I knew we would see a fair amount of posts. I really wanted to see what would happen when we had a theme week for a very rare brand in these parts though, so I picked ALD for the next one. The Atelier LaDurance theme week only generated a single post, but it was from a user who I didn't solicit. There were two other people who said that they would try and get postings up, but life happens and they got busy. No big whoop. I do think its cool that we got an unsolicited post though, and it kind of validates the concept in my mind. 

But, after a few theme weeks we will run into the problem of theme-ing brands that won't generate a lot of content. Do we still move forward when we have a week without any posts? 

**5. [Raw Denim Library Project](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/2bey92/the_rrawdenim_library_discussion_and_explanation/)** This is such a helpful tool for researching people to talk to. I'm just going to try and promote it as much as I can. 

So yeah, I'm interested in seeing what everyone has to say about this. 

**EDIT**

**6. Theme Week Frequency** - /u/minkusdominkus brought up this point that I completely forgot to add into this post. How frequent should the theme weeks be? After the first Ande Whall one, I waited a month before posting the Studio D'Artisan one (I think). And then waited three weeks before posting the Atelier LaDurance one. Would either be preferable? Would it be better to have the theme weeks be the last week of every month, for example?"

35uq15,1,2015-05-13,[Vent] Incredibly disappointed in myself,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/35uq15/vent_incredibly_disappointed_in_myself/,"It all started to go downhill about a week ago. A girl that I had been crushing on for half the semester drunkenly let me know that she had had a crush on me for about 70% of the semester, but now she was over me. It wasn't a big deal because I don't plan on dating at all during college nor do I feel like I have the time to invest in relationships.

My finals were from the 8th until yesterday. I had started studying on the 26th and was pretty gung-ho about all my exams except Physics E&amp;M as my professor had tried to cover six chapters of material in six classes (since he was gone for four weeks at the beginning of the semester), which obviously didn't work out. Anyhow, he expected us to know all of it and I just did not understand any of it. However, I didn't go to office hours or recitation because none of the TAs (this is not an exaggeration) are good at teaching. Come the final, I thought I had everything down, I had gone through all of the homework, the exams, practice exams, labs, everything and was at about 90% proficiency. Boy, was I wrong. The final fucking wrecked me, I was hoping for a 75 at that point. Guess what I got: a 50. I needed a 55 for a B, but I now have a C+.

Same with my Mass &amp; Energy exam. I needed a 76 to get a B, I got a 73. I had also gone through all the practice exams and exams and homework, roughly 30 hours of studying. I had felt relatively confident about the exam, but I was wrong yet again.

Then there was my general engineering exam that I thought I had done well, but apparently for the programming practical, I had submitted the wrong final, so my max grade on the final would be an 83. I know this was 100% my fault and I had shown my teacher my code as he wanted to know that I understood the coding material. He saw that it was perfect and congratulated, but I didn't ask for a grade change nor would he have been willing to give one for good reason.

So now here I am, with maybe a 2.6 GPA my second semester of college. I'm in a few organizations, but I'm not active in any of them because I spend all my time doing homework or chilling out with my friends and I didn't think much about not being active until I spoke with my brother yesterday. I also plan on graduating in three years and a yearlong coop, so I need to get a coop opportunity in the fall, but with my shitty GPA, I know I won't. My people skills can be spectacular, but I know I'll end up being anxious about my shortcomings.

This summer I'm taking classes at a college in the city, which is putting me in even more debt, but it's still better than paying for another two semesters at my university. I've applied to hundreds of jobs and internships, but none of them have hired me. I almost got hired at two, but their peak times of operation are when I'm going to be in class (9 AM - 1 PM). I've tried applying to  be a volunteer at a ton of machine shops, bike coops, and other mechanical related places, but they either ignore me or reject me.

Last of all, I've consistently been wondering throughout the semester if I even have what it takes to be a chemical engineering and now I'm starting to think that I don't. If I'm failing in the beginner's courses, then I sure as hell won't be able to get through this program. Actually, my school does a general engineering program then after your first year, you switch into your intended major if you have a 3.0. At this point, I may not be able to even get into ChemE because of my GPA. My peers and friends are ultra-competitive and think I'm dumb, which infuriates me because I won regional and national academic awards in high school, got a 2340 on my SAT without studying, and have a treasure trove of knowledge and common sense that allows me to quickly remedy problems in a domestic situation.

I know my parents think I'm a failure because they told me that yesterday when I came home. They think that I'm digging myself into a deep hole because I'm taking out loans to do something that I suck at. I should be mindful of their advice since my dad's an engineer and my mom's a chemist and they know what I'm going through.

I think my choices have put me in a shithole that I won't be able to trudge out of. I think that I'm on a path that may make me unemployable. I don't know what to do, but the one thing I will not do is quit. I can't take time off of college and nor do I have the means to take a year off."
35uri2,1,2015-05-13,Anxiety,throw_away444441,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/35uri2/anxiety/,"Backstory: 
Since whenever I can remember I've struggled with anxiety. It runs in my family and my father, grandfather, and aunt all take medication for it. I've seen them have troubling and significant side effects and switch medication often as a result. In the past I've used weed to help calm my anxiety when it gets out of control. I've done this just in my own home and it has never bled into any other parts of my life as I've learned to manage my social anxiety in particular. I've found it to be a way for me to quell my mind and help me not obsess over things out of my control. It hasn't interfered with any of my school or work as I am a 3.0 engineering student and even run my own tutoring business. 

My Current Issue:
So a friend of mine works at an engineering company and suggested that I apply for one of the internships there. The only issue here being that I would be drug tested. So I knew far enough in advance (~1 month) that I would have to stop smoking. I did and had some difficulties at first which I've noticed before and ascribed these to the usual changes that occur in the first few weeks. However, I've now been clean for nearly a month and am having serious issues dealing with my anxiety. I obsess over things and can't get my mind to stop just like I did before ever smoking weed. I've practiced meditation for around 6 months and found that to be somewhat helpful, but only when the anxiety is less severe. There are times where despite meditation, distraction, etc I just can't stop obsessing and going over possible outcomes in my mind. Its beginning to effect my school work as I find myself unable to focus at the task at a hand. I have heavily researched anxiety medication and do not feel that is a good route to take as the side effects seem to often be worse than my current anxiety. I feel that I can continue to abstain from smoking but the anxiety I experience is making me miserable. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I just don't know what else to do about this. Any advice?"

I would like to have some opinion for graduate studies in the field of  data mining and machine learning.
I have secured admits in the following two courses in Canada.    
* M.Math Computer Science at University of Waterloo  
* MSc Applied Computing at University of Toronto.  

As far as courses are concerned the one at Waterloo is research oriented and the one at Toronto is aimed towards working professionals like myself (3 years software development experience in an unrelated field)  

From what i have researched on the internet, Waterloo is very well respected for its undergraduate course in computer science, but I was not able to find any feedback for the Masters course.
MSc in Applied Computing is relatively a newer course which includes an internship, although the companies involved for internships are mostly startups.  

I intend to return back to the software industry after the master's degree and would really be aiming towards working for the top companies in the field (likes of Google, Apple and MS). Any advice/resources to help me with the decision would really be appreciated."

I have 2 years left of my (BSc) Biology undergrad. After finishing I will apply for an MSc Computer Science conversion course. 

At the moment, I have some fairly basic projects up on Github, and an internship where I used MATLAB to design some psychophysics experiments.

I'm planning on adding more projects to Github, getting a bit more programming experience (internships etc), and continue learning programming, mathematics, and CS to prepare for the masters course. 



What are your experiences fresh out of uni and looking for a job in the UK? Is it really as bad as I hear? What other things could I be doing to stand out from the crowd?

I'm thinking about moving to Edinburgh or Cambridge, any other areas that are especially nice for software engineers?

35uz53,13,2015-05-13,My History and Eventual Success!,Shapeshiftr,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/35uz53/my_history_and_eventual_success/,"For me, games were both a safe haven and a limitless supply of discovery. I started playing at a very young age; my parents had banned me from playing games rated T and higher, but I would sneak on to our computer when they were out of the house and play Morrowind, a T-rated game. That was Kindergarten onward -- games were instantly compelling in my life. In 2nd grade, I discovered Runescape, and was quickly pulled into its world, playing every minute of my spare time. It didn't really help that soon enough, most of my class was playing as well, and it was the go-to bonding medium. Runescape slowly but surely worked its ways up my priority list as I started to feel insecure in my personal life, and so turned to achievement in the virtual world to replace real confidence. I remember vividly having desperate internal struggles to limit myself with Runescape, coming up with ideas kind of similar to HabitRPG to motivate myself -- I created a time bank, that for every hour of a productive activity I did, I would award myself an hour of Runescape time. Soon enough, though, I started to bend those rules to accommodate my voracious virtual appetite, letting 1 hour of productivity produce 2 hours of Runescape, and so on and so forth until the system collapsed.

In Middle School, Runescape was no longer cool, and so I was left without a virtual social medium. After searching everywhere online for something to replace the void, I found Minecraft in 7th or 8th grade, when the game had just been created. I was blown away by the world and freedom it gave me, finally feeling as if I had a medium to express myself. I started playing 6+ hours a day; it was at this point that my academics started to suffer. I'm a smart kid, and I've always been able to get by, but with all my time devoted to Minecraft, school became a low priority. My parents were also at a loss of what to do -- they've always struggled to hold boundaries, but my fierce attachment to my computer intimidated them from stepping in to stop my obsession. Soon enough, I joined what was the first clan in Minecraft, and found myself surrounded with a gang of like-minded, albeit virtual, friends. That was the last piece I had been missing -- I then felt as if I had all my bases covered; achievement, a social life, and a creative outlet. Real life seemed dull in comparison, and so I stopped doing homework just as academic rigors began to pick up. I started to push away friends and family, diving into deeper obsession with my games. At the end of Middle School, I got into Starcraft II with a couple of friends, and that would spiral my gaming into obsessive mania. It was around the same time that I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on stimulant medications to help remedy my focus issues... I realize now that although that might've had some element of truth to it, for the most part, my focus issues came from the fact that all my focus was on games. No wonder it was so hard to pay attention in school! The stimulant ADD medication sped up my mind a lot, which I found well-suited to playing Starcraft, a game that requires intense concentration and quick thinking. In addition to increasing my focus, though, it increased my anxiety level significantly. I started playing more and more Starcraft, as I thought this was the only thing that calmed me down and helped me to relax after a stressful day at school, but the opposite seemed to be true. 

I transferred to a different high school for Freshman year, the public school in town, full of kids that I didn't know and felt intimidated by. So caught up with trying to fit in and not cause any disruption, I spent my days hyper-focused on my actions and observant of everyone around me. Not having as much social experience, or so I thought, as I spent all my time online, I was worried sick that I would come across as weird or awkward to the average kid. At the end of the day, I would come home and shut myself in my room to play Starcraft until past midnight. I thought so much that it was the only thing good in my life that I began to get violently protective over my computer and privacy with my parents, threatening them if they even suggested that I should tone down my gaming, and unleashing frequent bursts of rage. Online, I fell in with several creepy characters, people who manipulated and ridiculed my constantly, but I kept coming back to them for companionship and ""enlightenment."" I had almost entirely shifted all my priorities and my whole life onto a virtual platform. When I burnt out on Starcraft, realizing my limitations, I discovered MMORPGs, such as Eden Eternal. I quickly got wildly sucked into these worlds where socialization was seamlessly integrated with an escapist fantasy universe, as well as achievement through character development. 

By 10th grade, I was hardly trying at school, falling asleep in class, or lost in my mind. Many days I would play up sickness and manipulate my mother's anxieties to let me stay home, where I would play 16+ hours in a day, regularly. When the summer hit, I was even worse. I somehow picked up a job, but spent the $1000 I made before quitting on virtual clothes and cash-to-gold transactions, so basically nothing that had value after I spent that money... I was staying up until 2-3am every day, and then getting up for work at 8am. Eventually I started falling asleep at work (not good as I was supervising kids), and this came to attention of my boss. I quit my job before I could be fired, and went back to playing games 16-18 hours a day. I had myself so convinced that this was the best I could do. Mind you, at this point I was not happy, and I knew that. I just felt as if I had dug myself into a hole so deep that although I knew that digging deeper was only hurting myself, I didn't think it possible to get out. I had gone through several therapists, none of whom dared to tackle this issue, and after a messy online relationship, I felt as if life had nothing for me anymore, that I was a sad wreck going nowhere and spending all his time trying to get the same enjoyment out of video games that he once did. I would have days sitting at my computer, just searching for a new game for 5 hours, looking for something to get me up again -- looking back at it now I see so many parallels with drug addiction. 

Well it was midway through junior year in high school that my parents decided to send me to extended rehab, first at an intensive Wilderness therapeutic backpacking trip for 3 months, and then to a therapeutic boarding school for the past 2 years. I'll spare you the details, but 5/15/2015 marks my graduation from the high school/program. I've been through a period of time, as at a certain point we are allowed to use computers and play games again, where I thought that games could be a part of my life again, and I picked up casual games. At a certain point, though, I realized that games are at their core a way to fill up time. With minor exceptions, I don't grow as a person playing games, and the time I devote to them does not yield real, broad-reaching results that benefit my life. I've found after a lot -- and I mean, a hell of a lot -- of hard work, that I can do great things with my life if I only spend my time wisely, in fulfilling areas. I have amazing friends now (in real life!! haha.), am graduating from high school very strong academically, going off to a great college, have a great internship this summer, and many skills and talents and hobbies that I'm proud of! Plus I'm in the best shape of my life! I realized that games aren't the best I can do, and that there are tons of rewarding opportunities in life that feel more real and sustainable in the happiness they provide. I realized that by opening up my heart and my eyes to the world around me, that there were discoveries to be made far more exciting than anything a game could ever provide. I'm out of that pit now, and I've committed to a firm 1 year of abstinence from video games, and so far it's going really well! Occasionally I have  a strong urge, but I'm able to divert that energy elsewhere and tell myself that it's a slippery slope, that I would just be wasting time and reinforcing old thought patterns and habits. Part of me thanks games for occupying a very important role in forming who I am today. But I realize now that they are an outdated coping mechanism, and that there is a whole world to explore out there that won't be seen from behind a computer screen. I hope that I can set an example for others around me, be able to relate and offer assistance or guidance to anyone in the throws of struggling with this stuff, or just convey a positive message, that this stuff is surmountable. Feel free to message me! Thanks!

Most of the time, it was at those inopportune moments when I was a teenager - on a date.... or worse, when I was alone... and on a ""date"".

Some folks speculated that it was my awkward teen emotional states, and quite possibly my raging hormones that brought them.  Kinda like I was giving off that type of energy that they needed to manifest themselves.  I always thought I'd grow out of it once I reached adulthood.

Boy, was I wrong.  I'm forty-two, now.  I've been experiencing these manifestations since I was able to understand what was real and what I thought was not.  Since my first incident, I'd been in and out of therapy, hooked up to monitors - hell, I'd even been studied by, so called, paranormal experts.  No one could really explain what it was that was going on, or even how I was able to bring about the presence of individuals from beyond.

Since I was twenty-three, I'd been residing at The Rhine Research Center for Parapsychology Research in North Carolina.  On a daily basis, they would put me through stress tests of all sorts - to see what it was that might actually trigger any kind of paranormal interactions between this world and the next.  

Though a small part of me really just wanted to go home and get on with my life, I was truly dedicated to finding out what it was about me that made me a portal... or ""conduit"", if you will, to bring about these entities.

Throughout the last nineteen years, I was able to manifest one hundred and twenty-two occurrences - each being more intense than the previous.  In most cases, things got broken or tossed around.  However, there were those few times that someone got hurt, or worse - as in the case of yesterday's incident that put the whole complex on red alert and brought in the federal government.

After that, the doctors told me to sit back and take a breather from my daily routines until the higher ups are through with their investigation on the matter.  I was told, at some point in my time here, to write a journal.  Though, I'd never been big on written expression and writing down my ""feelings"".

I usually remember all of my encounters.  A gift, a curse?  Call it what you will, but it stays with me for the longest time.  Take, for instance, the time I was thirteen years old (yeah, lucky thirteen).  I had the worst nightmare ever recorded in the history of nightmares.  You know those things that you know are there but you can't see them?  Yeah.  Those.  Hands clawing at me from the inside - forces pulling me from the outside, it was a mess.  I woke up, and I can still see the spots on my arms and chest where the scratches used to be.

But that's nothing compared to this latest incident.  

So, after taking the advice of my new doctor, I decided, this is it.  This is my chance to recount yesterday's happenings in all their glory - as it were.

It started off like any other day, though admittedly, I felt the usual uneasiness that accompanied an oncoming episode.  Though, as the day progressed, nothing happened, but the uneasiness kept growing inside me.  When my final session came about, I was so unnerved and fidgety that I was getting upset.  My stomach felt like it was in knots.  As Doctor Shaw asked his usual questions, I couldn't help but get angrier and angrier.  Nothing was happening.  Nothing ever happened when he asked the questions... I just wanted the day to be over with and I'd reached my boiling point.

And that's when it happened.

I tried to warn Doctor Shaw, that it was coming.  He ignored my comment and made a quick glance at the window where the interns usually looked on and monitored the activities from the next room, but they did nothing.  They just sat there, smirking.

It started with a low hum; the kind of electrical hum from a florescent light with a bad ballast.  I could feel the vibrations of everything in the room.  as the vibrations got more intense, everything in the room started to shake.  Books fell off the shelves, pens flew off the desk and that's only the beginning.

I yelled at Doctor Shaw to get out, but he just froze - looking around the room in awe.  I yelled again, but he still sat there; frozen.

As quickly as it started, it stopped.  But I knew it wasn't over.  The uneasiness was still there.  I could still hear the humming and the vibrations made me light headed - it was coming.

I looked around the room, and then back to Doctor Shaw.  He was sitting there, wide-eyed - but not with the same awe that he'd had before.  This time, it was a look of fear - fear of me.  No, he wasn't looking at me.  He was looking PAST me.  

I could feel it.  It was behind me.  I glanced at the window, noticing the same look of fear on the interns' faces.  One of them had stood up with her hands on her head in shock.  No.  It wasn't shock.  It was something else, entirely.  It was a look of pain.

She looked like she'd begun to cry, only they were tears of crimson, as a shadow emerged from behind me, and in a flash, had moved around the room in one swift motion - shattering the glass window between the interns and us.

The other intern flew backwards, smashing against the brick wall behind him, leaving a red streak on the wall behind his head as he slid down to the floor.  The other, still standing had glass, now embedded in her skin.  Her arms dropped to her sides as she stood there for a moment before succumbing to her hastened demise and falling to the floor.

I got up out of my chair and backed against the wall.  I wanted to scream in terror, but I couldn't form the sounds.  I looked back to Doctor Shaw who was still sitting in his chair, wide-eyed at what just happened, but something else was wrong.  Entirely too wrong.

The shadow was no longer in the room.  No.  Yes.  Yes it was, but it wasn't where it should be.  It was inside Doctor Shaw.  I could see his aura fading from its usual vibrant color - to black.

It wasn't Doctor Shaw any more.  His eyes were now glazed over in a shiny gray-ish tone with hints of bloodshot veins, just under the surface. His face had run pale.  The entity inside him, craned his neck and head in my direction and stared at me momentarily, before smiling at me in the creepiest fashion, I could have ever (never) dreamed.

This thing.  This being.  This entity who had taken over the body of Doctor Shaw, craned his head around the room and began to stand up - as if being pulled up by it's chest.  Once upright, he... IT turned to face me - opening his stolen body's mouth to form words.  But, instead, smiled at me again - as if it knew something; something that only other entities would need to know.

It's smile faded - right before the body of Doctor Shaw began to creak, and things internally began to snap. The entity's body started folding in on itself - contorting in a fashion that no HUMAN could ever do; bones breaking and cracking, skin tearing, and blood flowing - until there was nothing but a crumpled mess of bodily remains on the floor, no longer resembling the man I knew, just five minutes ago.

The world around me faded and swirled as I fell to my knees.  I was tired and drained.  The last thing I remembered was four more doctors standing over me - shining a pen light in my eyes.  I was cold.

Everything went black.

1. Finishing 2 yr tech school associates in IT - network 
2. Finishing 8 month internship @ medium corporate headquarters, did basic helpdesk/infrastructure stuff racking, etc.. cables reimage.
3. Wanting to possibly finish a bachelors, am all enrolled and admitted in university, all credit transfers, and am in a position to be able to not work much and finish 4yr.

We did a large project, was very monotonous, am very burnt out and not challenged @ this corporate location
(edited for anonymity :P)
Was told a position opened up at this same business on the helpdesk (not devops/netops) that supports all of these  

I am pretty luke warm about this position. Location is Midwest (not chicago)  and position is 40k with 2 weeks PTO, 401k. Hours are rotating on call with a shimmy swing schedule. 

My boss at this internship (director) is very pro me not going to finish 4yr and humping hard into a sysadmin/engineer/systems role somewhere else. His comments were ""you don't need a degree"" and ""you wouldnt like this job in helpdesk, your skillset is too far up for it"" and ""you don't need a starter job"".... But he also offered it as a possibilty when he learned I hadn't got any promising offers yet. I am a little worried about getting Siloed from the rest of devops/admin world by focusing on Point of sale.

I am burnt out from full time school and fulltime internship w/ a part time job. 

I have three choices: 

1. Finish internship, and cycle all summer with money saved up. **Start bachelors in fall** and not work or part time.
2. Gun for this position on this helpdesk i am not super enthusiastic about.
3. Go full time 4yr while working fulltime at this position.
(not going to happen I would hate my life)

For context, I had some marks on my background a long time ago. This company i intern for took a shot on me, and I will get a good reference either way. Am I commiting career suicide by continuing on for a nother 2 yrs without continual IT employment and the networking that comes from it.

35v9ut,81,2015-05-13,Lost my first data science job very quickly - how discouraged should I feel?,csds_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35v9ut/lost_my_first_data_science_job_very_quickly_how/,"Background: I'll be finishing my PhD in economics in the coming months. Along the way I had developed some proficiency in R and Python and figured that my background in econometrics could position me decently for some sort of data science position. I mean, a research position in academia would've been ideal but I wasn't going to get a good offer here, and I figured this would be comparable in desirability to a post-doc or liberal arts position.

There was an opening at a startup locally (in D.C.) that I seemed well-matched for (it asked for familiarity with several of the packages I had used in R, as well as some additional research tools), so I sent in my resume. Their software test was simple enough, although the senior dev at the firm who graded it noted that my code was functional but inefficient. Keep in mind that I was self-taught in these languages and had largely developed software for my own research and not really for a production environment. In any case, I had a couple of interviews subsequent to this, I felt that I had hit it off with the senior dev and cofounder who would become my boss, and so they made me an offer.

Since the job was local, I expressed an interest in working part time while finishing my dissertation work, moving to full time at around June 1st. I figured this would just be a nice way to ""hit the ground running"" and be familiarized with their code base and workflow at that time. Initially they made me an offer with a part-time hourly wage with the details being sketchy beyond that, but I stressed the importance that if I accepted the job, I would see it as a real commitment (the academic labor market is pretty seasonal and accepting this offer would mean forgoing other opportunities that would not exist later) and they came back with a salaried offer that would just give me partial pay while I was doing part-time work. Great. I accepted. Turned down some other places that had expressed interest (some academic, some not.)

The job: To skip ahead, I only ended up working there for about 13 days, or 3 days a week for 4 weeks with their dismissing me on the 5th week. The 1st week was more or less an orientation, and the 2nd I got put on a project to develop code to improve their main predictive model. Great. But it was obvious pretty quickly that the cofounder thought that this job should not take very long to implement, and although I was making steady progress and adding in new features to test a variety of models, my code was not well-optimized (partially because I was focusing on testing and evaluating new models rather than making the code pretty) and he expressed disappointment with the speed of its development as well as its complexity. It was repeatedly implied that the senior dev - who struck me as something of a fucking wizard, a very talented guy with elegant code but who also had the advantage of having built the entire current workflow - could have probably completed this project in a couple days, and therefore that my taking weeks (or more like 5+ days) was a problem.

I wasn't expecting this to lead to my getting dismissed, however, but it did. Despite their being apologetic about things not working out, I felt used. Looking back, I can see some activity in their hiring records indicating that they started looking for new data scientists about a week before my dismissal, which to me indicates that there must have been a judgement made very soon after they saw my code to look into replacing me, and initiated this process right afterwards. I'd like to imagine I'm being paranoid here, but the bottom line is that it seems like despite my expressing the importance of the offer representing a mutual commitment before accepting it, they ultimately viewed my time there as a trial period that I had failed within a matter of days.

Questions/thoughts:

- When they told me I was being fired, I was pretty surprised, and I said that I understood that I wasn't as good as the senior developer they had but I believed I would get there. Importantly, the level of sophistication/elegance required by their code base was far beyond anything in their relatively-simple test. So I said that they should probably develop a harder test.

- Maybe I sound incompetent. Maybe I am. Like I said, I have a familiarity with a variety of tools in R and I was able to approach the tasks given, but not with the speed/elegance that was expected of me. I'm not sure if this means that I should give up on a data science or a software career at the moment (it's difficult to convey my absolute level of competence here), or if I should just try to find a more... supportive environment, where I'll be able to develop a more-professional style through practice. This wasn't a particularly-lucrative senior development position or anything, and it makes me worry that there just might not good positions for people like me who have decent data background and also some experience with whatever software tools. I'd prefer not to end up with an internship or something that's super entry-level.

- Is this sort of thing pretty par for the course in the industry? I'd imagine in a larger firm I would've had more slack. Part of my frustration was that I was being told to expand my code to do new stuff but that it also had to be nicely-optimized and look like their production code at pretty much every stage of the process. I figured I'd just built in all the features first, then when we've decided on what models work best I'd optimize the code to integrate into the current base. Was this just a bad idea? Am I bad programmer for seeing a tradeoff here at all, or perhaps I was unwise to not try to communicate my concerns better?

I don't know. Ultimately I'm shocked and I feel somewhat incompetent right now. But I also don't feel like I was given the chance I needed to demonstrate value and pick up some of the habits that would allow me to consistently generate high-quality code. Maybe I shouldn't expect to get a job that allows me that.

**tl;dr version**: Accepted a job offer as a data scientist based on my R and Python experience on my own projects. Got fired after working for 13 days because the code for my first project was insufficiently polished. Not sure if I should just interpret this as indicating that data science won't work out for me, or if this particular firm had unreasonable expectations of me."

35ve5z,2,2015-05-13,[help] I could use your advice,MopperigeKat_,MechanicalKeyboards,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/35ve5z/help_i_could_use_your_advice/,"Today I bought my first mechanical keyboard. It's quickfire rapid-i with mx browns.

I was looking for a tenkeyless mechanical keyboard, and since I live in the Netherlands, this was one of the only boards that was available to me in a Dutch store. I have 14 days to return my product if I happen to not like it, so I went ahead and pulled the trigger.

As I'm typing this, I have used the keyboard for about 3 hours. In the beginning it felt very weird, but as time goes on it's starting to feel more comfortable. Coming from a wireless Apple keyboard, I assume it will take some time before I'm used to it.

It feels like the keyboard is very tall. I have to raise my wrists to quite a high level, and it feels quite odd. Is this normal, and will I get used to it, or is this keyboard one of the taller ones out there?

Overall, I like the keyboard, but I'm wondering if there are better choices out there. I'm traveling by bus and train everyday to my internship, where I do a hell of a lot of typing, and I would like to take this keyboard with me (if that's a realistic scenario), and I would like to know if you guys know keyboards that would fit me better."
35vgjp,0,2015-05-13,Long post about a bad day at work.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/35vgjp/long_post_about_a_bad_day_at_work/,"So I moved here a little over a month ago. I’m completely alone. I know no one here.

I went to school for a specialized field. I graduated early with honors. I accepted this job two months later. Moved here. Started four weeks ago.

I train here for 6 weeks. Except I’ve already been assigned to a completely different area, but they make all new hires go through this training even though I’ll never use it (or by the very off chance that I will).

This is week 4. There are different areas that I train in. So far, all of my supervisors have given me good marks. I know I’m a hard worker. I’m very willing to learn. I admit my mistakes and correct them. I’m the first to volunteer. 

Yesterday and today I was put in an area where they take blood, give vaccinations, etc. They have an assembly line going. They’re very fast and concentrated. Considering you have to be trained to take blood and give vaccines and I haven’t been, I couldn’t help them with much of anything. I assumed I was to stand back and watch, which is what I did. If they asked for help, I was right there and willing.

To give some background on me: I’m quite by nature. I do warm up to people and talk more, but when I first meet a group of people I tend to be a wallflower. Some see it as standoffish, but I’m not trying to be and I’m very nice to anyone who talks to me. I attempt to keep the conversation going. I’m just bad about initiating it when I first meet people. 

In this area, if I had a question, I would ask it. I didn’t have a lot because I had seen and done a lot of it before through an internship. Some stuff was “new,” but I thought it had been explained why they do certain things in the different areas I had been trained in so far because there is some overlap. (Sorry. It’s a little confusing, but I can’t go into much more detail than that.)

Today one of the people told me to ask more questions. Considering I’m a quite person and people telling me to speak up is not uncommon when they first meet me, I thought he was just trying to get me to open up some more. 

I observed again today. I, again, asked question when I thought of one. I did spend more time actively thinking of questions to ask and asked them. 

Then, at the end of the day, I was out with another area that I had already been trained in because they asked for help and the area I was currently in didn’t need any. 

Well, then they called me back. So I went back.

I walked into a room where the supervisor for that area was and the guy who said to ask more question were. They closed the door and handed me a sheet of paper with 1 - 10 on it. 

I was given a pop quiz about their area. But, the questions on it… THEY never explained the answers to me during training. I was apparently expected to just know to ask these questions. Apparently, every other trainee asks them. I failed the quiz. I got a few right, but most were wrong. I wouldn’t know the answer without asking, but I never thought to ask these questions. Even today when I was more actively thinking of questions, I didn’t think of them. You would think that, because they’re supposed to be training me, they would have explained their different stations in more detail if it was important for me to know the information. I’m fine with a pop quiz, I wasn’t fine that it was my fault that I didn’t think of the questions that apparently everyone else does. They said that I acted uninterested in their work.

I explained to them that I was observing and asked what I thought of, but it never occurred to me some of them. To which they’d always answer that the other trainees did. I also said that I was interested, I was just observing what they did. 

Then, afterwards, I started asking other trainees about the quiz. They were never given one. I asked what they did and they said they just observed. 

It just made me very upset. I felt dumb and as if I should have done something differently, even though most of it I couldn’t do without the proper (more extensive than two days) training. 

It just pissed me off that they’re there to train me. It shouldn’t all be put on me to ask every question. If they feel that something is important for me to know about their area, they should tell me. I shouldn’t be expected to know what they want me to ask about their area. 

They said that they wanted me to know this information incase I was ever assigned to their area, which I never would be. My official assignment isn’t even during the time that they work. 

The entire atmosphere of the quiz was very tense. Every time I answered a question wrong the guy behind me (not the supervisor) made a noise. Then he said, “That’s why I told you to ask more questions.” 

I just felt very small and I cried my whole way home. 

This quiz does not effect me, really. It won’t get any disciplinary action towards me. In the long haul, it’s basically worthless. It was just a shitty day."

Need advice on this situation",ccricers,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35vhn6/broke_and_jobless_but_considering_going_back_to/,"I graduated in 2007 with a BA in Electronic Visualization and I am getting more difficult to get hired in the web development market. When I had less than 2 years experience I could find a new job in less than 3 months. After leaving that job, and with 4 years of experience, since then it has taken me between 6 and 12 months to find the next job. I'm now 32 years old and it's been six months since being laid off and I now am risking bouncing checks to pay the rent unless I sell things.

So I'm thinking of going back to college (maybe the same one I got my BA in) to get a Computer Science degree. This is more generalized and much more well-known in the industry than a BA in Electronic Visualization and it should hopefully strengthen my background and marketability for getting a job. And hopefully I can get a good internship where I get a good foot in the door.

But unlike the last time I was in college, I am now broke and I don't have the option to continue living with my parents anymore. The good news is that I do not have any debt currently. But I need to have a roof under my head while I look for work and consider going to college.

How am I broke? The web development jobs I worked at payed below average for the local market. I was able to save money, but not as much as I had hoped. During those long dry spells of no work, I used the savings as rainy day funds to keep me going while I looked for work. Basically, my career has went like this: worked, saved money, lost job, savings goes back to zero. Repeat this once more.

Edit: I am not interested in joining the military."

[How does environmental health affect me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7xnjl?context=5)|There is a reciprocal relationship between you and your environment. Think about it, you likely woke up indoors where the air you breathed was cleaned by an HVAC filter, presumably flushed body wastes down the toilet, you washed (I hope!) in bacteria-free water, made coffee with safe drinking water, ate breakfast that was safe and free from contaminants. In the absence of a safe and healthy environment, your life expectancy drops dramatically.

Also, you should anticipate food and water related disturbances to your GI tract, which can be minimized by preparing your own meals or eating street food which can be observed being cooked. But don't be paranoid.Having said that, I am jealous, Beijing is one of the great tourist cities on the planet. Be safe.
[Serious question; should I recycle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7ssma?context=5)|Serious answer, it is better to ""reduce"" than ""recycle"". Recycling can generate its own set of environmental challenges, which are absent if we live thoughtful lives. For example, bottled water. We can recycle those plastic bottles although it would be better for the environment and more cost efficient to simply drink tap water from a reusable container.

Asthma episodes can be brought on by stress, physical activity as well as air contaminants, including cockroach, mite, cat dander and other irritants associated with the indoor environment. So, the short answer is that that indoor air quality, lifestyle, and other mediating factors can be associated with asthma.
[Mr. Dyjack; as someone who likely will never become a vegetarian (except by necessity\), is spending my food dollars on sustainably/ethically raised animal products actually impactful in any meaningful way?

I believe there is a ""normal"" distribution of ethics among the producers. I am not vegetarian, and at the same time try to eat a plant-based diet when ever I can control myself, and consume ethically harvested and raised animal products. An ideal approach is to be a ""locavore"", eat food raised locally, then you will know for certain the practices of the growers.

[Hi Mr. Dyjack, I would first like to say thank you so much for doing this AMA. Awareness regarding the links between environmental health and human health is so, so important. Which leads me to my questions...   How do you go about inspiring people to champion environmental health? And how do you show people that standing up for the environment isn't just for the whales and the trees, but it's for our entire society? For example, when I tell my roommate or some friends that I study Sustainability, I am often met with infuriatingly patronizing responses along the lines of ""oh, that's cute"" or ""that's nice, but how will that be useful, ever?"" People just don't get that literally everything in their lives depends upon a healthy environment. Even more concerning is that I'm getting these responses in the world of academia, where people are generally more informed.   Do you think apathy or lack of understanding that human health is very tightly linked to environmental health in the general public is a legitimate issue? Have you seen it throughout your working career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr801e0?context=5)|I have strong opinions on your questions, and would be delighted to weigh in. EH professionals have fallen prey to the ""evidence based decision making"" agenda at the expense of our mission. EH is a profoundly local issue, and ""intimate"" issue. We should frame our work and results in personal terms. For example, what is more intimate than the food we place in our children's mouths? The water we bathe them in? The mosquitoes that fly around us at night? I will be speaking at the NEHA Annual conference in July on this issue, and will introduce a metaphor and new way of speaking about us and our profession, which I hope will provide a path forward and enhance our visibility and influence.

35vm7u,6,2015-05-13,I don't think my [29F] fiance [24F] really loves me. Worried he still has feelings for his ex who is also my bridesmaid.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35vm7u/i_dont_think_my_29f_fiance_24f_really_loves_me/,"EDIT : Since everyone is freaking out over the diary part, I told my fiance that I read his diary and he joked that we are even now. As I said before we don't have a lot of privacy concerns that other people do. 

Hi Everyone,

My fiance and I have been engaged for 10 months and dating for 1 year before that. Our relationship is great and he is wonderful to me. He is attentive, loving, we don't fight, we both approach disagreements logically and calmly. We don't has any problems with jealousy or insecurity in the relationship.Until now!!


 So I was staying over at his place yesterday and he left for work while I was working on a report. I was going to leave for work from his place in 1.5 hours. When I went to get a print out from his office, I looked at his cabinet and saw his diary. I was overwhelmed with a huge curiosity and ended up reading it. I want to preface this by saying that we an very open with each other and frequently read texts on each other's phone, answer each other's phone calls and so on.



 I always had the impression that my fiance pursued me, said I love you first and brought up the marriage discussion. After reading his diary, that view is challenged. I feel like he is marrying me because I pushed for it and I would make a good wife.

 For example, in his diary entry he say that when he first said 'I loveyou,it was something that just slipped out. He thinks that I am falling in love with him when I say it in return and that he isn't sure about his feelings. Then nothing on the subject.

Then a bunch of pages about things that happen on other days and months later, he mentions that I brought up marriage with him. From the way I remember it he was the one who always joked about getting married and what we will do in future before I decided to give in and take the marriage question seriously.

Then he says he is not sure if he wants to marry and is going to make a pros and cons list. The pros list mention my good personality and my ambition. However in the con list he says that he is not sure if he really loves me, but for that matter isn't sure if he has loved anyone even his parents. He also says that I am his first real gf so he is worried he is too young.

Then a couple of pages filled with details of other days, he mentions that he has decided to ask me to marry him and goes on to talk about his work. He makes no mention of why he decided to do that.

In his whole diary he never says I am pretty or that he misses me (we were apart for 8 weeks for my internship) or that he loves me or even how he feels about me.

Contrast that to his entries about his so called ""ex"". He has a whole page dedicated to when he first saw her in his third year of college(4 years before we met) he thought she was so pretty and he was looking for excuses to talk to her. 

Then he talks about how he wants her to be his gf and how he constantly thinks about her. He decides to ask her out, they kiss and make out but then she just wants to be friends. He mentions how hurt he was when she decides to date somebody else
 
While she is dating somebody else they are still friends and he talks about how he wishes she would dump the guy and be with him. He mentions how she has occupied all his thoughts and how he loves her.
Finally she does dump the guy, he is very happy and then they have sex. He lost her virginity to her. But after that she again rejects him and starts dating someone else. He is angry at her and decides to not talk to her. Then they pick up again about 2 years earlier and become friends as she has a bf.

It doesn't help that I am a little overweight, while she has a great body.

They are still friends and about a year ago he got her a job at his company. I met her through my fiance and we became fast friends. She is living with her bf now. She is actually one of my bridesmaids since I was not a jealous person and I trusted my fiance completely.


There was even a diary entry about a dream he had. In that dream he was trying to convince his ex to cheat on her bf and he mentioned that he was ashamed that he didn't think of me.

After reading the diary, I am a little hurt and jealous. I am so confused about his feelings for me and whether he really loves me. I am worried that he is only marrying me . 

I am worried that if his ""ex""/ bridesmaid breaks up with her bf and wants to have a relationship, my fiance would leave me to be with her. I was never insecure about my body or looks but after reading the way he writes about her, I am feeling like he is not really attracted to me and is only marrying me 

What do you guys think? Am I overreacting? Also please don't berate me for violating his privacy. I know it was wrong, but he has read my diary so I think its fair.


   
**tl;dr**: Read fiance's diary. Feel like he is only marrying me because I will make a good wife/have a good personality. The way he writes about his ""ex"" who is also my bridesmaid, feels like he was far more emotionally invested in her."

This isn't QUITE so science based, other than I do work in STEM policy and have a STEM degree and I'd rather ask for advice in a smallish subreddit compared to some place like TwoX. Sorry in advance for the short novel.

For background, I have been working as a policy intern for a VERY small nonprofit on science-based policy issues. The policy team is a part-time director who is in the office once a week (she has young children and works remotely the rest of the time) and then an assistant director (AD) plus usually two interns. 

I've been the only intern for the past four months, so the AD and I have gotten pretty close. Our desks are literally next to each other so it's easy to throw ideas off each other and strategize about new issues before we report to the director. The office has really good camaraderie on the whole, we are able to laugh and joke with pretty much everyone, but it skews a bit older, so he and I tend to socialize the most with one other younger staff member who sits near us. Still, I never considered the way I interact with the AD too terribly different than I interact with the other staff. We are friendly, but professional in my opinion. We are obviously just in sync on a lot of issues since we come from similar educational backgrounds (same undergrad, he graduated the semester before I started my degree) and have just collaborated a lot over the past few months. 

It was all fine and great until we had a new intern start last week. He's caught on really quickly and it's been nice to be able to share work except he's been making a few comments about me and the AD that put me on edge. On his first day I took him to an out-of-office meeting and on the way back, he made a comment about the AD ""obviously having a crush on me."" It made me uncomfortable, but I laughed it off and just said that the AD and I would have been friends if we met in school. I was hoping that would be the end of it, but I've since caught him smirking when the AD and I joke about something. Today I was staying late to finish up a draft and he made the comment that he would give me and the AD some alone time, except that he made it in front of two other staff members. They took it as a joke as they know me and the AD very well, but it made me mega uncomfortable.

I've worked REALLY hard the past four months trying to meet the policy team's goals that are set up for two interns, plus taking on more duties he usually doesn't pass along to the interns 1) because these are issues that I care about and have a more solid background in compared to previous interns, and 2) I do want to remain in the science policy realm and I want to show that I am capable. We're a small office and the walls are thin. I feel like this is something that can easily be misconstrued or get out of hand and make it seem like I was getting special treatment/duties. The AD has said that they are going to push for more staff positions to be created in the coming years and that I would be a candidate for those after I finish my masters, and I feel like if this could threaten that possibility if it gets out of hand. 

The other intern is also not from the US so I am thinking maybe we as a society are perhaps more culturally uptight about these topics than he is used to, but I still feel like it could come off as inappropriate very quickly. While the AD is not technically my boss (the director is), he is still above me in the organizational structure, plus has pull with the executive officer and hiring decisions since we're so small. I feel like I should also note that the AD was responsible for hiring me because the director was on maternity leave at that time. He was not responsible for hiring this new intern.

Am I making too big of a deal out of this??? Should I just relax because I know that regardless of anyone's feelings me and the AD are mature and smart enough to only interact in a professional way? Should I wait it out until he sees this is just the office culture? Has anyone else dealt with a similar issue that could offer advice?

Tl;dr Other intern is implying that the assistant director has a crush on me and I am worried it is going to impact my professional life in negative way by making it seem like I am getting special treatment instead of the fact that I have just spent the last four months working my butt off. 

EDIT/UPDATE: Before I went to bed I shot off a short, professional email requesting that he don't make comments of this nature because I was worried that I would chicken out of doing it in person. He replied with an apology this morning, but also added that he would have made the ""alone time"" comment about anyone in the office. I took him aside and said that I accepted his apology and that those types of jokes can easily get out of hand and be misunderstood in a small office. He said he wouldn't make them in the future. Otherwise it's been a quiet morning, not sure why I feel so bad about sticking up for myself but hopefully this gets progressively less awkward......."

[The post in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/) 

First, some background:

Zach Jesse is a professional MTG player. At an event, an organizer named Drew Levin tweeted about Jesse's (public knowledge) conviction of raping an acquaintance at his apartment in college. That night, the victim and he were drinking, she was slumped over a toilet and he raped her vaginally and anally. ~~She was a virgin at the time.~~ (Edit: *This detail doesn't matter, and should not have been included. Apologies.*) It was an acquaintance rape which rarely is ever reported - much less prosecuted, but the victim bravely came forward and sought justice.

Little did she know, Zach Jesse comes from money. Facing a possible life sentence if convicted of the original charge, Jesse eventually gets a slap on the wrist in the form of 3 months in jail.

After the tweet, Jesse goes on reddit and makes the linked post in which he shows absolutely zero contrition or remorse, nor does he acknowledge the victim.

~~I'm torn in this situation. Obviously, the criminal justice system has done its job... at least, in a way. And Jesse cannot possibly undo what he's already done, all he can do is strive to be a better person in the future (which, by all accounts, he has been). This post isn't about that. This post is about reddit's *disgusting* reaction.~~

I retract this. The guys' parents had money and connections. He got off with 3 months with fucking *work release* for a scheduled internship. This punishment was nothing.

It should be noted, Zach Jesse's self-serving post was gilded twice. He also mentions that he received a full-ride scholarship to University of Richmond and graduated from law school. This is a head-scratcher for me, because it was my understanding that a mere accusation of sexual misconduct will literally ruin a man's life. Oh well, on to the poop!

[""Personally, I'm more angry that Drew Levin and his involvement in this whole affair is being ignored. This is yet another time where he has gone out of his way to stir something up within the community, and it's sickening that people still respect him as a figurehead and that he is still writing for SCG."" +760](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/cr6ptnv)

Our top comment is more upset at someone pointing out that Jesse raped an unconscious woman than... the guy who raped an unconscious woman. Classy as fuck, Reddit.

[""Thought I'd highlight these two logically inconsistent Drew Levin tweets: ""The number of people who keep telling me I want Zach Jesse banned when I've consistently and explicitly said the exact opposite is nuts.""
""My advocacy on this issue has been consistent: I think rapists have no place in the Magic community. We should exclude them."" +110](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/cr6wn3a)

There's many, many more if you really want to read it. The gist of it is this: the *real* criminal is not the criminal, but rather the person telling people about the publicly-available criminal's record.

[""Illegal U-Turn you say? To the gallows with him."" +107](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/cr6qvle)

Then...

[""People may joke and demonize this, but as I'm walking to get my pairings, I want to make sure that somebody's not going to turn around out of nowhere and run into me. This is my choice as a Magic: the Gathering player, but I don't feel it appropriate to let traffic offenders into my community.
And everyone is going to point fingers to other pros \(who will remain nameless\) who are convicted speeders. Even another pro who plead guilty to the misdemeanor failure to yield.

COULD WE POSSIBLY MINIMIZE RAPE ANYMORE? Holy fucking shit, this makes me sick to my stomach. You are talking about anal and vaginal rape here, and you compare it to a fucking *U-turn?* What the fuck is wrong with this web site where creepshaming is the biggest crime you can commit but rape is basically just a traffic ticket.

Next is this awesome exchange:

[""As a woman, I would not want to play Magic or associate in any way with a rapist. However, I don't think that's a reason to ban someone. Do I think that Zach is going to rape someone at a Magic event? No. It certainly seems like he has turned his life around.
I just wonder if WoTC cares at all about the image of the pro players and how they make the game look. Cheaters are allowed back on the Pro Tour, only to cheat again. Now we have a rapist too. This just can't be good for the reputation of the game. It seems like we could find some good players who want to be pros who could represent this game in a good light."" -5](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/cr6v7jf)

Followed by...

[""As a woman who plays magic, I'm very intolerant of other female Magic players who raise the ""I'm a woman"" card. Not that it's pertinent to this discussion, but men can be rape victims too."" +15](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/cr6w7ev)

Has any exchange ever been *so* Reddit?

""I'm a woman myself and I just don't know if I'd feel comfortable-

""BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MEN?""

It's doubly absurd in this context because we're talking directly about a man who raped *a woman*. It makes no fucking sense saying, ""What about men being raped?"" when there's absolutely no reason to think Zach Jesse would rape a man. Also, shoutout to the classic ""As a black man..."" trope. And account less than a month old. Not even trying this time. 

Honestly, nearly every comment in this thread is doing one of three things:

1. Downplaying his crime

2. Absolving him of his guilt/patting him on the back

3. Demonizing the event organizer that brought it to light

As far as I'm concerned, that tells you everything you need to know about this garbage web site.

**Edit**

Here's a bonus. Someone on Circlebroke found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/35q0yx/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_post_by_zach_jesse/cr6u90a) wonderful comment:

""Extenuating circumstances"". Dogwhistle for ""she wanted it"". But of course, rape culture was invented by feminists, right?"

I moved to the big city for college and she moved there a few years after for an internship, so I've been here for about 7 years and her about 2-3.

M has always had depressive moments, and has been on antidepressants which have made her pretty spaced out and apathetic for years, but in the past 2 years especially it really has seemed like she's been stunted. It's hard to explain, but where my other friends and I have all grown up through college and post-college -- when it comes to dating, relationships, jobs, finding your own apartment, making friends, etc -- it seems like M just... hasn't grown.

So, without wanting to sound like I'm just going to list a bunch of negative things about her, here are some of the things that have gone haywire in our relationship during the past 2 years.

1). She's been extremely depressed and isolated in the big city, and has no friends here. She avoids going out and dating people and is still a virgin but she's always complaining to me about how she's still a virgin. I have several social circles, a boyfriend, and a group of really fun coworkers, so I've done my best to invite her out anytime I'm out, though she rarely drinks, parties, talks, or reaches out to people on her own. my boyfriend and I have tried to introduce her to about 5 guys now. Each one takes an interest until they talk to her more, then become completely disinterested due to her awkwardness and lack of social cues and desperation

2). She has hit on both boyfriends I've had that I have introduced her to. My current boyfriend is pretty emotionally aware/mature, so he noticed her awkwardly flirting with him and craving his male attention when all 3 of us hung out the first time. Her behavior made me and him both extremely uncomfortable (she was only making eye contact with him, ignoring me, getting into her ""sultry"" mode, etc) and he said when i was in the bathroom, she leaned closer to him and just got weird. I know I'm not crazy, because he backed me up on this one and did everything he could to avoid her advances. So this entire thing has broken my trust in her. It's like she has no concept of the 'girl code' whenever guys are around.

3). She relies on me for everything, but never thanks me or tries to do anything on her own. She depends on me completely for social events, friends, introducing her to men. She also lived in a boarding house that she hated, and was isolated in, so I let her take a room in my apartment for a sublet to jumpstart her apartment search (she wanted to move to my neighborhood only because I moved there but never did any of her own apartment hunting). My boyfriend and I moved her (he did most of the work by borrowing his friend's car and carrying things) and she never really thanked us. We had to ask her to buy us pizza. My bf has also bought her tickets to shows and she's never thanked him. 

4). It often feels like she's trying to be me even though she's resentful towards me, which gets incredibly annoying. She tries to fit in with my friends, hit on my bf, steal my roommates, move into my neighborhood, etc but she never asks me how I'm doing. She only complains about things, sits in a corner by herself and sulks at me.


5). The problem is that we've been friends for so long, and I worry about her mental health/depression and potentially being suicidal. She's like a burden that I have to carry around though I get nothing out of our friendship. She has no one else here but me, plus a lot of my hometown friends are still friends with her so it would be awkward for me to ""breakup"" with her. I've tried to detach myself from her, and I also told her recently I'd be moving out of the apartment (because I can no longer deal with her or deal with her burdening me). But it seems like I can't avoid her in all social situations.

Long story short, she planned on staying longer in the apartment than I expected. I only tried to help her, and I thought she'd find her own place, but she made it clear she has no intention to go out on her own and she said she'll do whatever I do. I can't take it anymore!
   
**tl;dr**: A depressed long-term friend of mine tries to live my life and relies on me for everything, yet she resents me and never thanks me for anything. I can't ""friend break up"" with her because I worry about her state of mind and our connections with other close friends of mine."

Accounting major here just looking for some wordily advice. I'm currently going into my 5th and final year of my undergraduate career.  I've done well in school recently. Did my first 3 years at an out of state JC and just finished my 1st year at a private university in my hometown. This year I finished up with about a 3.5, completed Intermediate 1 with a B and Cost with an A-. I'm in B.A.P, first semester candidate. I'm participating in extracurriculars with the club. I have been working throughout my college career. I currently work at a golf course and intern at a small life insurance company where I am working under the controller doing various tasks.

My goal is to eventually get my CPA and start out working for a B4. 

First concern is whether I am a good candidate for B4. I feel like I'm a personable person I'm just worried about the grades and extracurriculars. Next is how to go about looking for a job at one. Should I keep my current internship or leave at the year mark and participate in events like Meet the Firms to get an internship the last semester of my Senior Year? 

I guess what I'm looking for is just some advice...what should I be doing right now to enhance my career at this stage in my life.

I'm staying at the NYU dorms, but I can't check in until the 31rst, so I'm staying at a hotel nearby my assigned dorm in Chinatown. 

So here's where it gets complicated. My dad decides he wants to help me over and come to NY for the first time. He's flying up and then taking an Amtrak with me from Buffalo to Penn on Saturday. An hour ago, my Grandma just called me and told me she is surprising us with Orchestra seats to the Lion King that night in NYC. At 8 p.m.

Here is my dilemma:

The infamously late Lake Shore Limited train is supposed to arrive at Penn Station at 6:23 p.m. Obviously I wanted to check in at the hotel, but that's downtown, so that might not happen if we're too late. So I was thinking, ""well I guess we could store our bags at Penn,"" even though I'll have quite a few bags since I'll be in NY for 10 weeks.

Then I made the mistake of checking the time performances for the Lake Shore Limited and some have been 2 to 2 and a half hours late, causing us to be late to the show. 

---------
So tl;dr - Booked a train ticket and hotel thinking I would be taking myself to the city. Dad decided to come with - Grandma decided to surprise us with really nice seats to The Lion King. Taking an Amtrak train that had a 44% on time performance rate for last month and on time is supposed to arrive only 90 minutes before the show starts.

Should I try to stay course and hope it works out, or call my Grandma back and see if she can switch our tickets for a different show?

I searched a bit but my situation isn't exactly like any example posts I could find, so please bear with me.

I have an internship interview scheduled in the next couple days. The main problem is final exams begin Friday and one professor in particular changed his office hours so they take place during the interview. Not only that, but travel each way to this place's location would take about 2 hours, which is a lot of time considering the interview length would be at least 1.5 hours and possibly longer.

I wanted to interview, but beside the mentioned problems, it's also an internship for a position that I'm not prepared for much, if at all. It's not really software engineering, though it's CS-related. I looked up interview questions, like on Glassdoor, and I just feel like I'd be wasting the interviewers' time.

It's very last-minute and I wouldn't normally cancel like this, but altogether I'm just not sure if it's a good idea to do it.

Would this ""burn bridges"" or if they wanted me enough to invite me for an on-site, do you think they'd consider postponing a week?

I feel guilty about it. It's an awesome company and I don't want to be disrespectful.

Thanks in advance."

35wcd9,8,2015-05-13,Five and a half months without meds after taking them for 9 months...It's really hard sometimes. [Rant],DircusPeanut,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/35wcd9/five_and_a_half_months_without_meds_after_taking/,"I've been feeling really crappy since January.  Here's the context: I took 75mg of Effexor for about 6 months last year (March-early  September), and it worked WONDERS.  Then, at the beginning of the school year, I started getting more stressed and interpreted that as my anxiety getting worse, so my former doc an I doubled the dose to 150mg, which I took from September to early December.  Upping the dose didn't help, and actually made me feel calm but less emotional all together (which I didn't like) and made me zone out from time to time, so the doctor switched me to Cymbalta.  I took Cymbalta for about a week and half-two weeks, and when it finally started working and stopped just making me really sleepy it gave me a TERRIBLE migraine (the first and only one I've ever had, and it lasted for 2 days).  I emailed and called my doctor, and stopped taking it (she's my *former* doctor because she didn't respond to me in any way for 4 days). 

After the period of withdrawal (which was weird and sucked) I started experiencing the worst anxiety I've ever had. I started having to duck into bathrooms at work and at school almost every day just to cry because my mind would get so off-track and spiral out of control, and I had to run out of a computer lab while working on an final essay in April because I experienced the closest thing to a panic attack I've ever experienced (I think they're called limited symptom attacks, which what experiencing less than four symptoms of a panic attack is categorized as). I tried Zoloft for a few days at one point and although I know the first few weeks on new meds are really difficult and can make you feel worse, I gave up and decided that I wanted to try and deal with my anxiety without meds.  

Sometimes I REALLY regret this decision.  I started seeing a new therapist in March and she's been REALLY helpful, but it's still so hard to just keep my head up and calm down some days.  I haven't been able to see my therapist in two weeks and I've been feeling really shitty for the last few days.  Sometimes I look back on how I felt during the summer of last year and notice how much worse I feel now, and think a lot about trying to go back on the smaller dose of the Effexor.  Sometimes I just feel so insecure in every part of my life and it drives me up a wall, because I know a lot of my downward-spiraling thoughts are just caused by my anxiety.  I'm as on-top of my shit as I can possibly be right now (job that pays the rent, one year of college left, really good internship, loving boyfriend, and the weather is nice) and yet I constantly question myself and beat myself up because sometimes I feel like a fucking turd that doesn't do anything right.  

The biggest problem I have is that I constantly worry about and fear how my future is going to go after I get my degree.  I'm terrified of being in tons of debt and I'm terrified that I'm going to get stuck in a job that I might realize I don't like so much.  When I was taking the meds, I wasn't so freaked out about this, and I would be able to remind myself that nobody knows how the future is going to go and that you just have to roll with the punches, and it made me feel fine.  Now I still do the same thing, but it feels impossible to not worry about it sometimes.  I'm seeing my therapist again on Friday and I honestly can't wait, because I started slowly getting better until I wasn't able to see her for two weeks.  

That's all I have to say, I guess. Opinions of what to do about medications (or what not to do) are totally welcome.  Thank you for listening. :')

Edit: So now it's the next day and today has already been a lot better.  Sometimes we have extra bad days or even a bad hour or two during a decent day, and those hours are hard but we can push through!  Sending positive vibes to all of you out there!"
35wfn7,1,2015-05-13,"I [21 M] am to lose my perfect girlfriend [20 F] of 3 years, because I keep losing track of what's important... (LONG)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35wfn7/i_21_m_am_to_lose_my_perfect_girlfriend_20_f_of_3/,"Hi reddit..... I don't even know where to start. This will probably be highly incoherent, long, and relatively useless but I need to just vent... As a precursor, I am a complete dumbass.... I don't even know why I want to put this on the Internet because no one could possibly like me as a person after this story but here it goes...

Picture this. Grade 6, we were all stupid-ass naive immature children without a care in the world. A simpler time... Relationships were shallow and based on superficial characteristics and whatever. 

I was this awkward, ugly duckling of a child with a bucktooth and all kinds of undesirable traits... my personality being one of them. I was always a shy, socially awkward kid. Never had any success with girls and was too scared to approach them anyways. I never had great self-esteem... I could blame it on a lot of things but confidence was something I never had. I was bullied and often got into fist-fights (mostly over racism) and was often ridiculed for being another ethnicity. Luckily, I had a great group of friends that have had my back for the last 10 years or so...

Anyways, in Grade 6, this girl, who we will call Kelly, whom I have known through my cousins that went to school with me was wildly in love with me. I don't understand it to this day, but it is what it is. She ""asked me out"" one day while we were all playing under this huge oak tree during recess at school one day.... I didn't know how to react, but I said yes. She gave me a big hug and we were ""dating"" for the rest of that school year. I was happy. She was happy.

**...and then I fucked up**

Sure, we were in Grade 6 and its pretty much a given that relationships that young don't last. However... Me, being a dumbass immature child decided that once summer came around, I was going to dump my girlfriend by being the biggest coward ever and ignoring her forever. It worked. She obviously was confused, hurt and whatever a young 10-11 year old would feel after being basically abandoned. I hate my guts to this day for doing what I did... my only excuse was that I wasn't ready for the relationship in the first place, and I was too much of a coward to break it off... Fuck me.... Her friend was also really annoying and always wanted us to kiss each other and shit.... Bro I'm fucking 10 years old, leave me alone.

Years go by, my fucking immature plan worked and I was lonely and single for next few years. Went through awkward ass puberty and high school. Became slightly more attractive. I spent my time mostly messing around with my friends doing dumb shit like making sketches like Chappelle Show, getting drunk like a dumbass teenager, the list goes on. I was more interested in girls at this point of my life, of course, but still was this socially awkward kid but decently popular at my high school (don't ask me how that works). I even had girls flirt with me quite blatantly, but me being an idiot, didn't know how to react and nothing ever came out of it.

**...and then I fucked up**

Oh shit, my senior prom was right around the corner in my final year of high school and I have yet to have any real interaction with a girl. So, me, being the jackass I am decided this was the time to grow some fucking balls and ask someone out. There was a cute girl that had a crush on me throughout high school, and I even had a crush on her. It made perfect sense that I would ask her out right? Nooope.

Remember Kelly from Grade 6? Well did I forget to mention her and I went to the exact same middle school and high school as well. Talk about awkward... Well, she turned out to become this beautiful person and I mean that in the least superficial way possible. She had a beautiful soul, always did. She was smart, cute, funny, and had her life in control. You know the song ""Miss Independent"" from Ne-Yo? He must have been writing that song for her. Man... I wanted her so bad. But hey, remember now, I'm a fucking idiot and literally dumped her by disappearing off the face of the earth.

But I wanted her... I always felt bad about what I had done to her throughout high school.... I have always been the type of guy that values respect, integrity, and all those other nice things that makes you a good person. I knew deep down in my heart, I needed to apologize to this girl because I could not be a good person without doing that. I played the scenario out in my head over and over again. Remember, I'm a socially awkward dumbass. Finally, one day, I mustered up enough courage to message Kelly on Facebook one day and went all out with an apology... I could probably actually dig it up from our chat history, but yeah.... It was an apology of epic proportions. She, being the awesome person she is, completely understood how we were so young, and it was okay that I did that (NO IT WAS NOT OKAY).

We started talking over the next few days, she definitely found this to be weird, and who wouldn't? A dude you asked out in Grade 6, ignores you and disappears for 5 years, then comes back into your life with an apology and starts talking to you. I'm a fucking weirdo, okay. I started talking with her every night after the apology about pretty much about nothing, I needed to know if she still liked me. 

Eventually, I found out, she did still like me (I actually don't know how this is humanly possible, but yeah, she's an angel). Game on. I asked her out to prom and we had a fantastic time together, despite my high school being ghetto as fuck and having the prom inside our tiny cafeteria.

Here is when it gets good. Me, thinking I'd be smooth and sweet, asked her to come to our public school with me on a walk. I had bought a bouquet of flowers and planted them under the huge oak tree she had asked me out under so many years ago in Grade 6. I thought I was the slyest motherfucker ever... anyways... I got her to walk by the tree with me and I said some crazy ass sappy shit to her, and asked her out and gave her the bouquet of flowers under the oak tree. In a  way, our relationship came full circle? She said yes, and we were dating again. This time for real. I was happy. She was happy. When we tell people our story, people tell us its some fairytale shit... I don't know

This girl is amazing though. Let me reiterate that. She is flat-out amazing, perfect person. 

Our relationship is actually fairly resilient. We were together for a full year before any troubles started occurring. We rarely fought, and we respected one another immensely. I fell in love with her, and deep down in my heart, I realized she was the one..... the one that I wanted to marry later in life. She was always madly in love with me for some reason, it was great.

**...and then I fucked up**

But I grew complacent I guess. I don't know what to tell you. I thought I was being a good boyfriend and companion, but sometimes I would fuck up on the communication side of things. She didn't like that. I also have always had issues expressing my feelings towards her, me trying to be the macho man ideal. You can probably tell that would cause problems, and of course it did. She didn't like that.

We went through a few rough patches over years, I sometimes had problems with her but it was mostly her having problems with me. I'm a dumbass. We got through it together and I vowed to better myself for her. I actually did improve myself on the things she asked me to (i.e. communicate better, express yourself more, etc) but after months go by, I guess I just lose focus and relapse. 

Fast-forward to the present. We just had our 3 year anniversary together. She just moved to a different city because she got an internship there and I got an internship in our hometown. We spent a lot of quality time together before she left and I really thought we bonded like soulmates. However, we were going long distance for the first time....

**...and then I fucked up**

I did it again. I'm a fucking idiot but I did it again. I was so caught up with her leaving to a new city, me starting a new job, me trying to fill the void of her leaving with various hobbies. The week she left was really hectic and busy. I realize now that I failed to communicate and talk to her well through that week.

She's now mad at me, sad about our relationship, and is sick of giving me chances. I never stopped loving her the way I always did. I know she is the one for me, but she lost faith in me. 

Sometimes I think I lost track of the short-term because I am thinking about the long-term with her. I was thinking about marrying her within the next few years. But that's going to be completely useless thought when she's going to leave me now... I think I have run out of chances with her...

I don't know, this story got really long and convoluted with random ass stories and points. I don't know where I was going with this but I could give anybody advice, this is it:

**IF YOU ARE IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP, DON'T STOP MAKING IT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP YOU FUCK.**

You'll only regret it later. I am a fucking mess. I don't even think I talked about the things I wanted to talk about, but I am done typing now. Thanks for reading.
   
**tl;dr**: I keep fucking up, my girlfriend is fed up with me, she is literally the one in my life that will get away and be the biggest regret of my life... don't need advice but feel free to call me a piece of shit "
35wh8i,14,2015-05-13,Nmom forcing Religion (sorry for the wall of text),cupcake_addict17,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/35wh8i/nmom_forcing_religion_sorry_for_the_wall_of_text/,"My mom was always religious growing but but when I was in high school it increased to a completely different level. Since then, with every year of college her religious fervor has become more and more intense. I, however, am not religious. When at home during college, she would force me to go to church every week. When at school she would ask all the time if I had gone (I said yes to keep the peace).

After graduating, I moved to Orlando for eight months for an internship and kept the same routine. Yet, this entire time since the beginning of college her and I have clashed about religion so my issue with being Catholic has never been a secret.

When I came home in January this exploded into a huge fight where she demanded I go every week while I live home or I couldn't live in her house. I was not financially able to live anywhere else so I decided to make a deal with her, which my father witnessed. I agreed to go to church every Sunday IF she agreed to leave me alone about religion entirely. Since then, I have kept my end of the deal. She, on the other hand has blatantly ignored it: demanding I go to confession at Easter, asking me to pray for her, telling me my success will only happen if I pray, I'll only get a new job (I've been looking in Boston and DC) if I ask God, cornering me into religious conversations/ lectures in car rides, telling me I'm disrespecting her when I tell her to honor our agreement.

Well today, I blew up. I finally exploded. It started this afternoon when I casually mentioned that I wanted to get a kitten when I move out. My mom is allergic to cats and just doesn't like them. So she says exactly that: ""you can't have a cat, I'm allergic."" Right. Right. I forgot. You totally get to choose my pets for the rest of my life outside of your house. It just slipped my mind that I should base my animal preferences around you and your non life-threatening allergy.

So I was already primed to be angry with her. Then a couple hours ago I got home from nannying and she casually tried to slip in that tomorrow is a Holy Day Of Obligation and I'm going to church. I flat out refused, citing our deal from months prior. She starts demanding that I go, saying I had said in our deal that I'd go for all HDOs as well. Except, I'm not stupid enough to say yes to something like that. So she's screaming about how I have to go and I snapped screaming about how she hasn't done anything she was supposed to per our deal so she couldn't force extras onto my half. 

But it gets better. My parents and I agreed that once I get a contract, full time job I would take over paying my car insurance and other bills because of my current independent contractor position not providing steady enough income. The way it's looking, that should be in roughly a month. So she tells me that if I don't go she's kicking me off the policy early, figuring it'd be a threat that would work. But I told her to do it; I'll drive with out the insurance. Thing is, I know she'd never do it because until I get the job, the car is also registered in her name. So if anything happens, she'll get sued. 

So now I'm upstairs in my room trying to cool off. And she has turned on my dad (who has Edad tendencies like sometimes telling me to let her do what she wants and just not respond) demanding to know why he didn't back her up. She's gotten in his face yelling and being petty and he's not agreeing with her so her response is (like a child) I hope the Rangers lose, since he's trying to watch the game. But now my mother is storming to her room because he screamed at her saying that a married couple they know is a Catholic and a Jew so obviously one is going to hell. 

I don't even know what to do right now because I can't give up my religious freedom. She's been trying to make that happen since I was little but now I'm an adult and I can't deal with it. How does she not get that it is a literal right? I don't know how much longer I can live with this. "
35wmfq,3,2015-05-13,I've Completely Screwed Up,citrusblanket,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/35wmfq/ive_completely_screwed_up/,"I don't know where to start with how much I've screwed up my life. I graduated from a very expensive college with a useless major about five years ago. At the time, the only jobs I could get were unpaid internships, and most of those were awful. A few years ago, I managed to get a part-time job, and that's all I've been able to get. I've seen people who have started after me get promoted ahead of me, which just crushes me. I live at home, which is the only possible way I could still manage to be alive despite the obvious fact that I should have starved on the streets years ago. 
During that time, I pursued a creative interest which I do not wish to name for fear that it will clearly identify me. There were a few successes here and there, but mostly failures. I was offered an opportunity in this field, but it came at the wrong time and I could not take it. I haven't had any opportunities like that since, and have basically stopped trying. I feel like I wasted my life on this when I should have been doing literally anything else. 
Sometimes, I look up ways to change my life: job ads, masters degrees, etc., and every time I think ""what's the point, I won't get this either. I'm not qualified. I have no references. My submission would be a waste of everyone's time.""
I feel like I have few people I can talk to. I used to tell things like this to a person who uses this sort of information as capital, and that really screwed me up in terms of trusting others. There are a few people who I guess I would call my friends, and there are a few who know that I'm depressed, but I feel like I can't say these things to them, because they can't help. And I'm way too broke to see a therapist. 
My depression has worsened in the last two weeks. If I don't have to be anywhere the next day, I won't go to sleep until about 5 AM. And then I'll sleep until maybe 1 PM, decide it's not worth it to get up and go back to sleep until about 4 PM. My life needs to change, and I have no idea how I can possibly manage to get it done."

I need advice on what I could do until 5/20 from current date May 13th. My 6 month internship I have been working for contract ended and have been unemployed for just over a month now as I have been job searching. (I know I should have had handed out resumes prior to contract ending, but I was 18 at the time and thought ""how hard could it be finding a job when I landed this one right out of highschool"". Now i'm hungry and have no money) And now I have landed myself in a spot where I took a parttime job at a local fish market filleting fish and don't get paid until 5/20.
What could I do? What are my options ??"

* I can't find a job. I've had several internships and thought it would lead somewhere with applying for jobs. Clearly it has not. People with fewer internships are getting jobs. I've asked past internships for help and they have not been of help as of this writing. I didn't have an internship this semester since I couldn't get a paid one and that was probably one of the worst moves I could make.

* College has been a very lonely existence. I'm not a drinker or partier and everyone around me has been off in frats, projects, or just never had the time to hang out. 

* I feel worthless. I'm borderline Aspbergers, I lack spacial perception skills and to some extent a social compass. I seriously wish I never was born.

* I'm not gonna find a job and I'm convinced that I'm a weirdo that no one trusts. 

The only people who I can really talk to is one friend of mine who I feel has been distant as of late, and my parents, but they're absolutely sick of hearing my self-pity (I don't blame them). They keep telling me to keep my head up and be positive, but there's no use. I have no control over my life right now, and it sucks.

I've been in therapy on and off for the past several years and I've gotten max benefit out of it.

I seriously wish I had the balls to commit suicide but I'm too much of a pussy to do it. I just keep hoping a car hits me out of nowhere while I'm driving. 

Hell, I don't even know why I'm writing this post on here since everyone here will try and convince me life is worth living - I guess it's just to vent. Life is not worth living."

So, I was wondering whether it is good to try an internship in Korea as it will also be good to visit Korea for a small time and also complete an internship. So, can anyone suggest me some IT companies list which take students as an intern. I tried googling it but I thought getting answers directly from people of Korea would be better than mere googling it. I am ready to do in any company (including statups) unless they really teach me some real work.

I feel extremely dumb now and am going to take responsibility for this immediately.*

I will be turning 21 in less than five months. I have known my friend, we'll call him Richard, since I was about 17. Richard is the guy with a very masculine father and as a result, was very popular with the ladies as a teenager. He has been working for his dad's junk hauling business since he was about 14 which added even more points to his Alpha-ness. Today, he still works the same job with his father, about $11/hr, rides motorcycles and is an aspiring tattoo artist. Even though he has all of these alpha traits that you can imagine, he is extremely Blue Pill on the inside; he once told me that he identifies as a feminist and would *proudly* date a single mother.

When we first met in high school, he thought of me as a socially awkward loser with no potential. (Because I actually was that: addicted to porn, played WoW in spare time, didn't work out, BP mindset, bad fashion sense, not many friends, etc.) As time went on, we eventually became the really good friends that we are today. On top of that, he let me work for his dad's junk hauling business last summer. Even though he's unaware of it, he is asserting power: befriending those beneath him to elevate himself and making people dependent on him. When the semester began, I couldn't work with him that much because of classes and a commute and I began working at this crappy-ass fast-food joint that pays minimum wage and is filled with retarded workers with no direction in life. 

Two days ago, I got my final grades for this semester. Not only did I have a 3.99 GPA as a math major, I am joining two collegiate honor societies and Toastmaster's (gotta show off that sexy voice, eh?). On top of that, I am qualified for this job at the national laboratory in my city that pays more about $14.50/hr and will actually contribute to my future, potential career. I am also qualified for an internship (next summer, though) at a financial firm that pays $20/hr. Here is where I fuck up.

We went to the gym together last night. Our conversation eventually flowed into our future, potential careers. The retarded me told him that I found potential employment that pays more than the shitty-ass fast-food job, works around my school schedule and looks good on a resume. He immediately said, ""**Don't do that! You already make good money at (fast-food place), they give you good hours and you'll have enough to have the time of your life now in college.""** I responded by telling him that these new internships/jobs actually make me more money with less hours. He hesitated to say, ""...Okay...but I think you should stay at (fast-food place) because you should enjoy this time of your life while you can."" I responded by saying that you can also put the hard work in now and be the one that *hosts* those parties at your own place in the future. He then said, ""You're gonna be one of those creepy guys in his late 20s/early 30s, huh""? 

In terms of the ""power hierarchy"" here, here's whats going on: Richard has had a reputation of being somebody that people rely on (gives jobs in this case) and is viewed as the top dog that never gets conquered. When I revealed these new potential employment options, his reputation is going to be severely damaged because A) his resources lost their value to a person and B) that person used to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy and C) that same person is no longer dependent on him. To be honest, if I get the job at the laboratory (I've been told it's quite easy to get in there, just as long as you have a 3.2 and keep applying if necessary), his reputation is going to take the biggest hit in his life. HO..LY FUCK. I screwed up...

I am a 3rd year economics student at a top public school in CA. This summer I've been meaning to find an internship, in the business field . I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in the future yet, hopefully go into entrepreneurship one day, since it's really exciting for me!    

I go to a pretty competitive school, so everyone is getting (or has gotten) internships locked down for this summer. I feel kind of like I'm lagging behind since I've gone through a couple of interviews with no success.    

With that being said, the semester is almost over (next week actually). I applied to a work study job on campus last week (part time) for the summer, which pays pretty okay, and I got an offer for it today. They want me to accept by tomorrow. It has to do with financial grants and a little bit of accounting.
However, I got a huge influx of emails from various companies that I applied to a few weeks ago inviting me in for interviews for next week.. last minute hiring I suppose. I'm assuming they'd pay a decent amount IF I'm able to actually even secure one...not sure how likely that would be. :/ I'm not sure what to do in this position. I feel like junior summer is the most important year for experience/internships. Will this on campus job be of any help? It's a 3 month summer PT position that pays 20/hr.    

I am also unsure if I'll even be able to land an internship if I forgo this campus job. Which would leave me kind of screwed. Also, most of the internships are full time positions that will likely have many many rounds of interviews, so I don't think it'd be possible to take the PT campus job AND then interview for the internships after. Should I take the gamble and not take the campus job? Or what should I do? In terms of future prospects, what is better? I'm really lost right now...any words of wisdom? It's really giving me anxiety since my fellow peers have everything locked down in terms of summer plans and I'm here scrambling to find SOMETHING. I'm afraid to be unemployed after I graduate :("
35y5v0,3,2015-05-14,I want to get off the help desk but unsure how to prepare myself,Stimpson_J_Cat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35y5v0/i_want_to_get_off_the_help_desk_but_unsure_how_to/,"I landed my first help desk job last October. First, they had me only supporting their iPad app, a month ago they moved me to the main help desk. It's been a month of trial by fire- trying to learn as I go on the phones. I have no previous tech support skills or knowledge and so far I am learning how little I know about computers/networks/etc. However, I am currently in my second semester for a Computer Networking AAS with a concentration in security. I'm aiming for a network admin job. Its sounds like a mix of all I want, sorta hands on working with some hardware and some security thrown in. I don't want to be confined to a desk all day and I don't want to have a phone strapped to my head all day either. 



Help desk has been a plethora of learning but I feel already burned out with it. I like fixing problems but I'm struggling to tolerate the customers.  Along side the help desk, I still support the iPad app which is used by truck drivers. The drivers are mostly unpleasant and pissed off. They hate the iPads and love to tell me how bad they are (9/10 problems I encounter are user error though). I also am struggling with the fact that I am available for calls for 9 hours straight- calls about literally anything. I'm huge noob but I'm already bored. I either get simple calls to unlock accounts or really complicated stuff I have to escalate to T2 or beyond. So on a regular basis I am bored or frustrated, not really much between. I have really grown a passion for technology in general in this position and am really letting my geek out, but to get off the phones I'll have to be promoted to tier 2 or above. I don't know if I want to set that as a goal or just learn all I can while I'm here but focus on networking over all.  Luckily the company I work for is really good with letting people intern in areas of interest with a high rate of internal hires. 



At this point I am already attempting to plan my escape. I want to be able to put at least a year of help desk on my resume but I want to be ready to intern with the network guys (what department would this specifically be called?) ASAP. I'm interested in learning on my own, I've bought a couple books about the basics to start with and I am open to building a home lab to play with.  Plus schooling, but I'm not scheduled to graduate until 2018.  Also, I am interested in certs however I don't know how they work. Are they something I can just study for or do I need to go in to them with prior ""advanced"" knowledge?



I guess I'm just looking for advice or insight, I'm going to guess my situation is not very unique. I'm prepared to be told I have to work my way through the help desk tiers. In that case I'd learn more about operating systems and applications.

35y75w,117,2015-05-14,"It's two weeks before graduation, I've applied to literally hundreds of companies but I don't have any offers. I don't know what to do.",MusaTheRedGuard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35y75w/its_two_weeks_before_graduation_ive_applied_to/,"Hey guys,
So I'm a computer engineering student at a state college in New York with a mediocre GPA. I've posted my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tye56q542pvl31h/Anonymous%20Resume.pdf?dl=0) on here multiple times and have tweaked it to reflect the advice I've been given. 

I decided to take the shotgun approach to applying and I applied(mostly online) to hundreds of jobs in many different industries(big tech companies, biotech, finance, web development, consulting etc). I even got interviews at some pretty awesome places including Bank of America, Google and some trading shops. 

The problem is that I have literally no offers. Zero. Every single place I've applied to has either ghosted on me or rejected me. About half the time I make it to the phone interview stage and rarely I make it to the in person interview. 

I don't think I'm the *worst* programmer in the world, though I certainly could be better. I've had a couple of internships. I've read cracking the coding interview and Skiena's Algorithm design manual. I have(well, had) a few side projects. I go to hackathons to learn and to network. 

It's just hard seeing people talk about multiple 6 figure offers and hearing everyone talk about how there are all these jobs in CS and no one to fill them. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong and the rejections are beginning to get to me. I've started thinking of switching careers or something."

TL;DR;
I work in desktop support right now, out of the blue the team lead for our LAN admin department called and said there is a position open and he had heard good things so I should apply. Feeling a little overwhelmed about the inevitable interview.



""Environment includes Novell e-Directory, Microsoft Active Directory, and Microsoft Server products utilizing Hewlett Packard blade hardware and EMC storage arrays"" and ""Novell e-Directory, MS Active Directory, Linux, Microsoft server products including IIS and SQL, Veritas Enterprise Backup, Citrix, VMware, and HP blade servers, chassis, and switches""

I finished college 5 years ago, I did an internship during my last year of college, followed by about 4 months of an ""official"" internship. Both involved a lot of active directory work, I still understand the structure, group policy, and fell I can speak knowledgeably on these subjects. Since then though I took a PC support job not finding anything in networking/systems, spent 4 months with a horrible company, found a better paying PC support job after that with a great company and have been doing that for 4/5 years.

I've picked up more responsibility over that time. I manage our squid proxy server. I'm no Linux expert, initially I was just adding sites to the allowed sites config. Since then though the guy that built and managed it quite, and no one else knew anything about it. So I've learned how log rotations work (we had an incident with them filling up) started editing the ACL, learned some basic commands like grep, tail, df, learned out to pipe things together to actually make them useful. I also did most of our MDT config and assist with managing images.

The fact is, I'm under qualified for this, I know it, the interviewer knows it. Only reason I'm applying is because the team lead for this position called me out of the blue and said my name had been brought up for it a couple of times. I even told him on the phone ""I'd love the job and think it would be great but my server knowledge is rusty"" he responded with ""I don't care about that, I'm more worried about your fit with my team, I can teach you anything you don't know""

 Knowing that helps but the last thing I want to do is go in over confident. 

I haven't been looking for a job, I am bored with PC support sometimes but my boss is awesome, and the extra responsibility here and there is enough to keep content. So this is my first interview in 4 or 5 years. I'm in the process of going through my resume right now making sure I can still speak at least semi intelligently and elaborate on every word of it during the interview. "

About half a year ago, I moved thousands of miles away for a new job as a recent college graduate. With few people around my age, I had four very lonely months living here and was starting to consider leaving. However, three months ago, my small workplace received a round of interns, all my age, who I quickly became great friends with and have kept me where I want to be.

I live alone in a small apartment in a town ~30 minutes from work, and only two miles from my three friends' house. I am over there almost every night and very often sleep on the couch, do laundry there, etc. Another friend (we'll call Bill) lives an hour away from us and ~40 minutes on the other side of the town the work in. He also comes over a lot - I would say he spends more time with us than at home.

A few weeks in, Bill moved off the floor/couch and started sleeping exclusively in the bedroom of the only girl among us (call her Kelly). There are often nights where the others and I are out and about, coming back to find only Bill and Kelly at home, sleeping in the same bed. This made me extremely uncomfortable at first, especially on the nights I slept on the couch right outside her room. I often pretend to be asleep but end up staying awake all night to hear them quietly laughing and talking late - even on weekdays. However, Bill and Kelly have denied anything regarding an intimate relationship, even though the rest of us have easily figured it out.

Regardless, I still consider them my best friends and offered to move in with them closer to work this upcoming June. However, one night after we had found a house, I was spending the night over and was kept awake by the two once again talking and giggling late into the night. Extremely frustrated that I could not fall asleep, I yelled at them to go to bed (they didn't hear) and then angrily left at 2 AM to sleep back at my apartment (ended up still not able to sleep until 5 AM). The next morning, when I went to pick them up for work, they were very cuddly toward each other as I sat there extremely sleep-deprived.

Last week, I nervously confronted Bill and Kelly about this (note: I'm very non-confrontational!), telling them how I felt like a third wheel and considered backing out of the lease in June. Bill and Kelly were clearly scared and hurt from hearing this and I felt like I had blindsided them. I expected more of a fight, but instead they told me how much I meant to them as a friend and how they would only consider moving in together if I was there. They made me feel more important and comfortable than I have ever been with them. All has since been good for the past week, though still no mention of the intimacy between them.

Last night, I got off work early and spent the afternoon at Kelly's house. After I went to use her bathroom, I noticed a paper bag I had never seen before lying in her room and found an opened box for a vibrating ring. When the others came home (sans Bill), I made no mention of my discovery, but I have again been staying up late again now knowing that I have evidence.

Keep in mind, I still want to move in with Bill and Kelly. Tomorrow we are going in to sign our lease, and I am making sure to not mention anything until then. However, now I feel like as much a liar for snooping around for evidence, and I am starting to worry how they will respond when I confront them again. They promised me that we would all talk about personal space in our new house, and I feel like I have already violated their privacy, but I am also still upset that they have kept their relationship hidden.

   
**tl;dr**: Moving in with two great friends hiding a sexual relationship, now have evidence that I acquired by violating  their privacy. Want to confront them but worried how this will affect the three of us come June."

So this summer, I do not want to sit at home for the meantime while looking for a job, which according to some post here can take months or years. I do not feel like applying jobs online will land me a job in a while or at all so I am looking for any suggestions of what I can do in the meantime, it would be great if its engineering related.

You really want to know more about what I'm going through?  Fine, but don't come crawling to me asking me to take it all back.  I can't.  As much as I wish I could, I can't.  Just remember, you asked me to keep you updated on my situation.

 
I can't get the image of Doctor Shaw's mangled body out of my head.  When I close my eyes - even for a moment, I can still see that face.  That horrible face; those gray-glazed bloodshot eyes, and that creepy friggen smile!  What! The! HELL!

 
As many of you know, I just woke up a few hours ago.  Most of the incident, now is just a blur.  Everything is a blur - except when I close my eyes.  Not only do I see everything that happened the other day, but...  I see IT again.  I don't know what's happening to me.  I think the sedative they gave me (""benzodiazepine"" - whatever that means) is still in my bloodstream.  I can't sleep, but I'm still SO so tired.  So, I apologize to you, if my ramblings seem nonsensical at times - or if I jump around a bit while I try to make sense of everything.

 
I think they may have moved me while I was out of it.  When I woke up a little bit ago, I wasn't in my room.  Well, by my room, I mean the room I've been in for the last nineteen years.  The room that I've had no choice but to call home.  This room was different.  None of my artwork was hanging on the walls.  I don't have a mirror anymore, and there are no windows.  You can imagine the shock of waking up with to light in the room, save the light that shone through the gap between the door and the floor.  I was kind of wigged out at that, and it almost sent me into a panic attack; had it not been for the nurse that came in to check on me.
 

When I tried to sit up, I couldn't.  I couldn't move at all.  They'd restrained me to the bed.  I struggled for a moment to get loose, but the nurse quickly came to my side to relax me a bit.
 

When I asked what was going on, she explained to me that I had to be restrained.  Apparently, throughout the night, I'd been thrashing about so badly, that I'd completely destroyed my other room.  The mirror was broken, the furniture was disrupted, and it was just a wholly mess.  I had cuts, burns, scratches and bruises all over my body.  They assumed that I did it.  But, I'm pretty sure I didn't.  I think I know who - or WHAT did.
 

After she let me out of my straps, I needed to take a minute to gather my thoughts.  She'd said I'd been in and out of sleep for nearly twenty-three hours.  A whole day?  Everything was so intense.  I didn't know what to make of any of it.  The dreams were so vivid.

 
I remember the dreams, clearly.  Please just bear with me while I try to process everything.  You are my pillars of support and I look to you to help me through this.  I know. I'm rambling.  I blame the sedative - and my high stress levels - and the fact that I haven't been laid since I was a teenager.

 
The dreams - get back on track... the dreams.
 

The first dream started off great.  I remember thinking to myself, I really needed this after the day I was having.  Have you ever done that? Consciously had thoughts within a dream?  Anyway, I was flirting with the one intern who'd often monitored my sessions with Doctor Shaw.  Sure, she was literally half my age, but she was legal - and adorably cute.  Though, after a few minutes of flirting and watching her smile fade, everything changed.  She started to rub her forehead a little, as if she had a headache, but then it got worse.  The blood tears streamed from her eyes, and both hands reached for her head as if to squeeze the pain away.
 

When she stumbled, I reached out to help her - I turned to look for another doctor to help, but no one was around.  When I looked back, she was standing upright with both hands on her head, and glass embedded in her skin.  I remember my heart felt like it sank deep in my chest as I watched her fall to the floor, dead, for the second time.
 

I dropped to my knees looking down at her to see if there was anything I could do to save her this time.  But there was nothing.  Before I could stand back up, to turn to face my demon that I knew was responsible, I was grabbed by the arm, and she stared at me.  No.  She stared INTO me.

 
I struggled to break free from her grasp, but she wasn't letting go.  She dug her nails into my arm as the pain shot through my body.  But, it wasn't the normal pain you'd feel.  It burned.  Literally BURNED.  The smell of my burning flesh from the puncture wounds filled my nostrils and I remember my eyes beginning to water.
 

I looked back at her, and she had those eyes; those gray-glazed eyes.  Her face, now a pale gray with sunken features, peered into me.  That's when I heard the voices - whispering my name repeatedly and out of sync.  As they got louder, her nails - now claws, dug deeper into my arm.  My veins began to show through my skin; painfully pulsating and turning colors that I didn't think were possible.
 

As I screamed out in pain, I remember waking up dripping with sweat.  I reached for my arm.  It was warm and wet.  I was afraid to look - but I knew.  I knew all too well.

 
I flopped back on my pillow to try to catch my breath.  I must have fallen asleep again, because the next dream came almost instantly.
 

It was great to see Doctor Shaw again, alive and counseling me in his usual fashion, but I wasn't me.  I was looking at me.  I knew it was me, because I know what I look like.  Though, never from this point of view.  I was in the monitoring room, on the other side of the glass.  I looked around the room and noticed all of the monitoring equipment, the blinking lights, the video feed, my intern counterpart.  She looked good - even from this angle.
 

I noticed myself - my other self, getting impatient and irritated with Doctor Shaw.  He glanced my way for a moment, and back to the other me, sitting and fidgeting in that seat.  I remember the feeling I got when everything culminated to that point when everything just... happened.

 
This was the moment.  But something seemed a little off.  It was as if everything had slowed down, and I was watching an instant replay of some sporting event.  I remember imagining a scoreboard at the top of the room: Home - 0 , Demons - 1, then 2, then 3, then 10, and so on.
 

Everything from that moment on was exactly as it had happened, but this time, I could see ""everything"".  In the split seconds, I watched the room begin to vibrate as colors began to bleed and run together, books falling off the shelf - everything as it happened before.
 

But this time, I finally saw him... the root cause of all this commotion.  I watched the other me's aura change from a deep blue, to a dark purple, and then red - slowly, I watched something pass through the other me and manifest itself behind me, pulling the red aura from my other body with it.  And that was the key.  They DID feed off my energy.
 

As he began to take form, he was HUGE, but he was still a blur, and I could almost make out the features of his ill-shaped body.

 
In slow motion, I watched this blur pass around the room, stopping momentarily in front of the window and pointing to me.  I could feel this pressure building up inside my chest, as if it were about to explode - but with a wave of his hand the window slowly cracked in every square inch and began to pull inward toward us - the interns.  I could see the glass begin to make it's way toward my face and I felt myself being pulled backward as the demon kept moving around the room and back toward the other me, but instead of returning to the other me, he pushed forward and entered Doctor Shaw.

 
The glass finally made contact with my body, as I felt the solid wall behind me. I remember everything fading to white as Doctor Shaw began contorting into that folded mess on the floor.
 

When I woke back up, briefly,  my body was in pain, all over.  The nurses must have bandaged me up.  I could see someone clearing a path through the mess in my room.  I looked up at the nurse who was administering an IV, and then I went black.

 
I don't think I can take much more of this.  I know, now, that I have to keep going - but to what end?  When does it stop?  When I'm dead?  When I've brought about the apocalypse?  How many other people are going through what I am?  Have they reached that point where the only option left is to put a bullet in their mouth?  Or will their inner demon ultimately rip them to shreds?
 

If that's the case, will they even know it's happened?
 

Everything about this last dream was wrong on so many levels.  I can't even begin to describe everything I saw.  It was too graphic, even for me to try to explain it to you.  But I'm going to do my best.  I just hope that my story finds it's way to the right people.  I can't do this alone.
 

I know.  I'm rambling again.  And, I'm sorry.
 

So, yeah.  This last dream.  While I can't explain every gory detail, I will try to stick with as much as I can without making anyone as uneasy as I am, trying to recount it.
 

I found myself in a dimly lit hallway.  What lights were on, were flickering and buzzing with each flicker.  In the distance, I could hear a sort of tapping sound - maybe it was more of a clicking - echoing down the hallway.  I turned to walk away, maybe back to my new room, where I knew I could wake up and be somewhat safe, but there was no where to go.  Behind me was a concrete wall.

 
I knew what was waiting for me in the other direction; him.  Sadly, I had no choice but to move forward.  Up ahead, I could barely make out what looked like bodies strewn across the floor.  As I got closer, I could tell they were the bodies of several security guards; some of them, I knew.  Their bodies were twisted and mangled, broken and bleeding.

 
I carefully stepped over them - out of respect for the dead, and for fear of one of them grabbing on to me like that intern.  I don't think I could have taken another encounter like that, again.

 
The clicking sound in the hallway was getting louder as I got closer to the end of the hallway.  It sounded like... a clock.  As I reached the end of the hallway, I confirmed - that it was, indeed, a clock; a wall-mounted clock with a cage covering it's glass face.  It read 3:23 before it stopped.  It just stopped.  And, now, there was silence, save the electrical buzzing sounds that coincided with the flickering of the lights.
 

I turned around to see the distance I'd walked, which appeared to look like miles, but I know it was only a few hundred feet - as it only took me a few moments to reach the end.  When I turned back around, that's where I met him.

 
Finally, we were face to face for the first time.  I was frozen with fear and he knew it.  Those gray-glazed eyes stared at me with delight, as if he was happy to see me - like we were long lost friends and he'd been searching for me for centuries.  His ill-shaped body lurched at me with an outstretched hand.

 
I jumped back, almost stumbling over my own feet.  His hand... his claw caught me by my shirt and just barely grabbed the skin underneath.  It burned.  Much like that of the intern's grip, it burned a lot.  But it did not pierce my skin.  Instead, it stretched my skin to match that of my shirt.  MY GOD! HE HAD ME BY THE SKIN OF MY CHEST!
 

He wrapped his fingers tightly around it, as he did with my shirt.  The burning pain was intense - feeling the stretching of my skin around his fingers. He pulled me closer; dragging me by the chest until we were again, face to face.  I could feel his hot breath on my face.  He sneered at me.  His misshapen lips curled upward in a tight smile.  The same smile that he gave me when he possessed Doctor Shaw.  I felt nauseous.  I wanted to vomit.
 

I thought this was it.  I thought this was how I was going to die; facing my demon.  I struggled to get free, but it only caused him to tighten his grip on me.  He hoisted me up and held me out at arms length, as I was just dangling there - helpless gripping his forearm tightly with both hands; still trying to break free.
 

The demon.  MY demon, reached up with his other hand and placed it on my forehead.  I was expecting the same burning sensation, but instead, it was cool to the touch.  That moment of relief only lasted for a fraction of a second - as a new type of pain pulsed through my body.  A flood of visions entangled my brain, as I saw everything; everything from my childhood, my teen years, and every encounter I've had with other entities, places I've never been, but places I never wanted to ever see - I saw others like HIM, and what they once were - human.
 

I saw pain and suffering.  I saw others; like me.  Conduits.  Gateways.  I saw hell.  I saw the end.

 
I felt a flood of emotions, pain, and tears.  Before I could react, he removed his hand from my head and dropped me on the floor.  I collapsed, instantly - when I looked up to see my adversary again, he'd vanished.  And I woke up; restrained to the bed, until my nurse friend came to set me free... free.
 

And, now, here I am trying to make heads or tails of all this.  I don't think I can do this anymore.  I need to leave before they find me, before anyone else gets hurt.  I need to GO!"

Programming itself is really fun to learn and with the conclusion of my most recent classes, I also love learning about CS related concepts outside of coding.

As these 2 years have gone by I've managed to get A's in all CS courses I've taken: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, Discreet Structures, and Computer Systems (assembly/concepts about memory/etc.). That being said, I have a feeling that I don't *really* know what I'm doing. I can do well on tests and assignments but if given some abstract project with little to no instruction I feel like I wouldn't even know where to start.

Is this a normal feeling for a student at this point in their undergrad? I'm starting at a software development internship next week so I'm hoping that can provide me with some more confidence as a programmer and give me a feel of what CS is like outside of university. Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

Throughout this internship, you will have a primary liaison on our team, continual contact with everyone via Slack and you will also meet weekly with our entire team to give updates on your progress.

Your primary 3-month project in this position will be a comprehensive review of deployed AWS resources.  The purpose of this audit will be to identify areas for improved efficiency and internal practices by analyzing resource computing tiers, deployment practices, security settings, IAM profiles and overall usage of AWS. You will also recommend improvements to all aspects of the project and be expected to analyze the pros/cons of each change before taking the lead to make them a reality. You may also be asked to assist with other ad hoc projects that are related to cloud resources and infrastructure such as DNS management, API/Site monitoring, MySQL optimizations or git deployment practices.

While we hate paperwork as much as anyone else, each stage of this project will require creating a written audit/recommendation/review.  This is atypical for our normal workflow, but will help you learn to articulate technical concepts and construct formal documentation.  At the end of the project, we will turn these reports into a white paper you can use as a reference example for future job/project interviews.

Plan so far was to rent a car and start a little road trip for at least some time of our journey. 

Here's what is on my list at the moment: 
Rio (probably to the end because of Rock in Rio and our flight home),
Chapada Diamanta,
Sao Paulo,
Paraty,
Curitiba, 
Ouro Preto,
Santa Catarina

What I'd love to see, but might not make it because of time/distance:
Iguazu Falls,
Brasilia,

We are supposed to meet with HR tomorrow to discuss things.

I had zero experience coming in, but this internship was the last thing I needed to graduate with an associate's degree in networking, so I will soon have an associate's. Since being here, I helped with upgrading the infrastructure (running cables, punching things down), figured out how to use uniPoint to create a ticketing system as well as an equipment check-in/out, completely organized the server room (where we also keep items to be checked in and out-this will change and server room will be only a server room once building expansion is done), handled all sorts of licensing issues with multiple companies, manage backups, respond to any support issues or tickets that came up, and set up a mirrored array in an old server we have, put ESXi on it, created a Windows 2008 R2 vm on it, and will be migrating all of our license managers to it as well as creating another domain controller. These are just some things, there has been enough to keep me busy almost the entire day every day I am in.

Now comes the point of the post. The job will come with benefits. I already make average pay for beginning. The problem is, if I want this to be long-term, I will need to move here, as I currently live about an hour and a half away. Between the cost of moving (most likely renting), child support, insurance for myself and family, and taxes, I am going to be completely broke at my current rate. At this stage, would it be best to bite the bullet for a little bit, or would it be fair to ask for a little more, given these reasons (and they've said I am doing amazing)?

Apologies if this would be better suited elsewhere, my goal is to eventually become a sysadmin."

I currently have a Bachelor's Degree in Education with a major in Social Studies out of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I am a 23-year old man with a girlfriend who I live with (and two cats, if that helps). I'm debating going back to school to get a 3-year Bachelor of Computer Science degree.

My Bachelor's Degree has taken me 5 years to get. I took two semesters off because I was exhausted, and really having doubts about my major. The first year of university was absolutely awesome, and I loved courses like Anthropology and Sociology. One of my friends died before the start of the second year, and I was quite depressed. I broke up with my girlfriend, did a bunch of drugs, and we got back together. Although my personal life got back on track, I realized that I wasn't a huge fan of my university path (Education).

I basically spent the last few years of my degree just trying my best to get through it so that ""at the very least I would have a degree"". To be honest, this plan hasn't panned out very well, and, six months after finishing the program, I'm just as lost as I was when I finished.

I tried working in a more trades-type job (a dangerous goods hauler), but I didn't like the hours or the treatement there. It paid alright, but I felt it was degrading my mental health, so I quit. Currently, I have an internship with a company unrelated to my degree, which is just about to end.

I've been interested in pursuing a Computer Science degree, however. I talked to a representative at the university, and she said it would probably be really difficult for me to come back, seeing as how they mostly accept new students instead of students with a second degree.

I've set myself a schedule of studying programming concepts for the next four months, but have been kind of losing motivation because of my confusion over how I should proceed. 

Here are some of the positives of my position:       
1. I know that I don't need a particular career to be happy. I have my girlfriend, and my cats, and a handful of good friends and family. I'm very grateful for the people I have in my life.            
2. I know that many people go back to school in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, so it is not an immediate necessity for me to ""figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life"".      
3. I have enough money coming in for next month's rent, which gives me time to go apply to a temp agency if I am still having troubles.      

Here are some of the negatives of my position:
1. I currently have 20k in Student debt. It is not a ton, but it is still enough to be hanging over my head. 
2. Time is ticking, and I feel like I have to make a decision to go back to school quickly before my loans kick in (which should be in about a month, if I decide not to go back).

I basically have two options:
**Go into teaching**
1. I would basically have to slog through being a substitute, as I am unable to move outside of our crowded city with so many teachers. The real jobs are in the country, but it doesn't interest me to move.     

2. It might take me a long time to get an actual dedicated teaching position, but the drop-out rate for teachers is that 50% leave in the first 5 years. Do I want to put in all this effort into something I don't really want to wake up and do for the rest of my life?

3. I was a really good teacher (I think), and finally got my groove in the classroom. The pay is pretty good as well, if you stick it out (I met two teachers maxed out at 100k). That is pretty fantastic pay, really, and might excuse the general awfulness that comes with teaching. 

4. I don't like the ""hoo-rah!"" over-exaggerated nature of teaching. I'm much more of a university-style teacher. I like to stay in my classroom as my little den, and teach in my style. I'm not too into putting in tons of effort on top of the effort that comes with my lesson-planning. 

**Computer Science**
1. It's something new, and I don't hate it. At the very least, I love being in university, and I would enjoy the next few years of studying instead of working. Things like infinite recursion are fascinating to me-- I love [Gödel, Escher, and Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach). I initially was into programming in my teens as a hobby video game maker, but every kid and his dog want to become video game designers, so it seems to be an extremely competitive market. 

2. It seems like this is a very lucrative career choice with, what I've heard, to be more jobs than there are people to fill them. I don't think I'd really mind Network Administrator or general programmer at all, although I lean towards the programming side. 

3. I really don't have a hell of a lot of experience with computers, and still have basic layman problems. I could probably move past this, but I fear that this career choice is just a diversion away from facing the real world.    

**Tl; dr: 
my question to you is, do you think I should pursue teaching with my existing degree, or go for one in Computer Science?**

So I was casually browsing youtube and stumbled upon some promotional google video showing some interns at the google headquarters. When I decided to look up the names of the people shown in the videos on linkedin I discovered some amazing resumees. I'm well aware that these might be partly faked but I doubt it and even if they are they're still a bit inspirational for a future career of mine - with internships and jobs at NASA, google and other famous tech companies, it looks like the interesting work life I've always been looking for!"

So I'm studying Computer science and I was accepted to Virginia Tech and GMU. I already finished my first two years at a community college to reduce cost. My top university choice did not accept me, so I decided to go to VT. Two days ago I started to calculate the loan amount and I found myself not wanting to attend VT. VT would be around $24,860/year vs GMU at around $17,000/year (I would be living at home, so the original $21,000 cost drops to this amount). When I subtracted subsidized loans from this amount and assumed I would be taking the rest in loans over a 10 year period VT was around 55k and GMU only 36k. My parents are not contributing anything to my education and are not willing to sign or cosign a loan for me. This made me stay at GMU, however still wanting to go to VT. Am I making the right choice? I know VT is more well recognized in the computer science area than GMU, but it doesn't seem to be that huge of a gap specially for an undergraduate degree. Any advice is highly appreciated!

Edit:
While at GMU I will also have a paid internship."
360h7e,3,2015-05-14,Thinking of turning down a seemingly amazing job offer. Am I a complete idiot?,RunThePack,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/360h7e/thinking_of_turning_down_a_seemingly_amazing_job/,"I decided to leave my current job to pursue some specialty training in my field (veterinary medicine). This training does not require a residency per se but does require a year or two of hands-on experience and certification through specialty institutions.

I've been offered two positions. Both will provide me with the opportunity to achieve my professional goals. I'm struggling with my gut instinct to take the one that pays less and is at a lower-profile (but still excellent) clinic, and need someone to either tell me that yes I'm being an idiot and should take the ""amazing"" option, or no, I should trust my gut on this and stick with my decision. Here are the basics of the two offers:

One is an internship at a small clinic in a small town. Clinic feels like a home, not a hospital. Support staff work their tail off and are very proactive and great with clients. I pretty much want to BE the owner/head vet - she's amazing. She is an adjunct prof at local vet school as well so I feel confident that she can mentor - her associate (who is fantastic too!) also has great things to say about owner and their team relationship. The hours are very reasonable. The pay would be a huge pay cut. HUGE. But just for 1 year, then there's the option to move on, or come on board as a full time associate with full time salary. I am allowed &amp; encouraged to pick up emergency shifts locally to make extra $ and see different types of cases to complement what they can teach me. Town is 20 mins from the beach and 30-40 mins from a city ranked in the top 75 ""cities to start a career in"" by Forbes magazine. Cost of living is next to nothing and I can walk or bike to work if I live in town (I currently commute 70-100 miles a day!!!)

Second option is in a big sprawling city (ranked in the low 100s on the Forbes list I just mentioned). I would split my time between a superb emergency clinic where I would be salaried as a part time employee but have to work 12 hour shifts including a proportion of overnight graveyard shifts. The other part time would be in a clinic doing my specialty training, initially on an hourly wage, transitioning to full time in the specialty clinic on an appropriate salary/wage as I complete my certifications and improve my hands-on skills. In 1.5-2 years they would put me in charge of my own specialty clinic at one of their satellite locations across the country, likely in a SoCal town where I have a large social circle. I really like one of the Drs at the specialty clinic but did not get along great with the other. The ER clinic is incredible and I would learn a ton there and in particular have a great surgery mentoring program. This would require a long-term commitment up front to the company, and I'd have to be willing to move wherever they needed me in a couple of years (hopefully CA but not set in stone). The cost of living would be somewhat more than the first clinic but the money would be proportionally higher and a full benefits package included. It seems like the company takes VERY good care of their employees and the majority of them seemed happy to be working there.

This second offer feels like a ""Lean In,"" power-career move, in the sense that I would be around a lot of high-powered people and it would end up with me heading my own satellite clinic... And I'm genuinely considering turning it down in favor of the first. Part of it is commitment-phobia. Part of it is not knowing for sure where they would send me. Part of it is this deep desire to have the chance to SLOW DOWN and live very simply and work on my personal and ""spiritual"" development for a while, but still have the opportunity to accomplish my professional goals. I've gone through a LOT of turmoil in my personal life in the last 5 years and I really want less chaos, not more. I'm not convinced that living in a big, crazy city is conducive to that. Part of it is just that I'm not really in love with the big city clinic, even though I think it would be a great career move and learning opportunity.

Am I being an idiot? Please advise.

FWIW: I have one person in each location who is very very dear to my heart, so I would have emotional support and a friendly face no matter where I ended up. I have lived 3k miles away from my parents since 1999 and both options will put me much closer to them in areas with great airports."

360q8g,2,2015-05-14,Do I drop out of yoga teacher training?,bestofbatman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/360q8g/do_i_drop_out_of_yoga_teacher_training/,"**TLDR** I'm in a yoga teacher training program that is not enjoyable and is sucking out all of my time, but if I drop out my parents lose their money and I become a quitter

A little background:

I'm eighteen and just finished classes at my high school. At my school, every senior finishes classes the first week of May and spends the rest of the month completing an independent study project until we graduate in June. For my ISP I wanted to become a certified yoga teacher. However, the program that my studio offers was only on weekends so I decided to intern with my yoga teacher (who owns the studio) on the weekdays in May. I have been practicing for two years and it's helped me relieve stress and increase my strength and flexibility. Needless to say, I LOVE yoga. Also, this is my last summer with my high school friends. We're so close that they're basically like a second family and I want to spend as much time this summer with them as physically possible. Furthermore, I am rarely a quitter. I am a very ""when the going gets tough the tough gets going"" kind of person and have always been very determined.



The Problem:

The yoga teacher training program that my studio offers was originally supposed to be every other weekend from 10-4 on Saturday and Sunday. However, there was a problem with scheduling and it was condensed to every weekend (with the exception of a few holidays). The program started in mid April and after the first couple of weekends, I realized that I may have bit off more than I could chew. I found the teacher training sessions to be a bit boring and they were extremely time consuming. My mother, who financed this teacher training, said that I should at least stick it out until the end of May so that my yoga teacher will still let me work with her on the weekdays. I thought this was a great plan and I have been sticking it out, but the end of May is coming up quickly so now I have to make a decision.

My reasons to drop out:

* it is extremely time consuming
* this is my last summer with my high school friends and boyfriend but I can't spend any time with them because my weekends are full from teacher training (my boyfriend recently got mad at me because I don't have much time for him due to this teacher training)
*   I DREAD going to these sessions. I am miserable just thinking about them
* Because I don't like the sessions, I've partially lost my love for yoga 
* I can always complete another teacher training program when I'm older and have less going on
* I will be working full time over summer so I won't have much time on the weekdays for anything
* I can still be a yoga fanatic without being a teacher
* After my ISP is over there are still 2 more months of this training

My reasons to stick with the training:

* My parents will not get their money back (my mom said that she's fine with it if it's what I really want, but still)
* I wouldn't be a quitter
* I love the idea of being able to spread yoga to other people
* Yoga teachers are some of the coolest people I know
* My certification would never expire so I would never have to do this again
* It is something that always wows people when I tell them that I'm becoming a certified yoga teacher
* It is something different and interesting to put on my resume   
* After my ISP is over there are only 8 more weekends in the training  


I would really appreciate any and all advice! Thanks!"

3610z1,0,2015-05-15,How to best develop myself for a top B school?,thatguynamedbrent,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/3610z1/how_to_best_develop_myself_for_a_top_b_school/,"Hello all, I am a recent graduate of the University of Florida, and I am looking for some input on how best to continue developing myself so that I might gain entrance to a notable B school. Here's a bit of my story.

**Education:** In high school, I attended a military academy, and was involved with Army JROTC as well as a program known as the Civil Air Patrol, a civilian auxiliary of the USAF.

I was on a good track to attend West Point, but decided to halt my application process during the end of my junior year for personal reasons. At the beginning of my junior year I became the manager and head instructor at a martial arts studio. After recovering from a back injury and graduating high school with a 4.4 GPA, I was employed as a manager and head instructor of another studio in my city. I focused on teaching for two years before another back injury slowed me down, when I started attending the local community college. I continued to teach when I was physically able to and graduated with an AS in Business Administration and a 3.85 GPA.

After community college, I transferred to the University of Florida to study finance. During my time there I joined a coed business fraternity (Delta Sigma Pi), helped launch a leadership development and education program under the business college's Center for Career and Leadership Development (CCLD), became a mentor for another CCLD program, and founded an organization to help new transfer students acclimate to life at UF. I also took classes in both German and Mandarin Chinese, because I love learning languages and studying different cultures.

Unfortunately, a mixture of lots of extracurricular involvement and test anxiety that I developed during my first semester, I graduated with only a 3.15 GPA, with my major GPA being a 3.3.

I know that I am more capable than my UF GPA would have employers and B schools believe, as I am able to apply the knowledge gained in my major coursework as well as or better than my peers in the finance program.

**Professional:** I have completed two internships with a wealth management firm, where I primarily worked as a data analyst who helped recommend improvements to both domestic and foreign business operations. I have accepted an offer with the firm and will be working as a market forecaster and sales material writer for their institutional investing group.

**Future:** I have plans to take the level 1 CFA exam in December (if funds permit), and am continuing to study Mandarin Chinese in my free time. I've toyed with the idea of pursuing the Certificate Program in Finance online at UC Berkeley, but I'm not sure about that yet. I'm also planning on getting involved with the Civil Air Patrol again as an adult, and am currently working on developing a program for leadership education and development geared toward high school students. In 2-3 years, I also plan on looking for a job in Shanghai so that I can have a chance to gain exposure to Mandarin in everyday life.

**Questions:**

1) I know my UF GPA is very low (3.15 overall, 3.3 major), would either passing the CFA level 1 and 2 exams, or completing the Certificate in Finance from UC Berkeley help me show greater academic capability? What can I do to overcome this? Also, will B schools look at both GPAs from UF and my community college?

2) Are there any additional things that I should consider involving myself with to make myself a more attractive candidate for B schools?

3) I've not really considered B school until recently, so should I take the GMAT sooner rather than later? Or does it not matter *when* I take it, so long as I get a competitive score?


Any help would be appreciated! Go Gators!"
3616mc,1,2015-05-15,Getting Rid Of The Feelings Of Guilt?,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3616mc/getting_rid_of_the_feelings_of_guilt/,"I will be turning 21 in five months and it has been about a year and a half since that Red Pill flowed down my throat.

Even when I was a child, awareness of Red Pill ideas were present in my mind. Despite constantly getting told by my parents, the church and my Beta father that it is best to obey, always be ""nice"" and to never sin, I somehow just instinctively knew that there is something fucked up about the world and the people in it. As a result of my Blue-shaded upbringing, I was the target of bullying for the majority of my life. Even though I could land two ""hot chicks"" in high school, my personal identity has revolved around me being a victim, until swallowing The Red Pill. 

Today, I am in a social circle of male friends. Like all social groups, there is always one major alpha of the group, the ""top dog"" so to speak. In regards to my current situation, we'll call this guy Richard. Richard is a guy who grew up with an alpha father and as a result, has been used to being the top dog in just about every social situation, in every aspect of life. He also began making money when he was 14 ($11/hr untaxed), which adds more points.  Of course, he had no problem getting girls. Despite all of this, he has an extremely Blue Pill mindset. (He once told me that he would *proudly* date a single mother and identifies as a feminist)

When I came along, he viewed me as I was: a spineless Beta with a porn addiction, WoW as a hobby and no friends. Since then, he has always thought of me like that in his mind, until just recently. After receiving my transcript from this semester, I not only found out that I had a 4.0 in upper-division math courses, but discovered that I am actually eligible for an internship either at the national laboratory in my city or this major financial firm as a analyst. Both pay ~$14-20/hr and work around my schedule. 

As of now, I am working this crappy-ass fast-food job that pays minimum wage and is filled with retard workers with no direction in life. When Richard heard the news, he immediately said, **""Don't do that! You already make really good money at (fast-food place). Everybody says its really hard to get in there, so I wouldn't try. The job you have now is perfect for you.** 

What is going on here? Most likely for the first time in his life, he feels that his position of power in the social group is under attack. Here, the member that used to be viewed as the Omega in the group is going to be the most intelligent one *and* makes the most money. We all know that one of the Laws of Power state that the reputation of a person is vital. The former Omega is now going to be more intelligent and make more money than the current Alpha? Shit...

Even though on the outside it sounds really good. Right now, I feel extremely guilty because he has been a very good friend of mine and has helped me through tough shit. I could sense in him the feeling of negativity when that shit came out of my mouth. (I screwed up by revealing plans, fuck...) But we all know that men compete and women select, that's just how the game works. Inside, I do still feel victimized as a result of habitual thinking, but results visible to the world say otherwise. My molded mind tells me that what I'm doing is bad because I'm going to hurt somebody indirectly, but my animal instincts are firing up because this may be the first time in my life I am the dominant person in something. 

How to get rid of these feelings of guilt? "

We've lived together for 3 and a half years always been a bumpy relationship as everyone's is really. Currently I'm working an internship 35hrs a week  (really hard finding an entry lvl job here even with a degree) and he has a high paying full time job. We live very comfortably. I do all the cleaning, cooking, everything everyday cos it helps feeling less bad about not having money. Although I still did this when I was earning money and paying rent etc. Both of us have histories of depression but not since being together.

So last night we went out as we do every Thursday with friends. I then found out my grandmother had died earlier that day via mobile. I was shaking so much it took a while to calm down, my fiance just carried on chatting to his friend. He didnt't peak to me or ask if I was ok for hours when he did I got upset went away my friends comforted me. I calmed down and told him I wanted to go home. When we got home we had an arguement.

Now I wish to state this is the 4th time something terrible has happened to me and heb ust ignores me. Dead best friends anniversary, father being sent to prison for rape, dog put down, mum suicidal. I wish I was making it up. Anyway, every 4-6 months or so something generally to tip me over the edge of stress(like my gran dying) and I get upset, he ignores me, then I get angry. 

I tried not explain to my fiancé, that I am also terrified of going to the funeral as my father will be there (it was his mother). My fiance just says he doesn't know how to deal with these situations. At this point I lose it and start shouting at him, while crying so not very audible, about how I'm sick of teaching him how to act like a basic human being. He goes to bed and in proceed to throw a chair a cross the room and cry. I do throw things when these break downs and I feel awful about it straight away and always apologise I honestly don't know why I can't stop. Anyway I'm sick of this treatment.

Generally, he ignores most things I say and leaps in to tell me how wrong I am about any fact I have to say. Our sex life is hit and miss. I have tried and done everything he asks so to keep him interested. He hasn't done anything for me as I don't really ask. I don't really initiate sex anymore as through a previous long rough patch he rejected me 60 times in a row (I tried to initiate everyn2-3 days for 2-3months) He often shows me what porn he watches even though I've told him it makes me uncomfortable band watches it when I'm in the room (obv without noise). 

We've both said hurtful things to each other over the years. This is just gonna happen, we've all had drunken fights. But every time something happens and I get upset like this he threatens then to breakup with me sqyingnhe can't 'deal with my shit' every time this happens I'm devastated I tell him he going to break OUP with me for getting upset and angry over the shitty shittynthings that have happened to me that I have no control over? He says yes leaves me crying and goes to sleep. The next day I'm depressed and awkward. He pretends like nothing happens. The cycle continues.

Now I wish to state we love each other very much. The thought of breaking up with him makes me physically feel sick, not to mention the fact that I'd have to live as a sheltered homeless person in my sisters one room. But I'm so depressed after these fights now, what should I do?

   
**tl;dr**: Fiancé ignores me when terrible things happen to me, when I get upset he threatens to break up with me. If I leave, I'll essentially be homeless with no money."

361wli,37,2015-05-15,Australian moving to Augsburg,Turville,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/361wli/australian_moving_to_augsburg/,"Guten tag!

I'm an engineering student moving to Augsburg for at least a year for an internship at at Fujitsu. I'm moving out from my parents place in Victoria and have so many questions and concerns, but i'm very excited to leave. I don't have a specific question just a giant lack of information that I would love anyone and everyone to help me be more prepared for the big move. As I said I am moving out from home so even if your advice is general and not specifically related to Germany its still very appreciated!

Some areas of concern are:

* Clothes. My wardrobe sucks, should I buy before I leave or buy there? What basics do I need to have.
* Accommodation. I have a place recommended for around 260 euro a month, although there's no photos. Its really hard to decide where I would like to live in Augsburg, especially when there isn't google street view in most of Germany. I will be earning under 1000 euro a month, and I assume I would want to have a room alone, but I feel I may get lonely, as I'm not super outgoing and don't have a lot of physical hobbies. 
* What to bring? Obviously clothes, phone, laptop. I'm a nerd and have a good gaming computer, I don't really want to ship it as it will be annoying and costly, I've considered packing the vital and expensive parts in my luggage and buying the big parts in Germany and rebuilding it.

-Can't access SMB share from Finder on Max OS X 10

-Error Message:

There was a problem connecting to the server ""Tower"". The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and try again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Steps Leading Up to the Problem**

-Previously was using UnRaid v5.06 trial. Filled my 2nd data drive so Pro key it is.

-Might as well ""update"" to v6.0b, formatted flash &amp; loaded v6.0b &amp; Pro.key to it

-SMB was working fine on same flash drive each time

-Started &amp; finished transferring in data from a 4 TB network drive

-Shutdown etc to insert freshly precleared 6 TB WD Red

-Now unable to get SMB working. No apparent errors from UnRaid server. Always get these errors in Finder
[error 1](http://i.imgur.com/c7LeKxK.jpg)
[error 2](http://i.imgur.com/AsfxSFY.png)

-Next drive (2 TB) was NTFS-formatted, so I shutdown/etc and mounted with SNAP

-Still unable to get SMB working. Same deal

-Did internal copy via SNAP

-Shutdown/etc to remove 2 TB drive, start up, nothing.

-All sorts of SMB/NFS/AFP configuration attempts. 

-Currently AFP is working, but I can't see individual drives. Just the Share as a whole. Is this a bug/feature of AFP?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Attempted Solutions**

-Connect via root/(blank), test user test/testa, Mac OS X username/password (registered user)

-smb://Tower/

-smb://Tower/Media

-smb://192.168.1.100

-smb://192.168.1.100/Media

**System Specs**

-Note that my Win8 and UnRaid are all on the same physical machine, I interrupt the boot process depending which one I need at the time.

Intel i7 3770 3.4 Ghz

Gigabyte GA-Z77-DS3H rev1.0

16 GB Patriot 1600 Mhz

4 TB WD Green (UnRaid disk1)

4 TB WD Green (UnRaid disk2)

4 TB WD Green (UnRaid disk3)

6 TB WD Red (UnRaid disk4)

4 TB WD Green (UnRaid disk5)

*note this drive is weird. 3-4 years ago I was trying to format the 250 GB WD Blue above for my old Xbox and selected this drive by mistake. It physically has 2 TB of storage, but the program I used really, really messed the drive up at a super low level, so it now only reports as 250 GB. No amount of wiping, partitioning, new volumes, etc has fixed it. The IT guy at my old internship was even stumped. Shouldn't matter here, but full disclosure I guess.

I currently have a BBA degree with a Computer Science Minor.

I have completed four 4-month co-op terms and have gained experience in creating Excel macros using VBA. I've also completed a VBA course while in school. I taught myself SQL when I graduated.

Right now, I'm currently enrolled in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and have completed the first required project. It involved programming in Python to perform statistical analyses, queries, and create data visualizations. I even learned a little bit of MapReduce.

While I feel like I've learned many things, I feel like starting my career with a SQL programming job would be a great way for me to get my feel wet.

Please PM me with any opportunities that may suit me. An internship would be ideal but it has been difficult to find an internship that isn't geared towards students. I am open to both full-time and contract positions. "

I'm a 3rd year student, about to be my fourth and final year in the fall. Finance is my major. I go to a small local university kind of in the middle of nowhere, accredited business program, but not really well known at all. I switched to finance my second year and wish that I had pursued more internships in that field. My resume is rather all over the place, with only one internship at a major company. I am fairly passionate about finance, mostly investment banking, but specifically micro-financing. I studied international finance in Spain for a semester as well.

This past semester (Spring 2015) I applied to various places to be a summer intern at, roughly 20, all in the major city near me (Philadelphia) so I have a good amount of competition with other students who go to more well known Universities.

Out of the places I applied, two got back to me and they were the two that I actually really wanted in the first place. I believe I interview really well, I have an ok suit, a padfolio full of notes about the company and the people interviewing me, and overall a good attitude. I shook hands with everyone and sent a follow up email thanking them for their time.

A week and a half have gone by and I haven't gotten back from either of them, pretty much calling it that I didn't get it.

I'm pretty devastated about it, as I was really counting on these internships to improve my career and increase my skill sets, especially because Junior going into Senior year summer is most important for internships. I have always gotten jobs I've interviewed for and ultimately that mindset was my downfall.

So now I'm not sure what to do. I really want to make the most of this summer as far as furthering my career. What should I do? Most summer internships have already been filled.

I work a crappy retail job right now that I have been working at through school just to pay the bills. I have an internship at a large financial service firm as a wealth consultant intern in the Fall, am a Level 1 CFA candidate, and am taking a financial modeling course through Wall Street Prep. But I feel that those things won't be enough to compete well in this industry once I graduate in June 2016. Which is why I am asking what kind of things should I do this summer, to improve my career path? Is there anything you guys would personally recommend?

I recently interviewed for a big company and was excited to hear that they offered me a year long internship for a development position. They mentioned at the end of the interview that I would be put into automated testing to understand the product and once I am able to do that job, will be given development work. I was ok with that as I would still be able to learn a lot. 

Now, I know I have been here only a short time (~2 weeks) but I am starting to get the feeling that they may of not been completely truthful. The interns that are currently here said they were given some coding work after ~8-9 months of testing but it was small bug fixes here and there. This got me a little worried because I decided to take a year long internship so I could learn and know more about the field that I want to do. So far, its just been me being trained on how to do the testing work. What really got me worried/sad however was when yesterday, my supervisor told me that they think I would be perfect to work with the clients as a customer support, this way I can better learn the product. My heart sunk here, it made me feel like all that I am doing is a mistake and will waste a year of my life. 

I tried talking to my coop office at school but they just told me I signed a contract and leaving early would leave a bad reputation for the school at the job.

I would like ask for some some advice from people that have went through a similar situation or someone that can offer some insight on what they think I should do.

 Should I try looking for another internship for the fall/next year? or is leaving early going to look bad to future employers.
 
 Should I wait a while before talking to my manager or should I let them know my concerns now (even though I have only been here for 2 weeks)

 or any advice really would be amazing. 

Thanks for all the help anyone can offer

There are now 2 positions available that go along the lines of my internship. Should I wait for them to say something about it, or should I bring it up?

My question is, what do I tell the CEO that i'm interested? How do I starting this conversation? Should I mention anything now or wait till it's closer to the end of my internship? Also, I do feel like my co-workers like me and want me to stay. It feels like a good fit. It's not just hopeful thinking.
Before I came here I was working in IT. So since i've been interning here, i've made a lot of upgrades changes to co-workers PCs/Laptops and they were very appreciative. Also helped a lot with troubleshooting issues with other things.... i.e. printer, wifi, network, pc issues. This is not my main responsibility as an intern, but definitely helps. So I know co-workers are appreciative of me.
How do I bring up the subject of transitioning into full time with my CEO? or should I talk to my supervisor before bring it up with the CEO?
tldr - internship coming to an end, wondering what steps to take on talking with the CEO on a fulltime position?"

It touches on many subjects and is definitely worth a read.,[deleted],C_S_T,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/362lmy/amazing_comment_about_the_current_state_of_the/,"The United States is at war. Russia and China will hire their shills and try to create dissent in the ranks. So the theory goes.

Many people in the CIA/FBI/DoD/Military and Washington want a military coup. The leadership is insane and is threatening to destroy human life on earth for nothing. The story about 9/11 and so on is falling apart.

If US was winning and US economy was strong and everyone was getting richer, then everyone would love the government. We could look the other way about the wars and the torture or even the NSA spying. However, when the economy goes down, the leadership's heads will roll. They need to create a crisis or external event to really people around and create buy-in.

However, people are fatigued from false terror threats. Military morale is extremely low. The military does not want to be deployed against American citizens. The leadership needs to step down and has been offered amnesty for 9/11 and a bunch of bullshit is going on.

We are entering a battle between the 1% and the 0.001%. The 0.001% controls the currency and they have the power. They can bring in foreign mercenaries, murder people and so on.

What happens, is that someone starts a riot, then snipers shoot both sides and it causes larger riot, then armed forces if they choose to step down the rioters win. So when oligarchies get very bad, the oligarchs in power get rotated out when the other oligarchs engineer stand downs.

So you have NY and they want to crush Bitcoin (the 0.001%) and they will do so clandestinely. The 0.1% see it as check on the FED and the assholes who are destroying everything and trying to enslave humanity, so they are supporting it. The CIA is neutral or pragmatic and only cares about it as operational technology for things it does.

So you have 
- analytical (evaluates capacities; think tanks)
- behavioral (does things, sets goals, reactive response; CIA/FBI/law enforcement)

The analytically people did war gaming and models and we are going to face massive crisis by September. Then the FED people want to loot the pension funds, grab cash, destroy economy, roll over currency. They say ""we will just intern 6 million people and put 400,000 troops on homeland"" and ""we will shut down indepedent media, cause crisis, use ebola scare to prevent people from forming large groups""

They do war gaming like that. Economic war gaming, riot war gaming, war gaming for how many people they can snatch and grab or eliminate before knowledge spreads. They identify network centers, resources, supporters and eliminate them to ""Deconstruct network"".

They are doing test runs on all their systems for cutting off encrypted communications, VPNs, disrupting DNS, cutting off cell phones and communication. Controlling reddit. Filtering thoughts and media.

The Wolfowitz Doctrine was applied to China, two months ago and all of the Fortune 500 pulled out.

Its really screwed up. The detainment lists are not being compiled by military, white house or NSA. They use that data, but they are being compiled by DSAC, so they will go after protest leaders, animal rights activists and people who dont like Monsanto. DSAC is one that had snipers on the roof during occupy protests.

Then fusion centers collect data and then local law enforcement monitors tweets and finds the ""extremists"", the Ron Paul supporters. The people spreading information about fact that people in current administration carried out 9/11. Then they will begin fining or punishing people, like they are now.

Crisis. Internal border check points. Then visible intermodal response teams (VIPR) goes nation wide, which is national police. The local munis go into crisis, run out of money. They need federal money to keep going (Dependence), so bow to the overlords. Police nationalization. Blackwater/foreign mercenaries are brought in.

Exit visa, encryption bans. Licenses required for blogging to avoid spreading of terrorism. Shilling, vote manipulation, infiltrating admin ranks. Identifying influences and shadow banning them from popular subs to prevent ideas from spreading. Isolating people into ghettos like /r/conspiracy.

They will forum slide here (flood with ""jooos did it"" and ufo articles) and shill on the forum slide articles. However, they just use this as ghetto, identify the users and then if you post outside the sub or spread information, you get shadow banned or auto downvoted. 

I have experienced it. Where I get 300 upvotes on comment and then they zero it out or set it to 3.

There is a whole research field on ""social contagion"". Memetic weaponization. Controlling spread of ideas.

Reddit traffic stats are falling off a cliff and so is Facebook and twitter. Corporate media paid for feed prioritization, CIA took over the admin ranks (cultivate influence) and banned posts to blogs on the top reddits. Massive vote manipulation, top control with keyword filters, punishment of non-compliant reddits, proliferation of SRS (which is a forum slide/distraction operation to keep people off real issues and the oppression in their face). 

This is a 5th generation war. I work with people in China and the communication is now being blocked by both China and now on the US size! Massive cyberwar operations.

5th generation warfare is invisible. Blackwater invades a country and its deniable and it wont even be in the news. The nation state collapses and the war continues. Its privatized, deniable, about influence and assassination. The factions in the war are often invisible and do not carry flags or have names. Its not even apparent to people outside of the conflict that it is occurring (deniable).

I am annoyed at the censorship, but I am excited to see some of the new capacities they are deploying! Hopefully this will be exciting (if they dont put me in a FEMA camp for being subversive).

It is .NET development in C# which has been fun but can get boring at times. I always had a passion for embedded systems software and working with microcontrollers,VHDL, assembly and such in labs when I was in school. My favorite classes were always the digital electronics courses like Digital Systems Design with Programmable Logic and theory of digital systems, and especially Microprocessor Systems (I did not enjoy much of the analog courses). My salary is in the mid 60k range which I feel is rather low, even though the area has a pretty low cost of living and I feel like with my degree I should be able to earn much more. I really want to gain experience in the embedded systems area that would help land a job in that field some time down the line. I am not in a hurry since I have a stable, stress free job and like the people I work with, but I would like to take advantage of the free time I have now so that when I am ready to start looking for something new I have something to talk about besides the more high level software experience I am gaining at my current position. I did not have any internship experience but I worked through college (unrelated field) and had an opportunity come up that allowed me to very briefly work with .NET which helped me land my current job.
I feel like while I am learning at my current position it is not as fulfilling as I would like, and that is important to me. I have an arduino, a rasp pi, I have some digital and analog components lying around but I have never worked on a meaningful project. I feel like I should invest in an embedded systems dev kit but I don’t know what I would do with it. What could I build and use? and have fun with? To sum things up, I feel like I learned a lot in school and I would like to exercise what I have learned in the real world to help me transition over to something closer to CompE (what I majored in) rather than continue the CompSci/Software Dev route. Really any advice would help I am an open mind and would love to hear others experiences or input."

Short somewhat relevant background:
I was born, raised and am currently living in South America. My family is really well-off (or at least well-off in our local currency).
My dad has a few wineries and I work for/with him.
I live with my parents but that's a common thing over here, we move out of our parents' place once we have solid savings.

I went to university for Graphic Design. 
In the middle of my studies I went on a Work and Travel to the US and I absolutely loved it. I knew I wanted to do another program like this when I finished the career.
I worked for 2 years in an AD agency here, then got an internship in a well-known studio and then I decided I wanted to go to New Zealand. 
So I went.
I started working in a restaurant as a waitress and I met Boyfriend. I absolutely loved him since the minute I saw him and we hit it off. 
Grandma gets sick and a series of unfortunate events occur so I came back home. Kept talking to Boyfriend on every social app there is to be downloaded.

Time passes by and after some small ups and downs we managed to get a 'visits rhythm' we're both comfortable with. BF gets a new job and is happy. I went over there, he came over here, we met at some other places. Of course traveling from South America to NZ is stupidly expensive (at least 2000 dollars) BUT it's even more expensive for me because 1 dollar=12 pesos. 
Anyway I was been working my ass off at my father's winery (no jobs for designers at all) to save money for whenever we met so we could have a good time and eat whatever we craved, drink whatever we were thirsty of and go wherever we felt like. Every holiday we had together was a blast.

Now, Boyfriend works for 4 weeks at sea and has a 4 weeks of paid holiday. He made it clear from day one he had zero interest on even considering moving here (I guess we're

Then I decided I wanted to go to uni for winemaking because I'm really passionate about wine, I grew up in a winery and all that. I would love to follow my father's steps and could really use his wisdom to work at what I love.
But I saw no point on starting the career here this year (classes started in february) because I was planning on moving to NZ in july.

Now we've been through a really long and tedious immigration procedure. Doctors have tested every inch of my body from my urine, blood, hair, teeth, skin, nails to psychological exams. We've filled heaps of forms, long forms. We've gathered evidence from everywhere, got our friends and family to write letters, did everything as good as it's possible and.. I didn't get the visa we applied for. I got 45 points out of the 100 you need to even be considered eligible.

This happened a week before I was going to visit Boyfriend (dad got me the ticket for christmas). I was very disappointed and visibly upset. So was he, of course. We fought a lot, the littlest stupidest thing caused a big argument. And on my last weekend we had a big fight about something silly that ended with him left me alone in his town with no money and wouldn't pick the phone up. This clearly broke my heart because it wouldn't even cross my mind to do something as horrible to him. He apologized, admitted he overreacted. I was really sad and asked my good friend to pick me up because I wanted to leave his place. 
Somehow we hugged and cried and everything was good again but I must admit I've been feeling strange since that night.

So I came back to SouthAmerica. And It's.Been.Hell.
He's been acting jealous to a point where I'm no longer going out just not to get him upset. I posted a selfie on instagram (no skin no duckface no nada) and he lost his mind. If I add a male friend on facebook I have to tell him exactly who he is and why we're friends (I am(was) on a fb relationship and my photos are all of us together) and whenever I asked why he wouldn't put any photos of us together if it was so important for him, he immediately said they're not important for him. I don't know, he can be a kid sometimes.

Now the final issue:
THANK YOU if you're still reading.
I suggested since I wanted to go back to uni and I would be alone for half of the time because of his job, it could be a good idea to study over there. One of the courses is like 3 hours away and the other one is on the other island, maybe a 1.30hs flight from where he lives. He agreed.
We would be applying for a work permit which I can get after living with him for 3-6 months (in which I CAN'T work) so we can then apply for a residence which I can get after 3 years, so I can then apply for a student loan to pay for the career.
And things got juicy.
I have savings but: because of our beloved president rules we can't take them out of the country and, divided by 12 because of the currency exchange, I couldn't even pay for half a year of tuition.

He said my father should pay for it (?)
I laughed it off and said I wouldn't ask my dad to do that. I mean, I took the adult decision of leaving EVERYTHING behind to move with him, I would never go back to my dad and ask him to pay for any career, specially because it honestly is a lot of money in our currency!

So I asked him if he could please pay for the first year an I would pay him back as I had the money. I never mentioned 'not working', my worst nightmare is becoming a stay at home wife. It's just, unless I strip I guess, I could never gather the 20000 dollars I need to start!

And then he just lost it (via whatsapp, pretty pathetic)
He wouldn't do it. He is not willing to take that risk for me. It's a silly decision to make. 'He wouldn't mind moving with me to where the courses are and leave his family and friends 2 hours behind' (thank you Boyfriend that deserves a Nobel Prize of kindness). 
He basically showed me he doesn't trust me.

And then I remembered he once said he wanted to sign a prenup, which is funny because I told him I have no interest in getting married, ever. But that's another story.

At the moment for the NZ government I am a 45 points, third-world tuberculosis-free woman immigrating to NZ with no outstanding degree or formation that cares. (Because graphic design is not a career they can validate/need)
You can imagine I will end up working (after 3-6 months) on something like a restaurant or a bar, which hey! I really did enjoy when I was younger, but I honestly had enough of it.
I have a very VERY comfortable life here, I have my family (BIG family), my friends, my contacts, I am doing a job I enjoy, I have my car, my dogs, my cats, my flat I've been paying for years almost ready! and decided to leave all of that behind because of him.. 
I DO NOT want to work at something with minimum wage for three years. 

So he broke up with me because we're not going anywhere if I think like that.

I've been crying, angry, in zombie mode, euphoric, pretty much all the emotions a human can experience after a breakup and now I really need advice because I LOVE THIS MAN. I want to make this work. I was willing to 'sacrifice' all of that because I'm tired of being away from him ! But I would love some feedback.
Should I let him go?
How can I try and make him see things from a different point of view?

GRACIAS !!! Thank you so much !!!

I recently got an offer for the summer for a company that will remain nameless. its not a top company like microsoft, etc, but its a well established company doing work that i think is pretty cool.

The thing is, they're offering 12$ an hour which feels like a slap in the face. I know students with half of my course work getting paid triple that, and even though I got an offer it feels like I failed.

I'd like to continue looking for internships, and even had lined up an interview for a couple weeks from now before hearing back today, but I also really want to have *something* this summer, which means I may just have to accept this one anyway.

Should I just accept it? Is the experience gained going to be so valuable that I shouldn't really worry too much?

Will this affect my ability to get a high paying job out of undergrad?"

3648o4,91,2015-05-15,Spare Change,powerhawkmash,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3648o4/spare_change/,"This is a true story. I know they're all true, but this one actually happened to me. 

I used to work at a gas station in Pennsylvania. Even posted a story about it a while back on /r/nosleep. Different night. 

It was a very rural area, maybe ten minutes from the West Virginia border. A lot of hicks came through. The people were all rednecks, minus the odd guy in a suit. The better dressed you were, the more out of place you looked. But they were pretty nice for the most part. I got to know a lot of the regulars, and it was the type of town where if someone left you with a bag of change to pay for their cigarettes, and said, ""It's all there,"" you didn't have to make them wait around while you counted it. Honest, hard working people.

There were a couple guys riding around knocking off liquor stores and gas stations a couple towns over. Nothing crazy, no one got killed or anything. These things just happened from time to time and I knew they would get caught over some dumb mistake like they always did. It was far enough away that I didn't really worry about it, even working nights alone.

Around the same time, a kid went missing. When I say kid, I mean about my age. I was 19 or 20 at the time I think. Stuff like that happened too. Not that you expected it or that it wasn't tragic, but it happened. A lot of drugs came through that town, and sometimes young people would try to step up and be people they weren't, and they'd get caught up in stuff that led to them being found in the river. It wasn't common, maybe once a year or so, but it wasn't unheard of. This kid's name was Adam. I didn't know him, never heard of him until I saw him on the news. Didn't really give him much thought after either. 

Anyway, it was a hot night in the summer. I was home from college on break, not having found an internship to make my pending English degree look a little less laughable. It was a slow night. One of the regulars came in, Miss Rhonda. Older lady, huge and obese, very kind and loved to talk. Since it was slow we chatted. Just everyday stuff, small talk about the weather and the new municipal building they were going to put in next to the high school.

She mentioned the kid Adam, but I didn't really have a whole lot to say about him. ""Yeah, it's a shame kids still mess with that stuff,"" I said as I grabbed her a pack of reds. Like I said, we all figured he got behind on a package of heroin or lost a couple bottles of vicodin that belonged to the wrong guy. Really not much to say beyond that.

Miss Rhonda left me a plastic bag full of change mixed with a couple gold Sacagaweas. I never needed to count her change, it was always right. I don't know why she didn't roll it at the bank, would have made it easier on her and me. She could have left and I would have cut the bag open later and put it in the register. She was poor, but she knew how to count out $6.35 and she never missed. Since it was slow she stayed and I counted it right there.

""Damn shame how they let the drugs get so out of control around here. Probably save a lot of lives if the cops would do their damn jobs."" She wasn't dropping it, but it didn't really bother me. She just wanted someone to talk to on her smoke run. I counted up the change and for the first time ever, she was off. An extra gold dollar somehow found its way into the bag and I handed it back to her.

""Oh you keep it, honey, you don't know when you might need it,"" she said. There was a kind of dark tone to her voice, very uncharacteristic. She seemed to suddenly be in a rush and left.

It wasn't uncommon for people to tell me to keep the change. Even give me tips from time to time. It was usually a couple bucks when they won their scratch offs. At another job I might have taken it as an insult, a dollar tip. But these people didn't have much, and honestly me grabbing her a pack of cigarettes didn't really warrant a tip in the first place, so I put it in my pocket without a second thought.

The rest of the night went by normally. I sold cigarettes, lottery tickets, and gas. There were no break ins, no thefts, really nothing for me to do but wait until ten o'clock.

The sun set and I waited around. It was unusually slow, but some nights were just like that. By the time closing came, I was more than ready to get out of there.

Part of the job was counting up the registers and doing some basic accounting for my shift. I added everything up, and it really had been a slow night. We did like $800 in sales while I was there, which if you've never worked at a gas station, is nothing. I counted the safe drops, added them up, then started on the register, which if you're doing your drops right, should be less than $100. It came out to $79, just short of the $80 or so the accounting sheet showed I should have.

""Goddamnit"" I muttered to myself. I was usually right on. The managers honestly didn't care if you were a couple bucks off. Really anything less than $20 was considered something they could figure out in the morning. But I was always picky about it. Especially on such a slow night, there's no reason I should have been off at all. 

I remembered the gold dollar Miss Rhonda told me to keep, and I figured it would only be right to throw it in with the rest, since I didn't really earn it anyway. 

I pulled out the coin and just as I realized it wasn't a Sacagawea, four cop cars rushed into the parking lot, lights and sirens on, surrounding the place.

My first thought was, ""Fuck, I triggered the alarm."" I had already closed up and the lights were off, so that had to be it. But the cops got out, guns drawn, and swarmed the back of the building. Didn't even glance in the window at me as far as I could tell. I just stood rooted to the spot, too scared to even duck down in case they started shooting.

I must have stood in place for a solid five minutes, not moving. I guess I was just waiting for something to happen. When the shock wore off, I started around the counter, to go out front and talk to the one or two that were still left in their cars, when I saw them.

The cops were leading two guys from around back, handcuffed. They had long hair that looked like it could use a wash, one of them had a bandana. Their shirts were dirty and torn beyond what you end up with from being shoved face down in the dirt. One of them looked up at me before returning his eyes to to the ground. I'd been around long enough to recognize what gave him that face though. Pillheads, probably longtime users. 

I still just kind of stood there, not really sure what had happened.  The police started taping up the area before I could even ask my first question. One of the off duty cops brought me aside with a notepad and must have asked me for a personal history on every single person I saw that night. They brought an ambulance and for some reason, one of the EMTs tried to me in a blanket like I was the victim of a catastrophe. It was literally like ninety degrees outside so I pushed it off me and spit it out. ""What's going on here?""

The cop looked at his partner and they both kind of shook their heads, dead serious like you see cops act before they give someone bad news. They explained to me that the guys they picked up out back were the ones who they'd been looking for in connection with all the robberies. They got a tip that they were spotted in town and someone saw them pull in here. They assumed I was the one they talked to earlier but I didn't know what they were talking about. Whoever had called was right, they sent a couple patrol cars by and saw them parked out back, just behind my car. There was no employee parking lot, we just left our cars out back by the dumpster. It was dead black with no view of the road. They were back there waiting for me to get off.

But the fucked up part wasn't that these guys were going to jump me and bring me back inside to get the safe. Like I said, these robberies hadn't been the kind where anyone got hurt. I almost wanted to laugh when I thought of how little there would have been to take. That's when the cop looked at me and said, ""You know the kid Adam Galloway from the news?""

The robbers had been on a bender that must have lasted a couple days. Pills mostly, but a little meth thrown in because, why not, we're out here with a bunch of rednecks, they were probably just smoking what they could get. We were all right about Adam, he had fallen in with a bad crowd. But they never found him in the river. The car they'd been driving belonged to Adam. He met up with them a day or two before and tried to join, but these idiots were so delusional from all the chemicals they ended up calling narc and killing him. The cops found his body in the trunk. He'd been strangled, and they found the clothesline that was used in one of the robber's pockets.

I sat down on the asphalt and told the EMT I thought I'd take that blanket after all. When you hear people use the word ""chilling"" you think it's just a metaphor or figure of speech, but I promise you it's not. They all kind of stood around and watched me, and that's when I realized I still had the coin in my hand.

[This is the coin Miss Rhonda gave me a few hours earlier.](http://imgur.com/y1PTati) 

I'm not superstitious. I'm not religious. I don't believe in guardian angels or divine intervention or any of that shit. But to this day, I don't know who called the cops. I would have been done for the night, out the back door in ten minutes, and I don't know why they came when they did. I don't know what would have happened if they hadn't, but I have a pretty nasty guess. 

I haven't seen Miss Rhonda since. Or more accurately, I didn't see her for the next month I worked there before I quit. Maybe she called the cops, I thought for a while, but if that was true, that would have meant that she saw them pull around back of the building, and there's absolutely no way that could have happened. She lived a few miles outside town, which I knew from the small talk we made over the course of that summer.

I went to her house about a year later. Couldn't shake what happened that night I guess. In hindsight, maybe I should have seen a therapist about it or something. But I was about to graduate college and move out of state, so I wanted to stop by and ask her about it. I had to know if she heard.

The house was empty, and I figured she must have moved. Almost being murdered has a way of nagging at your mind though, so I stopped by the neighbors' to see if they knew where she went. They told me no one had lived there for five years. 

I still keep the coin on me to this day, tucked in my wallet behind my drivers license. I live in Jersey now, in a part where you don't really walk around by yourself when the streetlights come on. When I'm walking home from the bar at night and I hear footsteps behind me, I still reach for my back pocket, into my wallet, and touch it. 

I'm still not superstitious. I'm still not religious. I still don't believe in guardian angels or divine intervention. That's what I tell myself anyway."

I changed my whole life in January and it got way worse. It will be this way until September.

I moved to another town for a post grad college program. I knew the program would be mediocre but it had a good reputation for internships at the end which is why I did it. I hate the program. Every project is group work, half the class are international students with bad English and no background in what we're doing. It can be incredibly grating when you have to explain everything that's been gone over in class to someone like they are a 5 year old. I have no real friends here.

The college is at the northern end of a suburban waste land town. There is seriously nothing around here. I do not have a car, I have to walk 30 minutes just to get groceries, which in itself isn't a big deal, but that gives you an idea of what its like here. I am from the big city and I hate it here. The college itself is a barebones commuter college. 

My living situation sucks. It is a room in a student rooming house. One roommate has severe ADHD and what I suspect to be Asperger's. He is incredibly hard to be around. He thinks he's my friend but in all honesty I can't stand him. A new girl just moved into the basement. She is from Africa, and has people over here every single day. They yell at each other in the common areas all day, it drives me nuts. She's moved her friend in to the basement which is definitely not allowed as well but I don't want to make waves. There are no locks on the doors. I don't always feel safe here, I am always on edge. I have night terrors and sleep paralysis constantly. 

I'm fucking miserable. The last three months I haven't slept well, I experience crazy mood swings, and sometimes I feel so encumbered by the gravity of my feelings that I can't even get out of bed. Sometimes I'll just get so miserable that drinking myself into oblivion for 2 days straight is the only way I can get outside my head.

I've never experienced this before in my life. I've lost about 20 lbs since I moved here from the stress. Sometimes I just don't feel like eating because I feel so shitty.

364h19,347,2015-05-15,Parents charge me rent when I visit once a year. (Extended post from r/personalfinance). Thoughts?,J1--1J,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/364h19/parents_charge_me_rent_when_i_visit_once_a_year/,"Hello there,


I'm generally interested to see what a wider population thinks of this situation. Everyone I've discussed this with in person tends to think it's a bit strange.


Originally posted this in PF because I thought at the core of this its a financial issue, but got a lot of callouts about it being more appropriate here. So, this is the same post with additions regarding more info as asked for in original post 


http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/34pewa/parents_charge_me_expenses_when_i_visit_annually/


So, I went overseas (New Zealand to Australia) to complete an internship, which I have since completed, after I completed university. I have decided to remain in Australia due to the professional opportunities etc, that will serve me well in the long term (also lifestyle). 


Every summer I take my leave to go back home. I stay with my parents, spending my time hanging out with them, friends, cousins and so on during Xmas and New Years and the festive season when everyone is usually on holiday too.


My parents charge me rent to cover my own expenses while I visit. My longest visit was 5 weeks, 3 at the least. The average stay these days is about 3 weeks. The most they have charged is $100 a week, the least is $75. This is in its 7th year.


I'd estimate I spend 60% of my time at the home, using expenses. Any day might entail me spending the whole day at home doing whatever, spending the entire day (or even few days away) with friends, or some kind of 50/50 split. I'm not having gourmet breakfast, lunch, and dinner while running the power 24/7.


I of course help out with chores and help wider family with whatever, babysitting for example. I also contribute by way of buying daily things like bread and milk, gas, alcohol, food/coffee if we go out for lunch/dinner.


Be aware I'm very grateful to my parents for bringing me up with financial wise. I have paid off my student loan and purchase my own home for which I have paid off half my mortgage in 7 years. This teaching started from a young age, I've never been without a job since I was 12, now 30, qualified, and working in healthcare. I've never lived beyond my means. I pay rent at my own place, pay all my own bills, have never been in credit debt or 'sprulge' etc. If i want something, i save up for it yadda yadda yadda. I studied while living at home for maybe 1 1/2 years (of 4) and paid rent at this time, but in that case I felt it was justified. 


Some additional info about our financials. Keep in mind neither of us are near struggle street or anything, so these are the financials relevant to the situation. 


Both used to work full time but that is currently down to one working near full time hours. Purchases since I've left have been a new tv+stereo home theatre, new 4WD dodge, and a boat (yes, a boat....they got a boat). They have no mortgage and all us adult children are out of home.


Beyond rent charge, I also have to pay flights which can be $700 something return. Also, my parents won't pick me up from/drop me off at the airport which is just on an hour away, which adds $160 back &amp; forth getting a shuttle. So all expenses usually end up $900ish. I fully accept the responsibility to pay for the flights. My mum has visited me once in Australia and I didn't charge her a cent.


I am in two minds about this situation.


In my practical mind yes, I am a financial expense over time. I get that.


In my emotional mind, I don't feel welcome. I visit once a year. When I add the factor that they won't do the airport thing either, well....I just feel like a tenant. 2 hours out of their year, and maybe $30 gas. 


Now it's not like we have a relationship issue or anything, everything is always on good terms. It's just 'there' and with various people from various aspects of my life (friend, friends parents, parents young and old at work) thinking it's strange, its just bothering.


I've tried telling them this but they bring it down to 'paying my way' and I dont think they get how this comes across. Above my daily contributions/assistance, they set out a weekly minimum.


Thoughts?


tl;dr: parents charge me to stay at their place on holiday. I think it's lame, most others do, parents dont. 


Thoughts?

364iq9,5,2015-05-15,How can I make the best of a bad life situation?,Proslaytus,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/364iq9/how_can_i_make_the_best_of_a_bad_life_situation/,"I thought I was depressed before. I changed my whole life in January and it got way worse. It will be this way until September.

I moved to another town for a post grad college program. I knew the program would be mediocre but it had a good reputation for internships at the end which is why I did it. I hate the program. Every project is group work, half the class are international students with bad English and no background in what we're doing. It can be incredibly grating when you have to explain everything that's been gone over in class to someone like they are a 5 year old. I have no real friends here.

The college is at the northern end of a suburban waste land town. There is seriously nothing around here. I do not have a car, I have to walk 30 minutes just to get groceries, which in itself isn't a big deal, but that gives you an idea of what its like here. I am from the big city and I hate it here. The college itself is a barebones commuter college. 

My living situation sucks. It is a room in a student rooming house. One roommate has severe ADHD and what I suspect to be Asperger's. He is incredibly hard to be around. He thinks he's my friend but in all honesty I can't stand him. A new girl just moved into the basement. She is from Africa, and has people over here every single day. They yell at each other in the common areas all day, it drives me nuts. She's moved her friend in to the basement which is definitely not allowed as well but I don't want to make waves. There are no locks on the doors. I don't always feel safe here, I am always on edge. I have night terrors and sleep paralysis constantly. 

I'm fucking miserable. The last three months I haven't slept well, I experience crazy mood swings, and sometimes I feel so encumbered by the gravity of my feelings that I can't even get out of bed. Sometimes I'll just get so miserable that drinking myself into oblivion for 2 days straight is the only way I can get outside my head. I drank 15 cans of PBR yesterday and just blew off all my classes, while I laid in bed and watched Youtube videos. I had got drunk the night before as well. I fell asleep at 7pm and woke up at 3am, shaking, sweating, and heart racing. Unfortunately this is probably something I've done like half a dozen times since January.

Teaser flashes of the day's news: Man seen on pogo stick going across the Forbes Ave foot-bridge/ University bureaucracy still hasn't officially hired a worker who has already been on the project for two weeks/ Five Guys Burgers and Fries voted best burger joint by the city of Bangor, Maine. Logo comes back and music fades as it cuts to two men sitting at a desk with papers. [](/sp)

[](/aj04)Anchor: Good evening stooges, this is the six o'clock Ostensible News. i'm your anchor Quasi M. Truth. But before we get to the juicy stuff I'd like to take a moment to contemplate the tragic loss of our old one, Owen Lots, who died doing what he loved; getting water-boarded by the mafia-owned casino for card counting. Anywho meet our new Co-anchor who has joined us today, Nick Wordsworth. Would you like to tell us a little about yourself Nick? [](/sp)

[](/nerdtwi)Nick: Of course Quasi. I just moved here from the city of Pittsburgh where I spoke as an anchor there. But the competition was tough, even with my two awards, so when I heard this small town needed a new anchor I was glad to fill in. [](/sp)

[](/ajterror)Quasi: Co-anchor, Nick. So, on to the first news of the day. Has the negligence of the pogo industry claimed another life? You'll find out right after this commercial break. [](/sp)

[](/smooze22)A commercial for a children's toy called Gak, one for Viagra, another one for the same children's toy, a cleaning product horked by some wanna-be Billy Mays replacement, two more commercials for Gak, advert for Wallmart, would you shut the fuck up about Gak already, and a trailer for Jurassic World.

[](/twigrump)Nick: Wait. That's it? [](/sp)

[](/angryaj)Quasi: Some people might defend these actions as a repressed, marginalized group finally speaking out, but honestly, the community leaders should be held accountable when things go this far. [](/sp)

[](/seriouslytwilight)Nick: Also, how are we reporting on this if no one witnessed it? [](/sp)

364jx7,9,2015-05-15,My plans for the clinical year fell apart and now I need some help finding more options!,Snoopy_the_Pilot,medlabprofessionals,https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/364jx7/my_plans_for_the_clinical_year_fell_apart_and_now/,"Alright so I thought I was good to be starting a clinical internship the fall of 2015 but I found out this week that I will not be able to start due to have not completed one course by the end of the spring semester (which I am completing this summer). So now I have to wait a year to start the clinical internship. If I stay with this program I will only have 2 classes to take in the next year as I wait to start the clinical internship and my graduation date is pushed back to the summer of 2017, which is not what I want.
So I am trying to find alternative options that will bump up my graduation date.

A few options I have been considering is getting a second major in General Biology, so I have can get a degree by the end of the fall, which would help with getting a job. As well as I could then look at more post-baccalaureate programs vs. just the programs which my school is affiliated with. 
The other big option is to stay with the program and work for a year along with the 2 classes. The problem with this is I want to try and find something field related but since I don't have an actual degree yet it is looking tough to find anything halfway decent.

I am very confused on what to do at this moment and would like to hear some opinions on what would be good options for me to move forward with!

Thanks

We were in the mere talking/hanging out stages of our friendship.  I know people hate when people say they are ""talking"" and all that bullshit, but its true.  We were not dating we were just getting to really know each other.

She had an ex about 5 months ago and we started talking a month after they brroke up.  I do not have twitter or instagram so idk what she does on social medias.

Fast forward to a week ago, things were going amazing.  Literally amazing with this girl, and I thought we were going to soon be a potential couple.... Until I saw her instagram and twitter.  She postedd about her ""ex"" boyfriend about a week ago and my friend showed me.  I freaked the fuck out for real.  This whole time she was telling me she was single then she goes and pulls this bullshit.  

I told her it was over and that was that.  

Fast forward to yesterday.... She calls me after a week of not talking.  She wants to settle what happened and I was all ears.  She was telling me her ex was abusive to her and that he manipulates her to posting things on insta/twitter about them.  (she showed me the texts.)  But I am confused.  She has been with me, why is she still caught up on him.....

We ended up fixing things and hung out that same day.  Had a good day.  

Today now...  She posts on snap chat of her at her boyfriends graduation with her ex in the car...  This just blew my fucking mind.

I feel like I got played super hard in this situation, and was used for like 4 months.  I told her exactly how I felt and she was getting upset with herself.  I told her I was mad at myself for putting myself in this situation in the first place.  

She leaves for an internship for 7 months and i wish her the best of luck (felt like the right thing to do.)  But told her I no longer wish to speak to her.  

Is this the right thing to do?  She said she ""told me everything that has been going on.""  But is that enough to trust her?  I mean she was at his fucking graduation after the fact that she STILL told me she was single.. I mean idk. 

Advice Reddit?  Thanks

TL;DR:  Girl said she was single, Got to know her for 4 months, ended up playing me kinda, I ended contact with her, do not know whether or not I should go back in 7 months or not when she comes home or do I still keep contact with her. "
364q2w,3,2015-05-15,8 week internship vs full-time/part time job,PrepFashionBeginner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/364q2w/8_week_internship_vs_fulltimepart_time_job/,"Okay, so I am in a pickle and here is the dealio.
I have gotten two offers. 

One offer is an 8 week full-time internship during the summer that pays $18 an hour. It is a company called DST systems. After the internship, I don't know if they are offering a co-op/part time position if they like me. The technologies I will be using will be most likely Java, SQL, and Unix. Keep in mind also that I will be graduating in Spring 2016 (one year from now). So I feel like this would be risky if I would take this offer. If I do not get an extended offer, I will be finding another job to work during the school year.

My second offer is from the government, the department of child services. They are offering full-time during the whole summer, and are even offering me part-time during the school year. However, they are only paying 12 an hour. I like this route as I feel it is a more safer, secure and flexible option, since I'll be there for a longer time and if they like me, I'll be able to get a full time offer and will be able to switch departments if I want to. This department uses technologies such as php, sql, .net, and vb.net.
What would you guys choose?"

i have applied to a lot of internship positions inside and outside my country, most of them have responded me and some of them made me nice offers, currently i havent taken any of those because i'm on my finals week, i know that i might not be the greatest coder i think im pretty novice but with a wide knowledge, i belive my personality and my way to speak in the interviews have helped me a lot but i have lost almost four years studying a engineering in Information Technology and communications in a very expensive university in my country and i really have felt that i wasted my time entirely, all the classes i have taken 60% were not related to engineering nor computer science and they are mandatory in order to get a degree, the ones i took with that topic like physics or networking were awful i had to spend most of my time studying at home i almost lost all of my friends and girlfriend(actually i did lost many girlfriends in the past four years) because of that, this semester i got really really mad because i was working and i forgot that my ITIL (administration of IT services) class had this activity that had a value of 30% - 40% of our final grade and my teacher didnt wanted me to give me a second chance or a project or anything because i had like 7 absences in the whole semester, my security information teacher never actually said a word about the class in the entire semester he made us make power point presentations about every topic  in groups to give us a grade... 

well this time im just tired about complaining to the university and in my website or other social networks, i think i wanna drop out and start over but this time studying computer science 100% in a serious university or if its posible online!

i do realize that i need a degree to make my chances of getting a good job better but i dont know what to do.

What would you do if you had to spend  6000 usd each semester in a country where the minimum wage per day is 8 dlls(i live in mexico) were all your classes looked like a bad bad joke, all your colleagues were more interested in fixing computers or in a help desk(with a IT major) than in coding itself and all the other public schools were completely horrible and worst most of the times?

3652g3,1,2015-05-16,My roommate is trying to blackmail me (tx),[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3652g3/my_roommate_is_trying_to_blackmail_me_tx/,"So my current roommate and me are in the middle of a dispute regarding who gets the apartment we share next year. Anyway, my problem involves (1) the apartment dispute, and (2) threats from him (blackmail?) to tell the school I use/offer drugs to other students.

**Apartment Dispute**
Some background info: we're both students. Our apartment is part of a low-income housing program, so we pay much less than other comparable units in the area. It's so cheap that I can actually afford the whole thing by myself. We're both on the lease, we found it together, and have been here the same amount of time.

When our lease ends in August, he wants to move one of his friends into my room. Up until he told me about his plans earlier this week, I was planning on staying and renewing the lease with him. We had discussed it briefly last fall. I told him that since I figured we both have equal right to the apartment, I was going to stay, and that if he wanted to live with his friend he could do that elsewhere or get bunk beds. We've both talked to the leasing office separately, and they're not going to get in the middle of this, although I qualify to rent the apartment separately. There's another unit in the same program that might open up, and if it does, I'm going to that one.

Up until this morning, he was saying he lined up a new roommate because I'd been asking around school about another roommate for next year (I wasn't, not that it matters).

**Blackmail?**
This morning, I get a long text from him claiming (a) I've been asking for and offering marijuana/cocaine/ketamine(seriously) to other students, (b) the school is doing some kind of investigation into this because I pissed off someone who snitched, (c) the school has been asking him what he knows about it, and (d) if I don't move out peacefully, he'll tell the school about everything on Monday.

I emailed the dean of students, asking if there was an investigation into me and saying I think my roommate is threatening to accuse me of being some kind of drug dealer. She said she didn't know of any investigation against me. I haven't responded to the text or the response from the dean. I told the apartment management that I'm anticipating he'll try and make the same claim to them.

There's some truth to what he's saying, I've smoked weed and used cocaine in the apartment in the past year, after asking whether he was comfortable with it. I actually have done both with him, smoking with him semi-frequently. I don't think I'm less discrete about it than other students. 

I stopped a month ago in order to test clean for an internship, and I tested clean on a home test today. I have no paraphernalia in the apartment.

Other than that, he's been giving me adderall off his prescription pretty frequently. I also made some stupid jokes when I found out that K is shorthand for contract as well as ketamine.

Now, I'm going to my internship out of town on Sunday. My roommate is not here and won't be back until Monday, so I'm not going to see him until August. I'm taking all my valuables out of the apartment, and I'll be able to move out all the rest and my furniture Monday (someone else would be doing it) if that's a good idea. Whatever happens, I'm not living with him next year. I'm talking to an attorney tomorrow about all this, so advice or perspective are helpful.

**My questions:** 

1. Is there any hope for me to keep the apartment next year alone?

2. Can I remove him from the apartment due to the threat now?

3. Do I have any recourse against him? Civil, Criminal, or through the school?

4. What is my liability in the drug accusations?

5. I'm not going to lie, but I really don't want to volunteer more of this than I have to to the school or apartment. I'm telling the lawyer tomorrow everything."

But I think the pay for this work is lower than standards and I am  being offered almost 1.8x basic salary somewhere else to work as a  software dev (compared to data engineer right now).

I really enjoy my work and there is a lot of learning, but I have financial responsibilities back home. 

**tl;dr**
How do I negotiate a fulltime offer given to me months back when I was an intern? How should I go ahead with the conversation? How do I ask for a better pay on fulltime than the one I was offered back when I was still in university? It's a little awkward because it will be face to face this time and I have been working with them since the last 4 months as an intern. How should I go ahead with this?

Back story, skip this paragraph if you don't care. So, I knew there wasn't going to be a local programming job in my small town but I tried anyway. I have been hired for a position that is basically a paid internship with a pseudo promise it will go full time if everyone is happy a few months from now. Important part to me is to get some form of job experience while continuing to learn coding in my own time. Plus the people seem really cool and chill, so the work environment probably/hopefully wont suck. 

So I am talking to the guy about my job responsibilities and it boils down to two things. General hardware help. Making sure things are working properly or attempting to fix them if not. A roaming IT person. But my question is on the second thing. **I'm going to be helping with a Microsoft based domain register and setting up computers with their own domain addresses.** I think I understand the concept but I'd really like to study or read up more about it specifically before I get to the work site. I'm having a hard time finding the proper set of keywords to punch in, or I don't know what I'm looking for and have found it. **Would anyone who has a similar job be willing to point me in the right direction for online self study and maybe describe their daily routine?** I've been told I'll be taught everything I need to know but I've heard plenty of horror stories about that exact line and I prefer to rely on my employer as little as possible.

365kam,9,2015-05-16,Remote Desktop Routing,canadadryistheshit,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/365kam/remote_desktop_routing/,"Good evening /r/networking

This topic is a little of networking and a little of sysadmin, but mostly networking.

I have a question regarding Remote Desktop routing with Windows Server 2012 and would like to find a better networking solution then the one I have setup currently.

My co-worker and I work from home at times because most of the support we offer is remotely done to clients in other states within the US, we prefer working in our pajamas - don't hate. There are times where we need to access our office servers we administrate. We have a total of 4 on the rack and only 2 of them have external IP addresses. We got tired of remoting in to one server just to be able to reach the other two servers and other computers in the office.

SO, I came up with a temporary solution to solve this with a port forwarding method via the netsh command on one of the two RD Gateway servers. I understand I could port forward from the router but Charter Communications doesn't allow their customers into the router interface for ""security reasons.""

""netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=*5000* listenaddress=*0.0.0.0* connectport=*3389* connectaddress=*destination_computer_ip*""

I tested it from home and it works fine but I'm unsure if it uses up a CAL or if its even safe opening up port 5000-5010 externally. So I'd like a better solution like the one below.

We have an actual .com domain that we use from Godaddy. I would like to replace the port forward method with:

""server1.domain.com"" 
""server2.domain.com""
""server3.domain.com""
""server4.domain.com""
""officecomputer.domain.com"" etc....

....So my co-worker and I can access each computer by their FQDN name followed by our .com domain externally with remote desktop (it works internally already). The other five employees in the office have requested this as well for when they go home at night and wish to get some extra work done. I don't want to open up anymore ports until I find out the port forwarding method is safe or another solution is in place.

I have a ""Configuring Windows Server 2012"" book from a buddy of mine that gave it to me when I was hired onto my internship but it has no information regarding on what I wish to do. I've googled as well but can't seem to find a solid guide anywhere on how to do this. Can anyone point me in the right direction?"

I finished it early this morning and since I wasn't going to work today, I was going to bring it by his house before he went in - I didn't really think about it, I just showed up.

So at about 7:30 I went to his house. When I pulled up out the front, I saw another man walking towards the door. So I sat and waited. I saw his wife open the door and jump into the other guys arms and start kissing him. Then the front door closed. I sat there kinda stunned for a few minutes. I never knew what time he went into work but I assumed it was somewhere around 8.

After I saw that I was really hoping he was into some weird swinging stuff. I called him and said that I finished the work, that I could bring it past his house, he said he was already at work. So I brought it in and got out by 8:15. I didn't say anything.

I'm not sure what to do now. Should I tell him? Am I better to leave an anonymous note?

I am willing to work hard to achieve this but in the case of dismissal I don't want to abandon my MS degree. If given a chance to start again I would avoid the mistakes and work hard to achieve better grades.

My low GPA is mainly due to choosing wrong subjects and not performing in those up to the required level.
Also I am an international student, I have a decent undergrad, GRE and IELTS scores as well as some internship experience if it helps.

My question is, can I get admitted as transfer student to decent university and where can I get more information about the procedure?

Also I have another option of changing the department from Mechanical to Industrial (or some other) but my previous education and experience as well as my interest is mainly in Mechanical Engineering

I am really confused and need help

UPDATE: I had an Email conversation with the dean of graduate studies for my department, he has assured me that I won't be dismissed and I can take 2 courses next semester and try to perform better. I am greatly relieved!
For anyone in the similar situation talk to your dean and higher authorities they are really helpful. And thank you for answering questions here, it really helps people."

The town I will be living in is suburban area near Stamford, CT. It's comprised of pretty much all upper-middle-class white people, so I am a little nervous in this aspect. Even though I go to school in the south, I've never really gotten shit for being Asian (looking back, I really wish I were still blissfully ignorant of the stuff some Asians face). I'm decently tall and built, have a couple cool hobbies that I'm really good at, and overall a pretty sociable guy, so I guess I've always been able to fit in and stand out at the same time. Still, I am a little afraid that I will be seen as an outsider because I'll very likely be the only Asian in any group situation here. For guys who have grown up or lived in areas that are predominately white (90%+), what is it like? Any advice on meeting girls when I'm on my own?

365z2q,0,2015-05-16,I [20M] told my best friend [20F] that I have feelings for her.,PrinceAsneeze,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/365z2q/i_20m_told_my_best_friend_20f_that_i_have/,"So yesterday, I told my best friend I had feelings for her. Let's call her Amy. Amy and I were friends in high school, and I liked her back then too. When we graduated we weren't the best of friends, and she went off to college about an hour away from me. After graduation she started dating this guy, we'll call him Mike. Freshman year we didn't talk, she came back in the summer and we started chilling before becoming close towards the beginning of our sophomore year. We visited each other here and there in the beginning, and around this time she broke up with Mike as she didn't feel a connection.  Her and I got even closer as friends in the spring, to the point that we saw each other every weekend by either of us visiting.

At this point I should mention that Amy tells me I'm her best friend.  She also tells me that she I was full of good vibes and she always felt good around me.  At this point I'm the only one who has never hit on her or tried anything. We wanted to hang out all summer, but she got this internship in New York so she's leaving this Monday for the entire summer.

I started getting feelings for her again at some point, and I felt like I needed to tell her. I didn't expect anything from it because she honestly makes me happy and feel good and I didn't wanna mess up our friendship for anything. I didn't want a relationship, as she told me that she couldn't date anyone for awhile recently and I believed her.

So I told her I had feelings for her and that I didn't expect anything, and that I didn't care what we were as long as we're in each other's lives. She said she couldn't date anyone now because of her bad relationship with Mike and all she saw with dating her friends was it ending badly. I told her that's fine, I really didn't expect anything and that I would rather us stay friends over anything. We hung out for a little after that, and I was acting the exact same as I was before I told her how I felt, I meant what I said about valuing our friendship and I wasn't being weird or any different than I was, and I thought she was too. Her friend, Emily, came over as she had moved in a couple houses down from me. We chilled for a few minutes before Amy went out to show Emily some art in her car that she had for her, as she does a lot of her own art and is looking for a career path in it.

After that, nothing. Amy left around 5:30, and I didn't hear from her at all. She had Emily text me later asking for something instead of asking me herself. I texted Amy around 8:30 saying what's up where she told me she was drawing at Emily's. I asked if we were gonna chill again that night, she said she was probably gonna just stay over there. I asked if I would see her before she left to New York, and she said I would see her the next day. I said ""cool, what do you wanna do"" only to get no answer. The thing is, our mutual friend Dave is having a small party tonight and she knew I would be showing up so she was probably referring to that when she said she'd see me again.

Right now, I'm pretty sad. I feel like I've lost my best friend and I don't know what to do about it. She was someone I thought wouldn't be weird about it, I thought if I was straight up with her she'd respect that and wouldn't let it get in the way. I honestly can let go of how I feel, her friendship means more to me than anything. I know now I shouldn't have told her but I took some random advice from some person who doesn't even know her and I let myself get convinced I had to tell her before she left. Either way I just want my friend back.

**TL;DR;** I told my best friend I had feelings for her when I'm the only guy who's never hit on her. I was her closest friend and now she's being distant, now I'm afraid I won't see her before she leaves for the entire summer and even worse, that our friendship has been impacted. I just want my friend back.

There is this simple release that comes from watching the blood trickle from a fresh wound. It's like all of the bad thoughts and negative emotions are waiting just below the surface and this holy straight razor is cleansing my body of all the terrible things I endure throughout the day. Don't mistake my self-destructive behavior as suicidal intention or masochism. There is a spot on my thigh that I cut from time to time, but you'll find no scars on my arms or anywhere you'd see in daily life. This habit, it is almost a compulsion. It is like my blood is this foreign liquid that must be purged from my body. 

I work as a floor supervisor for a suicide hotline. The irony of a cutter working in such a place isn't lost on me. The volunteers sit at their phones while I walk the floor listening in on the calls and keeping notes on the call activity. It says something about how fucked up the world is that we actually have a quota. This quota is simple. If you call making a suicidal threat, we are to call the police and having you apprehended for a seventy-two hour hold. The charity that pays our bills is funded almost entirely by three different local psychiatric hospitals. If you call because life seems like it isn't worth living, chances are you'll help us meet our quota when we refer you for a psychiatric evaluation. 

When I am not walking the floor or training new volunteers you can find me holed up in my office browsing various internet forums. I think its fair to say I have an unhealthy fascination with death. From an early age I've been unable to accept that eighty or so years of consciousness is some meaningless interval that begins abruptly and ends in an instant. My obsession with death has more to do with discovering what, if anything comes after it. While the plebs on the floor are answering calls from morose motherfuckers sad about their lives I'm reading accounts of near death experiences and messaging people who claim to have had contact with supernatural forces. 

Most of my inquiries don't pan out. 

The vast majority of the people who claim to have contact with otherworldly forces are either liars, lunatics, or both. In nearly fifteen years of searching, I've seldom found more than misinterpreted coincidence and uncorroborated claims. Well, there is one girl who stands out, but I'll get to her later. For now, I'll just say that most of what you read on the internet is bullshit. One of my favorite quotes goes like this. 

*“Don't trust everything you read on the internet.""*

Pisha is a woman I met in an IRC chatroom over on freenode IRC. The room I had searched the active room list and found a room titled #Ouroboros. There were twenty users in the room, but she was the one that messaged me as soon as I entered. I saved the chatlog of our initial conversation. I'll display it below. 

&gt; Pisha216: You shouldn't be here.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Where should I be if not here?
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: I suppose you think you are clever?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Perhaps.
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: Cleverness &amp; Curiosity can get you killed.
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: Go back to whatever room you came from. 
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Suppose that I am curious and clever, what's the worst that could happen?
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: I'll send you an email later. For now, I'm booting you from the room. 
&gt; 
&gt; (User Pisha216 has kicked you from #Ouroboros, Reason: Uninvited)

It was an odd encounter, but not uncommon. A lot of those rooms are set up for private groups and I had stumbled in without knowing exactly what to say or do while there. A few days later I was checking my email at work when I received an email from Pisha216@hell(dot)com. It had been a while since I had seen an email from that domain. From what I understood, the mail server went offline back in 2010. Even still, there was an email with an attachment. 

It read:

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; The Temple of Ouroboros is not currently accepting new pledges. If you would be so kind as to explain how you entered the room without the appropriate password it would be appreciated. My name is Pisha Maxwell, but you may refer to me as Pisha. I am an apprentice with the Temple of Ouroboros. My superiors have tasked me with vetting you and figuring out your intent. Should you prove to be a worthy candidate, my superiors may allow further contact in a manner they see fitting.
&gt; 
&gt; — Second Level Apprentice Pisha Marie Maxwell

I replied:

&gt; Pisha,
&gt; 
&gt; There was no password prompt when I joined the channel. My intent was one of curiosity. I was completely unaware that your organization existed. Please forgive my intrusion. It was just one of my late night internet binges where I went looking for something spooky. Sorry to disturb you. 
&gt; 
&gt; — (Name Removed)

Several weeks passed and I received no response. I figured it was just some group of weirdos heavy into role play or some sort of kinky sex stuff. I was walking the floor and listening to a caller who identified themselves as Pisha. It's a rather uncommon name. Sometimes I would take over a call if it seemed like the volunteer was floundering. I made some excuse about protocol and had the call transferred to my office. 

I picked up the receiver and a timid female voice said, *“I'm sorry to bother you. I hope I didn't get the other guy in trouble.”* I responded, *“No ma'am, sometimes with special cases I step in and handle the calls personally. My name is (removed). How can I help you?”* From there, our conversation when as such. 

Pisha said, *“I'm up for review with this umm... internship I've taken up. I don't think I'll be selected for advancement. My next review won't be for another year. I don't know if I can take another year at this level of service. Most apprentices who fail their second review kill themselves. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live with the shame of being passed over.”*

I interjected, *“Why do you think you'll be rejected for advancement Pisha?”*

She continued, *“I was tasked with vetting a potential newcomer. His story checked out, but I set up my mail client to delete messages on the server after I downloaded them. My laptop fried and I didn't have a backup of his contact information. If I returned to my superiors to ask for it, they would have marked me unfavorably. I have two days to find someone and properly vet someone and I don't even know how to get a hold of them.”*

I sat back in my office chair and contemplated my next words carefully. It violated pretty much every ethical standard of my position to even take the call. But to identify myself could get me fired. I had to be careful, but I didn't want her to off herself.

I replied back, *“The Temple of Ouroboros sounds like a pretty hardcore organization. I don't know who this potential newcomer is, but if I were a betting man I'd say he could be found at the Book &amp; Bean off of 2nd &amp; Porter in (Town Removed) tomorrow at around five.”*

Pisha responded in a hushed tone, *“This is twice now you've inexplicably appeared. Someone will be there. Thank you. Thank you so very much.”*

Pisha assured me that she wouldn't harm herself and I ended the call. After filling out the appropriate forms I logged the call and then logged into the quality control system and ensured that the audio had been marked reviewed and approved. It was an abuse of my position, but there was something about her voice that seemed so familiar. I clocked out at eleven o'clock and I was home and in bed by midnight. 

I was anxious about my meeting with Pisha later in the day and overwhelmed with guilt from abusing my position at work. I was a bit more hurried than normal when I pulled the straight razor from my pocket and made an incision in my left thigh. I cut a little deeper than normal and ended up having to give myself stitches. After more than fifteen years of self-harm, I had become fairly adept at patching myself up. I winced with pain with each stroke of the needle moving through my flesh. After some cleanup and some fresh gauze I pulled my Tripp pants and a Social Distortion t-shirt from my closet and headed to the Book &amp; Bean.

A confused girl in an ankle length slim gray lace dress wondered into the coffee shop a little bit before five o'clock. She was carrying an attache case and wore black horn rimmed glasses that rested on a slender face that was partially hidden by jet black hair. I looked at her for a moment and marveled at how she was an almost classic beauty. Her eyes locked with mine and she made her way over to my table. She extended a tiny hand that I shook firmly. She introduced herself in a timid voice, *“My name is Pisha Maxwell and I represent The Temple of Ouroboros, I take it you're (removed.)”*

I nodded.

She continued, *“Do you believe in fate? I don't mean some hokey sense of predestination, but rather that from the first spark of the big bang that all of these random atoms collided into one another just so that two people could meet? Twice now you've inexplicably appeared when I needed you the most. I don't believe in coincidence.”*

I took a sip from my latte and responded, *“I don't buy into fate. As much as I'd like to think of a few girls weaving the circumstances of our lives with golden looms I'm a skeptic and a pragmatist. Things happen. Any meaning behind them is purely subjective. That being said, it is a pleasure to finally meet you Pisha.”*

A barista approached our table and took Pisha's order. She motioned for some more comfortable chairs in the back of the room and by the time we had moved over to the vinyl easy chairs the barista returned with a warm Earl Grey tea with a wedge of orange. Sat on a love seat and motioned for me to join her there. She sipped her tea and placed it on the table next to her. A single finger moved the hair out of her eyes and we locked into a gaze where I could have fallen into those cold brown eyes. 

She looked away quickly and said, *“It's strange. We've just met and I feel like I've known you my whole life.”*

Still looking where her eyes had just been I responded, *“I hope I'm not being too forward when I say this, as I'm sure it wasn't your intention when you came here, but I haven't been able to take my eyes off of you since you walked in the room. It's not something I saw often, but you are simply captivating.”*

She smiled and turned her feet inward as she tried to deflect the compliment and my advance saying, *“As much as I'd enjoy taking you back to my hotel room and removing your clothes with my teeth, this is purely a business meeting Mr. (removed.)”*

I scooted towards the arm a bit to try and give her some space and she put a hand on my shoulder saying, *“Don't get me wrong. I'm flattered, in any other circumstance you would have just sealed the deal, but I have some more questions you need answered and a 7 AM flight in the morning.”* Then she leaned up and kissed me on the cheek. Her timid voice seemed a bit more bold with that declaration. 

She asked a new question, *“What do you know about Ouroboros? What would you assume about an organization that treats the figure like a deity?”*

I responded, *“I know about a much as anyone else that shows up to a coffee shop with a triskelion tattoo on his wrist in full goth attire. I always saw it as an eternal cycle like that biologically immortal jellyfish in Japan that lives for a million or so years. I imagine a religion centered around such a figure would be focused on eternal life through perpetual rebirth.”*

She smirked, *“I pegged you as clever in our first encounter, but that was eerily insightful. You're right. The Temple of Ouroboros is a religious sect that is centered around the belief that death can be averted through rebirth. Membership is incredibly exclusive. There are only fifty members operating in the United States and that includes apprentices and neonates. You have gained the attention of my direct superior. If you pass this interview, it is likely that we will fly you to the temple for the initiation process, if that is what you desire.”*

I took a long sip from my latte and stared off into the distance saying, *“It might sound strange, but I'm not even sure such a thing would make sense for me. I've spent my whole life looking for meaning in death, the idea of averting it altogether seems almost cheap. I don't know why your superiors are so interested in me. I'm a thirty-three year old slacker in a dead end job that spends his free time looking for answers online. At this point I'm not even sure where I'm going in life, much less that I'd want to live forever.”*

Pisha leaned over and put her head on my shoulder as her arms wrapped around me in a warm embrace I recognized as the first intimate human contact I had experienced in the better part of eight months. She brought her lips so close to my ear that I could feel her warm breath against my skin. In that moment she said, *“I'm at the Marriott, room 734. You bent the rules for me, allow me to bend the rules for you.”*

We went through another hour of question and answer from that point, but I can't remember most of it. There was something about her that was so uncanny and out of place. I was completely enthralled, but wary of her frequent transition between timid and bold. There was something off about her, but as the interview ended I kissed her hand and she caught a cab. I walked back to the car debating whether or not I should take her up on her offer. 

Several months prior to this I got about this far with a girl but when it came time to do the deed she saw the scars on my thigh and a fresh incision that left her uncomfortable. That was the last I saw that girl. She stopped volunteering at the call center and I ended up in a performance review where my boss explained that while they had no problems employing someone with a mental illness, that I would need a note from a doctor stating that I wasn't a danger to myself of others. I had to go to three months of therapy just to keep my job. If they found out about this, I'd be fired. That is the main reason I continue to remove any of my personal information from this account of the past few months. 

I was about halfway to my apartment when I received a text from Pisha. We traded contact information before leaving the coffee shop. It read, *“Don't be ashamed of your scars. I'm not ashamed of mine.”* I never mentioned the cutting. It was a little eerie that she picked up on it, but then I pushed on my thigh for reassurance and realized I had popped a stitch at one point and my black denim pants were wet with blood. I turned my car around and made it to the Marriott around eight in the evening. 

---


I stood outside of room 734 pacing back and forth as I tried to decide whether or not to knock. As much as I wanted to know the woman, I had an overwhelming sense of dread creeping up and my hand slid into my pocket as I ran my fingers across the straight razor. As I turned to leave, Pisha opened the door and pulled me inside. She was wearing the same outfit as before. She led me to the bed and I sat there on the edge as she asked, *“Can I see it? The cut on your leg?”*

A surge of anxiety welled up from somewhere inside and I started to panic. I was about to bolt for the door when she sat next to me and put a hand on me leg. She leaned in and said, *“Lemme show you something.”* She stood up and turned away from me saying, *“Would you mind unzipping my dress?”* I pulled the small zipper down and almost instantly caught sight of ridges of scar tissue on her back. She dropped the dress to her ankles and revealed in a slow twirl that most of her torso and upper legs were covered in scar tissue.

She sat across from me on the dresser and said, *“When I was a little girl my father caught me kissing a neighbor boy. It wasn't anything major, just a peck on the lips. The old man lost it. He dragged me into the living room and bent me over his knee screaming about how no daughter of his was going to behave like a harlot. He was spanking so hard that I stopped feeling it after the second or third swat and as I struggled to get away I ended up tripping on the rug and falling in the fireplace. By the time he pulled me out I had burns on sixty percent of my body.”*

She lit a cigarette and took a long drag as I responded, *“That's terrible. I don't even...”*

She interrupted, *“Some would call it disfiguring, but your expression hasn't changed since you entered the room. I can tell that it is meaningless to you. I can smell the blood on your leg. Judging by your anxiety and shame, I'd say you were a cutter. I did that for a while.”* She spread her legs and pointed to her inner thigh where I could make out numerous linear scars in about the same location as mine. 

I unbuckled my belt and let wriggled my pants to the floor to expose the incision on my thigh. I scooted back on the bed and lit my own cigarette and we sat there in silence staring at each other as the embers on the ends of our cigarettes approached the filters. She finished her cigarette and came over to the bed and snuggled up next to me. We sat there in silence holding each other in that moment of perfect desperation for an unknown amount of time before I drifted off to sleep. 

My dreams were fitful and violent. Flashes of red shapes that bore sharp teeth tore at me as I fought to wake and found myself violently throwing myself on the floor. Pisha mumbled in her sleep as I climbed back on the bed. I moved over the table in the corner and sat there in the dark smoking a cigarette as she laid there sleeping. I contemplated sneaking out but found my legs unwilling to comply with the instinct to flee. She rolled over and slid her arm across the empty space in the bed only to sit up and look around. 

She called out, *“(removed) are you still here?”*

I responded softly, *“I had a nightmare, decided to get up and smoke.”*

She came over and sat in my lap as she pulled a cig from my pack and lit it off of my cherry. With her head leaned against my shoulder she said, *“I feel so safe with you.”*

I pet her hair as we sat there. After a few minutes she started talking. I had zoned out but when I started paying attention she was mid-sentence, *“-ing and what not. I don't know anymore. At first I joined because I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself. Fraternization between apprentices and neonates is strictly forbidden. If you join, we wouldn't be able to do this again for the better part of a year and that is only if you make apprentice. It would almost be worth it to fail the review and say you didn't pan out. I like this. I've never had this before.”* 

I put my cigarette out in the ashtray as I responded, *“I've lived thirty-three years without you, I can wait a year. It would be worth it just to be a part of your life.”*
She leaned up and kissed me on the cheek before walking over to her suitcase and getting dress. She tossed me my pants and shoes and we were both dressed within a couple of minutes. I kissed her on the forehead before heading to the door. I turned back towards her and said in a soft tone, *“Thank you for the best night of my life.”* She smiled from ear to ear and said, *“I hope to change that one day.”*

For the next several weeks I worked the floor and monitored calls and exchanged the occasional secret texts with Pisha. She wasn't allowed to interact with me during the review process, but she couldn't help herself, nor could I. It was around the first week of March when I received a package at work with  an Ouroboros logo in the upper right-hand corner of the label. Contained within was a plane ticket and a thirty page questionnaire I was to have filled out perfectly by the time I landed in Maine three days later. I completed the multiple choice section of the questionnaire in just a few hours but decided to track down a typewriter for the essay portions. Three days later I was on a plane to Bangor, Maine. 

A car met me outside the airport and for the next three hours I rode with an ill-tempered man in the backseat of an SUV to a mansion on the shore of Flagstaff Lake. What little conversation I had with my fellow passenger came from his repeated dismissals of my worthiness and that only one of us would be selected to join. He boasted a degree in ancient literature and an internship at the Smithsonian. I was a slacker with an associates of general studies from a community college and a dead-end job that I fell into because no one else wanted it. 

The two of us were brought into the foyer and asked to sit. The ill-tempered man I had rode with was called first and I sat on the bench going over my questionnaire one last time. I saw Pisha walk past one of the doorways in a crimson robe with white and yellow trim. She didn't look at me directly, but a smile crossed her face. I sat up slightly less concerned with my fate. About an hour passed and the ill-tempered man came back to the bench with a smug look on his face. He said under his breath, *“I've got this in the bag, fucking scrub.”*

I was called back through a long narrow hallway. An ornate door at the end led to a study where an elderly woman with thick glasses sat in a crimson robe with white and black trim staring over an old mahogany desk. *“Please sit Mr. (removed.)”* There were three chairs set in front of the desk. The were lined up perfectly, but one was ever so slightly off center. It was on the right of center, a wooden chair with a soft velvet cushion. The middle chair was an ornate leather upholstered chair with brass tacks running along the edges. The chair on the left was a simple wooden chair that seemed out of place in the otherwise ornate study. It is where I sat.

The woman gave an introduction, *“Mr. (removed), I am Adeline Devonshire. At one-hundred and three years old I am the matriarch of this temple. All applicants require my approval. Why did you sit in that chair?”*

I sat up a little more and responded, *“It seemed the least comfortable. I wanted to pay attention and I thought the others would be too distracting.”*

She nodded her head and wrote some notes before asking, *“What do you hope to gain from this order?”
*
I paused for a moment and gave it some thought before saying, *“Pisha. What I mean is that I could give you some story about finding meaning or rebirth, but it is so much a part of her identity that I'm willing to be a part of it to have the chance of spending time with her, even if it it means waiting a year just to be able to talk to her again.”*

Adeline's jaw dropped a little, *“Are you even taking this seriously?”*

I swallowed some spit that had been collecting in my mouth and responded, *“Yes, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out my utter skepticism on the primary tenets of this order. Everything I gathered by the nature of the questions you had me answer in this folder I am holding points towards wanting honesty and candor. Maybe I'm wrong, but I have a feeling you are looking for quality of character over qualifications.”*

The elderly woman stood up and walked slowly over to a bookshelf where she pulled back a thick tome and tucked it under her arm as she moved back to the desk. She turned through several pages before stopping and running her finger across the text and saying, *“Pisha said that you were clever, and sometimes eerily insightful. Am I to understand you spent an entire evening in her hotel room without even attempting to fornicate with her?”*

Without hesitation I responded, *“I felt it would have cheapened the experience. It was a pure moment that would have only been sullied by giving in to such urges. I would have loved to, but I couldn't bring myself to even suggest it.”*

Adeline nodded and then said, *“One last question. Why the triskelion tattoo on the back of your wrist?”*

I replied, *“It's to remind me that there are three separate and altogether opposing sides of my mind that are in constant conflict, but still the components that make up my whole being.”*

Adeline looked down at the book in front of her and without looking back up she said, *“Leave your questionnaire on my desk and go back to the bench in the foyer.”*

I stood and before turning I placed the folder on her desk and said, *“Thank you for your consideration.”*

The ill-tempered gentleman on the bench commented on my return, “I was in there for more than an hour, you were barely gone ten minutes. I think we both know who is staying and who is going home.” I thought about punching him in his smug face but opted to sit there silent. Nearly an hour had passed and no one had come by. The ill-tempered man got up and wandered off. I sat there on the bench for a while longer as Adeline and Pisha walked past without so much as looking at me. 

The ill-tempered man returned just as an attendant appeared and said, “You are both invited to the main dining hall for a meal prepared especially for you.”

We sat at a small table in the back of the room as the rest of the apprentices and neonates gathered around a dining table that was longer that my apartment and covered in gourmet dishes and fine china. The ill-tempered man and I were both brought covered platters. His was a fine cut steak cooked medium-rare with asparagus and a Gruyere sauce. Mine had an empty plate. He was given a goblet of wine and I was given a glass of water. 

The man in front of me smirked. Adeline stood at the end of the table and announced to the room, *“After some deliberation with the elders via Skype and scouring The Book of Ouroboros I have come to a decision on which supplicant will be allowed to complete the trials of initiation. We sit in front of this table of luxury with a feast set out before us. Our plates are empty, but we know that we will take part in the pleasures afforded to us by this celebration. As such, one supplicant has been given a fine meal which he will eat in peace before leaving never to return. The other supplicant has been given an empty plate, because he will join us in the feast we hold in his honor.”*

The smug look fell from the man's face as a smirk came across mine. He stood up in protest and shouted, *“I spent years studying the ancient texts of the old world just to find mention of your order and then spent six months preparing for this. How does this philistine warrant an invitation in the first place? Look at him!”* 

Adeline shot a look to a large man standing by the door who removed the ill-tempered man from the dining hall. She then turned her gaze to me and said, *“Please tell the attendant what dishes you wish to sample, you may join in the feast but to join our table you must first pass the trials.”* I sat alone at my table dining for the next couple of hours before being led to the rather posh guest suite. My carry-on bag sat next to the bed and there were fresh silk pajamas in my size on the dresser. After a shower and some reflection I laid down and drifted off to sleep. 

---

I woke to laughter and darkness. Robed figures in porcelain masks dragged me by my feet through a narrow stone corridor. The rough stone floor tore at my pajamas and scraped my skin bloody as I slid across it. I tried to struggle, but I couldn't shake my legs free, much less pull myself up off the stone floor. The narrow hallway widened to a large candlelit room with light brown stone walls and strange symbols carved into the rock. In the center of the room stood a rack with leather straps tied to the top and bottom I was stood up and tied as a masked figure emerged from the shadows and said, *“Welcome to the first trial of initiation. This is a test of willpower and endurance. This can end at anytime. Simply ask us to stop and you will be set free and sent home.”*

A small rubber mouth guard was shoved in my mouth and the masked figure stepped back. Hanging there on the rack I winced at the sight of the whip in the hands of a large figure I assumed to be Adeline's enforcer from the dining hall. The first crack of the whip against my back caused me to violently pull at my restraints. I bit down on the mouth guard a bit more each time the leather sliced into my back twenty lashes in he stopped and the masked figured returned saying, *""There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain. Why do you endure this pain?”* With the mouth guard in, I could only speak in vowels. 

It was pulled my mouth and a repeated, *“Pisha.”*

The mouth guard was put back and the man went back to his lashing. Ten more lashes and I was all but convinced by the cold throbbing pain that there was exposed bone. I could see blood pooling on the floor. Eventually the lashing stopped and the masked figure returned saying, *“To endure such pain for love is admirable, but this is not a romantic order. We are embody a proud tradition of esoteric study and discipline. It takes more than willpower and determination to advance in this study. Your wounds will be tended to and you will be returned to your room.""*

An hour of stitches and bandaging later I was led to my room. I sat up on the bed not wanting to lay on my back. In the darkness of the room and the pale glow the moonlight I could see a figure standing in the corned of the room. Pisha spoke up, *“I'm beyond flattered that you would do this to be near me, but it isn't necessary. Just give up, I'll leave with you.”* I responded flatly, *“You went through this for your own reasons, what kind of man would I be to reject a pain you lived through willingly?”* She walked forward and kissed me on the cheek before leaving. 

A few days of resting and healing later I was brought to a small room with metal chair. I was given a cup of a bitter tasting tea. An attendant brought in another chair and a few moments later Adeline entered and sat across from me, and the attendant tied my wrists to the arms of the chair. Adeline spoke up saying, *“You were just given a powerful hallucinogen. It will eat away at the walls in your mind and you will have no way of knowing what is real and what isn't. Your innermost thoughts will escape from your mouth and you'll be completely unable to hold anything back. I am going to show you some pictures and you are going to tell me what you think. It is here that we will come to know you as you really are in your heart of hearts.”*

It was about that moment that the walls began to melt and the words coming from Adeline's mouth echoed through the room on an infinite loop. It became in possible to focus on anything, Her facial features twisted and distorted as she spoke on and on about the pictures she was showing me. I lost all connection to the world around me. My mind drifted to my straight razor and I entertained the thought of bleeding the poison in my head through that sacred spot on my thigh. I drifted further and further away from myself only to be jerked back time and again when cold water was splashed in my face. 

Time lost all meaning as this interval became eternal. Violent images consumed my thoughts. Ancient soldiers marching with spears and shields converged on small villages killing everyone in sight. Women and children fled in terror as soldiers chased them down and did unspeakable things. I tried to look away but it was everywhere in my field of vision. The scenes changed but the carnage remained constant. Around the time that I lost anything resembling awareness of myself I was crying out that it stop, that the inhuman violence was too much, that I didn't want to see one more unspeakable act. Then I faded into the carnage and became one with the ever-increasing violence as I lost myself to the torrent of blood washing through the towns and villages I saw in my mind's eye. 

I woke in the guest room an inordinate amount of time later with Pisha standing over me. She brought a damp cloth across my forehead as she looked in my eyes singing under her breath in a language I didn't recognize. She stopped for a moment and whispered in my ear, *“I'm so proud of you.”* I drifted back to sleep.

---


The next morning I was brought to Adeline's study. She sat at her desk and barely took notice of me as she said, *“Grab a book and read your third trial is tomorrow.”* I went for the huge tome she call The Book of Ouroboros. The thick tome was a leather bound book with thick yellowed pages printed in an old typeset. 

A printed engraving on the first page showed a slender woman standing with a sword over a caricature of a Shah. The title at the bottom read, *“The Lady Is The Victor.”* I read the story of Parisa, the youngest daughter of a Persian Merchant in the late Zand Dynasty. Her father punished her as a young girl by tossing her in a fire. She spent the next ten years in waiting for a suitor, but each would learn of her disfigurement and break off the betrothal. She was nineteen years of age with the oldest son of the general of the Shah's army took her as a wife. He was a cruel man and a vicious drunk nearly twice her age. One night while he slept she poisoned his wine. The next morning as he drew from the bottle he began to convulse. 

She was tried and found guilty of the murder of her husband and sentenced to death. In the dungeons she was subjected to all manner of unspeakable act by the guards before being sent to the chopping block. It was cloudy on the day of her execution. Battered and bruised, she led to the chopping block where the executioner sharpened his blade. Just as the blade made contact with her neck, a bolt of lightning struck the blade and Parisa disappeared in the flash. 

---


The next morning I was led to a chamber where Adeline stood at the foot of a throne. A veiled figure sat on the ornate chair and Adeline bowed before her. One by one, each member of the order filed through and knelt before the throne. I was brought to the throne and pushed to my knees. Adeline stood over me with a sword saying, *“It would be better for you to run on this sword than enter this order with fear in your heart.”* She kissed the sword and presented it to the woman on the throne. 

The woman stood and revealed herself to be Pisha. Pisha put the sword to my throat and said, *“In this incarnation I am Pisha Maxwell. I have also been known as Parisa Al-Fath and Lady Marie Lizet. Twice you found me when I was looking for one to stand by my side. You have shown great character and strength. It is for this reason and the connection we share that I believe you to be Azir Al-Fahad, my dead lover reborn. I live eternal, like the jellyfish you mentioned when we first met. In each lifetime I regress to a child like state only to grow again into my position as Priestess.”*

She removed the sword from my throat and continued, *“Adeline was the first of my converts. A transfusion of my blood and a sufficient electric shock and her body reverted as mine had so many times before. Each apprentice and neonate serves in hopes of my gift. You on the other hand simply endured the trials for a chance at another night in my presence. What say you, of my offer to break the cycle of death and rebirth as I offer you my gift?”*

Now, I don't know what exactly went through my mind before I said this, but there was a deep feeling of betrayal as she revealed this to me. I fell for a woman that didn't exist. Pisha the apprentice was a lie. I looked up in defiance and said, *“Pisha the apprentice held my love and devotion. I do not know the woman in front of me.”* 

The sword returned to my throat. 

Pisha said in a stern tone, *“You fought for a vulnerable young girl, and thus you are worthy of a queen. Why do you seem so distraught at this revelation?”*

I cleared my throat and then put a finger to the blade pushing it away as I stood up. I turned my back to her and started pacing as I ranted, *“I don't know what kind of sick game you're playing but I made myself vulnerable to you. I gave myself to you. But I didn't. I gave myself to a lie. And now you're talking about immortality and conversions. Fuck that. I hated being a kid. All this time you've been saying that I'm free to leave at anytime. Well, I'm out. If I ever see Pisha the Apprentice again I'll give her my love, but this is ten kinds of bullshit.”*

Pisha shrieked and two men grabbed me at the shoulders and dragged me to an antechamber of the main hall where I was strapped to a chair. All manner of tubes and needles were inserted into my arms and chest. I struggled as best I could, but it was to no avail. Two pads were brought towards my face and past my field of vision to my temples and with a sharp pain, I passed out. 

---


I woke at home and in my own bed. I don't even remember flying back. I called the human resources office to inform them that I was back from my extended vacation and asked if my position was still available. Over the next few weeks I fell back into the routine of working nights listening to calls and spending my down time searching the internet. Only now instead of searching for clues of otherworldly origin I became with The Temple of Ouroboros. 

A few weeks of research returned very little if any results. It was only when discussing my experiences in a deep web chat room for paranormal discussion that someone sent me a private message that read, *“I knew you were a scrub. You couldn't of been worthy of the gift.”* I replied, *“You're that smug asshole that kicked out aren't you?”* He replied, *“The name is Kenneth.”* I typed out a response, *“Actually, I refused the gift and after a scene from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest with electric shock and all manner of needles I woke at home in my bed.”
*
Kenneth responded, *“Bullshit, there's no way she gave you the gift. Pisha was my beloved, how could you have been worthy. I was supposed to be the reincarnation of Azir Al-Fahad.”* I replied, *“Yeah, she sold me that line too. I've been considering going to the doctor and getting some tests done to see what they shot me up with. I've had a wicked headache since I've been back and I can't seem to sleep comfortably.”*

Kenneth sent me one last message, *“It's not fair. Why do you get to live forever?""*

---


I got an email from Pisha216@hell(dot)com last night. It simply read, *“Should you ever change your mind, your place is by my side.”*

 I added the address to my block list. It's been a crazy past few months. I met the most amazing girl only to find out she was some insane cult leader. I had the most amazingly intimate night of my life and then endured the kind of torture that leaves men broken and rambling. All in all I'd say it evened out. 

The major improvement in my life as a result of this is that I haven't felt the urge to cut myself since I've been back. In fact, I feel more alive that I have before. I remember reading somewhere about people surviving tragedies and seizing life by the horns afterward. I like to think that's what's going on here. Heck, prior to this whole ordeal I was starting to get laugh lines on my face and gray hairs in my beard, but both are gone. All the stress in my old life seems meaningless when looking back at those damned trials. 

The only thing that has me concerned lately is the how thirsty I get sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I've lost nearly ten pounds and my skin is tightening up wonderfully, but sometimes I'll drink a gallon of water at a time and still feel thirsty. I talked to my doctor about it and he told me to take it easy on the hydration and gave me a pill that makes it a little more tolerable. I'll miss the Pisha I fell for and curse the one who tricked me. Maybe one day I'll decide to look her crazy ass up. 

Until then, I feel great. It's like I'm getting younger every day.

I am back at McDonald's under a franchisee who I've been with previously and about to come up to my two year anniversary with company and as a crew trainer.

This is my first week back after a two month hiatus going for project management, my company wasn't the right culture and so I was given the option to resign. I have taken a huge downgrade in pay and wonder if McDonald's is right for me.

When asked to come back to my old store, the company requested that I be put in a store that has my old store manager of a previous store was put in charge of to fix up.

This store needs so much help. No smiling faces, no work ethic, no willingness to follow SOC guidelines or policies of the brand and company. The look on my store manager's face is that of overwhelmed as she is just working too hard and not doing much in observing or administrative duties. Various equipment is in disrepair or just disgusting.

I am trying to follow my duties, being friendly, but the shade and gossip. No one is passionate in this store up to management except my SM.

I am slowly building trust but when I offer advice, coaching, mentoring, and showing my expertise, it is seen as show-boaty or compromising authority. I am well aware of my focus, but my station is near pristine and my targets &amp; goals (if the store had any) are beyond average into exemplary.

How should I move forward? My degree in Associate's of business comes December and well, is this all worth it? Tell me there is a light beyond Store Manager. Tell me about your stories into Hamburger University, becoming Division Supervisors, or anywhere in coorporate. Am I just going to have to wait for the degree and apply for the summer internship, or what path should I take to keep my smile while serving smiles and making my crew smile and listen to my teaching &amp; example of leading."

So...I'll attempt to not write a novel here. Currently I'm living with my girlfriend of approximately 3yrs off/on. We've broken up, get back together that sort of thing. It's been for various reasons. She cheated on me once, not physical, but the text/IM sort of flirting cheating a few years ago. That's over and done with and I currently have no reason to believe anything like that is going on.

However, physically I'm just ..not feeling it. She's very sexually active, and I am too, but I think it's an issue of attraction. She's put on weight. She knows it. She wants to get it off, but hasn't. She was losing it but started gaining again. 

I don't think I'm in love anymore, and I want out. Right now we're okay, and that makes this harder. She has no job, she just got fired, and I'm the money maker. We're both in school and I work full time. If we broke up, she has no place to live and no income. Financially we're losing money which is stressful and she's not really looking for a job at the moment. She has an internship coming up in July that we already purchased the plane ticket for and she'll be gone for a month. I want her to go, I'm doing everything I can. 



Any advice? We've been getting along great but 90% of it feels like we're best friends and 10% dating. I have thought about ending things but she has no money/job/place to live and I dont want to put someone out like that. 


Edit: I feel like I should include that in the time she's been jobless, she does do some work around the house but it's forced. Laundry doesn't happen really, the kitchen isn't clean but she ""picks up"" and I'm just at a loss now. "

I am accepted into a strong university into the computer science program and I am grateful for my parents paying for my college expenses. I am lost though: I want to be an independent person but I have very little experience with work or personal finance. How should I spend this summer? The summer after my freshman year, should I get an internship? Should I get a job this summer? As a computer science oriented person and programming knowledge, should I start free lancing and learning entrepreneurship? 

Thanks, I understand that I am fortunate with my family's finances, but I have been spoonfed my entire life and I need to learn how to provide for myself. Any tips/things to look out for in my college years would be appreciated."

366pof,3,2015-05-16,Quarter-life crisis. I can't sort out my thoughts/wants/needs. Any opinions = helpful,bottleofTrexpee,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/366pof/quarterlife_crisis_i_cant_sort_out_my/,"I'm going to do my very best to make this as coherent as possible, but I'm an emotional wreck right now on the verge of another panic attack, so bear with me.


The main problem is this: I'm 24 years old. I have an Associates degree in Biology and Natural Sciences and a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice with a Forensic Science Concentration. The goal was to become a Forensic Lab Tech focusing on DNA/Serology. I was very, very interested in this. I loved all my coursework and lab work. As a requirement for graduation I had to do a massive (almost 400 hours) internship with a local agency. I applied and interviewed for a position at a local forensic laboratory but was denied. The one space open for that internship was filled by a man in the military who knew people who worked in tandem with the lab (I heard from him later on). I was discouraged, but found another agency, a police agency to intern with. During this internship I stared steadily losing my drive to work in the Forensic science field. Crippled by anxiety and intoxicated at the thought of finally graduating, I ignored my second thoughts and graduated December 2014 with honors.


Then I began looking for work in the field and found that I was pathetically underqualified for any lab work. I was misled by my academic advisor (who actually moved to a different school 2/3 the way through my undergrad work) in regards to how easy it'd be to get into the field. My mistake--I know that--for trusting so much in someone else and not doing my own personal research. I was naive and I know how dumb that was. 


Anyway, after searching for two months and hating my current retail job, I got a second job in retail. I decided that I'd work two jobs, save up for grad school and moving out, and figure things out a bit later.  


While working and talking with my boyfriend, trying to figure out where we're both headed in life, I came to the realization that I don't want to work anywhere near the criminal justice field. I'm just not interested. I have no faith in the system. And my ultimate goal in life is to help/educate people. Things just aren't jiving. 


Cue the first panic attack. I'm no stranger to anxiety, so I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything, but I was wrecked for three days trying to recover and missed a lot of work. Every time I thought about the fact that I don't know what I'm doing with my life I'd start crying and hyperventilating. 


From a very young age I wanted to be a Palaeontologist, which--evidence from my Associate degree choice--was the plan. Last week I was trying to think of the point where Palaeontology turned into Forensics. I knew how to explain it to people that have known me my whole life: ""I just didn't want to have to go into teaching full time with only being able to go on digs once in every long while. So instead of working with prehistoric animals and fauna, I'd work with dead, dying, missing people."" That's how I'd explain it to people. So I had all that, but no clue when it changed. 


And then it hit me that the decision wasn't mine. Back in 2009 after I had a brain surgery to remove a fucking tumor, I went out to visit my grandparents (who live a small town away from where I got my Bachelor's from). We toured the campus then and got a catalogue. I remember sitting down to dinner and my grandfather (the abusive patriarch of the family) explaining how great Forensics would be.


**Boom!** 


It wasn't my fucking decision. I, being the stupid sheep I am, went along with someone else's plan for me. 


He has dreams of me working for the CIA or the FBI or GBI, all these big name agencies. He wants me to make tons of money and still, despite me moving out, micromanages my life. 


Well now I've wasted 2.5 years of my life, about 30k of my father's money (who made too much for me to get any financial aid, but barely enough to support himself and pay for my schooling), and have a degree that I can't/don't want to use. I'm so mad and I hate myself for letting this happen. I have no passion, absolutely none for Forensics. It's an interest of mine. And that's the big problem. I have so many goddamn interests. I am interested in just about anything, can find anything fascinating, and love learning. But I'm only passionate about a few things. 


So I've been doing research but I have no idea what to do. Every time I start thinking about things regarding what I'm doing with my life or when someone brings up me doing Forensic work I start panicking.


I'm lost and have no idea what to do with myself. "
366slj,38,2015-05-16,"I [F21] told my boyfriend [M23] that he was getting bigger, and now he says he wants to take a break. I'm freaking out.",whatpoop,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/366slj/i_f21_told_my_boyfriend_m23_that_he_was_getting/,"We've been together for almost a year, and this is our biggest and only fight really. Also, we've been best friends since high school and we live together in our college town. Lately his eating habits haven't been great, but he has bouts of eating a lot then eating a little. He gains and looses weight fairly quickly, but right now he's a bit more chubby. I've told him about loosing weight before, and he usually tells me he will when he starts sports up again. Hes never told me that he was comfortable the way he is, so I just assumed he was kinda uncomfortable with it because he does sometimes mention he doesn't feel comfortable in his clothing.

I'm a peacekeeper always, but I have a bad habit of picking up peoples emotions and keeping them. Lately I've been stressed with my mom's wedding which I'm planning, finals, and my dad. My boyfriend knows my family doesn't think he's good enough for me, but I disagree. I wanted to show then that we are great together but my family if really fixated on weight and looks.

Hes such a sweet person. So talented and he looks past all of my flaws, but he will tell me when I am wrong. Sometimes we accidentally take our anger out on each other and we get past it. Also, I started taking medication for anxiety, and I had to stop due to my liver. My anxiety has been through the roof lately. He got a new job as an intern, and while his hours are only like 28 a week, he goes from 9-6/7 everyday working on making the process run smoother with coding. He just hasn't been as home much and I miss him because he gets home and I've been home most of the day with the dogs, and I just want to cuddle with him and watch tv or play games.

Last night we had friends over and one friend doesn't really like me and him together, so on our way to get food (just me and said friend) he mentioned weight. I told him that was mean, but I usually can't say anything more in fear of hurting feelings. My boyfriend uses one pair of jeans all the time and they don't fit very well, he was also wearing a tight shirt so his muffin top was showing to the max. He also sometimes drinks a bit too much and throws up, and eats a bunch to the point of feeling miserable, which I've brought up as being a bad habit.

Thiughout the night he made me feel amazing, telling me I was pretty, and giving me kisses. But for some reason my emotions from my stress just got to me and threw me into a big loop of anger because I wanted people to see that we are great together, and I wanted to look it too.

So we went to bed, and I told him that he looks a bit too big for his jeans, and he said I was calling him fat. I tried to defend myself and tell him that he just needs better fitting jeans and a better eating habit (he adds max salt and max sugar to everything since his smelling sense isn't good, he can barely taste.) He got extremely upset and told me that I was being shallow like the rest of my family. I should be able to think for myself and forget what everyone else thinks, and that I now made him resent me every time he thinks of his weight.

At that point I lost it and started bawling not knowing how much I fucked up. For some reason I just let all of my stress and anxiety of approval manifest into this girl who I didn't even know. And after talking about it last night, he was still upset. Said he would try to forget about it by morning. Morning came, still didn't want me to touch him and we rehashed feelings. He still resents me for what I said, and now thinks that he needs a break. Reminder that this is the biggest and pretty much only fight we've had.

He left the house on the note that he didn't know where he was going and that he would maybe text me, but he wants to take a break.

I can't loose him guys, not like this. He's been my best friend and he's so great to me. We have been a positive influence on eachother throughout the relationship, and I think we could make it really far. Please help me talk to him and try to make it up to him.

Tl;Dr: I told my incredible live in boyfriend that he has gained weight because of my stupid anxious mind, and now he doesn't think we should be together and wants to at least take a break.

First, I'd like to say that I read this thread frequently as well as FI and I have learned a great deal. I am currently 22, and soon to be a university graduate. I will be completing a summer internship and then most likely proceed with a job offer (50K-60K starting). 

I have always been frugal and a savvy saver. I have worked since I was 16, paid for all my hobbies, clothes, food, gas, etc. I will graduate with zero debt. I started an IRA last year and was able to put $5.4K into it. I currently have $4K in savings and will earn an extra $8K from the summer internship. 

My mom (divorced, late 40s, makes $60K) and I are interested in purchasing a house together in 4 years. I have lived in the same house for 22 years (yikes!), and to purchase a house will be a crazy new experience for me. Our current house is valued at $400K (40min-1hr north of Seattle), and we'd like to move more south to decrease our traveling time to work and live in a new neighborhood. The farther south we go to Seattle/Bellevue area, the more expensive the homes and we are considering a decent family home between $500-600K. 

So here's the initial plan: my mom would purchase a house, place $200K-$250K as down payment, and then we would split the mortgage (she pays utilities and all the other fancy stuff). Although she is purchasing the house, she will act as a renter and make me the homeowner. If I ever do sell the house, she receives her down payment back and I get everything else. 

What are the drawbacks to this idea? How should I divide paying for a mortgage and contributing to my 401Ks and IRA? What should I do now to prepare for 4 years down the road? 

It's a dream to own a home, but the level of investment and commitment is extremely new to me. I would like to make sure that I'm going to make a good, financial decision, or at least be aware of challenges that I have not considered. 

Thanks for the help. "

36722r,1,2015-05-16,Working for Nparents is a bad idea,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/36722r/working_for_nparents_is_a_bad_idea/,"Little backstory: I don't think my parents are full blown N but they definitely show some N tendencies. I've been the GC due to being the youngest child by 10 years and being the only boy which is important in Indian families. 

After University I had no clue what I wanted to do so my Ndad pleaded with me to join him in the family business and move from Europe to Asia, leaving behind my girlfriend of 3 years (we're still together, she moved to be with me after a few years and we got married 3 years ago). 

Here's a few stories that have infuriated me and kind of made me realise how bad my Ndad can be. 

Despite pleading with me to join the family company, he's told the rest of my family that he threw me a bone because I couldn't find a job. This stems from doing an internship where I was totally unsuited for the role and was not asked to come back after the internship ended. 

Working with an Ndad is really hell. I'd get phone calls at all times of the day, and if I didn't/couldn't take a call he'd then phone me multiple times from unknown numbers hoping I'd pick up and then send snarky messages about me ignoring him. Heaven forbid I am driving or at the gym or doing something else. 

Over the time I spent in Asia I developed pretty bad social anxiety and depression. I saw a psychiatrist and was put on medication which got me back to myself. I wanted to quit the family business multiple times but was guilted by Ndad and Emum saying it'd be the end of their life as they knew it and everything they worked towards would be going down the drain. 

Now admittedly I made some very bad calls of judgment at my lowest and its impacted the company. I've managed to bring things on track but I've now been blamed that I've ruined the past 3 years of his life. Forget that I'm the one that tried to commit suicide multiple times because of the situation I was in.

After 6 years of living in Asia, my wife and I decided enough was enough and we just could not handle living there anymore and wanted to return home. Her job was a nightmare and she'd been offered a transfer to the European office with a much higher pay and better opportunities. We had multiple failed attempts on trying to leave until she got the role and we took it and gave Ndad 3 months notice that we'd be moving. 

We lived in an apartment owned by the family company and seeing as we were the ones living there we decorated it to our own tastes. The furniture we bought wasn't good enough and there were complaints about every single thing we bought. Our plates were wrong, the glasses weren't good enough. The best was the complaint that we didn't buy a leather sofa. If you've lived in a country where the weather is 90F+ everyday and at least 80% humidity you'll realise you will stick to leather which is incredibly uncomfortable. 

Now when we moved, we shipped all our furniture and goods back to Europe. After we moved, my Nsis (a whole other story), finally decided to visit the country we were living in however only AFTER we had moved. My Nparents decided to be there while she was so they could spend time with the grandkids. On the family WhatsApp group Ndad started bitching about how I had emptied out the apartment. Heaven forbid it's the furniture we bought with our money and the stuff he spent 3 months bitching about whenever he was in Asia for business.

Since moving back things have been better. Contact has improved and I've started to develop more of a backbone and being able to stand up to Ndad more. I still work for him but I've threatened to quit. Doing so would leave him stuck so he's calmed down a bit. 

There are still snide comments but it's getting better. The most recent issue is that he's spent the past 21 years living in Europe and not paying a single cent in taxes. It's a situation that could potentially land him in jail so he's now working on spending enough time outside of Europe to qualify as a non-domiciled resident. Somehow wife and I moving back to Europe has caused these issues?"

(I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask, asking at most places it's relevant)

In canada for 4 months, here on an internship that is going to keep me busy pretty much all hours of the day other than sleeping. Got little to no time to cook lavish meals, not to mention I suck at cooking anything competently tasty.

I was wondering if there are some good company/brands whose products I could look out for when I go grocery shopping next, the brand stores next to me are Fortinos and Bulk Barn. I guess I could make trips once a week or so for really good purchases from other stores that are worth visiting.

Does anyone know of any great pre-prepared or marinated and frozen meat products that are sold, one's that I can just put on the grill and leave em or just put some oil in the pan and start cooking? Perhaps any healthier choices than ones I might otherwise find?

I prefer chicken as a safe staple, but I would love to try out all other sorts of meats and produce you might recommend.

I can handle eggs and sausages for breakfast and other emergency meals but was looking for some more convenient and faster lunch/dinner meals.

Any help is much appreciated!
Also if any other tips for such student &amp; food lifestyles please do mention!"

367heh,1,2015-05-16,Need help with a dissertation macbook?,[deleted],mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/367heh/need_help_with_a_dissertation_macbook/,"Hello, yesterday I passed my qualifying exam and the two days before that I finished all required coursework. [I wanted to](http://i.imgur.com/X1tXrxL.gifv)... a little bit. 

I currently have:

1.  A 15' MBP (Mid 2009, 2.53 Core Duo, 8gb ram) and
2.  A 21.5inch iMac (Mid 2010, 2.06 i3 8gb ram) with an extra monitor.

The MBP, has been acting a little laggy and I want something quicker with a better battery life. My MBP is really used as well. I also get sick of having two machines. I was thinking about replacing them both with a single machine.

Here are the things I've been thinking about:

* In the next year I am traveling a lot for a fellowship, internship interviews, and conferences. I like the extra screen with the MPB and size of the MBP because its nice to have for running statistics, research, and writing, often concurrently. But, the 15 inch MBP it is large. So I am torn between a MBA, 13' and 15' MBP retina.

* It would be nice to have something that would be flawless and not laggy current for at least three years. I really only ever surf the internet, stream movies/tv, read and search for PDF's, and run stats (STATA and SPSS). Sometimes, I'll mess with Kerbal Space Program, but its pretty shitty on both of my machines, and gaming is not a high priority right now.

* I would also like to run two monitors, while at home. Then be able to unplug, easily, and then go do research or attend meetings etc. It would be nice if it was easy to switch out. 

I think the sweet spot, between power and portability, is the current 13-inch MBP with retina display. I am thinking about going with 16gb of ram (or do you think I could save some change with 8gb). I also wonder if the base processor would also be good for at least three years. Or do you think I could get along with a MBA, but that my make having two monitors a issue.

Also, I am wondering what some good monitors are for the price. I don't do any video gaming or video editing. So I am wondering if I could save some money. The extra real estate allowed with multiple monitors is nice. 

8 or 16gb?
Base processor?"
367l3d,7,2015-05-16,"I was a great CS student, but a terrible employee. Not sure where to go from here...",DownOnCareer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/367l3d/i_was_a_great_cs_student_but_a_terrible_employee/,"**Background**

From grade school through high school, I had a way of getting things done and it worked. Throughout the day, I would exhaust my daydreaming nature by spending the majority of class time in my own world and then learn by doing the homework at night (often having to self-teach the material due to not paying attention in class). Although also chronic procrastinator, I would not go to bed until my assignments due the next day were complete. Because I always met the deadlines, my grades were very high and I graduated at the top of my class in HS. This strategy did come at a high price; however, as it required significantly more time to get work done. As a result, I was not part of any extra curricular activities and didn't really have friends past school hours.

Moving into college, I chose computer science because I loved working on computers and had taught myself some C programming. Moreover, I saw the impact that computers were having on society and I wanted to be part of it. 

Coursework in college was more rigorous than in high school and led to even more massive amounts of time being dedicated to learning things outside of class (I still spent the majority of lectures daydreaming with the intention of learning from notes later). While the projects got bigger, they were still self-contained and I was able to get them done on time. Since I was always able to hand in decent work and be a great test taker, I graduated with honors and moved on to grad school.

In grad school, I should've recognized that I had a problem. I was on full fellowship so that I could pursue whatever research I wanted under a really great professor. The problem was that I floundered without direction. I have no sense of drive for accomplishing things and really am only good at meeting deadlines. After a year of zero progress, I switched off of the thesis track and moved to a project-based MS degree. Since the project track came with mini-milestones (imposed by a professor), I was able to finish my degree.

As a side-note, I had a couple of internships in college/grad school where I did poorly. In both cases, my boss gave me a project and expected that I would take the initiative to get things done on a timely basis. While most employees dream of a boss that gives you creative freedom and just a general timetable (i.e. end of the internship), I struggled to complete anything significant. Since I was graduating after my second internship, the company extended an offer but it was literally sheer luck. In that case, my primary boss was on a month-long trip to India so his boss just asked everyone in the office if they liked working with me (he had zero insight into what I accomplished). 

Back to post-grad life where I started a professional career; I was offered a six figure job at a top company on the west coast. They were impressed with my quick thinking in the interviews and my ability to be both technical and personable. For that reason, they put me in a product role where I was to design a variety of UX features. My friends and coworkers at this company all really liked me but every manager recognized that I was not accomplishing anything. My reviews were consistently terrible but other managers kept hiring me because they believed I had just been mismanaged. After the fifth manager, I was told to again look for another team but I decided that I wanted out (cursing for four straight minutes in frustration before getting out of bed every morning simply didn't seem healthy). In retrospect, I'm still mixed on this decision. 

**Other Struggles**

Writing itself is a significant struggle for me. It's not that I don't understand how to structure sentences or communicate a thought, it's just that I take a very long time to complete whatever I'm writing. For instance, I may take upwards of 10 minutes just to send a two line email while someone else would spend &lt; 1 minute to do the same. Even things like posting on FB and writing text messages tend to take me roughly double what I've observed my friends doing. Since almost every skilled job a decent amount of writing, I find it very hard to work in a timely manner.

Ambiguous and difficult problems are also things I've struggled to handle. It is when these arise that I tend to start daydreaming and not solve anything. Since professionally these come up a lot, I often shut down and didn't have a deadline to force me into acting.

**The Future**

I feel like my issues are going to seriously hinder me from any future careers in the tech industry. All of the industry problems are very open-ended and I struggle to work on them without direction. While it's still a field I love, I don't know how to work in it any longer. Does anyone have advice for unmotivated (but curious) people like me in tech? 

**TL;DR - Chronic procrastination and laziness got me through school, but it's getting me into serious trouble in the workplace.**"

This year I am returning but this time interning at Amazon's Lab 126 in California.  Both times I am a SDE Intern.  For the Lab126 internship on my resume, should I put ""Amazon"" or ""Amazon Lab126""?  Which sounds better to the recruiters and interviewers?  

Argument for ""Amazon Lab126""

* I will put ""Amazon"" for my previous Seattle internship, so maybe ""Amazon Lab126"" sounds better because it seems like a different place with new experiences.
* Lab126 could be more selective since there's fewer positions compared to in HQ.
* I will probably mention Lab126 during interviews anyway.

Argument for just ""Amazon""

* just ""Amazon"" is more simple and recognizable.
* Lab126 seems more hardware-focused, whereas I'm in software.

367n91,1,2015-05-16,Should I take an offer in the middle of a project?,Saiyurika,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/367n91/should_i_take_an_offer_in_the_middle_of_a_project/,"I work for a small company owned by a large corporation.  I started as an intern on a short several-month contract, when it was up I was moved to a team with a large project made up of almost entire fresh inexperienced contractors, where I did the same work as them for half the pay (as they left my title as intern; my boss even said I was promoted to the level of the contractors, but the HR refused to promote me so I kept the same title and pay of intern.  After about a year I finally got officially promoted to their level because my manager put in a word for me, but was still classed as a temp employee (so were all of them.)  I worked very hard regardless of the fact I felt that was unfair.  

Now, we are starting a new project, in which I and one other contractor have been basically put in charge. we have been flown alone to talk to other outsourcing companies and have a greater responsibility than all of the other contractors, However, again there has been no title changes or pay rises to speak of. I was fine with that, except it did make things difficult when we were told to delegate work to people the same level as us.  Finally, my old manager stepped in and promoted one of the laziest contractors to a management role, and everyone on the team became bitter, and weeks later the same HR lady sent out an email to everyone on my project saying we will be extended until the end of the project, but nothing else is lined up for us to do, so it seems like they are getting ready to cut the whole team.  our company's higher-ups and non-contract does not seem to care about the project but corporate and the other companies involved are seriously relying on it.

As I mentioned before, me and this other person are the only ones who can support certain aspects of this.  But as you can see, I have become fed up with the situation and have started putting out applications. Some of them seem to be seriously considering and I already have an interview coming up, but its still uncertain.  Regardless of all of the drama I still like the company a lot, and the people, but the money is small for the type of job and the only rewards many of us have ever seen is simply getting to keep our jobs, there is no upward mobility and I have never seen a salaried employee get hired in my 2 years here. 

My question is, Should I finish out the project and just look when I go on unemployment? I can make that work.  Or, should I continue to put out applications and take any offer that pays more and/or keeps me employed longer than the term my current company is threatening us with?  that seems liek the obvious choice - But I just don't know if its appropriate to leave in the middle of a project I'm carrying so much weight in.  I'm worried that will burn the bridge I have with my current job or managers, but I have heard its normal for employees to quit to take better offers, especially temps, I don't see how they could not expect us to look for other work if we are temps.

TLDR; company dumps more and more responsibility on me without any raise or title increase, and has no guarantee that they will keep us at the end of the project in a few months.  I have applied to several places and have an interview Monday, should I take it or will that damage my standing with my current company?"

* How should I change the formatting/grammar? I feel like the phrasing, periods, wording etc are not totally correct, but I'm not sure what best way to do it is. 
* Should I keep the HS info? Should I add my HS job (Best Buy Computer Sales)
* Should I list my GPA? I ended with a 2.45. Some people have said don't include it because it doesn't reflect that well, some people say not including it is worse than them seeing it because its ""standard info"" and very suspicious when missing.

For my ENTIRE LIFE, my mother has been fixated on the idea that I will someday, no matter what, become a doctor (or ""at least a PA""--which is condescending towards a very respectable profession.) This post is exactly what it is: a chunk of anger, sadness, pity, and disgust all packed in one--tl;dr provided.**

To my mother, I am a very expensively-kept treasure of 17.5 years. My success story is the focal point of her life, and she lives vicariously through my academic achievements. Her life has been a hard one-- single parent of 2 divorces, continental migration, cultural shocks, relatives' deaths, self-abnegation, miscarriage, countless sacrifices... At this point, she is almost 50, and is incredibly disillusioned about life.

I pity her, but also feel a tinge of *hatred.* My opinions are always, *without exception,* tossed aside because I haven't experienced as much as she has. Her beliefs are so warped by the torrential negativity of her past that she no longer holds an ounce of faith in taking chances and enjoying life.

Around midnight yesterday my mother came in to give me some snacks, and she noticed that I seemed to be crying. (*eyes red, sniffing nose, etc.*) She asked me why I cried, and I told her that I was just thinking about stuff. She pushed to know more, so I ended up telling her, ""*Y'know, I was just having some doubt about becoming a doctor. I'm not **sure** if I want to be one.*""

And she freaked the fck out. It was *1 A.M.* in apartment complex.

*You don't know anything*, she screamed. *You've never gone through what adults go through. You're JUST a kid. You've never experienced divorce, job hunts, poverty. You've never had to raise  kids alone because your husband was a fking abusive gambler/alcoholic!*

She tells me I'm just a stupid teenager, so I shouldn't complain about potential hardships/loss of experiences during med school or residency. Fck. Then she goes on and says she *loves* me, and wants the best for me.... I don't know what to say to that. She wants to give me financial stability. But **never**, not even once, has she tried to listen to my thoughts or tried to give me advice BASED on my desires. Her obstinacy to keep propping up that framed dream of my financial security fails to include the most important part---*my* feelings. These are some very cringe-inducing angst-filled teenager words, but I said, ""I'm the one who knows myself the best"", no? 

But she denies even this--claiming that a she knows me best. She, a mother who barely talks to her daughter at all except about academic achievements, somehow understands me more than I do.

There is just no. Fcking. Way. That is true.

I wasn't even raised by her from birth. I only came to the US 6 years ago, and that was via her manipulation and deceit. She has always been so sure of my life, somehow, that she readily refuse that I, a human being, might have other priorities in life other than a huge stack of money sitting in my bank. This will undoubtedly sound naiive to many of you, but I want to experience the *world* as a young adult. I want to begin rock climbing, weight-lifting, hiking, mall-shopping... Getting a boyfriend, going out with friends on the weekends, having time for self reflection and perhaps even harmless stupidity... 

But I doubt I can do everything if I have to spend 8 years of my life after college to study something i don't even know if I'm interested in. I was feeling unsure, insecure, and scared... and she shot my worries down without any regard of my feelings. (and she tried to crush my optimism, too) Is it so wrong to desire adventure, life, and new experiences in my twenties? To relax? To embrace ambiguity? She probably cannot even comprehend me. The two of us are citizens of different worlds, and our hearts speak different languages.

Yes, I may be full of a young girl's naivete and slight stupidity. But I want to enjoy this feeling while it is still here. I haven't yet been crushed by the many realities others now live with, but does that really make my opinions *any* less real than an adult's? 

Oh, yeah. When I say I want to go out and experience the world, I don't mean that I want to go full hippie. I just want life in moderation, a balanced amount of fun and investment for future. But she only wants the latter.

There HAS to be some median by which I can travel/have fun but also invest in the me decades from now. But she refuses to believe anything except becoming a physician. *""They all work only 3 days a week,"" she tells me. *""It's hard getting there, but how can you be so lazy? Nothing in life is easy!""

^Notice how she immediately jumps to criticizing me, without trying to truly understand my position.

Right now, she is so intent on protecting me from the horrors of the real world that I have become a fcking **fragile, sheltered, and empty vase** that she locks within a trophy cabinet. To her, I am that beautiful but so easily broken vase that just cannot possibly do anything without her. The suffocating vase that remains empty, that thirsts for sunlight and fresh air. I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT BREAKABLE/EXPENSIVE VASE--I'd be much happier as a cheap rubber bowl that children toss around while playing outside in the parks. Why doesn't she understand that?

We are two totally different people, and I just want to explore potential careers. I'm only 17, but at this rate time will pass and I might hate my job as a doctor---I might hate medical school, residency, and internship. I don't want to become that douchebag doctor who doesn't truly care for patients or staff...

Why is this woman so obsessed with doctors? What the hell? Is a physician the only freaking respectable job out there? (*it's not, i know*) Why can't I question my own future? Don't I have that right?? How can she refuse to even TRY accommodating my personality and feelings? My initial uncertainty was twisted out of proportion into an indication of my rotten character: lazy, naive, &amp; inept. 

**I wish I was joking, but she is the living portraiture of the woman who sang ""Mother Knows Best"" in Tangled. She is the reason that the Disney movie made me cry so many freaking times--embarrassingly in front of friends!** 

Every time I say something she disagrees with, my words are dismissed as stupid gibberish. She forces her ideals down my throat every time we are in the car, and berates me for not being a good daughter. *look who is talking...*

Also, while I understand that some ppl can't pay for college (parents have tradition of not paying or not rich enough...etc)... I understand that, and I sympathize with them. But... BUT. How can a mother ever even THINK to THREATEN her own child about not paying for her college tuition after reassuring her for 5+ years not to worry?

HOW can she call herself a mother while threatening me in every argument with inheritance, college loans, or shelter availability? She may want the best for me, and she may do all this with the best intentions.. but the effects of her actions do NOT correlate with her love.

To me, she is no longer family. I cannot call her ""mother"" without cringing inside. She has become a disagreeable employer who refuse to compromise her opinions/beliefs, *ever.* This is sounding very dramatic, but I am truly shocked &amp; angered by her outward immaturity. She is a smart woman, but why must she treat me with such fickle ... I can't.... Never mind.

I am not perfect either... I shut myself in my room often, and I some times lose my temper. But there is a reason I have always been so aloof to both of my parents....I know she sees me as the most important thing in her life, but I just can't bring myself to love her. Only a bitter taste ever surfaces... Is it pity, sadness, hatred? I don't even know anymore. 

For the past few hours, I've decided to treat her as though I'm in a work setting. Fake smiles, head nods, and ""enthusiastic"" agreements are all I've been doing. I've concealed my true thoughts, but the anger is slowly boiling over. 

I got so angry that I ended up punching the jagged end of my desk... now I have a bleeding and bruised dominant hand. The anger is still there.

I feel better now after I've let this all out on Reddit. Sorry for the long post, but know that you've saved someone from committing something much worse just by reading this. Thank you.

**Tl;dr: Mother has midnight freak session when I said i'm not sure about becoming a doctor. Proceeds to state (calmly) that she would not pay for a penny of my college if I don't major in ""pre-med."" I am disgusted, and can no longer call her mother sincerely without wanting to punch someone or something. Ashamed to be her daughter, and now bleeding from right hand.**

Kindergarten, elementary school and middle school. No problem, same path for everybody. After that I had to make a decision. I could have gone to high school to get my diploma. Or I could have gone to a ""professional school"" to get schooling on a specific area, for example electrical engineer. I should mention that I live in Italy.

I chose to attend the IT classes. More specifically application development. I made my degree on that 3 years ago, but it doesn't interest me at all. Not one bit. I hate programming. I can see why people love doing it, but it's just not for me. So why did I attend those classes? My father has an IT background and I was a stupid 14 year old kid without any guidance. 

1 year ago the ""professional maturity certificate"" was introduced. Basically you are allowed to catch up on your high school diploma, if you have the degree I made. The hook is: you have to pass an entry exam, which determines if you are allowed to attend this class. I wrote the exam yesterday and I have a bad feeling about it. So what I need is a plan B, in case I failed.

It feels like I wasted the last 3 years, because I was so deep in personal problems like depression and anxiety. At least I have that under control now, but I don't have any skills that would be useful on the job market. My degree isn't really worth anything, since I haven't coded in years. I live with my dad and I hate to feel dependent on him. I'm willing to work hard, but I need to figure out where to start.

I could move to Germany to start an apprenticeship. I could wait another year to do the entry exam again (in case it failed) and go to university after that. I could do an internship and hope they school and keep me. But the bottom line is: It feels like I'm running out of time and people around me expect me to finally amount to something. I guess I am my biggest enemy, since I pressure myself a lot. 

**tl;dr:** How did you figure out what you wanted to do with your life? How did you achieve it? How did you deal with the pressure?

369275,1,2015-05-17,I'm Thinking About Coming Out,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/369275/im_thinking_about_coming_out/,"So I wrote this blog post and I wanted to get some feedback before I post it. It'll be my first time publicly admitting I have a mental illness. Any thoughts or suggestions welcome.

May is mental health awareness month. It isn't getting much visibility, at least where I live or the online places I frequent, but its still nice that discussions about mental illness are happening outside of some horrible event like a school shooting. So to add to the discussion I thought I'd share my own personal struggle with mental illness.

My struggles with mental illness began when I was in high school but it wasn't until I was in college that I received a diagnosis. My illness flew beneath the radar of my friends and family. I was not even fully aware there was a problem until someone confronted me about it.

The thing about mental illness is that it can change your perception. So you may not realize you are suffering from one until someone else sees it, it colors your reality. As Andrew Solomon puts it in his TED talk, ""instead of realizing you are seeing the world through a bad mood, you think you are seeing truly."" That's how it was for me anyway.

I had been living with anger, anxiety, and unexplainable emotional pain for so long that I did not realize it was odd. Not only that but in the moments when I thought something had to be done about it, I thought sheer willpower could overcome it. I took personal responsibility for it as if I had caused it. It wasn't until an advisor at the college I attended and her assistant, both of whom I had known since high school, ambushed me that I was made aware that there had been a change in me and it was perceptible.

They requested a meeting with me at the end of my fall semester sophomore year, which didn't seem that odd to me, I thought they wanted to discuss spring semester classes. The meeting basically consisted of them telling me I lost my ""change the world"" energy, I didn't seem to be taking care of myself and they, and some others, were worried about me. I broke down pretty much instantly. Hearing something I knew deep down inside that I hadn't acknowledged, having someone else see my pain, was kind of a relief. The meeting ended with me agreeing to see a therapist. 

After seeing a therapist for awhile I was referred to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety. My depression was so insidious I didn't fully believe I actually had it. Those diagnoses allowed me to get extensions on schoolwork and saved me from failing a semester so I thought I had beat the system. I started an antidepressant and things did get nominally better for awhile.

During this period of my life my emotions were extremely off kilter. Sometimes I wouldn't sleep for days at a time. Lashing out at others wasn't uncommon for me but neither was confessing affection. I went where my emotions took me for good or for bad with little awareness of the shifting states(partly why I didn't fully recognize the reality of my depression at the time). At times I felt high but mostly low. Sometimes I would self isolate but at other times I would call everyone in my contacts. 

My emotions took a toll on me academically, interpersonally, and vocationally. 

That instability was my life for the rest of my collegiate career. Even with an antidepressant things did not improve much. I self medicated with beer and weed to cope with my feelings which often times made things worse. But I was supposed to be getting better, right? So I put on an act for those who were concerned about me and started to hide parts of myself in different people. It felt like I was living several lives. I was moderately successful at pretending, but my junior year things started to get worse.

The summer after my junior year a friend of mine agreed to let me sublease his apartment for the summer. I was working as a dishwasher at a bistro and life was quiet but I started to think customers were talking about me. I would ask my coworkers if they heard anything and sometimes I would tell them customers were definitely saying bad things about me. This had been happening all throughout the spring semester but worsened in the summer. 

I was starting to experience intense paranoia. It seemed that everywhere I went people were talking about me. Whether I was out for a bike ride, walking across campus, or relaxing at the apartment, nowhere was safe. Even when I was with people it happened. I became adept at pretending nothing was going on.

Around this time I was also heavily into self help books and spirituality. I had intense spiritual experiences which affected me so deeply I changed my life's course. I decided I was going to take a year off college and move to California. So at the end of the summer I moved back home.

When I got home things changed again. I told my family about my depression and the medication I was taking both of which I had been hiding from them for years. I dumped my antidepressants down the toilet and things went back to normal for awhile. The paranoia was gone, I no longer felt the need to move to California, but the depression remained.

Things were relatively uneventful for awhile. Well as uneventful as life can be for a college drop out. I was kicked out by my family and relied on my friends for support for awhile. I was still self medicating with alcohol and drugs. But I eventually found my footing and life was good for awhile.

Not long after I moved into my first apartment I started to struggle again. Along with my depression, the paranoia was making a comeback, I started to have panic attacks, and I was hearing things no one else could. This went on for months.

I was still functioning, still going to work, paying my bills, seeing friends, somehow I was still functioning normally. Sometimes I would have delusions but I did not voice them so people were unaware. This all came to a head one night when I started having persecutory delusions and full blown psychosis. 

After a particularly challenging night, I begged a good friend to take me to a behavioral hospital but she felt like that was something my family should handle so she took me to my mothers house. I told my mom some of what was going on and my delusions and asked her to also take me to a mental hospital but she refused, we went to an ER instead.

When I got there they asked me everything I had been taking and drug tested me. Apparently my own mother was convinced I was on hard drugs. I spoke to their resident therapist and begged him to go to a mental hospital. His response, ""if everything comes back clean."" That was my first taste of how people with mental illnesses are treated. I was begging for help and they weren't giving it to me. 

The voices I was hearing were relentlessly tormenting me and feeding my delusions as I laid in an ER bed waiting for the drug test to come back. My blood pressure was off the charts. Eventually the therapist came back with my results. I asked to see them, he gave them to me and left without explaining anything. 

After some time an ambulance arrived and I was taken to a mental hospital. My mom rode in the back of the ambulance with me, holding my hand, she was trying to be strong but I could tell she was worried. When I arrived at the intake office I filled out some paperwork and committed myself. The doctor gave me some medication and gave me some time with my family before I went in.

My brother arrived during this time. He talked me down a bit, helped me relax, and I started to get drowsy as the medication started to work. The three of us had a group hug and I was taken onto a unit.

My time in the hospital is kind of fuzzy. It was weird, we all knew we were there for mental health reasons but it was never a topic of conversation. I spent most of my free time playing scrabble with this guy who claimed he wrote a book in one night; he was very verbose and a great scrabble player.

For a week I was treated at the hospital. The doctors didn't really communicate to me what they thought was going on. They just prescribed me medication and I just took it with the mindset that they wouldn't prescribe something unless they thought it would help and I was desperate for relief. I met with a psychiatrist once a day for five minutes and that was the extent of my contact with doctors.

At the end of the week a doctor approached me to try to convince me to stay a couple of more days, they wanted to milk my insurance for all it was worth. I vehemently refused. Although the structure and routine was of the hospital was peaceful, I wanted my freedom back. So I met with a social worker who asked me my recovery plans and told me outpatient care had already been arranged for me.  I still had no clue what exactly I was dealing with. 

The day I was released my brother picked me up. I didn't feel comfortable being alone yet so I stayed with my mom for a few days. When I first arrived it felt like I was being debriefed. My mom asked me what I remembered and I pretended that it was all a blur to hear her version of events and to save face.

At this point no one had discussed my mental health with me. I didn't know what the doctors or my family thought was going on with me. When I was discharged from the hospital I was given a folder with some papers; thinking I could find answers there, I opened it. I leafed through the paperwork until I came across a page with a diagnosis.

Schizophrenia was what I was being diagnosed with. I think I was in shock because initially I had no reaction to my diagnosis. I hopped on the computer and googled the medication I was taking along with the symptoms of schizophrenia but I didn't really feel affected by this turn of events.

I went back to my place about two days later and that's when it all came crashing down on me. I cried for hours and thought about how I would never have a normal life. Suicide seemed like a good idea. I tried to lean on my family for support but they were in denial.

After realizing I had to keep living life, I informed my boss I would be returning to work. When I showed up for work my coworkers asked me what had happened. ""I was sick,"" wasn't enough for them because I had a reputation of always showing up and I was out for a week. Whether it was out of genuine concern or nosiness they knew something serious had happened and wanted to know what it was. I couldn't tell them I had mental health issues with the stigma attached to it, so I made up some story about having a heart problem.

That was when I first started to shut people out. No more shooting the breeze with my coworkers I couldn't let anything slip. Same thing for most of my friends. I stopped calling some people and ignored calls for almost a year. But I had successfully covered up what had happened, no one I didn't want to know knew. 

There was one friend who I let know right away. She was my rock during this period. I would vent to her about how scared and confused I was along with how frustrated I was with my family. She took a realistic approach to what was going on when I discussed my mental health with her which was exactly what I needed during that time. She was in grad school and working at an internship but still found time to stop by my apartment several times a week, if it wasn't for her I don't know how I would have coped. 

A couple of months after I was released from the hospital, I had my first appointment with the psychiatrist my family had arranged for me to see while I was in the hospital. After talking to him for awhile he told me he did not agree with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. He thought I was schizo affective instead. Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic condition in which the sufferer experiences symptoms of schizophrenia and a mood disorder. The mood element is either depression or manic depression. He prescribed me an antipsychotic and antidepressant and sent me on my way.

The months following this were really hard. The medication made me extremely drowsy and foggy, my family was still in denial, I was still trying to understand the implications of my diagnosis or wondering if the diagnosis was even correct. I had very little support. Along with all that I had to suffer largely in silence. I couldn't share my struggles with this illness with the world because I didn't want people to think I was crazy.

After being medicated for awhile my symptoms started to go away. One day I riding the bus on a nice spring day and I realized I wasn't anxious or worried. People were having conversations and I didn't think they were about me. I wasn't hyper aware of my surroundings, I was just enjoying my commute. There was no paranoia, no social anxiety, and no hallucinations. That was the day I finally accepted that maybe the doctors were right.

This moment of peace and clarity came months after I started treatment. I didn't realize how severe my symptoms were until they were gone. It was like I woke up to a new reality, I felt normal. I felt like I finally understood what it's like to live life without a mental illness.

That however was not good enough for me. The next couple of years I would go on and off my medication periodically. Why? Well the side effects of these drugs are terrible. But when the symptoms would inevitably return and I would go back on medication. Eventually I reached a point where I realized my symptoms are worse than the side effects, so I don't go off them randomly anymore. Thankfully none of my episodes affected my life too badly.

3698uw,4,2015-05-17,"How is it possible to go from saying all the big words, love, future together etc. to the cold shoulder?",ateams,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/3698uw/how_is_it_possible_to_go_from_saying_all_the_big/,"It all started in the spring of 2014. At the time I (27m) had just finished and really demanding temporary job (campaign management) and went out to a small get-together that a friend was throwing for a few friends of hers’. I was invited and that was where I met her (28f) for the first time. We seemed to click right away and a few days later I asked her out on a date. 

We met in a small coffee house where we sat for the next 4 hours and talked about everything. The time just flew by. After the date we had an awkward kiss but it was great. The following morning I received a text from her about how she felt amazingly about our date. She had never experienced the same feeling after a first date with someone. She was smiling all the time and felt rejuvenated after our time together. I felt the same way and expressed those feeling in a reply. Unfortunately we would not meet again until about two months later. She worked as a flight hostess during the summer and was flying when I asked her out on a second date and a few days later I was going on summer holidays which would last until the beginning of August. 

I traveled for about two months but we kept in casual touch through Snapchat and Facebook during that time. Perhaps a phone call or two were made during that time but when I got back home I waited for a few days to contact her again. Finally in the middle of August, more than two months after our first date we were talking on Snapchat and she invited me over to her place to a party that was being held there. I barely made it in the door because we started kissing intimately right there on the spot. We had a fantastic evening. After that I stayed with her until a few weeks later when I moved abroad to continue my studies.

During my summer holidays I had gotten the chance to continue my studies abroad and we agreed that it was the only sensible thing for me to do. She even told me that she would lose all interest in me if I would decide to stay in my home-country while having the opportunity to go abroad and finish my studies.

We had the most amazing three weeks together before I left for my studies. It was almost unreal and both of us felt the same way about our time together and looked forward to the future although we knew we would be in a long distance relationship for some time but that would not be an issue. We would fly back and forth regularly. Before I left we told each other we loved one another for the first time. The future was bright.

After I had been abroad for a few days she told me that she wanted us to talk every day which I was completely happy with. I didn't want to call her to much when I got abroad but when she gave the green light on daily communication there was no turning back. We talked everyday. Sometimes for hours. Actually most of the time for hours, several times a day. We loved having each other on the line. Sometimes we used to fall asleep with each other on the line and both of us would wake up in the night hearing each others breaths over the phone (thanks to FaceTime Audio this was possible with out going broke). Then in the morning I would wake her up, with a phone call. She loved waking up to my voice. We would talk about our future together. We would talk about how happy we were to have found each other. How we had learned from previous relationships what we really want in life and in our partners and how we had found that in each other. We were loving life and life was loving us. Everything was great.

She came to visit me half way through the semester and It was unreal. We connected on a new level again and everything was perfect except for one minor detail where she found a message on my phone which she interpreted as me cheating on her but that was not the case. She had been cheated on in the past and was therefore extremely cautious. That little misunderstanding was cleared up and we went on. The plan was then for me to come visit her in a months time but because of exams and a lot of deadlines that was not possible. Fortunately the semester was almost over and soon we would have the whole xmas break to spend time together. My Uni would not start again until March 2015. 

The days leading up to my flight back home were intense. We were missing each other a lot at that time and were looking really forward to seeing each other. We had not seen each other in person for about two months. We talked about everything we were going to do and how nice it would be to finally see each other.

I came back home and it was a wonderful feeling. I came to her place of work (art teacher during the winter) and after she got off work we drove straight home to do what every couple who haven't been together for some time need to do. The next few weeks were fantastic. We did a lot of things together, went out with friends, went to the winter cabin for a weekend just the two of us, had dinners, with our parents and family and friends and without. Then xmas which was nice and the new year. Happy 2015!

This is were things started going down a slippery slope. I didn't notice it at first but after about a week or two into 2015 I sensed that she was acting differently. All of a sudden she was getting a bit cold and distant and would not talk to me as before. During the xmas I was living at her place. The weeks before I came back home we had discussed the seriousness of the relationship and I had been really clear on how serious I was about the relationship. As I remember it her mother had raised the question if this was a serious relationship or not. We had come to the conclusion that any other arrangement, then me staying at her house, would just not make sense while I was back home on holidays.

One evening in January I tried to open up a dialog with her about what was troubling her. She was reluctant on telling me and told me that she didn't know what was really going on but she didn't feel the same way about me. I was really shocked by these news and without realising it right away, my self confidence was crushed. We agreed on seeing how things would pan out until I would head back to continue my studies but there was no turning back for me at this point. For the next few weeks I would do everything to try to keep our situation in order, tell her how much I loved her, be nice to her, do everything for her and be just a generally good boyfriend and a nice person. At one point I raised the question again, what was troubling her and at that point she broke down and started crying but wasn't able to tell me what was going on exactly. 

At one point I spoke to our mutual friend mention in the first paragraph of this ‘essay’ and asked her for advise. She told me that the best thing for me to do was to try to distance myself from her, show her the cold shoulder as well in the hope that she would come back. I did that for a few days but I could not keep up with it. After about three weeks of her cold and distant behaviour I could not take it anymore. I told her, in a quite dramatic way, late in the evening after trying to initiate sex without any success that I would leave the following day. I packed most of my belongings and stayed at my parents until I would head back to my studies. She told me she understood and was supriced that I hadn't left earlier. 

The following day I went to work (internship during my holidays) and after work I came back home. We watched a movie (she was already watching it when I got home). The previous night I had packed most of my stuff without her noticing and when she went out to grab dinner I moved most of my stuff to my car. We had dinner. After that I went out for a bit. When I got back home she wasn't there. I took the rest of my stuff and left the keys on the counter. 

The night before I was flying back to my studies I received a letter through my letterbox where she expressed how sorry she was for being so cold to me, nobody deserved that, especially not me, the best person she had ever been with. “There are few people who are wholeheartedly good persons but you are defiantly one of them.” The last thing she said in the letter was that she hoped that my life would be a nice journey.

Since these communication we have not really spoken. A few messages were exchanged in the beginning about some of my belongings that I left at her place. But other than that, nothing. I would really much liked to contact her at a few points but I have been advised against it. I should just let her be and if she wants me back at some point she should have to say it and work for it. 

The bottom line is that I want her back. I still love her. But I am not sure if I should contact her. I have tried to explain our relationship in as much detail here as possible. I could have easily written a much longer and more detailed account of our relationship but I have tried to only mention the most important things. I have a few questions as well which I have not been able to answer for my self. How is it possible to go from saying all those big words, love etc. and talking about the future together, planing our future to the cold shoulder? Do I stand any chance with her in the future? "

Please help me.,coco_moonbabe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/369bk4/i_22_mf_am_feuding_with_my_57_f_mom_over_sleeping/,"My boyfriend [24 M] and I [22 F] have been in a stable relationship for almost three years.  During the summers, when we were in college, he would have to move back home because he had to move out of his temporary room for the academic year.  He lives an hour away and (before I got my license and a car) drove to see me during the summers. I started sleeping over at his house sometimes because we wanted to spend more time together and all the driving was a lot for him. At first I brought my sleeping bag with me, since I expected to sleep in another room.  However, his parents always insisted I sleep in the same room and have acknowledged they know we probably have done the same in college and they do not have any restrictions toward it.  I've asked over and over again how they feel and continuously they expressed every time, they don't care.

My Mom [57 F] on the other hand has always hated me sleeping over at his place, regardless if school was in session or not.  She has communicated to me that I am not an adult until I graduate college, despite the fact I was supposed to graduate recently and I am in college now for only one class.  My family hates it and my mother and grandparents almost felt the need to disown me because I slept at his house during school and the summer. I have always maintained respect of them and always followed the rules, this is the only exception.

In fact, because of this situation, they have illustrated me as a crazy child with no respect and dignity.  When I told my mom that my bf offered his place for my internship that may be closer to him, she said it was disrespectful that I had even considered it.

Almost three years later, I have spent the night his house sometimes, and my boyfriend doesn't like how controlling my mom is of me, but respects it.  He just avoids sleeping over at my house period. And I get it. My mom offered him to sleep over at my house, but we don't understand why she would offer if she hates the idea...

My boyfriend and I want to move in together, but he wants to wait until he has the income for it and I until I graduate with a job.  He graduated recently and my mom offered for me to live at home for my last semester, but that would he can't sleep over at my place if I decided that.  It would make things complicated. Which it already is.

My Mom loves me and I love her so much, but because of her recent erratic behavior over controlling my relationship, it has really turned me off. She screams a lot, and was angry that I was not available the friday and saturday before mother's day because his family invited me to a trip for my boyfriend's dad. I was going to be back early morning mother's day to celebrate it and planned out mothers day months in advance, but my mom didn't like that I had not made all of plans based on her for that weekend, and she always says I should be thankful for her. I was back before 10 am and she was still mad.

So at this point I am tired.  I am tired of the drama.  I know how to drive, and own a car, so I drive their when I want.  However, its a lot to drive back and forth in one day. I am tired of my mom yelling and screaming. How should I handle this?
Really... I follow every rule, I don't call attention to myself. I don't get it.  And to be honest, she would still hate it after I graduate. Because my grandmother was horrified that my cousin who is almost 30 lives with his gf in the same bed.  He makes more money than all three of us.  So idk.


   
**tl;dr**: 
My mother hates I sleep at my boyfriend's house at times during school and during the summer. I am about to graduate college. There's a lot of drama that comes with it. My family wants me to abide by their rules everywhere. And my mother thinks I am ungrateful and spoiled.  My bf's family wants me to be comfortable and wants us to share a room in their house. What should I do?  I want to make peace and love her lots, but don't want my controlling family to manage my relationship as they have with my friendships and life choices. How do I do that?

Edit: 
Also yeah I'm complaining, but i am looking for a solution at this point.

369tko,4,2015-05-17,[For Hire] Recent graduate software developer looking to relocate to the US,OMCS,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/369tko/for_hire_recent_graduate_software_developer/,"Hi everyone,

I'm from the UK and about to graduate with a computer science degree (excellent grades and a number of side projects). I've done a couple of internships and have a part-time software related job, so I have a good amount of previous experience to offer.

My previous roles include software development for industrial optical sorting machines, dev work at a crowd-funded startup in the space sector and (currently) system administration / IT support for a midsize upscale business.

I want to relocate to the US to start off my career in the software industry there, preferably under a J1 visa. I'm open to offers anywhere in the continental US, the right job is more important than the location for me.

My particular interest is embedded software (particularly Linux based systems) although I'm also very capable with desktop application development, sysadmin and web backend work. I do a lot of freelance work in my spare time and really enjoy software development. 

I'd say my strength is in my versatility, with good to excellent knowledge of C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, PHP, shell scripting and more.

It's difficult breaking into the industry when there are so many excellent US-based candidates, so I'm turning to the people of Reddit for help. I believe I would be an exceptional candidate for an entry level position and I'm just looking for a company that is willing to give me a chance.

If anyone is interested I'd be happy to send you my resume, just send me a PM.

Thanks and have a great day!"

I feel like I am ready to go, and have had a few people offer me internships and say they are ""to-hire."" However, my school isn't getting behind me on these offers sighting that the agencies are trying to ""farm labor"" and ""telling me what I want to hear.""

I understand their concern because I share it too. I don't want to move across the country only to land back on my ass in three months if I lost at the summer intern ""Hunger Games,"" however, I also don't want to wait out the summer because people may not be hiring as much, or settle for less-sexy shops for the sake of getting hired by the time school is done. 

Any advice? I just straight up don't know who to trust."

I graduated with a Business Degree concentrating in Accounting, during that time I completed three terms of paid internships with a local governement for 4 months and 8 months with the Canada Revenue Agency(USA-IRS) as a Excise Tax Auditor. My major career goal right now is to obtain my CPA (Canada) but I have been unable to get a job.

I have had 4 interviews since graduating in August of last year not inlcuding Sept/Oct as I was on vacation. Even before then I was applying for jobs like the Big 4 and was unsuccessful. 

I have done the following to:

1. Reached out to my network to let them know I am looking for job
2. Had my cover letters and resume revised by HR professionals in network.
3. I do have a linkedin profile 
4. I have profiles on a lot of the major job sites with resume attached
5. apply to 20+ jobs a week(although not consistent to be honest)

I really wanted to start out in public accounting to get my CPA but since they only hire in the fall for the following fall so I would be sitting with out a job until Sept 2016 that's  if I get the job. My plan was once I got my CPA I would spend up to 5 years with the firm before contemplating swithcing over to private.

36ac39,6,2015-05-17,Moving out?,Arsacides,Morocco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/36ac39/moving_out/,"Salaam everybody,
I am stuck in a dilemma, and I'd like to have the opinion of some fellow Moroccan redditors on this issue. I am a 20 year old student living about an hour away from my university, with my parents. My father is Moroccan and a non-practicing, albeit religious muslim. My mother is Dutch and converted about 10 years ago, abiding by the five pillars and being as good as a muslim she can be. I am a somewhat practicing muslim, in the sense that I do not drink, eat pork etc, but I do not always pray.
'
My dilemma is that I want to move out, and my parents(my mother at least), does not. I have several reasons for moving out, distance between school and home being one of them. However, being independent is my main aim. My parents are not the type of people to forbid everything, as I could go out clubbing with friends, have dinner with them etc. But ever since the beginning of this school year it has progressively gotten more difficult to do such things, as they have become more stricter. In itself this wouldn't be so much of a problem for me, but in my opinion it is becoming a bit suffocating. If I come home an hour later than expected due to circumstances(not after clubbing or anything, but just following lectures and doing homework at uni), I will get a preach. Last week they event wanted me to stop studying at the university's library so I could study at the library in my hometown, despite everybody of my course that could help me studying at uni. I also have the opportunity to follow an internship at my dream company, in my field, in France(I'm currently living in the Netherlands), but they have been very reluctant about this, and I get the feeling that if I were to be accepted they would not support me to go there

I can fully imagine this sounding like some privileged kid whining about his parents, but please bear with me. I do understand that my parents only want the best of me, but I feel like they are unnecessarily suspicious and somewhat controlling. I never drink, did drugs or had any premarital activity, yet they have been clamping down on me. Honestly, this is not a surprise to me, as my dad is a very controlling and dominant personality. He is a very good father, do not understand me wrong. He has always supported me and helped me to get where I stand now. But I have to admit that he is not a person one should cross, and things either go his way or they don't go at all. As I am growing older, and as I try to be more independent, this is a bit frustrating to me.

About two months ago I told my mother that I wanted to move out. Although I didn't expected my mom to be happy, she was absolutely devastated, and made me feel like a complete failure. She said I would betray and ditch my family, that I have Westernized and turned my back on my culture, and that I was being an egoistical toddler. I felt really bad of course, and I thought she wasn't right. She also blamed my friends for this idea and my behaviour of lately(the trying to be more independent), as I have quite some friends that are not muslim, mostly African and Caribbean Catholics. I tried to explain to her that this was entirely my idea, and that my two closest friends whom I told about it, actually tried to dissuade me, but she didn't buy it. Because my mom responded like this, I didn't tell my dad as I was fearing for his response even more.

Now I am stuck. I have been trying to be away from home as much as possible, staying in at uni till late, working extra shifts at my sidejob near uni etc, just because I get immensely frustrated and depressed at home. We have had fights often the last months, and I don't think this whole situation is helping anybody. Lastly, I am really fearing that they would forbid me from going to the internship in France, as then I would be completely torn then. I don't want to disrespect my parents and not listen to them. But neither do I want to leave such a opportunity just because my parents don't think it is right for me to live on my own. So redditors, I don't ask for advice(although it would be appreciated!), but just your opinions, or people who have been in similar situations :)"
36aep5,5,2015-05-17,I'm in an awkward situation with my friend (23/M). How should I (23/F) act when I visit? (11 years),sodapuppies1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36aep5/im_in_an_awkward_situation_with_my_friend_23m_how/,"I have a friend named Bill. Bill and I have been friends since middle school. We were really close in middle school and our friendship faded in high school. We were still friends, just not close.

By college, we rarely talked until he started to interview for jobs near where I lived. He would stay at my place when he would come up. We eventually started to basically talk on the phone everyday. During winter breaks and holidays at home, we would hang out almost everyday. We have the same friend group in high school, so sometimes alone and sometimes with friends.

He eventually moves to my city for a summer internship. He lives with one of our high school friends, but we basically hang out everyday after work. We'll smoke weed, make dinner together, and watch a movie. When we go out at night as a group, he started holding my hand and be really touchy with me. He would drop me off at the subway everyday for work. We would always walk off together and usually be alone most of the time when we went out to bars etc.

I'm obviously getting the vibe that he likes me and I start crushing on him. My roommate (Jasmine) who has a bf knows I like him. I had been mad at Jasmine for most of the summer because she flooded our kitchen with water and left for vacation without cleaning it. She never apologized and continually did inconsiderate things like that. 

Well eventually, Jasmine and Bill start flirting every time Bill came over. It wasn't even subtle flirting. My other roommate Sherry and I felt so uncomfortable we just started to leave the room. Jasmine would make fun of me in front of Bill. Bill would entirely ignore Sherry and me. Sherry even mentioned how awkward it was. Bill also knew that I hadn't really been hanging out with Jasmine because of the apartment issues.

It all culminated one night. Bill asked me to hang out and I told him I was with some friends. He kept bugging me to hang out, so I left my friend group to hang with him. Once we got back to my place, he made a b-line to Jasmine. I left the room with Sherry and they were flirting for almost 2 hours. At that point, I was pissed. Bill eventually noticed what he did and tried to be nice. I took him outside and told him it would be best if he left. I didn't leave hanging out with my friends, so he could use me to hit on my roommate who has a BF. He denied everything and claimed he didn't even notice. I told him he had me invite him over and ditched me for 2 hours. I wasted my night to hang out with him.

Mind you, the next day was my 21st birthday. Bill incessantly texted Sherry to see if I was upset with him. Bill decided to show up to my birthday dinner, club, and hotel night. Jasmine doesn't go. At the club, I am sufficiently wasted and Bill keeps grabbing me. He's like putting his hands around my waist and I eventually told him to leave me alone. I told him I had liked him and it wasn't cool he kept leading me on, while using me to hit on my roommate. He claims he had no idea I liked him as he's still holding my hand. I told him I didn't really want to be his friend because he was using me for emotional support, but had absolutely no interest in me. He got upset and kept saying I couldn't just not be his friend like I was his best friend blah blah.

The night ended awkwardly. The rest of my birthday weekend was extremely weird. Bill showed up to all the events because it was all of our high school friends who came up for it. Jasmine didn't show up because she didn't know anyone, but Sherry and Bill. Jasmine also claimed I was imagining the flirting and absolutely nothing was going on. She was like ""I have a boyfriend, it's not like I would hit on another guy when I have a boyfriend."" Bill kept blatantly flirting with other girls in front of me and overall was being a jerk to me. 

Eventually everything blew over and I left for study abroad. Throughout study abroad and once I got home, I ended up dating a few different guys. Bill and I returned to friends, but we aren't as close as we once were. Jasmine and I became friends again, but just a pretty shallow friendship. Bill ended up moving to my city and I moved away.

Fast forward to now... It's been about 2 years since all this happened. I hung out with Bill a few weeks ago when he was in my town. I'm really close friends with Bill's roommate Steve. Steve and Bill have been bugging me to come up visit. I ended up booking a flight to come visit for a week this upcoming week.

I've been texting Bill to set up a plan to stay over for a few nights (as I will be visiting a few of my friends), but he keeps ignoring me. I see a snapchat posted with Jasmine and him. It finally all clicks. My mutual friend texts me and says that Jasmine and Bill have been hooking up. My friend told me that Jasmine has been talking about Bill a lot and eventually facebooked him to hang out. Mind you, Jasmine keeps texting me how she's excited for me to visit, but has failed to mention she's sleeping with Bill.

Now, it's been 2 years and I really don't harbor any feelings for Bill. I wish no ill upon Jasmine. I am pretty much over the entire situation. I just find it pretty shady for both of them to do it behind my back. Bill has hung out with my other female friends late at night previously and I've never had an issue with it. They'll text me and be like hey by the way, bill texted me last night to hang out and I did. I just wanted to let you know. Bill has never mentioned how he basically always flirts with my friends, even though he's texting them late at night to meet up.

Jasmine has always been jealous of my friend group. When everything happened years ago, she was surprised everyone dropped her instantly after how she treated to me. Everyone kinda knew she was purposely excluding me from conversations and making fun of me in front Bill, so he would like her more. My friends were only nice and friendly to her because I was cool with her. Once I stopped inviting her out, they basically all ignored her.

Point is, I know I have no claim over my friends. I really don't care if Jasmine becomes BFF with all my friends. It doesn't matter to me. I'm cool with her. I'm cool with her dating Bill. It's all good for me. I just don't know how to approach the situation when I visit. Both of them are under the impression that I have no idea what's going on. Of course, Jasmine's ""confidants"" tell me everything because they were my friends for years before they met her. I almost don't want to say over at Bill's place anymore because I feel like there's going to be a huge elephant in the room. The only reason Jasmine and Bill are hiding their relationship from me is because it kinda just proves both of them were using me years ago.

Should I bring up the fact that I know they're dating? Should I pretend like I have no idea? 

**TLDR: Two years ago, my best male friend (Bill) and I got really close. He was being extra flirty and touchy with me. I started to like him. My roommmate ( Jasmine, who has a bf) started to hit on him all the time and make fun of me in front of him. He would flirt back with her. They eventually started to use me as a way to hang out. Once I called them out on it, Bill dropped Jasmine. Bill and I mend our friendship. Jasmine and I are shallow friends. Jasmine was hurt because basically all my friends quit hanging out with her after how she treated me. Jasmine has been harboring feelings for Bill for the past few years. Once I moved away, she starts hanging out with my friends again and keeps talking about Bill. She eventually texts Bill to hang out. They are now sleeping together. Bill has been asking me to visit, so I booked my flight to visit (not knowing Bill and Jasmine are hooking up). I'm visiting next week. Bill and Jasmine keep saying they're excited for me to visit, but keep pretending like nothing is going on between them. I feel like I'm put in a really awkward situation because I don't care if they date or go out, I just find it really shady they are hiding it from me. I feel like they are hiding it from me because it just proves they were both using me years ago. I think I may not even stay over at Bill's and just hang out with my other friends in the area because I don't want it to seem like I still like him/ cock blocking him from Jasmine. What should I do?**

36afbs,9,2015-05-17,A general update on my life right now. Too much to even think of one title.,Reaper_of_Souls,ACON_Support,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACON_Support/comments/36afbs/a_general_update_on_my_life_right_now_too_much_to/,"Whatup, fellow ACoNs. Had to take a couple days off of Reddit - or more accurately, my life in general, and return to the NHouse for a couple of days and sort my life out.

So, in a nutshell, here's whats been going on:

1) I just had my best semester in 4 1/2 years. If I get one grade changed, it might actually be the best ever (I don't want to compare it to when I was in community college) but if I don't, I *might* be able to graduate in a month if I get A's in both my summer classes. The thought of that is just... wow.

2) In the middle of studying for finals, my ex-girlfriend messaged me. Long story short, she's the only girl I have dated in recent years, and just as the drama with NMom was blowing up last year, it ended really badly. Since she is back in my home state, this prompted me to back to the NHouse this past week. Just hoping I had a second chance to make things right again. And so far I have no reason to believe that won't happen but... ugh, uncertainty...

3a) Surprisingly, while I was home, NMom did not cause any drama at all (then again, I was with ex-gf most of the time and did not ONCE see her sober...) This time, it was EDad. He never takes my concerns seriously, which really doesn't feel a whole lot different than NMom's trademark gaslighting. But this time, HE'S doing most of the talking. Among telling me how much he wants to spend time with me and help me achieve the success I'm so close to.

3b) EDad then asks me something that I NEVER expected to hear from him, ""What do your sisters think of your mom?"" I only tell him what I know my younger sister (I grew up with her, the other one is much older) thinks, that she was a narcissistic, neglectful drunk. He then goes off on how I need to rebuild my relationship with my sisters. Like me, EDad has two sisters, but he is VERY close to both of them (as am I). But I told him older sis has been away from us for too long for me to feel comfortable, and younger sis has been ruined by NMom's triangulation. So if I were to have a relationship with her, it could not be while NMom is also in my life.

3c) I told EDad, among all this stuff, that the only reason I've been doing so well is that I've decided I cannot have NMom in my life anymore. He gets this, but still says nothing about how he wants to deal with the situation. I tell him if she just apologized for driving me to attempt suicide and then telling me I ""did it to myself"", I can see it differently. But she won't apologize because I ""terrorized her and my sister"".

3d) I have reason to believe my dad was acting like this was because he was stoned out of his mind. Yeah. Did not know I had a ""cool dad"". But different story, different time.

4) I'm thinking I now need to do what I've been talking about forever and reach out to my aunts about my dad. Since I can't help him, but I'm hoping they at least can. Hopefully they will help me out too, since I cannot lose ALL of my family as I'm dealing with this.

5) I did have one conversation with NMom, where she drunkenly said ""I'm so glad you came home, I was SO afraid I was just going to yelled at the whole time!"" She seriously does not understand how HER ACTIONS are what causes that (I will take responsibility for my action of yelling, I know that bothers her, but she refuses to accept how much she upsets me is a problem because in her mind, because she's ""right"" and I'm ""wrong"", that's MY problem.) I cannot deal with this anymore and am only trying to get her to help me pay for my last few classes. Seeing she stole $10,000 from me last year, that is the least she can do.

5) I'm starting my two summer classes and really excited about them. Both are based in web design, which is my minor - I'm trying to get an internship doing that or graphic design in the fall. Gotta get two A's though if I want to graduate... I think I can do it?

6) And the part that I should probably be most concerned with - in less than 24 hours, I will be homeless. At this point, I just have to clean my apartment and move into my friends house, where I can hopefully stay until they move out on the 26th. But after that, I'm screwed. My best friend said he doesn't think his new roommates will let me, and all my other friends have really sketchy living situations since ""the hangout house"" is about to become a thing of the past. So there's a possibility I'm going to have to put my things in storage and maybe stay at a homeless shelter for a couple days. Should be an interesting experience...

I'm sorry this is so long, but I literally cannot believe how much this shit has blown up in my face these past couple of weeks. It seems like in a very short time, if I get through this, my ""old life"" can very easily be put in the past. I had the opportunity to take it slow since I moved up this past September, but now I gotta be in full force. And I'm hoping if I work hard at everything, it will just be another month before I can reap the benefits (no pun intended! :D)

Lastly, I just want to thank everyone on here for hearing me out. I feel like I frustrate everyone when I talk about my NMom and say ""I'm going to go NCLOLJK"". Several of you have WTFed the things she has done, which I thought were normal, but I do feel bad for her since she is capable of empathy in a weird way (NMom is not a true N, but my therapist thinks she may have BPD). It hasn't been easy to cut the cord and run, as my sisters have. And rebuilding THOSE relationships is something I have no idea how to do.

So, yeah. Any thoughts on any part of this would be appreciated, since I can't prioritize it at all."

2010-2011 -&gt; Finished High School, future was bright.  
2011-2012 -&gt; CS Engineering begins, it was a total failure. I didn't care about it too much (yes, I'm an idiot), because here in Spain is common to fail the first year of engineering degree.  
2012-2013 -&gt; Second year, better but failure anyway. Decided to drop because I was near depression.   
2013-2014 -&gt; Enrolled in something like an Associate's Degree. Great year, learning a lot.  

This year (2014-2015), the last one of my Associate's Degree, I got an internship with Accenture. They are known for exploiting employees with extra hours, but the job experience is one of the best here in Spain. The have offered me a contract as a full-time programmer with standard pay for the degree (enough to pay rent).     

This would seem like everything is going fantastic, but I want to be an CS engineer. I want it so bad. I want the math, and the physics, the low-level things they teach. Maybe I'm obsessed because of the failure, but I feel incomplete without the degree. It's my greatest challenge.        


With that and without the possibility of a part-time job, I face two big choices:  

a) F*** the job, I want to be an engineer. Full-time student. **Fear of another failure and ending in the same position as last year,** but without a job. Finishing the degree as a 25-26 year-old without job experience (maybe I could find work in the summers, but who knows). I would need a good internship and another job offer to have the opportunity to work from the bottom, but this time as a engineer (more offers, better pay and ""job reputation"").

b) Work at Accenture and course the degree on my free time. This would mean I have great experience, but because of the extra hours and the job, the degree would take time. Maybe 8 years. 8 years without free time because I will be always studying. That's a lot, a really lot of time. Finishing as a 30 year-old senior-programmer or analyst, with great experience and a degree. From 22 to 30 dedicating time for anything but studying.    

I know that I have lost the opportunity of being an awesome young engineer and I accept that, but I would appreciate some advice.    

It's a long text, I'm sorry. Thank you for the answers and feel free to tell me about my grammar errors!

When we met she was studying Arts. After two years we moved in together and eventually I convinced her against her parents wishes to go to law school. It's what she always wanted to do but her parents just wanted her independent of them as soon as possible.

 I was in love with her, I wanted the best for her, I didn't want her dream to be thrown away because her parents were stubborn. I teased and cajoled and eventually she gave in. Turns out she was brilliant. She excelled at law, she worked hard and grasped onto lots of amazing opportunities and when she graduates I'm certain she'll get an amazing job. Even her parents now are proud of her and will nod their heads and smile as if it was their plan all along.

Not to say it was easy. She gained a lot of weight, she became ill often, she would freak out and break down and cry, fight with her parents, worry about money, spend all night studying or working on assignments away from home. But that was okay, because I was there and I loved her. I shoved my feelings about her weight aside when It didn't go away despite gyms and diets. I drained my wallet dry taking her to doctors, buying medications, paying for cabs. I worked part time. I practiced every bit of self control I had when she would break down and refuse to function. I spent hours comforting her and when I was home alone because she was too busy with school work I would fall asleep thinking about the future.

And that was okay because I was there and I loved her.

I just needed to hold on for a few more years and everything would be perfect. A few more years and she would be a lawyer and I would finish up medical school and with a double income everthi-

Oh yeah. Medical school. That's right, that thing, that ambition, that pathway to a better life that I rung myself dry to get into. The thing that requires you to commit, to invest, to iterate, to focus wholly and repeatedly. 

I don't know if it was hubris, or naivety, or just plain stupidity but how in the FUCK did I think this was possible. It wasn't. I burned out. I quit. I couldn't do it anymore.

But it was okay because she was there and she loved me.

She told me she that once she graduated she would take care of me while I went back to University. She would lose weight, she would take care of the bills, she would be there for me like I was there for her. I cried. A lot. I just needed to work for one year while she finished up law school, finished her internship on the other side of the country, then I could try again.

The train had been delayed but not derailed.

But then she showed up.

I've never hated a person more in my life. If she could just vanish and take all my memories of her away with her it would be perfect. If she wasn't so perfect it would be perfect. If I was perfect it would be perfect. But none of those are true.

I really don't know what kind of cruel deity could mold a human being so precisely, exactingly, perfect to my preferences and place her on the earth right next to me right now.

I'm not an idiot. I know she's not perfect. I know if I spent more time with her, If I got to know her, If I lived with her, the imperfections would come out of the woodwork, the little blemishes that make us human. I would never have lasted five years in love otherwise.

But look at what I'm saying!

All these dangerous thoughts because of this woman who seems to be conjured from my memories. The eyes and crooked smile of the first girl I fell in love with, the dress and manner of the second, the acerbic wit and humor of the third, and all around her the subcultures and niche interests I had long had to throw away. She makes me feel amazing. Alive. 

But I don't cheat. I never have and I never will. I've only met this girl as a friend, among friends. Even with her inviting eyes and her soft hands I've kept her at arms length. So what can I do.

 On one hand - the girl that has shared the most of my life, the girl who promises a future together, who promises to help me pick up the bits and pieces of my own academic life that shattered under our weight. The girl who wore me down, the girl who I'm no longer physically attracted to, the girl who's not here right now but on the other side of the country, the girl who I've been enduring for the sake of the future.

On the other - Leaving her for a chance, and only a chance at having something like that with this girl made from my memories. The girl who makes me remember my old ambitions and loves, The girl who I understand, The girl who understands me, The girl who is as close to perfect as it can get, The girl who I have to approach with nothing to show for myself except an incomplete degree and the earning potential of a high school graduate, and most of all The girl who I have to emotionally murder the other for.

 There's just no way it could work right?

I want the answer to be yes and no. It's been tearing at me for weeks and weeks. I feel like a weak and petty human being and I see nothing but double edged swords no matter what I do. I'm starting to hate myself.


**tl;dr**: Do I continue in my established relationship that has sucked me dry in anticipation of future happiness or do I abandon it all for a slim chance with who may be the girl of my dreams?

2010-2011 -&gt; Finished High School, future was bright.  
2011-2012 -&gt; CS Engineering begins, it was a total failure. I didn't care about it too much (yes, I'm an idiot), because here in Spain is common to fail the first year of engineering degree.  
2012-2013 -&gt; Second year, better but failure anyway. Decided to drop because I was near depression.  
2013-2014 -&gt; Enrolled in something like an Associate's Degree. Great year, learning a lot.

This year (2014-2015), the last one of my Associate's Degree, I got an internship with Accenture. They are known for exploiting employees with extra hours, but the job experience is one of the best here in Spain. The have offered me a contract as a full-time programmer with standard pay for the degree (enough to pay rent).  
This would seem like everything is going fantastic, but I want to be an CS engineer. I want it so bad. I want the math, and the physics, the low-level things they teach. Maybe I'm obsessed because of the failure, but I feel incomplete without the degree. It's my greatest challenge.

With that and without the possibility of a part-time job, I face two big choices:

a) F*** the job, I want to be an engineer. Full-time student. Fear of another failure and ending in the same position as last year, but without a job. Finishing the degree as a 25-26 year-old without job experience (maybe I could find work in the summers, but who knows). I would need a good internship and another job offer to have the opportunity to work from the bottom, but this time as a engineer (more offers, better pay and ""job reputation"").

b) Work at Accenture and course the degree on my free time. This would mean I have great experience, but because of the extra hours and the job, the degree would take time. Maybe 8 years. 8 years without free time because I will be always studying. That's a lot, a really lot of time. Finishing as a 30 year-old senior-programmer or analyst, with great experience and a degree. From 22 to 30 dedicating time for anything but studying.

I know that I have lost the opportunity of being an awesome young engineer and I accept that, but I would appreciate some advice.

If you meet all of the criteria that I request in this post, then there should be no reason why I don't respond to you.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a bit to see what I get. Thank you!"

Well well well... here is yet another request for this wonderful game. My reasons for wanting it are long and many, so I have taken the liberty of dividing my post into easy-to-read sections for your viewing pleasure; after all, the organization of this post should reflect the amount of time I put into it. 

I also want to thank the moderators and community for maintaining this spectacular sub. Without you all, this post wouldn't be happening obviously, and so many people would have lost out on happiness received from giving and receiving games to/from strangers. Ergo, y'all rock.

That said, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this review:

**Background**

Although we are [most of the time] all strangers to each other on the internet, I feel that it is important that you, the reader, know a little bit about me as a person and my interests in this game. There's not much to really know about me: I'm an 18-year-old university student who likes to ski, give math help, devour historical documents, travel around and gorge myself on traditional cuisine. In terms of my financial situation, I would like to tell you that I won't use the whole ""I'm a broke American college student. I can't afford this game. So please buy it for me, okay?"" spiel... but the problem is, that well, the first sentence in that statement is true. I haven't bought a game on Steam in over a year, the last time being a purchase of Empire: Total War on a 75% off sale for like $5 on the 2013 Winter Sale, and I have had to rely almost exclusively on the amazing family sharing deal to play games my kind friends own to satisfy my gaming needs. I have not had the opportunity to get a job since school started, and if you don't count internships than I have never been employed for a wage. My gaming PC is fine, gtx650 with an intel duo core and 8 gigs of RAM for the $170 price tag my broke self got it for, but even then it was only possible due to the kindness of another friend giving me half the requisite parts and case for free as well as the sale of my Xbox 360 and all of my games on that platform. Simply put, I'm not exactly the richest guy out there, and the school fees are starting to wrack up.

Leaving that negative note aside, I know that you all would much rather read up on my gaming background [and I would much rather write on in too to be fair.] I am primarily an RPG and Grand Strategy game player, as any quick look at the hundreds of hours I have put in these games on my Steam Profile will show you. Crusader Kings II is my favorite strategy game: I have 500 recorded hours on Steam playing that game, and I have probably spent countless more hours modding it to my liking. 

In terms of single-player RPGs, I really shouldn't have to tell you that my favorites are two of the Elder Scrolls Titles--Morrowind and Skyrim. Morrowind was and is a magickal (spelling-intended) place; political, cultural, and religious conflicts throughout Vvardenfell like the feuds between the Great Houses, the tenuous control of the Septim Empire and its puppet monarchy and dukes over the Dunmer people, the ostracization of the Ashlanders, the persecution of non-Imperial faiths by the Tribunal Temple (especially the persecution of the dissident priests), the tensions between Imperial colonizers and the Skaal/Dunmer, the Dunmeri practice of ancestor worship and slavery that even included the IRL equivalent of ""White MAn's Burden"" in the Velothi treatment of the Khajiit and Argonians, the economic monopolization and mercantilism of the Empire and her guilds... all of this and more made Vvardenfell feel REAL. This was a believable world, and to say I got absorbed on my first playthrough on the OG Xbox would've been an understatement. Playing Morrowind also got me into Elder Scrolls Lore like nothing else. When I first read The Dragon Break Reexamined my mind was utterly blown away; here is a book discounting the idea that the Time Dragon could be broken, yet the very presence of that book written in the 4th Era that casually mentions the fall of the Septim Dynasty IN A GAME TAKING PLACE IN 3E WHEN THOSE EMPERORS ARE STILL AROUND establishes Dragon Breaks as a fact. And the 36 lessons of Vivec... yeah, I never thought I would want to know the tale of the hermaphrodotic lover of Nerevar who ended up betraying him, marrying and procreating with the God of Rape, learning the truth of the universe's nature as nothing more than the dream of the unconscious Anu, and going on all sorts of hard-to-interpret metaphysically-themed adventures! The mundane lore was also great. Jungle Romans? Check. Cat People created by the Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk to maintain the moons, who could range in form from massive sabre-tooth tiger-sized Senche to the size of a small house-cat? Check. A Reptilian race crafted by a group of dimension-travelling sentient alien trees? Sounds pretty cool to me. It was foreign yet familiar, alien yet close to home. I made sure to read every book I could find on and off the web, and the UESP was a godsend. In fact, my love for the lore has only gotten stronger; I've got the Imperial Library and /r/teslore bookmarked, and I have contributed Apocrypha to the latter on my own time. I even am a part of the dev team for [Elder Kings,](http://www.moddb.com/mods/elder-kings) a mod that combines Elder Scrolls lore with the Crusader Kings II engine to bring Tamriel into the world of Grand Strategy (I also mod /r/ElderKings, so come check us out if you want to learn more as well as the Paradox Plaza forums!) I love Morrowind even more now that I'm on PC: Tamriel Rebuilt adds so much content to the game, Morrowind Code Patch fixes so many annoying bugs, and Morrowind Overhaul has allowed me to experience my favorite childhood game in glorious HD textures much to the chagrin of my low-end PC's graphical capabilities. That game is a 10/10 easy.

Oblivion was a fun game on console, but a real disappointment compared to Morrowind for me. No jungle Romans? Blasphemy. Nibenay was supposed to be the home of a thousand cults, yet all I see are temples to the nine everywhere in what should be a very cosmopolitan and religiously diverse Empire. Skyrim, however, more than made up for Oblivion to me. I had a blast on both console and PC, and I loved all the new lore that was added to the Nords and Falmer, especially stuff that was briefly mentioned in previous games or OOG texts that was confirmed (Giants and painted cows, Alduin and Dragons as shards of the greater Time Dragon AKA, the Falmer still existing but having been poisoned and enslaved by the Dwemer, and of course the return to Solstheim and all the lore surrounding the post-Red Year Dunmer who had suffered so much since the glory days of Morrowind. That's not even getting into the game having decent melee combat for once, as well as the neatness of the thu'um in general and the game's INSANE modability. If there is one game that justified my switch to PC, it's this one, no questions about it; modded Skyrim with Requiem, Frostfall, Morrowloot, Wet and Cold, iNeed, better book covers and libraries... I really should stop giving you all my mod list, but needless to say that Skyrim allows you to tailor that game to be the exact RPG you want it to be using mods in the Elder Scrolls Universe. I was able to mod my game to be more difficult than Morrowind and have Morrowind-esque loot system, I was able to mod my game to include more lore books,  I was able to mod my game to unscale enemies and force me to eat, sleep, drink and maintain my character's internal body pressure as well as to skip the repetitiveness of Helgen. Skyrim, like Morrowind, was and is legendary, and those two games are some of my favorites of all time. 

Now that you know a bit about me and my gaming preferences, let's get down to why I want the Elder Scrolls Online: Imperial Edition.

**Gameplay**

ESO looks to be a slight, but nonetheless appreciable, improvement over Skyrim gameplay-wise. The basics of the gameplay are pretty similar: in Skyrim one can go sword and board, two-handed or using two weapons at once in the melee department, but with one key improvement--in ESO you can now roll around to dodge attacks, a very welcome feature to a combat system that previously consisted of LB, LB, RB, LB... for melee-only characters.

ESO, unlike other MMO's, also doesn't shoehorn you into one part of the holy trinity; all four classes in ESO are free-form in nature, and can all do DPS, Healer and Tank if you spec them up right. The same goes for the racial bonuses that are minor at best and can be offset using the right equipment. Just like in Skyrim you can wander the world and build your character the way you want him or her to be built, with no WoW-type classes restricting you.

Of course, I also can't forget to mention that this game has what appears to be the best Third Person view of any Elder Scrolls game to date. I even played Morrowind in third person, so I'm glad to see a game that finally does it proper justice (Skyrim was also a very big step in the right direction in this regard.)

**Graphics**

ESO is gorgeous. It includes parts of every province of Tamriel, and incorporates the beautiful architecture and environments that spawned the various Tamrielic cultures perfectly and with lore-accuracy. I mean [just look at this wonderful world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2BScKGKyA8) Spectacular.

**It's an MMO**

I know a lot of Elder Scrolls fans dislike this game for straying away from the single-player nature of previous titles, and that is very understandable. Yet for me, this game's nature as an MMO is actually a strength; I am no stranger to theme park MMOs, and I always wanted to explore Tamriel with other human beings. Cooperative gaming is incredibly fun, and by far my favorite times in my gaming history have been those times where I could sit down with 4-5 friends halfway across the world and play a game of Crusader Kings 2 multiplayer. I am sure that I will have a blast playing with them in Tamriel, and hopefully making a few more along the way.

It will also be satisfying to actually face challenging enemies that have a brain and kill me. PVP makes MMOs shine, and according to some of the reviews I've watched ESO has some of the best non-WoW-esque PVP out there. To say I'd be excited to join a PVP guild and get back into PVPing for the first time since my Runescape/WoW days is an understatement.

**And of course, MUH LORE**

By now you should know that I like Elder Scrolls Lore. I mean, I really, REALLY do. And guess what: Elder Scrolls Online has more of it than any game since Morrowind. It is the first Elder Scrolls game to include every province in Tamriel since Arena, and as such the game has provided Zenimax an opportunity to add to the lore of each and every province. The game also has a [fantastically-knowledgeable](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/2g0x5l/ama_with_the_eso_writing_team/) dedicated lore and writing team run by Lawrence Schick (who happens to be [awesome too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ijLyD3z6u4) This team has succeeded in adding [2293 books](http://www.imperial-library.info/books/online/by-title), more than in any other Elder Scrolls title, and according to reviewers and players I've PMed on reddit they've also succeeded in writing one of the best MMO storylines ever. I've taken the time to read some of those books and I can say that I like what I see; Argonians playing a game reminiscent of [Ōllamaliztli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballgame), the Oceans of Nirn being Memory, and the debate between Phrastus and Lady Cinnabar on whether Cyrodiil was never jungle or Cyrodiil gradually shifted from jungled to forested (jokes on them, as they are both right and wrong due to [wonky time metaphysics. Mwahahahahah.](http://esohead.com/books/250-ruminations-on-the-elder-scrolls) ). 

ESO also takes place during the Interregnum period, a period explored by no other game before it yet one that was seminal to the foundation of the 3E and 4E worlds in which the main games happen. The Interregnum is a relative unknown to me, and I have a deep desire to learn more about it through playing in this living, breathing world. Also, the Elder Kings mod takes place during the same time period, so I most certainly will get more ideas to improve my share of that mod through playing this game too.

**Why the Imperial Edition?**

No, it's not because I'm greedy. My favorite ""race"" in Elder Scrolls is the Imperial race, although it'd be more accurate to say that my favorite culture is that of the Niben. ESO, more than any game before it, seeks to establish the clear divide lore-wise in the Imperial Race between the stoic Colovians and the cosmopolitan, tolerant and exotic Nibenese who populate the heart of Ald Cyrod. I planned for my first character to be a Nibenese Dragonknight should I get this game, and sadly 1/10 of possible racial backgrounds are kept behind a paywall. I would not be asking if Imperials were a vanilla race.

**Conclusion**

Elder Scrolls Online appeals to me as both a wonderful extension to the Elder Scrolls lore and Skyrim's gameplay, but also due to being the first MMO through which one can experience Tamriel. I hope the rest of you have a wonderful day, and I thank you for reading this incredibly long-winded post. (I seriously did not intend for this to be so long, I just couldn't stop writing is all.) Thanks again, and have a great day!

P.S. If any of you play this game, feel free to add me as a friend if I get the game. I'll post my username/character info here.

TL;DR in Haiku form of why I want the game:

I love Elder Scrolls

Love the lore especially 

Gameplay is sweet too

36b5ly,2,2015-05-17,Do I have a chance at this?,nickolasjt,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/36b5ly/do_i_have_a_chance_at_this/,"I'm 21, 5-10, and 185 right now.  I'm finishing my 4 year degree in criminal justice this December.  I'm testing for the police department that I REALLY want to work for in the future is coming up on June 27th (6 weeks).  I also have a very good shot at getting hired there, because that is where I did my internship.  The reason I need this, is they only test once every two years, and in order to be eligible within the next two years, you need to be on this list.  The first test is the physical part of it, and if you don't pass that you're automatically disqualified.  

The part I am worried about is the bench press.  You must bench 99% of your weight one repetition.  I can do about 135 right now, and I don't lift frequently.  My plan?

Eat healthy (paleo type diet), Lose about 15 pounds with lots of cardio, while working on my bench.  15 Pounds of loss would put me at 170, which is just 35 pounds I would need to gain on bench in 6 weeks.  For you lifters, is this possible?  I just went to GNC, and got some C4, weigh, and some daily vitamin packs.  

Do I have a shot?"
36b6rv,14,2015-05-17,As a side project this summer I want to create chess on my own in a web application. What language or tools should I use?,MrSinge,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/36b6rv/as_a_side_project_this_summer_i_want_to_create/,"I have an internship this summer, but on the side at home I'd like to code chess in a web application on my own.  I am a rising sophomore and am not really sure what language to use.  After some googling many articles said a JApplet would be best.  I already know java, but definitely would not be opposed to learning Python or Ruby or something like that.  What should I use and why? Also no javascript please"
36bgr5,9,2015-05-17,I [22/F] am feeling helpless with my depressed boyfriend [23/M] of 5 years. I don't know what to do anymore.,thow34443,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36bgr5/i_22f_am_feeling_helpless_with_my_depressed/,"I'm coming here because I feel like I have no where to go right now.

Boyfriend and I began dating mid high school, and have been together for 5 years now. We've had ups and downs but we complement each others personalities well, have similar interests, and are both committed to solving problems together. We've made it through a lot of tough stuff.

I love my boyfriend. He's smart, humorous, and interesting. He's great at sex and will adventure with me occasionally, going camping, for walks, or out to dinner.

He entered university at the same time I did, and struggled due to depression and IBS, and eventually failed out of the university we both went to. I'll get my degree Spring 2016 at said university. School has always been hard for him. He's a had a few jobs during all that time, one awesome internship, and one internship that isn't going well at all that he just started 3 weeks ago. It's not a good fit for him and has shot his confidence, and made him even more depressed. He has completed precursory online courses to be able to finish his degree online, but delayed starting them by a month because work has been so shitty. He has no confidence currently and wishes he wasn't here, wasn't alive, that things were different. I'm about 900 miles away currently, until the end of July, doing an internship. I'm hoping to get in a 3 day visit mid-June.

He's in computer science. At his current job, he's doing unfulfilling work, at low pay for his field, and there's one guy he has to directly work with who is impossible (rude, antisocial, but good at coding). His boss is nice but basically, the work he's doing isn't a good fit for him. This is the first job he's had in about 6 months. He needs it but it's wrecking him. And he's incredibly depressed by the thought of having to enter the apply-interview-get rejected cycle. He wanted to be able to settle into this current job for a couple of years while he finishes his degree, but it's apparent that can't happen with the company he's with now. 

He can't get excited for the future anymore, he's been let down so much and holds onto it. This summer should have been different.

We were recently (like an hour ago) talking on the phone, and I ended up saying something about his attitude towards school, and he got really upset and hung up. He's drowning his feeling in video games right now. He feels like I don't understand, which maybe I don't, I don't fucking know. I feel so fucking useless typing this. It's not like I can give you all the history, let alone have the energy to put it down. I mis-spoke, and now I've sent him into a pit of sadness and feeling alone.

It's been so hard for so long. I love this person a lot. But I don't even know what to do anymore. I can't fix him, he knows I can't fix him, which makes him feel worse. He is on medication and goes to see a therapist, and is very willing to seek counseling and he cautiously began medication about 2 years ago. It's helped slightly. But not enough. The antidepressant he's on has done meh, and the Aderall he now takes helps quite a bit with focus, which makes him happier. 

I feel absolutely insane. I go through periods of feeling very positive, being so ready to help him, I do help him a lot. I'll finish the job application when he is to exhausted. I'll make him dinner (when I'm not 900 miles away). I listen. I try to give advice. But I feel like none of my thoughts really matter anymore. My opinions don't do anything. I just feel so numb. I was trying to think of the most recent day we had, where there wasn't a fucking cloud hanging over us, and I can't fucking remember. The cloud is always there. He doesn't ask about my day, and in the worst of it, he hardly replies over the phone. I have to pull teeth to get anything to happen with him. I'm so exhausted. He's so exhausted. I just want things to go right. 

I miss my boyfriend. I don't know where he is anymore. He's just a black cloud, and occasionally the sun pokes through, but it's hardly ever anymore. I'm beginning to doubt myself. Is it my fault? Is it his fault? Or are we totally helpless to anything that our environment decides to do to us?

I don't know what my question is. I guess I'm just looking for others with a similar experience. I don't want to break up, I feel like it would devastate both of us, and I know the person I love is in there somewhere, I just haven't seen him in so long. I feel so alone. There's no way I could break up with him - he's been through so much: abusive &amp; poor childhood, money issues, deaths, depression. No way I could break up knowing the person I love to much is in there, I love him so much. I'll do all I can to help him know that he's not alone. 

I'm just worried where he's going to go from here. I'm worried he won't get another job, will lose this one, and will stagnate with school. I'm worried I will build resentment. I do feel upset sometimes, like a slave almost, to this situation. I'm angry at depression, I've begun to feel resentment when I read posts on r/depression. That kind of thing. I just want to have a fucking conversation again, I wish it wasn't like it is right now. I'm worried that my empathy is running dry. I just feel so empty, helpless, and numb.

TL;DR My boyfriend has depression pretty bad, his situation isn't great right now, and I'm feeling helpless and alone. We're exhausted. I don't want to break up. I need to hear similar stories, for better or worse. "

**Chapter 2: Profiling**

**Date point: 4y 10m 3w 2d AV**

“Age?”

“Seventy years.”

“Height and weight?”

“153 pounds, at least according to my bathroom scale. Almost 5’ 10”.”

“So 5’9” then. Any pre-existing conditions?”

“…Diabetes. Type 2.”

“…Alright. Profession?”

“Pharmacist. Retired.” 

“Any other professions in your life?”

“I was a truck driver back in the army. Went to Vietnam same as anyone else. Didn’t last long though.”

“Were you injured? It doesn’t mention your service in your file.”

“Didn’t think you wanted back that far. But yeah, took some shrapnel to the head. Nothing really serious though. It healed fine after a while. Still, I was gonna need to wear bandages for a while, so they sent me home. Hence not being a truck driver for too long.”

The woman behind the large desk had started typing every time he had answered a question. Ominously, she’d typed for rather a long time when he’d told her he was diabetic. Much longer than was necessary to type in a three word answer. He wasn’t sure why these questions were necessary either, he’d answered all of them on the application she had in a folder right in front of her.

For the first time since the questions began, the middle-aged woman behind the desk, named Ms. Ericson, if the door placard was to be believed, looked at him and stopped typing.

“You know that you can’t possibly be a candidate for work on Cimbrean, don’t you? Your diabetes *alone* disqualifies you from participation in Scotch Creek’s program, as well as pretty much every company currently operating in any space capacity, including ours. It says in your application that you’d applied to most of those places as well. So, why bother?”

“Better chance of getting into space than if I never applied at all.” Frank replied.

“True. Still not much of a chance though…” 

Ms. Ericson seemed to be appraising him before speaking further.

“You don’t qualify for any of our programs Mr. Clark. The application has a list right on page 4, at least half a page long of disqualifying ailments. Diabetes is the third one down. You can’t have missed it.”

Again, she gave him that same appraising look. For a brief moment, despite what she had just said, Frank thought she might be about to offer him a job.

“Why did you apply here?”

“Same reason I just told you about Scotch Creek and all the other corporations.” Frank replied, inwardly exasperated.

“No, you misunderstand my question. Why do you want to go into space? And why are you so desperate to go?”

It wasn’t a question he’d expected to be asked, even though he had some vague ideas bubbling under the surface of his thoughts. He’d written that he wanted to be a colonist, start a new life on another world, but that wasn’t really the truth. It was all he could think that these companies might want to hear, so he’d written it.

“…I dunno… Can I have a second to collect my thoughts, please?”

“Take your time.”

Frank mulled it over, aware that despite her claims that he was unqualified, his answer might actually buy his ticket through a wormhole.

“You remember me telling you I was in Vietnam right?”

“Yes.” 

“I never got a shot off. That explosion that put shrapnel in my head? It was my 10th day in Vietnam. Just driving in a convoy, bright flash, sharp pain, and then I was in a hospital bed three days later. Never even saw the guy who shot at me. Don’t even know what it was he shot my truck with. I always regretted never getting a shot off; not making a difference.”

“You want to go into space because you think you’ll be able to take your shot? To kill for humanity?” 

Her tone was flat; unreadable. 

“God no, it was that I never got to *help!*” 

“I don’t follow.”

Frustrated, Frank reorganized his thought process.

“See, I didn’t get drafted. I volunteered straight out of high school. I wanted to help, y’know? All the posters, the ads, the stories on the radio of the Korean war when I was a kid? I wanted to do my part, even though I didn’t wanna kill people. So I joined. We played army for a bit, and then they stuck me on a plane over the Pacific with my rifle and a duffle bag. I was fucking terrified. When that plane landed, a few of the draft guys refused point-blank to get out. They got dragged off to some brig or something, but not me. I stood up, legs shaking like a baby taking his first steps; ready to go do what I said I’d do for my country and my brothers.”

A pained look crossed Frank’s face, making him look even older than he felt in that moment.

“But just ten days in, before I’d even seen the enemy, and just driving a truck with nothing more exciting in it than some dirty uniforms being taken to the laundry, I see a bright flash, a bang, and wake up with bandages covering half my head…”

Frank looked down, unable to look the woman in the eyes any longer. He’d only ever told this story to one other person, because of how deeply it shamed him.

“I never got to help.”

“…I see.”

Ms. Ericson didn’t laugh or give a pitying look, or give him an amused expression that told him he was too late in life for a second chance like this. She just looked at him, expressionless, studying his face, like she was trying to look past it and see deeper into his intentions.

“Do you think you deserve the second chance?”

Startled, Frank again made eye contact with the woman.

“Deserve? I don’t know that I *deserve* anything. But I’m damn well gonna *try* for my second chance as hard as I can before I let anyone tell me it won’t ever happen.”

Ms. Ericson raised her eyebrows at this, but didn’t comment. Sitting in silence she began to type again on her keyboard. Frank sat motionless, afraid he’d just blown it, but not wanting to risk any more words in case he was wrong. She grabbed the folder with his application in it and added a few papers from one of her drawers. Then, after printing off several pages from her computer, added these to the folder as well.

She stood up from her desk, and, manners ingrained into him by his mother, Frank heaved forward onto his feet as well, earning him a small smile from Ms. Ericson, which he apprehensively returned.

“You don’t need to stand Mr. Clark. Wait here please.”

Then she left, leaving Frank to wonder if he’d ruined the interview somehow.

Minutes passed in silence in the office, with the nervous occupant fidgeting slightly. Frank sat, trying to keep his nagging thoughts at bay. “You’re too old to be of any use and you know it.” “Imagine if you went into diabetic shock up there. You’d be a liability.” “What possible use could they have for you in the future? You still listen to music on a record player; hardly a member of the future of humanity.”

After what felt like an hour, there was a knock on the door, and a young man poked his head in through the door; too young to be anyone of importance in the company. Ah, Frank thought, here’s an intern to tell me, “Sorry sir, you’re not quite the man were looking for. But thanks for coming in.”

But the kid, barely 19 from the looks of him, said, “Ms. Ericson sent me to take you upstairs, would you follow me please?”

Clamping down on the sharp stab of hope that shot through him, and instead assuming what he hoped was a dignified walk, Frank followed the kid down a hallway and around a few turns until they reached an elevator. The kid seemed to be a bit excited, based off of how he kept shifting from side to side in front of the door. 

“I never get to use this elevator.” He said, nervously. He produced an ID badge and held it near the elevator 
doors, which slid open.

Frank followed, wordlessly into the elevator. He felt the subtle shift of the elevator that meant they were moving, and quickly too. The ride took about a minute, and Frank felt both his ears pop before the doors opened to show a man sitting behind a much larger desk than Ms. Ericson’s, who happened to be sitting in a chair near the man.

“Ah, how’s it going Frank? Heard a lot about you from my psych-profiler, Jennifer!” He said, while pointing at Ms. Ericson. “Anyways, Frank, my name is Moses Byron. I’d like to offer you a job.”

36bjzi,7,2015-05-17,"Life seems to be going to shit, and I don't know where to turn.",throwaway89999998,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/36bjzi/life_seems_to_be_going_to_shit_and_i_dont_know/,"I don't know what to do anymore. I had a great vision for my life back in 2011, when I went off to college. I was going to be in the biology field, doing what I really felt compelled to do. But a year into it things weren't looking great in grades, and everyone around me told me I wasn't good for anything except editing and writing essays, and that I should just give up on trying to do anything scienc-y since I wasn't smart enough for it. So I panicked, dropped Biology and took up English, and just...decided that was it.  Graduated last May with an English degree, tried being optimistic, but being denied for every job that is ""in your degree field"" (so far) takes its toll. Was stuck in the same retail job I had in college, with nothing changing for the year and a half I was there. I quit my job (had a lot saved up) because I was going crazy and they were treating me badly, and used the free time to really start applying. Worked hard as hell on my resume. Got a few interviews, but the common trend is that if I'm not denied due to ""not having enough experience in the field,"" then it is because ""I don't seem like an upbeat fellow"" or ""you don't seem like you have the spirit to survive at our company."" 

It has always been like that, for the year I've been applying. Even in retail jobs. I've been denied promotions due to ""not having the [insert company name] spirit"" or because the managers have blatantly told me they despise me. I can never figure out why, they just do. Can't hold a job for long (year and a half was the longest one) because the managers make it a living hell for me, and I just give up. 

After getting over a bad bout of depression, I decided to go back to school and pursue Biology. I always regretted not sticking with it, and even with the massive amount of debt I have I feel like this is the right decision. There's a guaranteed internship which is nice and could lead to a job...but people in my life had berated me for being an ""idiot,"" that it's a waste of money, that I already have a degree and that I've ""dug my hole."" On top of the college telling me that I should have made a better decision and that I'm only allowed financial aid for 2 years due to Post-Baccalaureate status (and that's by law, so I understand, it's just upsetting). 

I don't have a job, paying rent with the money I have saved, and I refuse to go back to retail unless some circumstances compel me to...but I look for jobs every day that could accommodate a school schedule. Roommates constantly dirty the house, tell me it's my job to clean it since I'm a ""dead beat"" who sits at home all day, and they are just ""too busy actually having a life and not being shit"" to clean and that I should be the maid.

**HEY, GUESS WHAT, I FUCKED UP THE SHIT OUT OF THE COUNT YESTERDAY. COUNT FOR TODAY IS YEAR 2, DAY 23; 210 DAYS POST-CONDESCENSION**

Seven months since the end of the gigapause. Everything seems so short in comparison to that cold winter, doesn't it? Every summer, in my experience, seems short compared to the long winter of my discontent [whos shakespeare](/docscratch).

Unrelated: I think I can't really get drunk anymore. I think it's all the craft brews that my coworker funneled into my mouth during the internship. Really, they tasted *great*, but they are a *piss poor* method of getting drunk. Entirely too expensive, and too rich to drink in any quantity with any speed. 

My friend spent the night last night with his PS4, and we *should* have reunited online like long lost lovers, but we spent most of it fucking with my puppy. God, he's a nice kid, but you can tell he's not adjusting to the new digs very well. Still, potty training is proceeding along nicely, and I can *kinda* force him to drink and eat. He's gotta keep that strength up if he's gonna shit everywhere like he does. 

I also think he has the mange, so I'm keeping him isolated from the other animals when possible. I hear mange can *really* spiral out of control.

I also learned something about the other pets of the home: when no one else is around, they are the *greatest* sleeping buddies a guy can ask for. Paladin (the cat) and Louis (the dog) just get the fuck up on my bed and start vying for real estate on my torso. I almost said in between my legs instead of on my torso but then I realized ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

They do like to nestle in between my thighs, though. Kinda weird, but I guess it's warm and snug because my thighs are fat little shits. Whatever.

My mind is addled; I'm semi getting over that sickness and I woke up *two hours ago.* Man, I'm going to have a *great* day tomorrow.

It's one of my principles: an all-nighter to reset a sleep schedule.

[While I practice that principle, newcomers will be delighted to know that, if they're looking for a place to talk and learn about their fellow homestucks.](/kv) 

[Some common topics of discussion include school (it sucks), life (it's boring), anime (did you hear about Akame ga Kill?), video games (it's usually portal or smash), literature (*still* a big fan of 1Q84 here, guys), and family (they're usually pretty cool).](/kv) 

Speaking of family, I got attack hugged by my sister when she saw I was home yesterday. She's being a bit of a rebel these days, having sex with her ex-best friend's ex-boyfriend. Girls sure are weird! Just as long as she doesn't do something truly stupid. 

She's wearing this punky-ass nose ring, though. Told her to get a smaller one. I think subtle is better. 

Ah! But I have retreated too far into the realm of reminiscence, and forgotten that I am, in fact, supposed to post Questions of the Day after my red text! 

I MUST TAKE MEASURES TO PREVENT FUTURE TRANSGRESSIONS OF THIS SORT.

""what are qotds"" you ask (or probably *would* ask a veteran, if you were actually within whispering distance of them)

""QOTDs are Questions of the Day. They're a method of starting conversations betwixt ourselves. For example, you would answer this question, and I'd say 'omg right' and we'd become best friends forever."" 

""oh"" you say, pretty well satisfied, if somewhat unsettled by OPs mental breakdown. 

The veteran would (probably) further add, ""Those can be submitted by anyone. Even you, rookie."" 

You'd get a shimmering look of admiration in your eyes as the veteran poses majestically, his cape flowing behind him in a gust. [""You can do that here!""](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZoDZ_GkIbNz4lt5YM72n_UJlvS335WCS-CSnmWrFhBM/edit?pli=1) the veteran finishes, with an anime-esque gesture of their arm.

It's so much fun to go wild.

QOTD1 (*submitted by /u/aberrantArtificer*): What would you say your classpect is (or several possibilities)? Do you think that says anything about you?

I was once told by a quiz that I was a mage of heart. Haha, *VERY FUCKING FUNNY.*

A wizened old man then told me I was a thief of doom, and I knew my true calling. I was to steal the doom of others for my own benefit! I was to be a sort of perverse secret service for my friends, and an even more perverse *Mirror-Force* card for my enemies. 

God, that card is fucking *old.*

36blwe,2,2015-05-17,Give a recent grad career insight?,ValuingPotential,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/36blwe/give_a_recent_grad_career_insight/,"First off I want to thank everyone who takes the time to read this post and write a response. Your time is valuable and I appreciate it. 

Next I'd like too give a little about my education and work history. I was home-schooled through grade school, got excelled marks on my standardized tests, and was accepted into colleges' honors programs with academic scholarships. I chose a state university and chose class a curriculum that would hopefully lead me into the field of genetics. I took an assistant job in the biology research lab, and was prepared to take on the world. In my second semester, Chemistry II slapped that idea to the ground, my gpa suffered and I no longer qualified to be in the honors program, but otherwise I was able to get my science pre-reqs out of the way.

No worries, the honors-only entrepreneurship class made me realize I only wanted to get into genetics so I could one day direct futuristic research labs anyway. I changed my major to communications with a minor in business focusing on marketing (In hindsight I see that I should have switched my major to general business and done discovery courses, but I'm bad at asking for help from my advisers). 

My communications and marketing classes were a breeze, I had joined a Fraternity, and I was able to spend most of my time socializing. That all changed when I took an intro to world politics class taught by a seasoned war vet. Suddenly my paltry marketing quizzes became 30+ page, single spaced essays and hundreds of pages of reading. By the end of my Junior year I had switched my major to Political Science focusing on classes in international political economics. I dreamed of working for Goldman Sachs or a hedge fund, managing multinational firms and millions in assets, jet setting the globe.

In this time I assisted in starting a local humanitarian non-profit (which has been very successful and I now sit on the board), I obtained two internships in marketing, one at a popular regional music hall and the second at a crowd sourcing design start up, and I performed freelance marketing services for multiple small business (primarily through social media).

Because I was financing my own education, because I was feeling under a lot of pressure, and because I was still behind on degree credits; I took a year off. I worked as a server, continued my freelance work, stayed involved at the non-profit and thought about what to do next. Finally in the Fall of 2013 I graduated with a BA in Political Science and quickly found a part-time job at an international humanitarian aid office doing marketing. Because of the take-home pay at that job, I also worked in sales at a hip new vapor shop on campus.

Out of the blue I met a woman who had just started a one-woman consulting business for small clients, was looking for someone with my talents, and wanted me to start right away. Cut me a check for two weeks pay on the spot. I eagerly hopped on board and left my other jobs without doing my due-diligence and getting the right paperwork in order. I got caught up in her extravagant Rolodex. For one reason or another we dissolved our arrangement, with me feeling like I had not been fully recompensed. C'est la vie.

With all that being said, I still like the idea of jet setting and having lots of assets at my disposal. I'd like to eventually run entrepreneurial projects from the small scale in the arts to the large scale in technology and philanthropy. People like Richard Branson and Elon Musk inspire me. I read the economist, Inc, and The New Yorker, I listen daily to podcasts on current events, I have a strong interest in international business and politics, finance and investment, arts and culture, emerging markets and technology. I could see myself working for an investment firm or fund, a think tank, or any multinational.

Since January I have been doing ""extremely well,"" as a GNC Salesperson, according to my manager. I have entertained the idea of doing sales as a career in the past, but foolishly thought I needed something that challenged me more. I was listening to a guest on Bloomberg's Masters In Business podcast who said his life turned around after he did the job he was well suited for, rather than going after the ""sexy"" job. I have been earning my own money since I was 16 and have years of customer service and sales experience under my belt. Perhaps sales and account management is the path for me?

However, I still want some opinions. 
I'm in Toronto. I applied to a few Life Science programs and a few Engineering programs. I do not know why I did not apply to CS. People ask me that a lot. Anyways, I am interested in neuroscience, cs (ofc), robotics, biomedical engineering, computers, etc etc. I've also recently stumbled upon neural networks and am starting to read computer science related books and will probably do something cool once school ends.

So the problem is, I didn't make it into a good engineering school (Waterloo and Toronto). However, I did make it into UofT and Ryerson University Biomedical Engineering, which is not as reputed. I might switch to ECE there instead of doing biomed.
I may attempt to switch into U of T CS, or double major in Neurosci/CS. It may be hard to do this. Their internship program is pretty good. My friend is also ditching eng and going to CS, he says UofT is in top 10 or 20 in the world for CS. Meanwhile it's going to be hard to get any internships for engineering, as it is overshadowed by UofT in the same city and the job market isn't quite good for engineering here. I may go to grad school, and definitely aim high, so I don't know where that will lead me to. I also don't want to end up in a random codemonkey job.

But I am also thinking of going to UofT Life Sci and switching into CS or double majoring CS/Neurosci. Is there a chance I will be stuck in Life Sci? Will CS courses will up quickly? How would I go about doing this? I do some CS courses this year and then apply for a subject POST in CS? Also, I do not want to pass up on UofT, considering it is one of the top places in the world for CS. And I do enjoy neuroscience too. From what I've heard, PEY &gt; Rye IIP.

I'm only 23 years old, but I've been riding for about six years and I've put about 42k on my bike so far. I loved English in high school, did well in it, have had short stories published in contests, and would love to mix my interests in writing and riding. I don't and never have had a car; my bike is my main form of transportation. I ride rain or shine for as long as I can during the year, and would consider myself to be a fairly seasoned rider.

I approached the editor of a motorcycle magazine that I've been following for a few years at a show a couple of months ago. Their magazine -as with most motorcycle magazines- is completely male dominated, and I've been frustrated reading theirs for a while, specifically by the test ride articles.  Their test rider is a 6'2-ish, 200lb-ish guy, who never fails to take a crack at the [smaller bikes](http://i.imgur.com/EV3JWvY.png) but I feel like that means they completely miss out on the people those bikes are geared towards and gives a biased view to readers.

While my goal is to be a test rider for a major motorcycle magazine, the editor informed me that in his 20+ years in the business he's never seen a female test rider. Not a single one. As a result of this, I might be a hard sell in trying to get an internship with him, and so I'm looking for other things that I can bring to the job. I really need to prove to him that taking me on is a viable idea.

So, my questions for you ladies are: 
* would you be more interested in purchasing a magazine if it had a monthly column written by a fellow female rider?
* would you be more interested in the magazine if said female columnist focused on topics interesting to female cyclists?
*do you think my idea of having a sort of two pronged approach to test riding (the big guy and I each giving our thoughts on every bike reviewed) is a good one? 
* alternatively, do you think it would be more helpful if I offered to test the smaller (500cc and below) bikes?
and finally...
* what things would you be interested in seeing a female journalist focus on in a motorcycle magazine?

Any thoughts you have at all on this would be super helpful, and very much appreciated!"

My boyfriend and his family are in Kirkwood and live and die by Kirkwood. They are adamant I shouldn't live anywhere other than Kirkwood, Webster Groves, Glendale or Des Peres. 

And I would love to live close to them, you know moving to a city I don't really know anyone. Since I'm just one smallish girl living alone, I don't want the one person I can call in an emergency to have to hop on a highway and drive a half hour to get to me. Which is also why I'm not really intending to live downtown.

But...I'll be working downtown. Anything in the middle of the two (Dogtown, Maplewood, Rock Hill, Tower Grove, Central West End, etc.) my boyfriend believes to be unsafe for me to be by myself. A girl I know from the area lives in Dogtown and said she doesn't think these areas are unsafe.

When I declined the offer the CEO (small company) asked what my deciding factor was.To let her save face I told her that I couldn't accept her wages because I didn't want to tell her that I don't care for her company culture and the way she treated me during the interview process. Its not my place to tell her what kind of human being to be after all. She then emails me back ripping into me and how I barely deserve their offer and how they were taking a chance on me.

Nothing I can say from here on out will have any positive impact on the situation. 2) I'm actually a CS Minor with a Bachelor's degree in saxophone performance. The only reason I know $10 is too little is because my last internship paid me $20 to do web programming when I have never even written a single line of HTML/CSS/Javascript. They could take I just work hard and care I guess. Also, the average for our area is $16 so I knew I was getting undercut. Thanks again though guys.

I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get out of this but I just need to tell someone. This other person and I live in 2 different states, I'm in NY and he's in MI, we're both 24 years old guys. I've been best friends with him for 4-5 years, we met on playing a game on xbox live and it eventually lead to us talking and texting everyday where we would talk about basically everything in our lives, it was always fun and I always looked forward to talking to him. Now I’m a very shy and quiet person so I don’t really have any friends where I live so this summer I was going to move to Michigan if I could get an internship there to be near him and permanently move there after I had graduated from college this fall. So I did end up getting an internship and was planning to move there this week until today where he suddenly said he didn't want to talk to me anymore.

I guess I'll list some events so you can get a better understanding of the situation. 

Last summer he said that he was thinking about going to New Jersey to see a concert with his gf around New Years and since I was in much better financial standing than he was so I got both of them tickets to the concert so he would come to NJ.

In November I had free time so I went and visited him in Michigan but his gf had an attitude the entire weekend I was there and threw a fit one day because she thought she wouldn't be seeing him for the entire day even though she was going to be hanging out with us so I was stuck in a hotel room for 6 hours while he calmed her down but despite this it felt like we both had a good time and I ended up dismissing his gf's attitude as maybe she was having a bad couple of days.

Then when New Years was approaching my friend tells me that we wouldn't see each other when he came to NJ because his gf wasn't ok with us hanging out for reasons I still don't know. So it felt pretty obvious to me that his gf just hates me so I told my friend that I didn't want to pay for her ticket anymore because of her attitude she had when I visited in MI and saying she didn’t want me and my friend to hangout in NJ but we ending up arguing and he took it as I was trying to ruin his entire vacation and ended up buying new tickets to the concert even though I never said I cancelled the tickets I bought or got them refunded. So we weren't talking, they came and went and we didn't hangout or anything.

The week after they got back I went to Michigan again to try and talk to him to try and fix things. We met up for dinner and talked things out and he said he forgave me, we were friends again and still wanted me to move to Michigan. Between then and now we talked sporadically every couple of weeks but it definitely didn't feel the same to how we used to talk so I ended up asking every couple of times we talked if he still wanted me to move and he always said yes.

So a month ago I tell him I was able to get an internship in Michigan and I would be going there the week before Memorial Day to which he responded ok great that sounds cool. Then a week after I told him this he stops responding to any of my texts and phone calls up until this morning when he tells me that he doesn't want to talk to me anymore, that he doesn't forgive me for the NJ thing. He said he was trying to tell me this months ago but I still have all the texts and he didn't do any of that especially since every time I had asked if he still wanted me to move there he said yea. I tried pleading with him to just talk to me so we could figure this thing out but he didn't want to and now has blocked me on all social media sites. 

I just haven't been able to stop crying all of today, I'm just completely lost and I don't any idea what to do or think right now.

I am currently doing an internship in Indonesia, and for visum reasons need to leave the country every two months. I have been looking at things to do and found out about the Taman Negara national park in Malaysia. I am very much into photography and would love to do some kind of tour there.

I have been trying to find information online, but I have only been able to find one website offering a specific photography tour: http://tamannegarapahang.com/Wildlife-Photography-Tour.php
However, they have no prices or dates listed on their website, I sent them an email but have received no reply yet.
Because I would primarily be interested in taking photographs in the park, I don't want to go on a general tour, as people often get annoyed when somebody else takes a long time getting pictures (I do as well if I don't have my camera)

I was wondering if anybody could give me some pointers on going to the park, knows anybody who could organize such a tour or whether somebody here would be interested in doing a trip like this. I'd like to visit it around the 11th to the 15th of June, so a 3 or 4 night trip would be ideal.

Thanks in advance!"

**The Issues in a Nut Shell**

I've spent the evening catching up with leadership on everything that's gone on over the past 24 hours. And as I see it, there are 3 important issues to pay attention to. 1) Our Shifting Clan Reality, 2) Leadership and Communication, and 3) War Strategy. In this post I want to talk through 1 and 2. And tomorrow we'll put up a post about 3. 

**Our Shifting Clan Reality**

Omega had carved a very nice niche for ourselves as a clan of warring farmers who prioritized walls and heroes and upgraded so that our offense stayed ahead of our defense. And it meant war match ups were consistently in our favor and we pretty much steamrolled everyone we faced. But 2 things are happening concurrently that are making it much harder to continue to be that clan. The first is that we are rapidly increasing the amount of th10's in clan as people move up from th9 (yeah!) and Supercell has radically changed the match making algorithm which now values things like walls and heroes more strongly in its war strength evaluation. 

This is all well and good and nothing we can't roll with, but it means leadership has been immersed in pretty expansive ""what happens next for Omega"" conversations and there are a lot of really good, really creative, and really different ideas floating around in elder chat right now as we sort it out. 

When faced with the reality of a tough war opponent like we just did, it meant a lot of those baby ideas we are still fleshing out in terms of war expectations and war strategies were pressed into service before we as leadership had all gotten on the same page. 

And that is on me. 

It's been a crazy time for me personally with finals and then moving for my internship, but it's my job as the clan leader to take all of the awesome ideas and awesome talent we have flowing through our elders and members and forge it into a coherent whole that kicks butt, takes names, and has a ball doing it. But I've only had enough energy for maintanence mode. I apologize. 

The incredible thing to me is that even though we've just walked through a tough two day stretch full of drama, disagreement, and a couple of tough boots, elder chat is still honest, positive, and working hard on solutions and next steps. 

Let me reiterate what has been said repeatedly so far. We know we aren't perfect as omega leadership, and there are things that went differently than we wished. But in the end good decisions were made, heroic warriors brought in the tie, and we have a clan shot-through with really cool people. 

**Leadership and Communication**

In my opinion, at the root of a lot of the problems we've been facing this weekend come from a breakdown of communication and confusion on how to relate to leadership. 

War in Clash, just like organized sports, requires coordination. Each of us doing what is best for all of us is what makes us a powerful force. But that means someone gets to make the plan and someone has to follow the plan. We try to be really upfront about the values and the process that goes into making plans and include the whole clan in that, but in specific instances when the pressure of the clock is ticking down decision need to be made and then we all need to jump on board. As someone famous once said, ""making no decision is always making the wrong decision."" 

I often joke with leadership about ""putting my leader pants on"" which Drago always responds to with concern that I maybe wasn't wearing pants to begin with. The general idea is that my usual mode of operating is one of teamwork and shared decision making, but sometimes it's needed for me to take charge of the situation and make the hard decision. 

As I read the situation today, leadership ""put on their leader pants on"" and started making some hard decisions, and some members responded by challenging those hard decisions. 

There is nothing wrong with disagreeing with leadership. But within the context of a current war, especially one that is difficult, the right answer is to go all in on the war plan and then to work outside the context of that particular war to give feedback and to work on making our plan development and plan execution better. 

And if you feel a leader or an elder is wrong or out of line it is absolutely vital that you respect them enough to not call them out publicly, especially when emotions are already running high. Group Me's personal messages and the leadership structure are there so that we can responsibly hold each other accountable. Use them that way. 

The other part of this that is really clear now is that leadership needs some better ways to ""put on their leader pants"" in terms of making a strategic plan for each war so it's not surprising or confusing when it happens. But that will be our issue for tomorrow. 

**Last Thoughts**

I really want to end this post with a super-positive, rah-rah kind of ending. Because all of that is true and I more convinced of it now than I was yesterday. In the perceptive and inspiring words of the Mango. ""Omega is awesome...But let's be awesomer.""  

But for some reason it feels to me like a more reflective and serious ending is the place I need to go. We are in a unique place as a clan. We have a history and a present reality of being an incredible place to clash. But our future is in flux right now as we settle into this new reality of a clan with substantially more TH10s and a new match maker that by all indications is going to send us harder war matches more frequently. 

And that means that these next few weeks are going to be different. And we will need to share our strengths and ideas and laughter more urgently than usual. And we will need to war more thoughtfully and more proficiently than usual. And we will need to be more forgiving with one another than usual. 

Which is not a bad place to be.

36ch37,0,2015-05-18,"25/M Electronics engineer needs help with planning immediate future. Living abroad, no debts, no job, 3.2k savings.",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/36ch37/25m_electronics_engineer_needs_help_with_planning/,"Any advice or any help to clear my mind will be highly appreciated. Thank you all.  
  
 &amp;nbsp;
  
Here's my story:  
I have a bachelor's degree in electronics engineering from an university in Turkey. After I graduated I worked as hardware engineer (doing pcb design) for ~6 months. Then I moved to Australia (with 18 months working visa). I had almost no money when I moved here and started to live at my uncle's place (no rent, no house expenses for me) I was expecting to find engineering job in around 4 months and move on with my life. But it didn't work out that way. (Apparently I need something more than what I have, maybe some experience in Aus or maybe more in demand skills). After 4 months I started to work at casual jobs (my earnings were only enough to make some small shopping and few beers). Finally I got a 1,5 month full time job as a labour in construction site. Now the construction is finished and I need to take some steps.  

  &amp;nbsp;

What I have:  
I saved $3.2k. I also have $1k for emergency.
If things doesn't go right I have my family to finance me for my return tickets and few months' expenses in Turkey.  
If necessary I can borrow $2k from family.
Washington accord Electronics Engineering degree. It's been 1 year (7 months in Aus + 5 months in Turkey) without doing anything related to engineering. I feel kinda rusty (but I believe I'm still competent enough to do entry level pcb design, c programming and fpga work).  
I don't have any useful work experience in any other field (maybe working 2 months in electronics retail store)  
Decent english.   
No debt. No car.  

  &amp;nbsp;

My aim is:  
My visa will end in 9 months and I want to stay in this beautiful country. I need around $5.5k in 6 months time for my permanent residency applications and other necessary paperwork (application and paperworks will probably take 3 months)  
And of course I need something (job or money) to survive after the applications made.  

  &amp;nbsp;

Problems:  
I can't live with my uncle anymore (personal issues) I can manage maybe another 4-5 weeks max. So I need to move asap.  
Even if I stay here for another 5 weeks my productivity will be minimal (Even writing a application letter here is a pain for me).  

  &amp;nbsp;

I consider these:  
1(not really): Taking all the money and traveling for a while.   

  &amp;nbsp;

2: Rent a room in somewhere central (~250$ per week) look for minimum salary jobs in cafes bars etc. (~15$/h) wish for enough hours to work and save money.  

  &amp;nbsp;

3: Rent a room in somewhere cheaper (~170$ per week). Study full time via online courses (java, c# or any other profession related courses on demand) while searching for related job until money runs out. (Bonus: I have a network in Turkey and if I go back, I can find a job there right away if I learn Java or C#)  

  &amp;nbsp;

4: Wait and look for internships until I get one. Rent a room somewhere cheap (170$ pw + 40$ max travel costs) and hope to find a job after internship ends.  

  &amp;nbsp;

-If any of those plans fails I'll just head back to Turkey and cry for a while.  
-Besides rent I'll need 150$ max per week for shopping etc.  
-currency is australian dollars  

  &amp;nbsp;

Final Words:  
I'm sorry if I ever sounded like complaining or having hard time. I think my attempt to move to Australia was badly planned. So now I'm trying to fix it as much as I can =)

36cqtv,11,2015-05-18,"My life fell apart. I'm getting better, but it's taking a really long time and it's hard without very many people I can talk to.",hitoribotchi,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/36cqtv/my_life_fell_apart_im_getting_better_but_its/,"It was about three years ago now when we first saw the symptoms. Well, she saw them first, as she told me later, but it didn't really bother her. I didn't notice until one night, when she said we needed to go out because she had something to tell me. We got to the bar and she told me, eyes wide, more excited than I'd seen her in a long time, that she had seen the most amazing house that day and that she wanted to buy it because it was perfect.

We weren't looking for a house at the time. In fact, we hadn't even been thinking about buying a house, at all. I was planning on quitting my job and going back to school in a year or so, and I didn't know where we'd end up after that. It was actually a pretty terrible time for us to buy a house and settle down, but she was impervious to logic and just kept saying how she believed so firmly and so wholeheartedly that it was something we needed to do.

It took me a couple of weeks of research and spreadsheets and testimonials from friends before she reluctantly agreed to put the idea on hold. But from that point on, her behavior got more erratic. She started to get *really* excited about very small things, and *really* angry about other small things. It was like the gain had been turned up on her emotions. One night, she decided she wasn't tired and couldn't sleep, and so she stayed up all night. I was surprised when I walked into the living room and saw her productive, happy, and not the slightest bit tired. She didn't go to sleep the next night, either. Or maybe she slept about an hour and then woke up, refreshed, and got back to work. This sleep schedule continued, and she said she felt fine and refused my entreatments for her to go see a doctor. I didn't know what was happening, and I was starting to get very worried. It felt like a hard, heavy stone in my stomach that lasted all day, every day.

She had some ideas that she wanted to write down, and she'd started filling up a notebook with them. She was very meticulous when writing, and wrote each sentence in a different color. She had decided, very suddenly, that she wanted to quit her job and go back to grad school and get a PhD, and the next day she went to the local university and met all of the faculty in the department she wanted to apply to. She was more driven than I'd ever seen her, but she was getting increasingly hard to talk to, and the things she said made less and less sense. In the 10+ years that we'd been together, I'd never ever seen her like this. There were many painful and strange incidents that are now burned indelibly into my memory. One of the ones that I flash back to more than others is her standing in the middle of a grocery at 1AM yelling at me, furious about my reaction to some iced tea that she'd found, and yelling to everyone else that she wasn't crazy and that I was just judging her. We were supposed to go home around 10 that night, but she refused to go home until 2 or so, desperate to explore for reasons that she didn't explain.

I looked up hotlines for people having mental breakdowns and crises, and called one of them and described what was going on and how I just couldn't take it and didn't know what to do. While I was on the phone, she came up and asked who I was talking to, and took the phone from me. She asked the woman, sincerely, if she was her boss at work. There was a timbre in her voice that I'd never heard before, like a mixture of mocking and all-out confusion. I still feel terrible remembering that way of speaking (and I wish that was the last time I'd had to hear it).

When she handed the phone back to me, the person on the other end told me in no uncertain terms that my wife was having a full-on psychotic break and that I had to get her to a hospital as soon as possible, and then hung up. I told her that we needed to go to the hospital and she *ran* away. Just ran and ran. I chased her, worried for her, as I called 911. As she ran she yelled at people and stopped and put a girl in a headlock and kept running and running. By the time the paramedics got there, nearly everyone on the busy street we were on had seen this and there was quite a bit of attention on us. She was singing to herself and asking nonsensical questions to the paramedics and was 100% in a world of her own. She got a little violent when they asked her to calm down and talk to them. I can still see her handcuffed to the railing as the police and paramedics interviewed her, convinced that she was on some insane drug trip. They kept asking me what drugs she'd had, and no one believed me when I told them she'd had none at all.

I followed them to the hospital. She was sedated and strapped down and they were testing her for many things. She was dehydrated and in quite a bad physical state, but they found no drugs. I knew they wouldn't. They told me that she'd need to talk to a psychiatrist, but it was pretty unmistakably a psychotic break caused by bipolar disorder. (This didn't come as a total surprise to me, as I'd already started to google her symptoms as things were getting worse, even though she wouldn't let me take her to the doctor.)

The next day I picked her up from the hospital. She was groggy and mad, and barely wanted to talk to me out of anger for having called 911. She saw me as the reason she'd gone to the hospital--not the paramedics or the police who thought she was a danger to herself in the state she was in, but me, who ""just couldn't deal"" with how she was.

Over the next few days, she got worse. I'll summarize a bit, but it played out kind of like you might think it would, it you were a total pessimist. She refused to see a psychiatrist and started to look into naturopathic medicine. She got even worse, mentally, than she'd been before. I talked to the mental health people in the county government and they came to evaluate her. She was really, really badly off. They decided to commit her to a hospital for a week, and then, for a month. She hated it--absolutely hated it--and I felt terrible. She was finally on medication now, and showed noticeable improvement in the first week or so, but little to no improvement for the next few weeks after that.

I visited her every day in the hospital, but it took a lot longer than her hospital stay for her anger to subside. I can still remember the long drive to the mental hospital. I listened to public radio on the way over, to try to calm my nerves. (I still mentally associate All Things Considered with seeing her at her worst.) I got to the hospital and it was cold inside, which matched how I felt inside myself, too. I waited until visiting hours started and filed in with a group of other concerned family members, all of them looking impossibly sad--and for some of them, noticeably embarrassed to be there. I still remember the ""elopement risk"" warnings on the door as I walked in. Usually the risk was ""low,"" but sometimes it was ""high."" I wondered what it was that caused them to change it.

Eventually, she left the hospital. She wasn't fully better yet, but she was a little better, I guess. She'd been unable to do her job in the hospital, and I actually had to go on her behalf and coordinate with her coworkers to make sure her work was taken care of. She hated me for that, even though I did so much work to try to help her. Her coworkers were more understanding than I thought they'd be.

Over the next few months she improved noticeably until nothing was wrong anymore. She was back to herself. She saw a psychiatrist regularly and was on medication and there was a little bit of hope inside me that we wouldn't ever have to deal with this again. Our marriage was noticeably shaken, but I thought that maybe, if we both tried really hard, we could get it back to as good as it originally was, or close.

About a year and a half later, I quit my job to go back to school to pursue my dreams. It was a really scary time for both of us, but we had some savings and we were determined to make it work. I couldn't believe how supportive she was. It was scary, but it was a leap we were making together.

I remember that it was about a month later, the day after her birthday, when the symptoms started again. She was in a great mood. Her being in a great mood wasn't unusual, but I could hear something unusual, and familiar, in her voice. The timbre of her voice had changed again. I felt it in my stomach before I thought about it consciously... she was manic again. I knew immediately and started feeling sick. I may have vomited in the first 10 minutes after realizing that it was happening again; I don't remember. I do remember calling her doctor on the phone and frantically trying to get him to prescribe her more medication to bring her down before she went all the way up. He agreed to come and take a look, but she refused to take all of the medication he prescribed as it made her too sleepy. She started not sleeping again, and this time, things escalated really, really quickly.

It was about a week before she was in the hospital again. I wasn't even involved this time; she'd tried to get into a sports game without paying (it made sense to her; she wasn't trying to not pay, but was simply going in to look for a friend she thought might be there). A cop picked her up and was concerned for her mentally, so he took her to the hospital where they kept her for observation. She left the next day, but before another week had passed she was back in the hospital. When she got back out, she was angry, violent, furious. She took my keys from me and screamed at me to leave and bit my hand when I tried to get them back. I left, defeated, and called a good friend.

I stayed at his house for weeks. In the meantime, she called me to curse at me and occasionally came over to yell at me or drop off strange items that she thought I needed. One night she called me and told me she'd slept with someone else... the first time she'd actually slept with someone else other than me in her entire life. I was punched in the gut. I asked her how she could do something like that, and she yelled at me that I was in no place to judge her and hung up on me. (For the record, she was and still is the only person I've ever slept with.)

I sank deeper into depression. It was a hole. A huge hole. Deeper and deeper and the outside world went away and I was just sad and I slept. I considered suicide but also just didn't have the energy to think about anything besides how much I hated everything that was happening. I was scared and lost, and I found myself trying to wake myself up, over and over again. ""Wake up! Wake up! This is all a dream, wake up!"" I didn't believe it, but I wanted to believe it, so badly. If only I could just wake up from the nightmare that was happening and go back to our life together.

She continued to stay with this guy, and called me to tell me about him. She was living with him... he was living at *our* apartment. My friends gave me a lot of support, and I reached out as much as I could bring myself to do. But honestly, I didn't and couldn't reach out as much as I needed.

One night I asked if I could come get my stuff out of the apartment. I was going to move into a new apartment, on my own. Things weren't getting any better with her, and I was wearing out my welcome with my friend, so I didn't have much choice. I went with a couple of friends, for emotional support... and also, because I was scared. When I got there she was wild. Manic. Yelling and screaming at us and screaming at me and that son of a bitch was there and I wanted to hurt him so badly but I've never been a violent person and anyway I was too preoccupied with her. Things escalated and she attacked my friend and me as we were trying to get inside to claim some of my stuff and we backed off but my other friend called the cops. They came and she was out of control and violent. They arrested her and she went to jail, for the first time in her life.

Days later, the county decided to commit her and she went to the hospital for a month. I visited her a couple of times there, but she told me she hated me and didn't want me visiting her anymore. She asked me to stop coming, and I acquiesced. The times when I did come, she spent most of the time talking about her new boyfriend or yelling at me until the staff had to tell her to calm down.

This whole time, I was a new grad student at a new school with new people and I was struggling to hold things together academically. It was hard and I felt like a total loser as my grades and self-esteem dropped. Luckily, I talked to some support staff at the university and they set me up with a therapist, and I had understanding advisors who helped me to not fail my classes. I'm still so thankful to them for what they did. I wasn't out of my bad place, but at least I wasn't in a worse place.

That was a year ago. Since then I've done better in school and gotten some amazing internships. Everyone says I should be happy about the success that inevitably awaits me, but I just feel like shit, and alone. Almost none of my new friends know about this. I haven't even told the vast majority of my friends at school that I'm married. I kept this all from them and only told my close friends from before. This isolated me emotionally from a lot of the people I see on a daily basis, but it also kept me from having to talk about it when I didn't want to... and from feeling pitied by others. And yet I feel sad to have isolated myself as much as I have and to have shown a fake mask to most of the people I know.

She's been out of the hospital for a little over a year now. She only stopped dating that son of a bitch a couple of months ago, after the relationship became too acidic for her to deal with. She kicked him out and told me she wanted to be back with me. I can tell she's sincerely sorry and knows she's fucked up terribly. And I still love her immeasurably despite everything that's happened. I know that she's been through a lot of pain as well... many of the things that she did that hurt me are classic symptoms of bipolar disorder and I can't put all of the blame on her--it just wouldn't be right to and I feel so terrible for her having to go through all of this. But over a year of knowing that she was with him has hurt me more than I can adequately put into words. That entire time I just felt a dull scraping against my heart, like my emotions were gradually eroding, or at least hardening, until I couldn't feel anything anymore. By the time she was away from him, it was too late... I'd given up. I don't think I've moved on, but I did give up.

I filed for divorce about a month ago. My friends--the few who know--are supportive and say that I made the right choice. But I just made the choice that seemed slightly less bad of two choices that both seemed really terrible. I loved her more than anything in my life. We both thought we'd be together forever and so much of our relationship was pure magic. So many amazing beautiful memories and things that happened between us that seemed like we were destined to be together. All of that is behind me now, and turning away from that brilliant, shining light, I'm blinded to anything that might be ahead of me. I'm just hoping that somehow I can recover from this and find myself again, because the way it feels right now, it seems like I left whoever I was behind.

Anyway, if you've read all of this, or any of this, thank you. I've never really typed this story up before and I'm kind of surprised that I was able to without freaking out from flashbacks (which still happens to me occasionally). I'm in a better position now than I was a year ago, and I haven't seriously thought of suicide in a while. I meet with my therapist regularly and I'm on antidepressants. It's just... I know people say ""healing takes time,"" but I never thought that the wounds of my memories could feel so fresh even after over a year has passed.

36d1a8,2,2015-05-18,Massively improved my acne issues with sun screan and supplements,Lorikcana,acne,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/36d1a8/massively_improved_my_acne_issues_with_sun_screan/,"I'll give some background first. Growing up (in Africa and Europe) as a teenager I had very bad acne, and especially my skin would scar very easily. I used to pick a lot on my spots and I would sometimes go with several weeks with some huge scars on my face.. this was very hard to deal with. 

Anyways I finally stopped touching my spots at around 18. I was living in Europe at this time. From then on my spots became much better, except for some periods when they would come out. Since Im 21 I have had very few spots and I finally feel good not having to wake up in the morning with the first thing on my mind is seeing how messed up my face is. 

Anyways.. I finished university in the UK and went back to Africa 6 months ago. After a few months back, I started having terrible skin, the worse skin I had had since I was a teenager. I would have spots every day, often big ones that are painful. This was hard for me as I was working as an intern, I felt like a little teenager showing up for work with loads of spots on my face.. I was unable to find the cause of my spots despite using the same treatment I was using when I was living in Europe (Avene)

For Easter holidays I went to France. I wanted to buy some accutane, however I wasnt able to get a prescription in time. I spoke to a pharmacist and she gave me 2 advices. 

1. **SUNSCREAN**

2. **VITAMIN A AND ZINC SUPPLEMENTS**

I think the sunscrean was the main difference. My skin is very sensitive, probably why  it used to scar so easily. So the sun in Africa must have increased my tendancy for acne. So I recommend everyone living in hot climates such as South USA or Australia. USE SUNSCREEN. My face has been much better since I use a strong sunscrean everyday and try to limit my exposure to the sun. 

I also reccomend supplements. Some people are hesitant of taking strong pills that have side effect, there are supplements on the market that are made of natural products with 0 side effects. Try to find one that is right for you. My treatment was 40 euros for 3 months. I take 2 pills a day. And with the sunscrean I have seen a huge difference on my face. 

I hope my advice can help. "

I want to relocate to England from eastern Europe (please don't hate me) and I found out that it is extremely hard to get to the first interview because of lack of degree ;(


I actually finished 2,5 years of University where i learned a lot about programming but then quit due to economic situation and started full time job (not software development but related). Recently I finished my 6-months developer internship (really good one, where i was developing popular web application, bug fixing, supporting etc.).


Because my country is not a nicest place to live I don't want to start a new job here. Unfortunately it seems that person like me have no chance to get a job in UK. I would get over it if not the fact that I'm not even invited for interviews so I can't really show what I can do. I'm rejected right away.


Is there anything I can do to improve my chances?"
36dd88,3,2015-05-18,My girlfriend [23 F] of 6 months broke up with me [24 M] a day ago. Her reasoning is confusing to me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36dd88/my_girlfriend_23_f_of_6_months_broke_up_with_me/,"Met my girlfriend at college back in August. We immediately became fixated on each other and were pretty much always together unless we were in class. She lived less than a minute from me, and we spent pretty much every night together. We always had fun, laughed a ton, shared all the same hobbies, and we were always able to talk out any disagreements in a civil manner. It was like a dream come true.


She graduated in December and moved to a city an hour away to start her job. I graduate this December, and I plan to work in the same city. We agreed to stay together. I ended up getting an internship in the same city, so I drove to the city a couple days a week. We ended up seeing each other almost as much as we did in the fall. If we weren't together, we were either on the phone or texting. Things were good for a while, but her new life began to take a toll on her. She was working crazy hours, and she was miserable to her job. She became easily irritable and increasingly moody. I would always try to plan fun activities and dates, but she would just want to stay in and do nothing. We got into this routine of get home from work, cook dinner, watch netflix, go to bed. She tells me that she feels lonely and that she has lost all her friends. Still, we generally got along just as well, laughed plenty, and told each other regularly how much we loved each other. We both agree that we need to work on our codependency and make time for our friends to make our relationship healthier.


Recently, her ex contacted her saying he made a mistake dumping her and he wants to meet up to discuss things. This girl has been nothing but loyal to me, and she informed me of all this without trying to hide anything. When we initially met, she still wasn't over him, but she told me eventually that she was truly over him and very much in love with me. This is why it was strange to me to see her so bothered by him reaching out to her. I told her if she thinks maybe she isn't actually over him and doesn't wanna be with me to make her choice. She said she wants to be with me and that she'd meet with him to tell him they can't be friends. I agree to give her some space for a week.


Of course, that space doesn't last, and we still end up communicating all day like we always do. Still, we saw each other only a few times and both hung out with our friends plenty. Two days ago we spend a whole day together and before she heads back home we talk about where our relationship is headed. Her family loves me, and she was even taking me on a 13 hour road trip with her family to meet her extended family this weekend. She tells me she loves me but is afraid we aren't meant to be together. She wants to experience being alone for a bit to figure out why she has changed and become different than she was in the fall. I tell her I'm not getting out of the car unless she can look me in the eyes and tell me she doesn't love me. She cries and bawls her eyes out, and then she says it. 


That same night we see each other out at the bars. We end up going home together. The next day we spend all day together talking. She says she still loves me and she only said she didn't in the car because she couldn't handle the situation anymore and needed a way out. She stands by staying broken up and saying she needs time to be alone and figure herself out alone. This is all confusing to me, because while she has changed, we still have such a great relationship and both agree we are happy together. She keeps assuring me she still loves me.


I was initially worried about the ex, but I know for sure he isn't the problem here. Him popping up just added more stress to the way she's already been feeling. I think she is feeling overwhelmed with so much coming from all directions. I also know that she's not wanting a break just to go see other guys. She just isn't that type of person. I just worry why she has this fear of us not being meant for each other when we are clearly so happy together. We both talked about and know what it's going to take to make our relationship healthier. We both want this to work out and end up back together. I'm devastated, but I know life must go on and I will still go about it just as I always did. I won't just sit around and be miserable, I still have my responsibilities. I will not contact her during this time so she can actually clear her head. Is there hope? When I see her again, do any of you think we can have a fresh start of sorts and be together?




   
**tl;dr**
Meet girl at college in August.
Together 24/7.
She graduates and moves to city an hour away.
Still see each other all the time.
Girl hates job, feels lonely and friendless, becomes increasingly moody and irritable.

36ddv3,8,2015-05-18,College Advice thread,Xcoder62,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/36ddv3/college_advice_thread/,"Hey guys!

I recently got admitted to UMASS Amherst and will be studying computer engineering there for my undergrad.

As of now I'm taking some placement tests, signing up for my residential academic program (living with people who are also studying engineering). 

However I was wondering if you guys had any advice for me during my freshmen year of college?

So far I've gotten a few from fellow peers

**Academics**

*Make a formula/concepts sheet on a separate sheet of paper and use this to do the homework. Never read the entire chapter as some authors like to listen to themselves talk.

*for non technical-classes, write down notes and rewrite notes after class.

*Go to your professor's office hours, Ask questions and show good work ethic. If you show the professor that you're interested in what he's teaching, he'll know you on a first name basis and you could possibly get ask for a recommendation at the end of the semester (don't wait until senior year 2 ask for recommendations.)

**Social**

*Attend at 2 two clubs/fraternities/organizations in college and be committed to them.

*On being a friendly individual, Be open to people but don't feel the need to become their friends, desperation tends to create behaviors and attitudes that are not very desirable to be around.

**Major Recommendations**

*Study AI 

*Study Mircoprocessing

**Interships**

*Apply for a work-study position this summer so you can have one during your freshmen year.

*Your professor/organziation  may increase your chances on scoring an intership. Start looking during the fall of your sophomore year.

*post-graduation, your internship contacts will be your best bet for finding a job afterwards. Keep them close and when the time comes ask if they have anything your working towards.

Prehaps I am over-thinking this freshmen year thing, but I think it's better to be prepared than sorry. Let me know what you guys think!"

Interned last summer with a small-mid sized software company with around 150 people, 7 years. The whole time was devoted to a django financial app, developed entirely by the other intern and me. Very positive experience, performance and relationships were developed. 

**Problem:** Since I've left they have hired an on-board technical recruiter and an official apprenticeship program (3-6 months) which sounds nearly identical to my past experience working with them, except I'll be paired with another developer instead of intern. I'm interviewing with them in a few days and am expecting an offer of $20-25 an hour (medium cost of living) because it's an ""apprenticeship"".  

**Current Situation:** In the meantime, I have been applying to many different data scientist, economist, and software engineering roles that my high level math background qualifies me for. I'm also fortunate to have both parents highly successful executives which has allowed me to send my CV and resume directly to the right hands of several companies and CEO's. Responses so far have been quick and more than encouraging. 

**Questions:** My current plan is to take the interview as normal but defer a decision for whatever time we determine reasonable. However it's unlikely I will take the offer at all, instead just buying time to come back with other concrete offers and make the case that I want either a job or to be compensated competitively. 

1. Is this a reasonable course of action? Am I burning bridges by asking for a job after the fact?

2. How much time should I expect to defer a decision?

2. Would I be limiting my future opportunities/networking by moving to a northern big, but not tech focused city instead of say Boston, Chicago or Los Angeles?

3. Mainly looking for an outside opinion on reasonable expectations here. I can provide my CV/resume if necessary."

36dr59,2,2015-05-18,Getting gigs through emails,[deleted],DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/36dr59/getting_gigs_through_emails/,"Hey guys, I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about how to get gigs and the answer is always the same: **network**. I agree that is hands down the best way to do it, but I also want to point out that you shouldn't completely disregard sending out cold emails, especially if you've been gigless for while and hungry for a live set. While the odds may be against you, in the end it's still a numbers game and it's better than nothing. Personally, I've had a pretty lucky experience with getting gigs through emails and I'd like to share a bit of that. 


I've approached it in 2 ways:

1.) Finding posts from parties/clubs that need DJs (from craigslist, etc)

Craigslist is not reliable at all for finding gigs, but I still take a look at it once in a while because you never know. Think about it this way, if someone has no DJ contacts at all and are desperate enough to post on craigslist, then your chances of landing it are a lot higher right?

Now obviously craigslist posts can be sketchy, but use your judgement and don't just take anything that's offered. **Make sure it's a gig that you actually want to do** and that you can play your music at. For example I see a lot of wedding and grad party posts around this time, but I could never do a wedding. I don't have enough ""wedding music"" to please a bride and groom. I could, however, do a grad party depending on what age most of the kids there would be, etc. By only sending emails to gigs you could actually see yourself playing, then you're saving yourself from sending out a bunch of useless copy+pasted email templates.

One of the first paid gigs I ever did was for a traveling paint party production. They went city to city looking to use local DJs as openers. At the time, I was in Charlotte doing an internship for the summer. Even though I wasn't a resident in the area, I still sent them an email saying what kind of music I play, what kind of experience I had, etc. I was still using a mixtrack pro at that point and had only done frat parties. Lo and behold, they happened to be struggling finding DJs in that specific area and gave me the 9-10 slot. Being my first ""on stage"" gig, I was very nervous about everything. I practiced hours and hours every day and I even made posts on /r/beatmatch like ""Will a mixtrack pro sound shitty in a club enviornment?"" The payment was 5 dollars for every presale ticket you sold (not the best, I know). And being out of state for an internship, I literally didn't know anyone other than the people at work. So I started by promoting the event to other interns at the office, and then I went out to other clubs and promoted it to clubgoers. I ended up selling about 20 tix and got 100 bucks which was not too bad. During the show, the turnout from 9-10 was god awful, there was maybe 25 people max and most of them were at the bar instead of the dance floor. My meticulously planned ""opening set"" was making me feel trapped because it just didn't fit the vibe. That's when I decided to take a leap of faith and go back to open format mixing like I do at frat parties. Even though I make a lot more mistakes, the overall vibe was much better. The other DJs and producers noticed too. They were very friendly, complimented my set, and didn't bash on me for playing with a mixtrack pro at all. I told the producer they should come up to my home state some time in the future and they ended up touring there and asked me to DJ again, this time the 12-1 slot. 


2.) The second way I've gotten gigs from emails is reaching out to local clubs that you like/go to.
If you're going to send a cold email to a local club asking to be their DJ, the least you could do is actually visit the club first and see for yourself if you like it/if it's a good fit for you! I'm a bar/party guy myself, so I already knew the clubs and bars very well around my area. One day at a club on Tuesday and noticed that the DJ kept changing up the bpm and genre way to frequently for comfort. You could see the dancefloor evacuating after some of the songs he dropped. Then and there, I started asking bartenders and servers if they knew who I should talk to about potentially becoming a DJ there. They all said the general manager but he was no where in sight that night. The next day, I found that club's email online and sent a message saying how I was a local DJ, loved the atmosphere at the club, felt like I could contribute to the vibe and create a better environment for the guests. I also talked about some personal details like how I usually do frat parties, but now that I'm older, I wanted to expand my horizons, etc. And a little while later he sent an email back to me saying how they've actually been looking at replacing their Tuesday DJ and how they'd be interested in giving me a shot. Been a resident there for 4 months now, doing not only Tuesdays but also Saturdays now.


I think they key part about sending out emails is to make sure it's tailored for that specific club/event. Make it genuine. In the end, emails will only get you so far. Networking is still the most important. For example, I asked the bartenders in person who I should talk to if I was interested in DJing. Even though we couldn't find the manager, maybe in the morning, they mentioned to him that a guy was asking about DJing last night. That coupled with my email might've done the trick. Always be prepared to answer ""why should I hire you over that guy?"" and put it on the email. Tell them that you are willing to work slow nights, tell them that you are younger and have a better idea of what music young people like, tell them that you believe the vibe you bring complements what they are going for and that you're fresh take can help the club grow rather than stay stagnant. 

Hope this big block of text helps, feel free to shoot me any questions you might have too!

Tl;dr

Getting gigs through email isn't hopeless, tailor your emails to the specific club/event.

From what I've heard, many of the-tech-for-sale sites are dangerous minefields of scams and hackers, so I thought the best course of action would be to ask people more experienced than I."
36dvrd,8,2015-05-18,Unpaid internship,xenongamer4351,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/36dvrd/unpaid_internship/,"Hi guys,
So after a bunch of interviews the only offer I've landed to intern this summer is an unpaid one. It's not a CPA firm and it's not a prestigious company either.
I'm indifferent as to whether or not I should take it, so I'll list some factors I've compiled and hopefully you guys can help me out.

Pros:
It's experience versus doing something not accounting related this summer.
It's close to where I live so I won't be losing money getting to the office.
It's only 20 hours a week so I will work a second job to at least have some form of income.
It actually sounds like I'll be doing real accounting work vs say photocopying stuff, 

Cons:
Name isn't recognizable, and glass door has mixed reviews, so I'm not sure how great it would even look on my resume
I can't tell if it'll be more of an exploitation experience than a learning experience
I'm honestly not positive if I will get credit for it from my school (I realize I need to figure this part out, but at the moment I have not hence listing it here)

I really don't care about the money part of it since technically they will be giving me money for expenses, which sounds like it won't be that high anyway, and I think I can deal with being exploited if it ends up being more of that as long as the exploitation actually boosts my resume.

Anyone have any thoughts?
Thanks"

Was happy, but they gave me a job as someone who uses Jcl (or does something with it) , something I have never used before. They have tried explaining what to do, but it is literally learning a new language. Is there anywhere I could go to help save me?  Any tutorials or advice? Am I doomed?"
36dyjt,2,2015-05-18,Caution: Road Map On Fire,dogg724,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/36dyjt/caution_road_map_on_fire/,"Let’s see if I can bring down the mood.

I want everyone graduating to pay close attention. I’m extremely intrigued by your prospective futures, and if you could do one thing, it is to focus in on how you feel and think as the years pile on quicker than you thought they would. I’m asking this because of how many “old people” I hate. I’m asking so that maybe I can do two things; either figure out why so many clichés exist about life, “I gave up on trying to save the world,” “it’ll be over before you know it,” “that’s just how such and such works” and/or devise what it takes to escape those clichés.

You see, fundamentally, I’m worried. I’m bugged that you’ll end up saying things like the rest of society or feeling as lonely or complacent as the millions of match.com members. I lucked out in my cynicism and hated college and what it stood for two weeks in. This whole “real world” thing has had too much of my commentary and scorn, so graduation for me was just another day. I already expected the worst and low and behold, it can get even worse than my approximations. I think you’re all generally more optimistic about life than I am, and if you go from higher than where I get, to as low as I can go, that’s unsettling.

But, thus is my theory for many if not most dispositions. “I tried, I thought, I hoped, I prayed, I changed, and then it all went to shit.” After a while it’s really easy to want to find a rut. The idea of “settling down” is appealing, not for its truth about your nature, but for the prospect of even the semblance of stability. Or maybe it’s in climbing the ranks of a job; I’m all for loving what you do, I think it’s very easy to forget all the other things you love to do and sometimes easy to start hating what you love to do without even realizing it till things get hairy.

Now, you’re my friends because overwhelmingly you don’t tend to act or think like how I conceive of most people. BUT, you are not immune. I certainly wasn’t and I realize how hard you have to work and how deliberate you have to think in order to avoid “life as we know it” or “life as it is” and keep with “life that I want.” And at least for me, it’s what I hope for you, it just takes so much more time and practice than I think we as a society are even used to. We certainly don’t teach it in school and it’s not what we’re celebrating at commencements.

I know regardless of how things turn out, you’ll survive. It’s hopefully about more than merely surviving and that’s what I wish to keep working at. If/when the world our actual old people created goes to shit or has set us up to live a quarter of the American Dream as it was sold, I’m all for trying to work on something different. Be it a different kind of network or family or work structure or modes of thought or whatever to escape the “comfortable” ruts people find themselves in avoiding having to think about things too much.

Alone, you may be just another college kid with loans, maybe living back home, or maybe starting a job in your field, yet practically an intern to all the scared broke people who’ve been doing it 10 or 20 years longer than you. Just don’t become a slave to that paradigm. And if you start to feel trapped or isolated or bored, I hope you start to think about what can be done together. I see people screwing things up because they feel empty. They lost their ability to decide for themselves. They lost what it means to care. They’ve settled. Please don’t get comfortable. Don’t allow their excuses to become yours. Please don’t squeeze a pebble’s size of happiness for all it’s worth because a bigger rock is too heavy or you’re too tired. This is too important a stage in your life to let it get stolen."

I got offered an internship at a company two hours from where I currently live. The internship has the potential to turn in to a full-time job. They're willing to pay for my transportation, but everything else is unpaid. 

However, the logistics of it make it hard. I would have to buy a computer (I currently use my gf's computer at home) and I would have to take the bus there and back. Luckily I could live with my dad during the internship, so rent would be free. 

The company is a very small marketing company, and they're looking for a full-time copywriter. I've been on the job hunt for about a month now, and this is my first real offer-ish type opportunity. I've interviewed with around 6 to 10 other companies, all of which haven't gotten back to me or declined me. 

I don't want to miss out on an opportunity, but I also don't want to be set back for a position that could potentially lead to yet another ""no."" 

What would be the best course of action, r/advice?"

* I was in an abusive relationship for about 2 years, the relationship itself latest 5 years, but didn't become abusive until the last two. During that time he stole money from me, verbally assaulted me, made me feel like I was a crazy person (gaslighting), made me feel like everything was my fault. He would physically get rough with me (grabbing, shoving, pushing me), he was an alcoholic as well so he would even throw empty beer bottles at me. He sexually abused me, he would walk in on me taking a shower to look at me, or he would grab me sexually and wouldn't stop when I said no. He would force  sex on me when we were in bed together, I'd try to say no, pretend to be asleep or not move but he would continue. Eventually he would get extremely angry when I said no, so I just stopped saying no and just lied there. This happened to me on more occasions that I can recall (I'd guess in between 20-30 times). I felt suicidal during this time in my life, and just frequently imagined and hoped that I wouldn't wake up the next day. Ironically, I feared that he would eventually killed me or put me in the hospital if I stayed with him. I even tried to break up with him multiple times, and he wouldn't leave. I had to lie about the lease on the place we were living in in order to trick him to move out. After that relationship ended I experienced what I now know was PTSD. I would have frequent nightmares about him, I would relive the same horrible situations over and over and over and over again in my head. The emotions I felt from simply remembering those times were just as strong, if not stronger, than the actual experience. I went into a deep depression and lived my parents for two years. I slept all day during the day, and stayed up all night drinking or screwing around on the internet. I ended up gaining about 50 lbs and I didn't really work during this time. I had some internships and volunteered at places every now and then, but it was really just to keep up a facade of being a normal person. So when people asked me ""so, what did you do this day/week?,"" instead of saying the truth ""I cried myself to sleep around 6am in the morning after staying up all night playing video game, slept till 4pm in the afternoon and then ate a shit ton of unhealthy food because 'fuck it.'"" I could say instead ""Well, I'm taking this class right now and we get to volunteer at a local non profit to learn how it works. So I've been going to this non profit and learning about X,Y,Z."" I just started to do things to make myself look normal to my friends and family...which didn't take a lot of effort. Since that relationship ended I've been a lot more guarded with my emotions, I'm use to my thoughts and feelings being used as a weapon against me. It has been 8 years since that relationship and I can say that I've made great strides in the past  2 years to improve my life. I still have nightmares, but they are not as frequent. There are still some memories I have of that relationship that I've thought about every single day, and I hate it. 

* I have two male cousins (brothers), one a year younger and one a year older. I am female, and in the middle. When the 3 of us were very young my older cousin would have us expose our genitalia to one other, or touch each other. I guess to some extent this is normal for very young children who are curious. However, as we aged my younger cousin and I didn't want to do this anymore, but the older one kept pressing us to things we were uncomfortable with. The older cousin threatened us by saying he would tell our parents and that we would get in trouble. Every time I would visit my grandparents my older cousin would want to see, touch and would be rough with my genitalia. He would make me touch him too. I remember being old enough to know this was wrong, but I didn't know how to respond. Eventually I just started to ignore him, or make sure the 3 of us were never alone and the instances stopped. No one knows about this, my parents and my cousins parents don't know. I haven't spoken to this at all with my younger cousin, and I'm sure he remembers. 

* I have another sexual memory that I'm not even sure is true or not. I may have been around 4-5 years old, and a man is attempting to trick me to get me to touch his penis. He has a cloth or something wrapped around him, and his penis coming through a hole. He is tell me that this is some sort of animal he found, like a worm that can grow. He tells me to pet it and watch it move around and grow. I honestly can't tell if this is just a fabricated memory from childhood, or something I've repressed. If it is true, I can't remember who it was, I just know I'm related to this person. 

Here are some non sexual things, that aren't as bad but still suck: 

* I suffered from severe asthma as a child. There have been multiple times in my life where I just stopped breathing and thought I was going to die. Not sure if this is something that could affect your mental health, but it's a big part of my life regardless. 

* I was the poorest kid in a private religious school. My mom worked two jobs so she could give me a good education. Which sounds great in theory... except when you are told that you and your family are going to hell on a regular basis because you don't go to church. Or how the teachers treat you as an idiot because you accept evolution. I felt either scared about going to hell or like I was a crazy person for understanding evolution all throughout elementary school. 

* I've been in two long term relationships where the other person broke up with me by using the no contact method. Basically one day after a year and half they drop off the face of the earth. They don't pick up your calls, they don't return texts, and just ignore any private messages sent to them. In both instances I felt like I was going crazy, I thought I had done something wrong, or they were cheating, or they were angry at me, etc. I got no answers, no closure. 

The only thing that has kept me going is the notion of ""keeping up appearances."" I needed to make my life look as normal as possible - I needed to get a job - once I got that, I moved out of my parents. Once I moved out I need to be activate and lose weight, so I lost the 50 lbs I gained. I needed to make more money, I got promoted. My lowest point was 8 years ago when I ended the abusive relationship, after that ended I didn't see myself as a person anymore. I felt like I was robbed of my humanity and I was just a shell of a person. I've done a lot in the past 8 years to build a pretty good life for myself, but I've only gotten this far because I've just wanted to look normal. I don't know what to do with that. Eight years ago I started to develop a mental checklist of what it takes to be a person, and I've checked off all of the tics. I have improved a lot, but I'm still so angry, bitter and sometimes jealous of others who haven't been through as much pain as me. I still feel a lot of regret and sadness for myself. I think about how it could have been better, I think about how much further a long in life I would be right now. I know something isn't right in regards to my mental health, I just don't know what it is. "

As the title eluded to, I am currently a rising senior in the BS program at a small private liberal arts college with a locally respected CS program.

A little about myself: I am older than most of my peers (just turned 25), since I left college after my Freshman year due to family issues and deciding to join the Army. I did very well my first semester of freshman year (3.7 gpa) but flunked all my Spring classes because I just didn't show up. I left to join the Army and after getting out and returning to school in 2013 (4 years later) I have maintained a 3.9 overall with a 4.0 in my major CS classes. By the time I am ready to apply I will have two strong internships under my belt (1 already completed, one beginning June 1st) as well as research experience with one of my professors. I don't have many personal projects, aside from a few websites I did for clients and some substantial academic projects. Basically, what I would like to know is what you all may think my prospects of getting into a top tier masters program would be? Is it worth it at this point in my life to continue with school and not enter the industry until I'm 27 or graduate next year and just enter the work force? Thanks for your responses in advance!"

In 2014 I completed 2 paid internships (called Co-ops at my school) and it was the first year I earned enough to file my own tax return. I used TurboTax to file both state and federal taxes in early January. My state refund came pretty quickly, maybe 2 weeks, but weeks turned to months and my federal return never showed up in my bank account. 

Maybe a month or so back, I received a letter in the mail from the IRS which mentioned irregularities in my return and requested additional information so they could verify my identity. I promptly followed their instructions to verify my identity through their online web portal, but have since heard nothing. I regularly check the status of my return on IRS.gov/refunds but it never changes. Class ended last month and I'm back doing another Co-op, so thankfully I'm no longer desperate for the money, but I would still like to see my refund sooner rather than later. 

I wanted to know if anyone else in this sub has had a similar experience filing their first return. Any comments or suggestions on next steps would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I had been texting with my ex for a little since she asked me to do her a favor. For a very long time I've wanted to see her, so I asked her to hang out before I went abroad to study for 7 weeks. 

I'm very embarrassed by some of the things I did when we were closer, so I mostly wanted to see her so that I could explain that I just got nervous and reacted badly to things. I probably shouldn't care but it's really important to me that she doesn't think back to me and remember a loser, which I'm sure she does now. I also wanted to see her because pathetically enough I miss her. She's the only girl I've ever dated, so I think I have  a disproportionate emotional connection to her. 

We made plans for Saturday, then she canceled, saying her dad made plans she didn't know about. She said that we could hang out Monday. Today, Monday, I found out that the museum we planned to go to is closed on Mondays.

I probably should've taken the hint, but I knew I wouldn't have a chance again for a long time so I asked if there was anything else she might want to do. She said she has bad allergies so she was just going to sleep.

I'm so sad. I'm so pathetic and creepy. She probably thought that I was pressuring her to hang out since I did that favor for her, and she just wanted to get out of it without upsetting me. 

I shouldn't care about her at all, it's been so long since we dated and we only dated for such a short amount of time, but I still care so much about her. 

I'm not excited to go abroad tomorrow... I just wanna crawl in bed and sleep until I die. Everything I do lately has fallen flat, I feel like I'm doing so bad. I should've gotten a real internship this summer at a big company and I should've done better on finals and fuckfuck fuck. She said that we'll hang out after I get back, but I know she doesn't want to, so I won't be a jerk, I won't ask. I might get a job in a city a few hours away so that'll be an elegant excuse.  I hate me"

A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages (if you're looking to play a scenario out in just an hour or two while still getting all the details nailed down, I'm your guy!). Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing!

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you!"

-US Drivers license (do I need international permit?)
-International exception on debit card
-Will open bank account in UK (HSBC?)
-Will get pay-as-you-go cellphone/sim card and keep my iphone for wifi


Is there anything crucial that I'm missing to do, or is there anything you would recommend I do? Thanks everyone!


UPDATE:
The verizon iphone 5s is already unlocked, so I went to EE (Which I believe is owned or connected to T-Mobile), and bought a pay as you go sim card, and I'll be paying about 15 pounds a month for minutes and data. I suspended my account with verizon for 3 months, and it will automatically resume the day I return to the states. 

I'm keeping my US license, since it is legal in the UK for 12 months.

I'm opening an account with HSBC after the bank holiday tomorrow, and I'll be getting a chipped card. My US card does work over here, but I get charged an extra percentage for all foreign transactions. 

Thank you everyone for the wonderful help and information! You made this move a lot easier! I greatly appreciate it.

36evqf,2,2015-05-18,Second trip + questions,Satyr604,shrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/36evqf/second_trip_questions/,"A while ago, a friend and I did our first, low dose truffle trip. We had a whale of a time in general and all was good. The whole story is documented here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/32a2ir/a_man_and_his_pear_my_first_trip/

A little shorter while ago, we went for a second trip and upped the dosage this time. The first time we went for 2,18 gr. of dried ps. Tampanensis each (= about 6,6 gr. fresh) in a tea, this time we chewed up 3 gr. (=9 gr. fresh) of the same batch. A significant increase, it turned out. It should also be noted that we tripped at about 6 pm, and all I had eaten that day was a bowl of muesli and two apples. I did not mind, since I knew that, while me body would have to be hungry for a bit longer, my mind would have it's share of food soon enough. 

The bland cardboard taste and structure is one thing, but the battery-acid aftertaste of the truffles makes me gag. They made me nauseous as all hell, like my stomach was a churning crater filled with churning stuff. We chewed them up at his place and went outside immediately afterwards, to a place in semi-nature. It's a small patch of land where it's absolutely beautiful, yes, even while sobre. The land isn't cared for and has reclaimed it by covering it with weeds. The dandelions  were done turning the field into a yellow sea and instead poked up swaying poofballs everywhere. Crickets chirp and near the water toads were singing. 

We arrive and my friend starts to show first signs immediately. I chuckle when I hear him mutter: ""It's the slow things that matter. Fast things are useless."" He turns to me and says ""The sky, it looks like something straight of that videogame.. What's it called?"" ""Mass Effect?"" ""Yeah, that's the one!"" His pupils are big and black like spreading inkblots.

Meanwhile, I wander about restlessly. I would stay at my girlfriend's place that night, but there were some minor issues. Either I had to get up really early in the morning, before I had a bus back home, or I would have to come to her workplace to drop off her keys during her lunchbreak that isn't at a specified time. She does an internship there and the complex is huge and hugely complex. The doors only open with a badge as well. After six years of being together, I know her well enough to know she gets 'difficult' over stuff like that. She'll be restless until we clear how it's going to be done. By proxy, I would be restless because I don't want her to feel like that. So while I walk around in those fields, I decide it's best to give her a call and sort stuff out. On the phone I decided to man the fuck up and just get up early together with her. While talking to her and being glad it's settled, the trip starts to come up. She notices I'm getting giggly and happy. She laughs it off, wishes me luck and my trip was ready for take-off. 

We walk around. I know it's cliche, but the whole field was like a magic wonderland. We crawl through an opening in the bushes, and it felt like going to secret tunnel, going to new places. There's some more of that while walking along a forest path, until we get back at the clearing. While getting out of the forest, it's like my vision is suddenly 'widened' a lot, like looking through a fish-eye lense or, in videogame terms, turning up the FOV-slider. Just like last time, all colours get a green-silver hue to them. The meadow starts to wave gently. We sit down at some logs and enjoy the show. A bit later we lay down in the field and we just stayed there for a long time.

This is when the trip started to get heavy. I loved the visuals, but mentally, it was difficult to keep it all together. I wouldn't say I overdosed, but the dosage was stuck between 'certainly enough' flirting with 'slightly too much'. I tried to talk with my friend, but my mind raced in all directions. While sobre, you have your mind on a leash. It sometimes wanders a bit, but like a curious yet obedient lapdog, a little pull is enough to get it back where you want it to go. The smaller dose I did the first time made my mind wander way more and be more curious about stuff, but it was still manageable. I could function and act normally if desired. Think of it like a hyperactive, inquisitive Jack Russel on a leash. This time, my mind was a pumped up, stubborn yet friendly Saint Bernard. Have you ever tried to win a leash pulling contest with a Saint Bernard? It ain't gonna work. You can try to coax it into the right direction and it'll work at times, but only if that's where the big boss wants to go as well. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I can live with that. I don't mind letting go. But it was when an actual dog-owner with an actual dog walked up to us and asked us if we had any tobacco, I realised how difficult this would be. My mental Saint-Bernard was still rummaging through my brainkitchen's cupboards and I could not think, let alone talk straight. I managed to say ""No, only pipe tobacco"". He excused himself for his dog being a bit curious about me. When I answered with ""It is not a problem, I have experience with dogs of my own"", he probably started to understand the kind of dog that was running my system right now. The message I was sending wasn't weird, but the wording was very strange, so he stared at me for a bit. My friend was more clearheaded than I was, thank any deity out there that's willing to listen to thanks, and was able to keep the conversation going in a normal fashion. While my eyes are so dark you can barely discern the pupils, his eyes are greyish-blue and his dilated pupils jump into sight immediately. I don't think he really minded though, he seemed a bit of an alternative type himself. 

Like I said, I don't really mind letting go, but the trip was getting a bit much. To keep up the metaphors, you could compare my brain to a computer. It was trying to play this fun, new videogame with great and stunning visuals. Sound was awesome as well, the burping of toads and chirping of crickets kept increasing and decreasing in pitch in a slow sinuswave. However, my system was not equiped to run this at all. The processor in particular could not really handle what was going on, like it had trouble computing all of its own processes. It resulted in thoughts stopping halfway. I could not think straight. My thoughts were incoherent rambling raves and I was fully aware of that, even while thinking them. All the while, I was in love with the changes in my perception. Is there a way to achieve those, without having my brain turned into a storming soup of jumbled mess?

At times, my brain even froze or shut down. I went into a blackout-like state, where I would drift off into nothingness, like falling asleep or unconscious. However, whenever I got too far away, the mushrooms jolted me back with their defibrilators. It was like a sudden jolt of psychedelic-ness kicked me right of my blackout and spat me right back into the trip with a landing that was as soft and gentle as a concrete brick. And when I say jolt, I mean JOLT in capital letters as big as barns. It was not frightening, but it was very strange and not entirely pleasant. I'd really like to know if other people have experienced this as well?

We decided to go for a walk and took halt at a quiet road near a field with a little wall. We sat on it and like a bunch of happy hobbits we smoked a pipe of tobacco there and gently floated back down from our trip. We stood there and talked for quite a while and I was slowly feeling 'better' and more comfortable again. I have never been stoned or high in my life, but for a few hours afterwards I had a feeling that could only be described with those words. I was happy and made dumb jokes about everything. We went for a kebab because our stomachs roared like a whole can of Lannisters. It wasn't particularly good and my friend, almost entirely sobre by now, picks up a piece of kebab meat while saying ""Man, this meat is really weird.. It's not even like kebab meat"". ""Yeah, this meat is strange"", I answered while holding up a piece of tomato, thinking it was a hilarious joke. 

We parted ways and thanked each other for the amazing evening. I went to my girlfriend and the feeling while getting in bed with her, just holding and cuddling her, was phenominal. 

Something I noticed throughout this trip and the previous trip, is that 'stages' in the trip always seem linked to 'events'. The start of my first trip was when I intently looked at a painting, to see if I could detect any psychedelic qualities. I asked my friend if it was a hologram, one of those things that move if you change position from it. That, in turn, seemed to set off his trip. This time it was when I called my girlfriend and immediately after we sorted things out. My trip really kicked off the moment we got out of the forest and entered the clearing. Is that just coincidence, my mind reinforcing expectations, or do you have similar experiences?

TL/DR: it was a great evening. Though it got fairly difficult for me to keep my shit together at times, in the end all was well. 

Is it possible to have visual trip without your brain being blasted out of your skull? Has anyone ever experienced small 'black-outs' while tripping? 

Thanks for reading this wall of text. "

I do programming and fix bugs and stuff. My job can be overwhelming and sometimes I find it hard to stay motivated. 

I get to work at 9 and I usually stay productive until about 2 or 3. Then I just run out of steam and find myself staring blankly at my computer screen. I just don't have the mental stamina to do this job for so long. 

I have ADD, by the way. This kind of work is extremely difficult for me when I'm not on meds. I am taking meds right now (Concerta) and it helps, but it's still not enough to keep me going for eight hours a day. 

Do you guys have any advice? Have any of you ever been in the same situation?"

Currently 23 years old with no real obligations and an intense desire to escape the mundanity of the midwest and move back to the country of my ancestry. I've researched this move religiously for months now and I still haven't been able to hash out a plan I am comfortable with so I was hoping to receive some input from you all. 

Some background on my skills. I graduated from a large public university with a degree in Information Systems and Russian Language. After school I found a job working at a very respectable large, multinational healthcare IT firm hear in the midwest as a Sys. Admin. I am currently approaching one year at this job and pretty good at what I do (Linux, VMware, Oracle, SQL). From a language standpoint I know Russian at an intermediate level and have begun learning German from a private tutor. I am a very quick learner when it comes to languages but I've gleaned from other posts that basic German won't really get me anywhere. I'd have to take a job that communicates in English and then get fluent while living there.

Moving forward - I was wondering what you guys think of my prospects if I were to move to Frankfurt/Berlin/Munich to look for a job in IT (in English)? I've heard mixed results on how hard it is to get jobs in Germany without prior EU work experience. I also realize Germany has the special Blau Karte program for people with ""special skills"" but I don't really know what they mean by special? Do my IT skills quialify? Are there ways to land an internship there? I frequently visit toytowngermany.com and they have jobs in English but I feel as if my chances are poor since I currently live in the USA, essentially requiring me to move there for any real shot at a job. I'd be willing to look for work outside of my field as an English teacher but I've read recently that that field is becoming saturated. Would getting a language certificate increase my chances? 

I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and bust my ass to make it there, but lately I've been wondering if it is indeed possible? I look forward to hearing your comments, help and criticism.

The small tasks I've been given have taken me no more than a couple days and usually I get them done even faster. My boss seems very happy with my work so far and has even complimented me on being able to learn fast. However, once I'm done, he usually just says ""Okay just stay busy"".... I'd like to know what that means to you guys... Especially those of you in management. 

I've tried learning some new CS stuff, but youtube is blocked and thats where most of my favorite resources are. I also don't want to just goof around online because it seems like everyone else is working hard! And don't want to bug my manager too much for stuff to do because after all, I'm an intern and I'm sure hes got better things to do than worry about keeping me busy. 

Overall, I just don't want to feel lazy! So has anyone else been in this position and what did you do? Also for people who manage interns and engineers, what would you want me to do if I haven't been assigned a project."

36f4xs,57,2015-05-18,I Wrestled With Death Twice To Live For Photography,pete7568,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/36f4xs/i_wrestled_with_death_twice_to_live_for/,"This is the story of how I wrestled with death twice to live for photography. Before I wrote this article, I told a couple of people about it since it means so much to me. Although some didn’t understand how I could talk so openly about this topic, I decided that it’s my duty to generate awareness and help others even if it means that I’m revealing my biggest weakness in front of the world. 

Ever since I could think I loved being creative. I drew a lot of pictures when I was younger and not one day passed where I didn’t build something new with Lego or just another tree house. When I was a teenager, I wanted to apply my creative drive to as many outlets as possible. It all started with gaming, finding creative, daring strategies to win Counter-Strike clan wars. After a while, building my own maps fascinated me more than anything. I spend day and night coming up with my very own digital worlds to play in. Luckily, one of my maps even made it to the biggest gaming magazine in Germany. To maybe work in the gaming industry one day, I started with coding. If my grades weren’t obvious already, this endeavor soon made me realize how math retarded I actually am.

I wanted to find something new, so I kept myself busy with film editing and Photoshop. It was fun, but being color-blind i.e. having a red-green weakness makes it way harder to work as a designer one day. I found something new then. Loving music more than anything else in the world, I lived the rock star live on the smallest of all stages with my bass and my punk band for a year or two only to realize: yeah, you may love music, but that doesn’t translate well into creating it.

I left for university in the Netherlands in 2007 and during my college years this fun creative exploration all of a sudden had this bitter new flavor called real life. My biggest dream was always to work creatively. The only creative passion left was coming up with advertising ideas and slogans. Coming up with fun ways to advertise something always fascinated me. I applied for a side job in a marketing agency to pay my tuition fees and rent and learn more about it. It just felt so good. Getting payed for being creative. After a while the dream arose in me that I wanted to become the next Don Draper, the big shot creative director who’s working for clients worldwide. At the end of my bachelor I applied for an internship at one of Germany most successful advertising agencies, passed the creative test and made it there in February 2010!
 
Completely overworked from my side job and my international study abroad, I burned out after 3 months and suffered from severe depressions and anxieties for the next half year. I couldn’t write anymore, I couldn’t live anymore and I just didn’t want to be there anymore. I was scared to leave my room let alone the house. I was 21 at the time and couldn’t handle seeing my dreams shatter in front of my young, innocent eyes. I thought I’ll never be able to live my creative dream, because I didn’t have anything else that I felt on a creative level. I was utterly devastated and trapped in the infinite depths of depression. The grim reaper was breathing down my neck day in and day out. When you are depressed, he becomes your “companion” that doesn’t leave you alone until you give in and kill yourself - or you take hundreds leaps of faith and kick his goddam ass!

Every day I did something I wasn’t able to do the day before. Get out of bed before 6 PM, write two sentences, do the dishes, cook something, leave the house for a couple of minutes, do the groceries, talk to people again, continue with the rest of my bachelor study. It took me more than half a year to swim all the way from the bottom of this suffocating lifeless ocean of nothingness to the top again. I woke up into a nightmare every day with the grim reaper giving me a vicious good morning kiss for so long that I even felt sorry for him when I beat the hell out of him at the end of 2011.

He was gone. I was there again. I finished my bachelor’s and was left with no creative career to pursue. The only thing I could do was for once in my life stop giving a crap. What I had left was my interest in analyzing things and doing research though. So I did that and poured all my energy into my minor in Psychology and my master’s degree in Consumer Psychology. After the first weeks of living the badass researcher’s life, my creative thirst was unstoppable. I had to do something! 

My best childhood friend Felix bought a cam and showed me the photos he took. Although my father’s urge to capture every second of our family vacations annoyed me to no ends back then, I loved the idea of being able to express my feelings through photography. I bought my first cam.

I spent the next two years till the first half year of my market researcher job right after college with taking photos of nearly everything around me - without ever finding myself. I mean, it was fun and I always liked it, but it just didn’t feel right. I took photos, but not of myself. I couldn’t pour my eye, heart and soul into them. I was about to give up, because I couldn’t even take portraits and I still can’t. 

My old market research demanded so little energy on the creative side that I had to release it somewhere. At the end of 2012 I was about to quit photography and find something new that could be my creative outlet. I’ve been doing it for two years and I thought: if you quit, then go out with a huge bang. So without any preparation I started a 365 Project on January 1st in 2013, which is the day I signed up for Flickr as you still can see. 

Being forced to find something every day I like to shoot, I stumbled upon my oasis called street photography soon. All of a sudden it made sense. All these years I loved to observe strangers in the city, the way they looked when they were under a street lamp or passing through a dark alley. I always loved it, but I never knew how to express it. I would love to draw or paint these scenes, but I paint worse then the elephants I saw in Chiang Mai Thailand after my Master’s degree. So I never really gave it a try. After about 2 months I dedicated my 365 project to capturing strangers on the street and I’ve been doing this ever since. Till the end of the project this urge to live street photography and leave my safe and secure well-paying 9-5 job became bigger with every day.

During my travels in Israel and South-Korea people were always asking me, what I was doing for a living. I always said: “I doing market research for a living, but I’m actually living for photography!” After the 10th time of saying that, I couldn’t look in the mirror anymore. When I came back from Seoul I told my supervisor: “That’s it, I have to life my dream! I quit.”

Since I didn’t want to work with the galleries and art dealers that have been approaching me with their degrading conditions, I founded my own International Fine Arts Label NEOPRIME with my dear friend, highly talented photographer and business partner Martin Dietrich. We wanted to sell our art as signed and limited prints the way we wanted to see it: with the highest quality available on the market, 3% donations to worldwide charities for every sale (most of them go to depression help so far) and more than fair conditions for our signed artists. But doing this on your own with no art background, influential friends and almost no money was the biggest challenge I ever had to face.

I spent the next months building NEOPRIME from scratch with Martin and I burned through my savings with investments in the label and paying the rent. Although I sold a good amount of prints when the label launched in May 2014, it wasn’t enough yet to keep me above water. A few months later me and my long-time girlfriend broke up and my dream of living life as an artist shattered again. Do I have to go back to my cubicle farm now? Will I ever make it? I love this so much, but it doesn’t pay the bills enough yet. Since my ex-girlfriend stayed in our apartment, I had nowhere to go except for my parents.

There I was, 26 years old, broke, back again in this rural place that doesn’t let me breath in life and of course he came back: the grim reaper.

I was severely depressed again. Not as bad as the first time, but the grim reaper was hugging me with his cold, lifeless arms again whispering “I’m back, buddy” after giving me a kiss of death on the mouth. I sunk to the bottom of this 20.000 miles deep sea again. I though I’d never experience this again, but I did. Waking up to this nightmare, hanging out with death all day, not being able to live life and you know what the worst was: I didn’t love photography anymore. It meant nothing to me. That’s what depression does to you. It tells you that you are a failure. This sickness convinced me every day that because I couldn’t live off my dream that I'm simply not good enough and it isn’t meant for me. I couldn’t take photos for half a year again till the end of 2014. That's why there is a huge gap in my Flickr during that time.

At this point I want to express my deepest gratitude to Martin who was managing NEOPRIME basically on his own during my sickness. Without him the label would’ve gone downhill and I’m so happy to have him as my friend, daily inspiration and label partner.
 
At the beginning of 2015 I knocked out the grim reaper after the 14th round with tears and blood all over my face. But I did it. I survived this horrible disease called depression again thanks to great medical help and loving friends and family. So if you are reading this right now and you have the feeling that you might be suffering from depression, get help no matter how stigmatized it may be in your country. Don’t feel ashamed. It’s a sickness just like diabetes, cancer or the flu. Talk to your family doctor, neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist or your best friends and family. If you have no one to talk to, please send me a mail to marius@mariusvieth.com and I'm there for you!

After every dark night comes a bright day and after every winter a beautiful spring. If you know someone who’s suffering from depressions, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or any other mental health problems, call them right now. I mean it. They need it more than anyone else. Tell them that you are there for them and that you and the world need them. I want to live in a world where everyone with mental disorders can speak openly about it like any other disease and get proper treatment.  This article may reveal my biggest weakness, but if I can help one single person out there to feel only one tiny bit better, it was worth it!

I though a lot about life and photography and once I saw the light of life again, I saw photography again. I wanted to grab my cam, go out there and create art again. In order to truly live life as an artist, I had to go back to the one place where I never suffered from depression and where I always could be myself: the Netherlands. I moved to Amsterdam and after only a couple of days I couldn’t have felt more at home. It’s the most liberal and international city in the world. 187 nationalities under one roof, the most important thing here is loving life and being yourself and that was exactly what I needed to live fully through photography. So if you are ever in Amsterdam, let's love life together.
 
After my 21st international award recently and making it to the shortlist of the Sony World Photography Awards 2015, I sold more signed and limited print than ever before in my life. I realized again that maybe I’m not that bad of a photographer depression made me think I am. I also realized that the only thing that keeps me healthy and alive is photography. I have to do this. I have to live this life. There’s no plan B, no exit plan, no return ticket. Mark Twain once said that there are two important days in your life, the day you are born and the day you find out why. 

I not only had to experience these two days, but also two deaths to find my passion and purpose. It may have been as hurtful as it gets, but I always look on the bright side of things and I’m happy to appreciate life even more now. Will I suffer from depression again one day? I don’t know. 

The only thing I know is that if the grim reaper ever decides to come back again, he better make sure that I’m as old and weak as it gets.

Dear grim reaper, you may take me then, but if you want to get me now, you better come with two blades, because this time you won’t fight me alone!"

I was hired by my school that I had my senior internship at because they enjoyed me as a member of the staff, but at the end of this year I was told I was not going to be renewed. 

It has always been a dream of mine to go overseas and teach English in other countries, namely Korea. I have always been in love with the culture, respect for teachers, and general enthusiasm for life there. I have two good friends who work teaching English in Korea and they both absolutely love it. 

I'm worried though. I'm out of a job in three weeks and I am on the hunt for a new position, but in my heart I know I truly want to teach in Korea and follow my dream while I am still young, unsettled, and able. I'm afraid that I won't have the opportunity when I am older.

But I'm also afraid of how this could affect my chances of being hired again once I return. Will leaving to teach overseas result in my degree being a waste of time? What if I stay for 5 years and come back and have an expired teaching license? I am really at a loss and torn between what I should do.

36fpmx,2,2015-05-18,Diet related question!,GreenEyedLeans,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/36fpmx/diet_related_question/,"Hi All,

I am a 19 year old Male (I will turn 20 in a matter in over 30 days). I am around 5'11 and currently weigh 290 Pounds. I was born in the USA, but my parents are from India. I have been ""obese"" for my entire life, and it wasn't until Thursday night when I just got fed up with myself and decided I wanted to change my lifestyle. My mom herself is diabetic, type 2. I haven't been to a doctor since 2013, but when I last went they alerted me my cholesterol levels were a bit higher, but I was told to ease off on the bad type of food, and so I did. I started college back in the fall of 2013, and last Thursday, I was trying to play basketball with my friends, but for the love of my life, I got extremely tired in just about 10 minutes of running up and down the court. It made me absolutely furious yet alerting that I need to change my diet, and my lifestyle. 

I mention about my mothers diabetes mainly because that is also what sparked my sudden attitude to shift my life style and how I eat. She does have severe complications, though, I don't have a family history of it, it kind of got me worried about myself, and what not. I guess it is normal to be worried, but I have noticed that the past year, I have had moments where if I skip out on breakfast and go straight to class, come back to my dorm, I will start feeling shaky, and feel a bit fatigue. Once I snack on some cookies, drink some juice, it all goes away. I did some research and it sounds like this is basically by blood sugars becoming low. I don't take any medications at all, nor do I feel any other symptoms of anything, I feel absolutely normal, aside from just carrying too much weight. 

I had this weird moment going on that has taken place since Thursday, where I have eaten a bagel toasted with regular butter, a glass of chocolate milk and went about my day I usually eat my bagel at around 10:00 AM. I usually get back to my dorm at around 3:30 - 4:30 and my body starts shaking, identical to the low-blood sugar symptoms, but it all goes away. I am vegetarian, so I usually don't eat anything from 10:00 AM till 4:00 PM, part of the reason is because the on-campus food doesn't serve vegetarian offerings, and instead offer some lettuce wrap, which I don't find appealing (I am vegetarian my religion). 

My question here is, I just realized typing all this up that I don't eat anything for 6 hours after eating my usual bagel, is this normal to experience? Like I mentioned, I don't have any symptoms, nor see anything unusual in my body. I wish I could go to a doctor, but I attending school with scholarships, and come from a low socioeconomic family, making an appointment with a doctor is pretty pricey unfortunately, and I can't afford the price tag at all. 

Another question I have is, mentioning my weight, what kind of diets and tips and advice can people share here to get me started? I will be going back home for the summer and going onto an internship near home (my family lives in NYC), my internship is as a Software Engineer, so it pretty much is a desk+chair type of job, so any recommendation on how to keep myself productive and lose weight when also working, and when not working? 

I really want to change my life, and am thankful I am learning to appreciate myself, and am only keeping a upbeat, positive mental attitude from here on out. "

I could use some help with an internship project. I'm coding in vba, and as part of it, I want to be able to create a formatted list that is spaced out while taking data from a table. Essentially, I'm stepping through a table, row by row, and sorting that data into little chunks.
 
My problem is that I want to separate these ""chunks"" from one another. I already have a for loop to go through and parse out data from my table. I've tried using an offset command to start a new section down a few lines, but it doesn't work. 

Here's a general summary:
    
    Sub CreateList()
          For i = 2 To 50
            Dim Str As String
            Str  = Cells(i,10).Value
            Cells((i+1), 1).Value = Str
          ( Code rearrange data into small sections and put in a new column. Continues for i+2, i+3, etc., up to i+10)
            Range(""A"" &amp; (i+10)).Offset(11).Select
       Next i
    End Sub
    

Does anyone know if there's a way to get an offset command to work inside of a for loop? Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
36fxaa,1,2015-05-18,"I'm so lonely right now. In a few months, I'm moving in with my best friend, and I'm afraid it's going to be even worse.",ssrsly,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/36fxaa/im_so_lonely_right_now_in_a_few_months_im_moving/,"In August, I'm moving in with my best friend for our last semester of college. Fantastic, right? We're going to work out and play video games and shit together all the time. I'm excited.

The problem: I'm a dude, she's a girl, and I was pretty into her not that long ago.

But there's a lot of important stuff that's happened since then. Having typed this all up, I think it's all this buildup that I really wanted to write about and get off my chest. Good stuff and bad stuff. But I'll leave the title and intro as is, because I think it's a good hook. 

Back to the beginning, and back to the best friend. Let's call her Roxy. Roxy and I have been good friends for a couple years. Last summer/fall, I was across the country on an internship, and we talked every day on the phone. I caught feelings for her. Like pretty bad. I couldn't stop thinking about her, and I ached to be with her. I thought she felt at least somewhat the same way. If nothing else, she knew how I felt, and hadn't done anything to steer me away. Turns out she didn't see me that way. I told her how I felt, she turned me down (and was actually pretty shocked that I liked her, to my surprise), but we agreed to remain friends. It was awkward for a few days, but we soon enough we were closer than ever. Deep down, I still had feelings, but I've learned over the years how to get over unrequited love, at least to some extent.

Come January, I'm back at school, and I start dating Jane. Roxy, Jane, and I are all mutual friends - we all worked together a couple of years ago. At first, I kind of feel like I'm dating Jane out of convenience. We have a lot of the same interests, similar backgrounds and all that, but I didn't really feel that spark with her. I didn't get that feeling in my stomach that Roxy used to give me. But there's nothing wrong with her, and we probably wouldn't be dating for that long anyway - I knew she'd be graduating and moving in a few months, while I have another semester to finish. Plus, I'm graduating this year and hadn't really been in an actual relationship since high school (as if those were actual relationships). I thought if I worked at it enough I'd see her differently by the time she moved, and if I didn't, we could just call it quits. And to my surprise, it worked. I started to fall in love with her. I went from thinking ""there's nothing wrong with her"" to ""Goddamn, she is perfect."" We lost our virginity to each other. It didn't go that well, but it got better every time after that.

I was thinking more and more about how we'd handle our long-distance relationship. We had a little inside joke where we would pretend she was never leaving, and just shush each other any time it came up. This was meant to avoid the pain of separating geographically, but it ended up meaning we didn't talk much about our plans.

Last week rolls along. Jane is moving on Saturday (as in a couple days ago), so we're kind of forced to think about it. The more thought I put into it, the more I want to stay with her. I decide to tell her that I'll start keeping an eye out for jobs around where she'll be for med school. Before I leave to pick her up for lunch on Tuesday, she asks if we can talk first. I can tell it's not going to be a good talk. All of a sudden, doubts that I didn't realize I'd been ignoring start creeping into my mind. Maybe a long-distance relationship isn't a good idea. We haven't been together for that long, and maybe I shouldn't be choosing where to work after I graduate based on where she'll be. I finally get up to her apartment. We sit on her couch and she sheds a tear before she can even start talking. She basically says she doesn't think she can handle the long-distance thing along with starting med school in a new place. I'm cut. But at the same time, I understand exactly what she means, and a big part of me is even relieved. No part of me is mad, which is what she expected. I talked through all our options with her, but she was pretty set. I didn't exactly see it coming, but I guess I hadn't really ruled it out. We had talked about the possibility of this happening upfront months ago. I held her while she cried, and we said it was good while it lasted. We didn't talk for a few days. I was pretty fucking sad. I just wanted to mope around, and I felt a compulsion to drink that I had never felt before. I thought talking to her would make it worse. But we finally got lunch on Friday, and we had a great time. We hugged before we parted and wished each other the best of luck in everything. I'm still sad, but it felt like good closure and I'm feeling a lot better. I'm trying to view the last few months as a fun and refreshing chapter of my life, as short as it may have been.

Meanwhile, Roxy has been talking this whole time with a guy she talked to on a trip last summer. They reconnected this semester and had been talking more and more, until I pointed out to her that she was flirting with him pretty hard. She is really fucking bad at picking up on that stuff. But, this time, she realized she really has feelings for this guy. It gets a little heavier, and they make it sort of an official thing. They live pretty far apart, but he's going to be here on campus most of the summer, and they'll end up in the same city next year. So pretty much the opposite of me and Jane.

I'm really happy for Roxy. She is super picky about guys and hates that about herself, so she hasn't dated in a really long time. But she is really smitten with this dude who she always says isn't even her type, so I'm really proud of her for overcoming her self-described ""shallowness."" He seems like a great guy, and she deserves that.

At some point during the spring semester, I was looking for a place to live in the fall, and Roxy was looking for a roommate. We decided that we'll move in together in August. Why not, right? It makes sense. I checked with Jane, Roxy checked with her guy, everything is all good. Great.

So. The girl I love moved away this weekend and said she didn't want to do a long-distance relationship. My last roommate moved out a few days ago, and I'll most likely be alone in this 4-person apartment for the summer. I've had a lot of time to think about shit in these last few days. Right now, I am still constantly thinking about Jane, but I know myself. Thinking realistically, I'll be over her before too long. And soon enough, I'll be living with Roxy, who I really fucking liked less than a year ago, and that wasn't the first time I had thought about her in that way. I'll be single, and she'll most likely still be dating this dude. Is this a terrible fucking idea? Am I totally screwing myself here? I don't feel as strongly about her as I used to, but I know it's just festering down there, waiting to be a problem at the worst possible time.

I watch too much TV, so I keep seeing myself as Fry or J.D. or Jim Halpert. They patiently wait years for their other half to realize that the love she's been looking for has been right there in front of her the whole time. I know my story won't end that way, but it's hard not to envision it.

All this said, I know it's gonna be alright. I'm a fucking adult, I have a sort-of-decent handle on my feelings and emotions, and I'm smart enough (or at least I've figured out through trial and error) to talk about things as they become problematic. Roxy and I are close enough friends that I'm sure even if I screw up bad we'll survive.

Hopefully everything is going to be fine. Roxy and I keep the same dynamic we have now, neither of our feelings about each other change in any significant way, and her relationship with her guy goes great and lasts forever. I just know that if the balance gets messed up, the fact that we'll be living together is just going to magnify everything.

So that's it. Roxy has been at home for a wedding but she'll be back on campus this week. Her boyfriend gets here in like a month. I guess between now and August I'll probably get a better idea of how this whole thing will shake out. I just wish I had another housing option I could fall back on if I felt I needed to.

I'm afraid this post sells Jane short. I think that's because I've divulged most of the stuff about her in here to people before, but the Roxy stuff mostly stays inside. But Jane deserves to be talked about. She's so fucking awesome. I miss her like crazy, and having her to talk to would make this whole thing not even a problem. But I know the chances that Jane and I end up together are incredibly slim to none, so I don't want to fuel any feelings that are just going to mean more hurt later on.

This got way too long, I've been typing it forever. If anybody made it this far, sorry you had to read all that. I was gonna try to make it interesting to read but when I realized how long it was getting I kinda dropped that since I figured nobody would want to finish it. I'm just glad to get it out of my head. Or off my chest, I guess is the point. Anyway.

-----

**TL;DR** Broke up with the most amazing girl last week. Will be living the lonely life this summer. And in August, I'm moving in with my friend who I previously had unrequited feelings for that I'm afraid will boil up again."
36g2ez,6,2015-05-18,IJW: Pitch Perfect 2 (2015),wtimusprime,Ijustwatched,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/36g2ez/ijw_pitch_perfect_2_2015/,"http://screenhooked.com/2015/05/18/pitch-perfect-2/

WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW

From first-time director Elizabeth Banks comes a sequel to 2012’s Pitch Perfect. The Barton University Bellas have won three straight national titles and are competing in the world championships. Thanks to a distasteful fashion choice by Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), the Bellas are suspended unless they win the world championship.

The first Pitch Perfect was a really solid movie thanks to some great chemistry between Anna Kendrick and Skylar Astin, some interesting uses of acapella, and a diverse cast despite most of the characters seeming flat. Pitch Perfect 2 has Beca (Kendrick) working as an intern for a recording studio, headed by Keegan-Michael Key, which turns into a semi-interesting story line. But the main focus is on the world championships, which we’re all fairly certain they are going to win. The main plot is so thin, too. Also to fill time, they go to acapella boot camp just so they can have a character from the last film, whose name escapes me as I’m writing this, show up and have it make sense. The boot camp sequence was about as generic as you’d expect, and it builds into something that could have happened without it.The fireside cup song that we all knew was going to happen, that I wasn’t looking forward to, was actually pretty touching.

There were some acapella performances that impressed me early-on, but the finale left me so underwhelmed. Much like how the “Riff-off” from the first movie was the most fun part of the movie, a similar contest is held in the sequel and it’s really cool until Emily (Hailey Steinfeld) butchers it. So the main element of Pitch Perfect 2 is still solid, but I have some major complaints.

Rebel Wilson and Adam DeVine have three scenes together in this movie. Their little forced romance is given this epic final scene that no one understands because there was so little build-up. The exchanges between them in sequence are: 1. Bumper tries to seduce her, Amy says no and winks a few times. 2. Bumper asks Amy to date him, she says no. 3. Profession of love. I don’t even care if there was an extended cut that had this plot line fleshed out, it should not have been in the movie. In fact, there is just too much Rebel Wilson. She’s on her way to becoming Melissa McCarthy.

John Michael Higgins is hysterical as the commentator alongside Banks, but his politically incorrect jokes are more of a warning of what is to come. The racist stereotypes exhibited through the weird Asian Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), the Mexican immigrant Flo (Fit), and a blatant display of German vilification through Flula and Birgitte Hjort Sørensen. Is it funny? Sometimes. I wanna give them credit for continuing the non-PC 80s tone they were going for, but they need to give these characters some depth besides one-note stereotypes. It’s not just the non-Americans either. Stacie the slut has like two lines. Das Sound Machine’s best performance is its first, but these characters only show up wearing all black and making jokes using certain German words intimidating and/or seducing Beca and the Bellas. It felt like there was no point in having the primary antagonists in the movie, because they only perform and briefly chat. 

Keegan-Michael Key has the best performance in the movie having only been in roughly ten minutes of it. Beca seems underused completely. Skyler Astin doesn’t get to do anything. Benji (Ben Platt) is also given this creepy romance with Steinfeld, and they’re both already side characters, so we don’t care about this either. Steinfeld is insufferable in this movie, not because of her specifically, but because of her character’s cheesy dialogue and her inevitable subplot interaction with Kendrick and Key. The movie just sets up a bunch of subplots that can be completed with 3-4 scenes each, and cut them together to make the movie. Also, because I just want to make this point: Brittany Snow is too old for this, which is weird because Kendrick is the same age.

So I didn’t feel like I had watched the fun teen comedy I had seen 2.5 years ago. I saw two hours of stereotypes, forced romances, fantastic cameos, and a bunch of subliminal messages telling girls to join a sorority. At a surface entertainment level, it’s on par with the first one, catering heavily to the audience that is passionate about it. On a deeper level, if it weren’t for the great acapella performances, this would be considered lazy. I’d recommend it if you are a fan of the first one. Otherwise, I don’t really see anything of value here.

I've been applying to a lot of places but not too many calls or emails back about interviews. Today, I did get an email an email about an interview and I was excited. I started to read about the company and I drove out to make sure I knew the place. 

Out of curiosity, I looked up employee reviews and read something that made me uncomfortable. Wages were cut in half after a couple of months because they didn't like the results from the lab. The person writing the review said that their position was a research assistant (the position I'm applying for), but they were treated and classified as interns. Management only appreciate results that work in their favor and anything that doesn't is the fault of the one who did the experiment. Overall, the reviewer said that no one has left on good terms with the company and rated the experience with 1 star.

I don't want to copy and paste the review because I don't want this coming back to me somehow. I could only find one review for the company online so maybe I could brush this off as ""the *one* bad experience* or something. I'm not sure how I should take this. If it turns out that I do the interview, get accepted, and everything the reviewer says is true, I'm going to feel bad knowing that I knew this before hand and was in a position to decline.

36hkf0,26,2015-05-19,Android internships and junior dev positions (general info),djchapz,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/36hkf0/android_internships_and_junior_dev_positions/,"As a student who wants to be an Android dev, I have been on several interviews and spoke with people who work in tech companies. I have been mostly looking for an internship as I am still inexperienced (have one simple app and working on another by myself) and realized it is very hard to find one. 
  
The problems:  
* They require experience / don't have internships  
* They want to see your projects which you probably don't have  
* They require knowlege of a specific library/technology  
* They are looking for someone who knows iOS/WP alongside Android  
    
The problem here is, if you are starting to learn or know just the basics, they won't take you because you don't have the knowlege.
Therefore, you need to make a personal project by yourself, which could take up a lot of time and research which is the whole point of an internship - but you don't have a mentor that would help you if you run into trouble, you won't ""learn"" teamwork, the workflow of building an app, testing and so on. 
Besides, working alone takes a lot more time to get skill than working in a team.

The things I want to discuss is **what are the ""requirements"" for applying for an internship/junior position?** What knowlege should one have before applying? What are the typical questions companies ask you? What are the bonuses you can have to be better than other candidates?
    
    
**Currently the best suggestions:**  
* Make a personal project using some web API, sensors, or databases  
* Be sure to know basic Java and OOP principles
    

**Questions askes / required knowlege:**   
* Activity vs. Fragment use cases  
* Activity and fragment life cycles  
* Asynctasks  
* Services, receivers  
* List adapters and listview performance optimisations (advanced)  
* Content resolvers  
* Http requests  
* Dealing with device fragmentation and making adaptable UIs (advanced)  
* Also make sure you ask them some questions too.  
* Inheritance  
* Abstraction  
* Concurrency  
* Java util datatypes  
* More complex java util datatypes (LinkedBlockingQueue, etc)(advanced)  
* why setting a context as a static variable is bad  
* LinkedList, BinaryTrees, Tries, arrays, efficient sorts, recursion(advanced)

I got a call from the verification agency working on behalf of my firm a few weeks ago trying to verify that I worked at my accounting internships (which I was truthful about), which is what made me bring up this topic.

I pulled up my resume and everything is accurate except for one thing. I put this one temp job on my resume that I should have just omitted.. and the dates of employment are slightly off. The work I did here was basically answering phones and data entry, which is not very relevant to the job that I'll (hopefully) have. I put that I had worked at the temp job from June-July 2011 when I only worked there for a couple weeks in June 2011. I also worked there for a week in January 2013 that I had forgotten to put down as well. I'm friends with the CFO there if that would help at all (one of my good friend's mothers)

I also emailed HR on Friday to request for the Becker study materials and she still hasn't gotten back to me yet... making me more nervous. 

What should I do? Is this something to be worried about at all if it's just a temp job?

I just started an internship in a small company(~16 employees) that provides networking, telephony, and cloud services to agents and resellers, who sell the service to other companies. The resellers provide their customers maintainance and assistance. My company provides the dealer's customers and resellers assistance via their service desk. 

They currently have one 1st line, one 2nd line, and the rest of their employees (sales, coders, and executives) are 3rd line. They use call/ticket management system where they register tickets and calls, assign them, escalate them, etc.

My Task: Over the course of 5 months I need to analyze their current service management process, find areas of improvement, and add more automization (coding) to their current ticket management system. I start at the service desk for a week or two to see the process from the bottom up and then after suggest improvements to their service management process and changes to their system.

It is my second day and I am looking for a little guidance when it comes to what to look for. I am starting by looking for disadvantages of their ticket management system and their previous incidents. Searching thorugh old tickets doesn't provide much info as they don't have alot of search criteria and the search results don't provide enough information such as escalation, minutes till ticket was opened, etc.

I'm just a little nervous as I can't fail this assignment at any costs and am not sure where to start.

Thanks for any guidance.

Update: The assignment focuses more on improving the ticketing system rather than the overall process. By the end of the project it needs to be improved and production ready. System built in PHP.

Project Phases: Intro to service desk(~2weeks) --&gt; Process Analysis (Find improvements) --&gt; Ticketing System Improvements Implementation (coding in 2 iterations) --&gt; testing, etc"
36ihik,1,2015-05-19,What should I focus on?,Bumbe,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/36ihik/what_should_i_focus_on/,"Hello.

I am currently at 2nd year of college studying towards masters in computer science. Prior to this I had no programming experience.

I know C, java, some python and C++, basics of algorithms, operating systems, databases, theory of CS, etc. Everything you learn at the beginning.

My question is, what is something I should focus on studying in my private time if I am interested in becoming decent employee later on? I feel that I know nothing, and that generally speaking, I'd be much better learning more things on my own and gaining experience since I am interested in getting some part of internship job in year or two and I don't want to come there empty handed.

Just general idea what you feel someone in my place would have most use of spending his free time on.

Thanks a lot!"

I'm an incoming freshman at Drexel, I'll be majoring in Computer Science and, basically, I'd like to find out what Drexel's students think of the program :D
First of all, how challenging is the first year curriculum, what subjects do you generally touch upon? I found an online course listing on the college's website, but it's just a compilation of every course you have to take in order to graduate; I'd like to know what you'll be doing during your first year specifically.
Secondly, what do people tend to do during their first (and only) summer vacation? I was thinking of applying to an internship at a big company like Facebook or Google. I already attended a couple of internships during high school and I've also got a fair bit of competitive programming experience, so I'd like to think expertise shouldn't be a problem... I'm also aware of how excruciatingly competitive the admission process is likely to be. Have you done something like that as a freshman / do you think it's doable?

36iued,2,2015-05-19,Econ MA hopeful. Advice needed.,AncileBanish,academiceconomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/academiceconomics/comments/36iued/econ_ma_hopeful_advice_needed/,"Hi all. I'm an undergrad at a Canadian University (U of T). I just finished my second year and am doing a double major in math and econ. I'm planning on applying to MA programs once I finish my undergrad, and have a few questions for anyone who could offer some advice. 

I'm near-30, having gone back to school as an adult. This means that I work enough to support myself while I go to school. I currently work about 20 hours per week. I'm planning on not working during grad school, and just dealing with being very poor for a year. 

So far I've maintained a 3.91 GPA, having taken the usual first and second year math and econ courses, second year probability theory and stats (with the econ department, called ""Quantitative Methods in Economics""), and a few other miscellaneous courses in political science, history etc. 

I've developed good personal relationships with a few of my professors so far and am confident that I can acquire recommendations. 

I have no coding experience whatsoever, and have no room left in my undergraduate degree for adding CS courses. How important is coding ability for an MA applicant? I'm confident I can teach myself whatever CS skills are required in my spare time, if needed. Is this a realistic expectation or am I being overly confident?

I have a strong preference for staying in Canada for grad school. My preference for grad schools right now goes: U of T -&gt; UBC -&gt; Calgary -&gt; everything else. Which other Canadian schools are considered top tier? U of T is my first choice, and I have a strong preference for it over the others. Am I correct in thinking that U of T is the best choice for econ master's programs? Assuming I'm able to maintain a high (3.9+) GPA over my remaining two years, continue to cultivate strong relationships with professors and acquire recommendations from key faculty, is it realistic to think I have a high probability of acceptance to these three schools? Beyond just having good recommendations and a high GPA, what else should I be looking to do during my undergrad to further polish my application?  

As far as career options are concerned, I understand that a career in academia is very unlikely with only the MA. I hope to find a job working at a think tank perhaps. A job at the Bank of Canada would be incredible but I don't know how realistic that is. I can't say yet whether I enjoy working with data and doing research, but I should have a better idea once I finish econometrics at the end of third year. I can say that I enjoyed the stats I've done quite a bit, and I like the new ways it's caused me to look at problems. I'm not too certain on the specifics, but I'd like to find a job actually working as an economist, rather than simply using my economics education as a springboard to some unrelated job. Is this realistic? If so, what types of positions and at what types of institutions are typical of an MA from a top Canadian University? Specifically, how respected on the job market is an economics MA from U of T? 


Basically my plan today is this:

3rd year - Advanced micro/macro/econometrics, some math, and work as a TA.

4th year - A bunch more math, more TAing, and possibly apply for some sort of internship or RA program either during the school year or the preceding summer

MA Program at U of T

Cool economics job

Is this a realistic plan for the next 3 years of my life?

Thanks for any input."

She has suffered from intensive depression in the past, but has rebounded and let a generally happy life. This past few months, she studied abroad in Rome, traveled the world, and had what I can only imagine to be the experience of a lifetime. I, however, just wanted her to come home.

When she made it home, things were amazing. Passionate, fun, and it felt new again. But after just a few days it felt different. She recoiled from emotion and doing just about anything. I would take her out to dinner or we would go to drinks and she could barely manage a smile. She doesn't want to go out, she doesn't want to do anything. 

At first I thought it was me, but I realized it wasn't when I saw its how she was acting towards everyone and everything. I confronted her and she admitted to stop taking her meds for 3 months. She said she barely wants to ever get out of bed and wants to just be alone. I am the only person she will spend any amount of time with. She does nothing all day, begs me to come over when I get home from work, and then just pulls me into bed she she can cuddle up next to me and rest. It has been hard emotionally to see her like this. In a few weeks, however, she is headed to Hawaii for an internship, and I am really worried that she will sink into an even more intensive depression, despite the fact that she says that she thinks it will help her ""find herself."" She also agreed to begin taking her medicine again.

In order for her to focus on getting better, we agreed that taking a  break over the summer would be best. Even if we don't end up together, I will be alright with it. She isn't just a girl I care about romantically; she is also a very good friend, and I want to help in any way that I can, but I don't know how to.

36jbzk,26,2015-05-19,Me [25F] with my fiance [25M] of 1 year are stressed out because of his mother's jealousy.,synfultreat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36jbzk/me_25f_with_my_fiance_25m_of_1_year_are_stressed/,"Hi /r/relationships,

This is my first time seeking advice on here.  So here it goes.

Backstory:
My fiance is interning in the city and recently asked me to move in with him and his (handicap) mother so we can carpool to work in the mornings.  Before I started staying there, he would have to wake up at 4:45am everyday in order to catch the 6:10am train to make it to work by 8:00am, but we had a very nasty winter and the trains were almost always late or down completely.

He almost lost his internship due to being late or not being able to make it to work.  Now we leave the house at 6:50 and make it to his internship with time to spare, and I still have time to make it to my job as well.  He was no longer at risk of losing his internship until his mother decided to kick us both out of her house last night!

When Alex and I first started dating, I had a feeling that his mother didn't like me right off the bat.  Whenever I would sit with her to try to have a conversation, she would suddenly remember that she had an important phone call to make; if I ask her a question I would only get a grunt as an answer.  

It bothered me so much that she didn't like me, or didn't want to try to get to know me!

Alex does every thing for his mother.  She is in a wheelchair and doesn't leave the house for anything, so he is always making sure she has her meds, goes to the store for her whenever she has a craving, does any type of shopping, runs all of her errands, etc.  He has talked about arrangements to get her a home health aid for the days that he can't make it to the house, when we move out and start our life together.  Ideally, we want to move out of state, but his mother is set on keeping him close.  Mother Hen Syndrome?

Last week my SO received a large-ish check and gave her 75% of it to cover any bills.  She asked him what he planned on doing with the rest of the money, so Alex told her about our plan to keep saving for our own place.  She lost her shit.

They speak a different language, but I was able to pick up on most of what she was saying.  That's when I realized how terrible she is as a person.  She told him that if he leaves he will be making the biggest mistake of his life and that he should prepare to suffer (and lots of other horrible things).  Alex seemed unbothered by it and told her that she has to deal with it because he (we) can't live with her forever and she needs to deal with the fact that i'll be around for a long time.

He has tried to explain to her over and over again that without me helping him get to his internship every morning, that he would lose the position and all of his hard work would be for nothing!  He has cried multiple times in my arms, because he feels like she is sabotaging his future and he keeps trying to make her see that he needs this to work.

Ever since that fight, she has been extremely passive aggressive, and it's annoying but I had been dealing with it since Alex only has 6 weeks left at his internship.  He tells me often that he appreciates me sticking it out and being patient.  

Last night, she demanded that he give her money to pay the electric bill.  He politely told/reminded her that he gave her that money for the bills for the next couple of months but she wasn't having any of it.  She kept shouting at him in their language about how he's making a huge mistake saving that money to move out.  Then, in english, she shouted ""Why can't she just go?  I don't want her here.""

Alex, calmly told her that if I go then he has to go too and to remember that she was the one who pushed him away.  

We drove to the lake and sat in the car and did some brainstorming...I still don't know what to do.
 
I know that I need to leave.  I don't want my SO to suffer because of his monster of a mother, but I don't have the money to move out yet.  I'm stuck.


Sheesh, that was kind of a rant.  

*sorry for any grammatical errors or if anything is still unclear.  I'm rushing to an appointment.*

Right now, my biggest stress is finding a job. I went into a program out of high school which is what most people considered a ""very good"" degree. I wasn't sure if I wanted to do it, but with pressure and guilt I felt that it would have been a stable job in a good field that I thought was the safest option as I didn't know what I really wanted to study in college and wanted to explore in my undergraduate career. After I got into this program, I had one obstacle after the other. I was supposed to get work experience through an internship, but wherever I applied, I kept hearing that ""there was no more room for students"". These weren't internships that went through a selective process. They were just general work experience not required but expected of a student in my program. All my classmates who were taking classes while working their internships seemed to have a leg up and I felt really behind and intimidated.  I had done everything I could, above and beyond what my friends did, to secure a spot but apparently I found out that there were far too many students than jobs (which was becoming a significant problem as I was a student). My friends only wanted to be friends to use me for notes, homework and resources. There were other issues going on at home: my aunt, who had cerebral palsy got ill and passed away, a childhood friend of mine had an emotional meltdown and her family expected me to be there for emotional support. When I fell short due to school, she became upset and angry with me. I asked professors for help, if they knew somebody they could connect me too but all they told me was to attend job fairs, which I did and heard the same message ""there are just too many students"". I worked with a professor in my final year of school and he seemed to like me until at the end when I asked him for a letter of recommendation for a post-grad program, he said ""you didn't do anything worthy of a letter of rec from me"". I graduated with so much stress and anxiety. I didn't even graduate with distinction, which was my goal in college, as I was one of the top students in high school. I just graduated with no job, no friends, no mentors. I feel scared and can't sleep at night. I have another family illness at home- a sibling who was diagnosed with cancer, and I am just so stressed and depressed. I am trying to study more but I just lay awake at night thinking about my failures. I see people who are so excited and happy to graduate, but when I graduated I was just stressed and depressed. People are asking me what I'm doing with my life and think I have it all easy, keep complimenting me on my major choice and think life is great but inside I am so depressed and worried. After I graduated, I realized I don't even truly enjoy my field. I'm not passionate about what I studied. I did it because I thought it would be a stable job. I wanted to learn more in college about various topics, but I never had time to take in depth classes. My friends and family would laugh at my willingness to be passionate about certain subjects as they all thought it was a waste of time when I could be doing something stable. I ended up going through the motions of college like a robot and feel like I have been stripped away of my true goals. I'm thinking about a career change, but it's so hard to think of a direction to take. I'm wondering if anybody else here has gone through this kind of anxiety. Any tips are helpful."
36jelv,3,2015-05-19,Scripting/Macro help,CptComputer,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/36jelv/scriptingmacro_help/,"Hey everyone,

This is my first post here, but I've been lurking for a while now and I think this is the best place to get some help with my question. So here's the explanation of the situation and what I'm looking for:

I am an intern at the local community college, as part of my internship I have been tasked with the exportation and archiving of class data off of blackboard (if anyone is familiar with BB I am not sure, but its used a lot for online classes and many other things). The task is straightforward enough, yet going to be very monotonous going through and individually clicking to archive well over 1000 classes. So I'm looking for some way to automate, click the class, click archive/export, and wait for an email informing me that the task is complete. Then I need to transfer the archived data to an external hard drive. I would also like to account for possible delay in page loads by incorporating short waits before clicks as well.

Naturally, not wanting to get carpal tunnel, I started thinking and researching my options to automate this.

From my research so far, which I will admit has not been very in depth at this stage, it appears that a macro recording program may be my best option. I found one from a company called jitbit, its $39 for the basic version of their software and that's not a terrible price, but I'd like to do this for free or at least as cheaply as possible. 

So my questions are: is this my best option, or are there other viable ways of achieving my goal? I have very little scripting or coding experience, but I am willing to learn, would it be possible? Does anyone have any experience using jitbit or any other similar software for a task such as this?

I am open to any and all opinions or advice with this. Thanks to everyone here in advance."

There is currently a (paid) opening for an intern on my team for the summer, based in Oakland, California.

Ideally, you should be able to code well in python, understand multiprocessing and queues, and perhaps even understand databases.  You will definitely need to understand what SNP calling is, and VCF format, but we'll be happy to teach you code optimization and good coding practices if you don't already know them.

I want to begin by saying thanks. This subreddit has definitely helped me answer some questions in the past as I grappled with what I want to do. The following paragraphs include a bit of info about me, but questions are in bullet points at the bottom if you want to skip this.

I'm in my third year of undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago and I have decided that I want to join the Foreign Service. Becoming an FSO has been something I have considered for a long time and I figured I will try as soon as I can.

I am near-fluent in Mandarin Chinese and I will be taking a full year of Hindi in my last year of college. I have pretty decent internship (including a US embassy) and research experience. My passion is internal politics in Asia and I would love to become a political FSO with focus on domestic politics. I took the mock FSOT on state.gov and did well, though I know that is just one part of a long process.

Here are a few questions I had about the application process:

* When should I take the FSOT if I graduate in June 2016 and want to do the application process as early as possible?

* I am proficient in various software/statistical programs that I know are in-demand in some other places. Would these help my application to be an FSO? The programs I have in mind are ArcGIS, R, and STATA.

* If I actually manage to get through to the security clearance stage, will going abroad influence that? Specifically, I want to do the Critical Languages Scholarship for Hindi in India. I figure going abroad during a security clearance is problematic overall but I'm wondering if it helps that it is a State Dept program.

* Any general advice? "

For those who dont speak german, i try to list the points from the articel.

- The political party FDP just had an intern Vote to legalize it and it passed with more then 60%. That means that FDP joins the other 2 Partys that wanna legalize it.

- Few members of the Biggest German party (CDU) pronounced that they are for the decriminalization of mariuhana.

That means that we could actually see a CDU/FDP Party that has the power to change things here in Germany. Im just happy and wanted to share this with you, hope the germany articel isnt a reason for a ban here.

36k7zs,2,2015-05-19,My friend stopped talking to me,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/36k7zs/my_friend_stopped_talking_to_me/,"I've never been good at making friends. I was really depressed earlier this year, with the worst being in March. I joined OKCupid. Not much happened on it because I didn't live in a populated area, but I met one girl.

For the first few weeks of talking I didn't know much about her. Her profile was fake and I later learned she mostly just used it to check out other profiles for her friends. I didn't mind. I liked talking to her. What I looked forward to most in the morning was seeing if she replied to me. I actually felt genuinely happy when she did. 

After 2 weeks or so she shared her name and some small details about herself. She shared her instagram and she was incredibly beautiful. I would have loved her still, even if she was 200lbs, but I had never seen a more beautiful person.

We talked every day for a month before I moved to the city. Midway through the month I met her for coffee while looking at apartments. She recommended a book she was starting to read and we read it together and talked about it...

When I moved in April we hung out 6 times. She couldn't see a friend more than once a week or so, getting overwhelmed. That was okay. Being around her, talking, was my favourite thing in the world. It made me so happy. She was so brilliant and warm to be around. I loved her already, not as a friend or a lover, just in general. I loved being around her.

My favourite thing since getting to the city was spending the afternoon walking and sitting in the park. She gave me a tour of her favourite area. Then I went back to her place and we drank and talked. I felt so special being allowed in her room. I of course didn't push any boundaries trying to kiss her or anything. I was very happy just being friends. Every time we spent time together was great.

A bit over a week ago some things happened though. Her main partner (she is poly) moved to another country for an internship. I think she said she was going to move with him in September. I asked if she was okay and she said yes. I wanted to comfort her, but I left it at that.

She told me about a photoshoot and later sent me the pictures they kept. I painted a picture of my favourite one. A week or so ago I painted her a different picture of a dog tattoo she was wanting to get and she loved it. I figured this would be okay. I like to paint and she was so beautiful... It turned out well, but she didn't like me doing it. I apologized for being weird. She said she was busy with work, but we could hang out soon.

A few days after these two things I told her about my afternoon in the park and she replied about how busy she was at work. I felt bad and offered to take some of her shifts. I told her about how I was going to a gay bar with a friend. She thought this was pretty cool and said not to go to a certain one because she was taking me there. We talked about going earlier and I was really excited to go.

I sent her a couple trivial messages. Talking about the fox my parents found at the cottage and how they were feeding it kibble and buttered bread. I thought it was really cute and that she'd like it. I told her about my new job the next day.

No reply to either. The day after I asked if she was okay. No reply. I was getting worried. Is she okay? Did she lose her phone? Did I say something wrong? I message her friend on facebook that she was staying with. Almost immediately I get a response from both. The friend politely says that they're both okay and thanks me for asking.

""I'm alive, I'll text you my thoughts later""

Okay. This seems okay. What thoughts could she have? Seems not good... I'm still worried. I try not to text her any more. Give her space. I miss her though. I hadn't seen her for over a week... I give her a message a day about what I've been up to. No replies, but I don't mind. She'll talk to me when she's ready.

I start getting scared when she doesn't say anything for the week... I tell her how I feel. That I care a lot about her. That I value her friendship so much. That I'm scared she doesn't want to be my friend any more...

""You need to chill. Give me time. I'll get back to you.""

I should chill. I'm still scared. Still feeling sick. My new job is so mindless and boring that I just worry about her all day. I tell her that I love her. This was a huge mistake. I love too easily. I'm not guarded at all with my emotions.

Monday I wake up. I send her a message with a picture of the new Game of Thrones episode I downloaded. Asked her if she wanted to watch with me. Make up and be friends again. I offered some other things we could do. I hoped with all of my hope that she'd reply and we'd be friends again. She did.

""Sorry, I don't want to talk anymore. 

Goodbye""

It felt like someone stabbed me and I was dying. My friend. The person I care about so much... She's done being my friend. I fucked it all up. The only thing I care about in life is having close friends and I have none. She could have been one... I hate myself so much. I am so sad. Why won't people like me? Why can't I be happy?

I've been crying a lot for the past two days. Living off of cereal and vodka. I feel like I'm going to be alone forever. If I could have anything in the world, I would pick her friendship to have back. But I don't get to pick this.

Nothing seems to make me happy. I'm passionate about nothing. I got a call about a potential job that lasts all summer. Pretty great for a fresh university graduate. Nope, doesn't make me happy at all. I'm going home tomorrow to see my mum. I can't talk to her about things because she's so judgemental, but I need her company.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to be happy."

We got several opinions from different doctors, and they all said the same thing: he will not recover. My mother and I have slowly started to accept the fact that he will inevitably pass away soon. 

I've been spending the past week in the hospital. Even though I'm surrounded by my mother and all my father's friends and coworkers,  I feel incredibly lonely and empty. None of my friends are in town, I've been trying to pass time by studying, reading. I've tried talking to my friends about my feelings, and initially they are sympathetic, but I feel that I am quickly becoming an annoyance to them. 

Most of the time I'll think about my dad, but every once in a while thoughts of my ex will pop up. I feel disgusted with myself, for allowing some of my thoughts to be taken up with my ex. But I can't help thinking about him once in a while and feeling sad. 

I don't really know how to feel right now. I want companionship, but I've been struggling to find people to talk/hang out with. So I've just been sitting in the hospital all day, watching all my dad's friends come and go. 

Fuck, I don't know. Has anyone gone through anything similar?

36kjam,0,2015-05-19,TIFU by having a doctors appointment.,SwagYoloMaggie,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/36kjam/tifu_by_having_a_doctors_appointment/,"So let me start this off by saying that this is my first TIFU, and I'm doing this on my phone. So I apologize for any errors. 

Warning, this isn't really a TIFU I guess but I just thought if do this. Sorry if anyone gets mad or upset. 

So this TIFU actually happened today.
I am I junior in high school and I'm planning my future like most kids do. I have decided to become a nurse which I'm very excited for. I have an intern job over the summer at one of the local nursing homes. For me to actually get into it and do it, I needed a physical. Now off topic, I have a girlfriend  that I've been with for about 4-5 months, during these months we have has some sexual activities that were great. Now back to the story. I'm 17 and since I'm not 18 I can't go into the office without a parent. I told my mom to get me signed up for a physical and it happened to be today.

We arrive at my doctors office, sign in and wait. I was well aware of the questions that would be asked but never knew when. We walk into the office after the nurse checks my height.(6'1) we sit down and the normal procedure starts. 

Fast forward about 10 minutes in. The great sexual questions pop in. I sat in the chair without my shoes on for a while then decides to put them on. My mother, sitting across from me is answering the family questions is ""kids"" don't know about. So I'm tying my shoes. Then out of nowhere she asks me THE question us men hate to answer in front of our parents, "" Are you sexually active?"" My face turns bright red, but luckily my fave was down so I can see my shoe. There was a pause which seemed to go on forever. I panicked and said the wrong answer. I said ""yes"".  I mean I'm being honest but my mom was right there. 

Fast forward to about 4:30 pm, est. I come home from school and my aunt is there. My mom, at work. My aunt tells me to talk with her about ""sex"". Ugh great just what I want. She tells me that my mom isn't upset but she thinks I broke her heart. And being the guy I am, I would like to always have my mom be happy. 

Now I don't know what to do. My mom and I haven't talked all day   i don't want it to become awkward and us never talk, because like most kids, I love my mom.I told my mom I was sorry but I don't think that fixes anything. If anyone, ANYONE, had about the same experience happen, tell me what I should do. 

Thank you for reading. :) have a nice day"

But yeah, despite being anxious I'm definitely excited to start, and I was wondering whether any of you guys had advice about how to make the most of this summer, and contribute and learn a lot :) Some of the things I'm wondering about are: adjusting to the workplace, starting w/o much experience, balancing life and work, learning the new technologies, things one might not realize at first (e.g. etiquette, interactions), and just anything you might have advice about.

36kn6b,3,2015-05-19,"So, I haven't taken fluids but have an internship that's all about fluids... Help... Me...",nickdoof,FluidMechanics,https://www.reddit.com/r/FluidMechanics/comments/36kn6b/so_i_havent_taken_fluids_but_have_an_internship/,"Hey guys, I hope I am posting this in the right place. 

Like the title says I haven't taken fluids, yet got a really amazing internship at a great company working on water/sewage systems in a vehicle. My first task is to analyze a water system for pressure drop in a somewhat modular way (probably using Excel) so that I can see the pressure drop after various nodes throughout the system. 

Basically the system starts from a tank feeding a pump, has tons of twists and turns, inclines, declines, hubs where lines branch off, straight sections, re-circulation loops, and changes in the diameter of tubing. They want me to be able to whip this up in Excel in a way that allows me to add nodes into the system, change pipe diameter, and all the while calculate the pressure drop in total, and incrementally throughout the system. The end goal is to make sure there will be enough pressure and flow rate at the end of the system, and hopefully to reduce the size of some tubing as well. 

Now, I'm not all that fancy with Excel, but I imagine I will be soon. And I wont ask for help with that, though I am scared. What I need help with is the fluids part. I've done some research on how to calculate pressure drop and I'm a bit confused. There seem to be quite a few different equations out there to use, and as I don't have the background knowledge of the subject I'm not sure what I'm doing. 

I was advised to start by breaking the system into little sections, and calculating the pressure drop for every bend, elevation incline/decline, and straight tube. If I did this, can I add all the individual pressures together (superposition)? I guess at this point I am kind of rambling... I really need to know what equations to use, or concepts to study in order to calculate this. Adding in all the hubs and branching off of tubes will probably have to wait. 

If any fluids gurus could get me on the right track here I would be forever grateful. 

TLDR: Pressure drop equations in tubes that bend, change elevation, and diameter?!?"

I also have a ton of side projects but my only work experience is from when I did co-op in high school. They were impressed enough with my work to pay me and also hired me after my term ended. I am seriously at a loss what to do next. I live near Toronto which I know has a ton of startup companies looking to hire developers but I am not sure if its okay to apply for the full time positions (even if I have the qualifications). If I apply, what do I tell them? that I am going to be quitting in an year? I have applied to pretty much all Software developer related internship positions I could find. Any advice is appreciated.

Any input would be awesome.   Here's my situation:

I've been accepted to both USC's Marshall and Univ. of Texas' McCombs full-time programs.  Scholarships played out so when factoring cost of living, its pretty much a wash between the two schools, so I can eliminate that from the equation.  
My goals: I'd like to start a business eventually, and am planning on using the various entrepreneurial resources at whichever schools to test out some ideas.  Both programs seem to be very strong in entrepreneurship.  If whatever ideas take off while in school, I'll run with it, if not, no sweat, I'll learn from the experience.  While that's going on in the background, I'll be focusing on technology, aiming to get an internship / full-time job at a high-tech firm doing product development, project management, or strategy, depending on the company.  I currently live in San Diego, and love southern California.  I've lived a lot of places but never Texas, however Austin seems like a great place.  Socially I have a ton of friends in LA and only 1 or 2 in Austin.  
Texas seems to be the higher ranked school in most categories, and USC has been on a bit of a skid in rankings but seem to be righting the ship.  USC is known for its Alumni, and that would be key for starting a business.  
Texas seems to have a strong foothold in the tech sector, but USC is capitalizing on ""Silicon Beach"".

I'd say the 5 cities I could most see myself living in post-MBA would be: San Diego, Denver, LA, San Fran, and Phoenix.  

Any tips/opinions would help out.

My best friend (Tara), whom I've known for 4 years, talked to her boss (Joe) at her current internship and he wanted to hire me for the summer. This internship is all I've ever wanted and will be a great learning experience, but from what Tara has told me, I don't think it's something I want to be involved with.

Joe is young (26) and engaged to Kayla, whom I went to high school with. Joe started dating Kayla around September of last year, and proposed to her in January after finding out she was pregnant. According to Tara, Kayla comes into the office and is rude to all of the interns quite frequently.

The whole office talks about their relationship because Joe is very open about everything going on with them (which I find sort of unprofessional, but that's just my opinion). And from things I've heard from other interns that I'm friends with, they all cannot stand Kayla. I've known this girl my entire life and she is not a good person and does not come from a good family. Everyone in her family has issues, most notably her sister who is a habitual liar (faking pregnancies, illnesses for sympathy, miscarriages etc).

Joe told his fiancée that I was coming to intern for him during the summer and Kayla lost her mind. Kayla told Joe that I was the ""messiest person"" she knew, even though we have not spoken a word to each other since I was 16. We grew up in a small town, and a lot of the people there are always in drama. This is precisely why I avoid going home and have cut most of the people I went to high school with out of my life. Small town life is not for me, and I have no interest in knowing all of the ""gossip"" that goes on every day among these people I went to school with. I have moved two hours away, live in a large city, and now have a great group of ADULT friends whom I've met in college.

Tara told Joe that she's known me for four years and never once in those four years have I been ""messy"" or started drama with anyone else. She's my best friend, I'm pretty sure she knows me better than anyone else, so I'm glad that she stood up for me, but I don't know how much good that did. I'm embarrassed that my boss whom I haven't even met yet has this false impression of me. I admit, when I was 16 I was involved with some bad stuff that involved my boyfriend at the time and Kayla's sister, so I know that's what she's remembering...but that was six years ago when I was still a child.

If there is one thing I regret in life, it was that relationship and everything that came along with it. I have grown as a person, realized how toxic that whole relationship and situation was, and no longer talk to any of the people that were involved (including Kayla's sister).

So now my dilemma is that I'm having second thoughts about this internship. I loathe drama, and office drama is not something I want to deal with. Tara tells me about Joe and Kayla's relationship drama quite frequently, but it's not something I want to experience first hand...and the fact that this girl is bringing up things from six years ago is putting me off. She does not know me anymore. I am a completely different person than I was at 16. And the fact that Joe is telling his INTERN things his fiancee has told him just shows me that he's not really ""grown"" yet.

My sister told me I should still do it so that I can show Joe that the picture Kayla has painted of me is completely false, which I understand...I'm just not sure if it's worth the trouble. I feel like if I were a ""messy person"" like she claims, I would have already contacted her on social media. I am not going to say anything to her about it, but it's sort of upsetting that she is trying to sabotage a really good opportunity for me when she really doesn't know me anymore. So now I'm not sure if I should take the internship or go ahead and pass on it.

**TL;DR** A girl I went to high school with is trying to sabotage my internship at her fiancé's firm before it even begins. She told him a bunch of things about me from high school (6+ years ago) and has basically painted a completely false picture of me. Now I'm having second thoughts about taking the internship because if this type of things is happening before I even get there, no telling what will happen once I'm in the office every day...so should I avoid this internship and look for other opportunities? Or take it because it's everything I've ever wanted in an internship?   "

I opted for the Non-Retina Pro model at the time of purchase due to the larger price gap between the non-retina and the retina model at the time as well as the ability to get a ""higher-spec"" model for a lower price in order to handle multi-tasking and gaming purposes. As a college student I find myself not gaming at all. I mainly use my laptop now for Microsoft Office, searching the interwebs, streaming TV shows and movies, Skyping, light photo-editing using the built in Photos App, listening to music, and playing the occasional game of League of Legends... so not heavy use. However, I do like to keep multiple tabs in Safari open (5+) and like to leave apps such as iTunes, Skype, iMessages, Mail, Finder, and an Office app running at the same time. I also often connect my laptop to an external monitor. As a student I'm on the go a lot, taking my laptop to classes and internships as well as when I'm traveling, as such, I'm considering getting the Macbook 2015 due to its portability and the Retina display. It's a gorgeous laptop but its performance concerns me. Will the base model be well equipped to handle all these tasks (and keep multiple apps/tabs open)? Or should I consider upgrading to the 1.2 GHz model (it's hard to justify spending more money on an already pricey laptop though)?

Im her first bf, kiss and everything. She works a lot currently for her internship which will be over soon and i'll be starting one shortly, so we generally see each other on the weekend or a friday night, which is fine. Every 2 weeks or so everything is wonderful, we talk a lot and laugh and smile and it makes me really happy, then all of a sudden it will flip for a week or so where she'll barely talk to me and be generally rude, with one word answers and basically ignore me. But then of course it picks up again when shes in a good mood and acts as if everything fine, this has been happening for a good 2 months now. 

 I do a lot for her, driving her places, helping her out when she's sick, being there when shes had a shit day at work, somethings gone wrong or she's just feeling lonely or wants to chat. Half the time im not in a great mood as I have exams and major assignments which are stressing me out and make me tired, but I put that aside for a moment to help her out and make sure shes okay, always be there to listen because im her boyfriend and i love her.

Earlier this week I was at my parents house which is 3 hours away, she had an essay to do before the next day and wasnt doing it until 10pm because she was being sulky. I was ready to go to sleep at 11:30 and recieved texts from her about how dumb the essay is and she feels lonely. And wanted a pep talk and to keep her motivated when writing it. So I did, I kept talking and replying as she updated me on her word count every 15 mins or so. I was really struggling to stay awake when it hit 3am and hasnt heard from her in a half an hour so i messaged asking if she was done? and got a reply at 3:30 ""oh yeah, done a little while ago, tired, goodnight"". That really upset me as my sleep pattern is now fucked and was really tired the next day and of course i didnt let her know that. And im starting to get really hurt when this putting your SO above yourself is not reciprocated, Sometimes when i've had a bad day or feel lonely i send her a message and ramble on about my day and tell her something im excited about just because i want to talk to my girlfriend, and i'll get back a ""haha okies"", I'll even tell her i'm feeling lonely can we talk for a bit and still get back answers that lead to nowhere. When she's in moods like this i'll say i miss her and she'll just ignore it, which really hurts as she frequently does that to me and of course i reciprocate. 

Of course she can be wonderful at times, very caring and want to hang out with me, tell me about everything and help motivate me through uni when it sucks. But I just don't know what to do. She's a self confessed introvert so bad days at work make her not chatty, but id much rather her say i need alone time rather than ignore me. And i'd totally respect that. At the moment it just hurts and i feel unloved when I feel I can't reach out to her unless she's had a good day at work which is terrible. The only time where she'll seemingly snap out of it is if something really bad has happened and I have to be super upset.

 I'd feel so much better to get a simple smiley face, goodnight text or i miss you at the end of the day, even if thats all she has to say, just to feel like I still exist when she's in a mood. But when shes tired thats too much to expect. She's also said to me that when she feels like this she just doesn't like me as much as she likes herself. How do I deal with this? I don't want to have to feel that i can only text her when she texts me first or inferior.

My husband,21, has a 720 credit score. He's currently bringing home $2,000ish a month. However, he just graduated and once he finds a new job his pay will substantially increase. I'm working two jobs that are really crucial experiences for my career. I just began both, and my fingerprints are clearing. I know my pay rate, but the hours are still shaky. So, I can't estimate pay. I'm assuming at least 3k this summer from my income.

We have one car and we really need another. I'll be doing an internship, he'll be working full time, so we need another car. We have 4k in savings and 500ish in our checking for monthly expenses. Our overall expenses are about $1k-1,500 a month. We plan on buying another car in August. 

We bought our last car outright. We're looking for something that will last with a high mpg. I'm expecting to spend 10-15k. I haven't research cars yet.

Will a car loan help build our credit? Is it better to pay off as much as we can at once? My dad said financing something and paying it off slowly will build our credit best...If I can find a super low APR is that a good option?? Is finding a low APR and paying monthly an option? I don't think we'll be able to afford to pay for the entire car by August unless he gets a new job or my jobs end up having a lot of hours.  

We are young. And, we both come from very poor families. We want to start planning our financial future. I'll be graduating next year. Once we are both employed in our fields our combined income will be at least $70k a year. So, once he switches jobs we'll be able to pay the car off fast.

so let me be honest, i get paid 51 usd per month, this is supposed to be just a little help for all the interns but i think im doing too much for them and i dont really feel like my hard work is being paid, so the first week they asked me to check a finished system they had to quizz the workers about the company history and all of that, i found a lot of bugs and bad programming practices so i corrected them all and they asked me to design a system from scratch, i almost finished this system with python/flask and angular, working so hard to make this entire system a single page app, this system is for evaluating employees competences so the company can help them to improve in certain competences that they need for their corporate culture, its a really big company here in mexico its named CFE, its from the government but i really really feel that they dont apretiate my effort enough, im currently looking for better internship outside my country since my university has this international internship program where you can study and work abroad...

so TL;DR: working in a company as an intern, horrible php developers(they made me fix a php system with 120 files), made a way better one and im about to finish it but dont want to because of my salary and because they dont appreciate my effort enough.

What would you recommend me to do? 
please excuse my horrible English since im not a native speaker and i did my best here(tried).

36m3i5,0,2015-05-20,How to spot a 'good' front-end developer?,Lukk1989,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/36m3i5/how_to_spot_a_good_frontend_developer/,"Hi,

I'm a front-end dev with 2 years of experience (excluding internships) and I'd like to know how you guys can spot a good or 'bad' front-end developer. Why am I asking? Because I'm currently working at a web agency company where there was only one front-end developer before I started there. That front-end dev has 10 years of experience and is said to be a 'good developer' by colleagues. I am almost certain that he's considered a good developer because the websites he makes look nice. Does that make someone a good front-end dev? Because when I check his code I can see so many things that (I think) could be better. I started at the company because I want to improve and become a better (maybe the best!) front-end developer. And I'm wondering if I'm at the right place.

For example he has never heard of the term BEM before. What kind of front-end dev has not heard of this and is not using this? Also sometimes he makes stylesheets with ALL styles in 1 file. He says he does it so he can work faster and he will (or will not) divide them into partials later on. Now he doesn't do that anymore after I told him though. He only recently started using preprocessors. He seems the be behind on some things. More importantly he has alot of indented code. Some selectors can be like .class li a .child strong. Also code reusability is a biggy. I always try to make things as modular as possible. So if you move that same element somewhere else you expect it will work in the same way. But he adds layout styles to the modular class itself. For example a button which always has margin-top: 20px;. What if you re-use that same button somewhere else? If I point it out to him he does change it. But I shouldn't have to do this right? He should know this.

Don't take me wrong, he makes good looking websites and is pretty good at js and webdesign as well. I just expected more. I expected someone who is a master at html/css/js.

So I'm wondering if this is how a front end dev with 10 years of experience operates. Are there any other people with similar experiences? I sometimes feel like I know things better but he has more experience so 'he should know the better way'."

This internship I got is through a program for teens and is only for the summer. It's a document management position and I get paid well (for my age at least). I haven't started work yet but I just had a site visit with my new workplace and honestly, I am overwhelmed and nervous. This is my first *real* job working in an office and as giving me a tour and an overview, I'm just thinking to myself ""what the hell did I get myself into, this seems bigger than me"". 

Everything just happened so fast. I interviewed and got the job, and I'm happy for myself that I achieved that but man, things just seem to be changing so fast in my life right now (moving to a new house, getting ready for college, earning a summer internship). I'm also going to have to start riding the city bus for the first time regularly and I'm also pretty nervous for that too. 

All in all, I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance. I know I'm probably overthinking it all and everyone I met at my new workplace seemed friendly enough. I'm just afraid of... Failing and not being able to handle it I guess? And it's not like I'm not used to working hard, I do believe that I've worked hard in school and at my current workplace, it's just that everything is happening so quickly that I wasn't really prepared for it. 

Edit: Thanks for the words of reassurance and general positiveness! It's amazing how strangers on the internet can help a person feel better :) "
36mywj,1,2015-05-20,"Me [22/F] with my girlfriend [22/F] of almost two years; I was molested about a year ago and it's severely affected my behavior. She doesn't know, and recently broke up with me because of my behavior. Advice needed.",thr0w4wayb3causeduh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36mywj/me_22f_with_my_girlfriend_22f_of_almost_two_years/,"Hi there, /r/relationships. I'm here because I'm in a massive fucking pickle. This might take a while, so settle in. And please, just hang in there and help me, if you can.

Almost two years ago, I met the most amazing woman. Essentially, she was everything I'd ever dreamed of in a partner, and we got into a relationship through pure luck on my part, obviously. We were immensely happy together, and were convinced that we wanted to be together for the rest of our lives. Eventually, I proposed to her and she accepted. We then started planning our lives together; moving in together, how my dog would adjust to living in an apartment instead of a house, where we'd put our massive book collection, all that good stuff that made me smile just thinking about it.

Being her girlfriend made me happier than I've ever been in a relationship. Without a doubt, it was the best relationship I'd ever been in (for some reason, I'd always been in extremely shitty relationships, so this was a huge change for me), and I was elated that I'd found *the one*.

The month I proposed, I started an internship with a publishing company. Let me just say right now that I'm not the best at change, and working there was a massive change for me. Because I was the youngest in the department, and an intern at that, I'd always make it a point to show up early to get a jump on the work emails my boss had sent me overnight. Whenever I got into work, an older woman, Trish, would always be present. Trish didn't work in the same department, but she did a lot of work with the department, so she'd always be popping over to my desk to check on how I was doing.

At first, I just thought she was being friendly and trying to help me get settled in, but she began to make flirty comments and call me things like, ""love"", ""babe"", etc. The first few times she did it, my boss was around, and my boss would just laugh at how absurd it looked -- a woman her age flirting with me.

However, towards the end of my first week, I began to realize that she'd always be there when I came into the office, about half an hour before anyone else got there. Again, I didn't think anything of it, but she'd start following me around the office, to the kitchen, the conference room, etc., and just getting in my way, which meant that I'd constantly have to avoid bumping into her. Around this time, she started touching me -- putting her arm around my waist, touching my hair, brushing against my breasts, crotch, or ass -- not enough to be seen as purposeful, but still awkward, though she'd laugh it off whenever it happened.

Towards the middle of my second week there, I was sitting at my desk about an hour before work was due to start, and Trish asked if I could help her change one of the lights in the conference room. Up till then, she'd still played these incidents off as accidents, so I wasn't extremely wary of her or anything like that.

Because she was so much older, I said that I'd help her out. I went into the conference room, and she essentially had me climb a ladder, fixing the lights, while she ran her hands up and down my legs and ass. There wasn't very much I could do, because I was on a ladder, holding a tube light. By the time I finished fixing the light, people were starting to come into the office, and my boss was already at her desk. Without waiting for me to say anything, Trish said, ""Sorry for stealing your intern; /u/thr0w4wayb3causeduh was just helping me change the lights in the conference room."", clearly cutting me off so I couldn't say anything to my boss.

This continued to happen throughout the time that I was there, escalating, at points, to her attempting to get me to touch her or go down on her, and grinding against my ass, or trying to touch me. For the most part, I tried to avoid her, but I couldn't do very much to help the situation at all.

This is because my girlfriend and I were in a long-distance relationship, and I'd taken the internship because it was based in her country. Because of this, I didn't want them to fire me, since if they did, I have really no excuse to be in the country at all, and would've had to go back home. Another reason I didn't want to tell anyone is because my mother is insanely homophobic, and she would have blamed me in an instant once she came to know about it. This meant that I'd just try to come into work as late as possible, despite my duties of replying emails and getting back to clients and just setting up the office.

Once my internship ended, I didn't speak to anyone about it ever again and just tried to block it out. It's been almost a year since it happened, Reddit, and this is the first time I'm sharing this with anyone. The reason I'm doing this is because despite me not trying to let it affect me, it clearly has affected me.

It's affected my mental state immensely, my ability to talk about emotions, and it's affected my sex drive and levels of intimacy. This change in me has been noticed by my girlfriend, who told me this weekend that she can't be with someone like me because all I do is try to hurt her with what I say, and that she feels like I'm not physically attracted to her and that I don't want to be intimate with her. She broke up with me, just like that. Reddit, I think she's the most amazing woman I've ever met, and I can't be without her. She's the best part of my life, and is undoubtedly the best person I know.

I can't lose her like this, because of something that's been weighing on me for a year. I want to tell her what happened to me, but I don't want her to think that I'm using it as an excuse to ask for a second chance, but I want her to know that it really isn't me to act this way.

I want her to know, because she deserves to know what happened to me, why I've become this person. I want to fix myself so that I can be the person she fell in love with again, because I cannot be without her. I hate that I'm so affected by this, and that my shitty behavior because of this has caused me to take her for granted and has pushed her away. That being said, while I want to tell her, I'm also afraid of how I'm going to explain how embarrassed, humiliated and angry I was/am with myself, if she asks me why I took so long to tell her what happened. Reddit, please, please help me. What should I do?
   
**TL;DR**: I was molested while working as an intern. It's severely affected my behavior (ability to talk about emotions, niceness, intimacy and sex drive), and because of this, I hurt my amazing girlfriend, who broke up with me. She doesn't know what happened since I haven't talked about it up until this post. I want to fix things. What should I do?"

36n1d8,3,2015-05-20,I'm nearly at my limit. How to tell my boss I can't deal with the added work?,haitechan,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/36n1d8/im_nearly_at_my_limit_how_to_tell_my_boss_i_cant/,"Hello! I'm a 28F, working at an small company. The thing is that we have a strong workload and since it's an small company, a person is expected to do more than one project. Until last year it was fine. I was handling two projects (which is a lot, since they involve community work, coordination with several people involved, monitoring and doing reports) and I was fine with the work load since I really like challenges and learning new things.

This year, a shiny new project appeared and while I was not initially involved, I'm good with that particular subject and slowly I began to get more and more involved. That specific project needs an obsessive attention to detail (which is an skill I don't have) and I have made several mistakes, not too big, but still. To make things worse, that project is taking a lot of my time, since I need to focus more for those tiny details and I'm neglecting my main projects, which are the base for my work evaluation. And it was less than stellar last year.

I've told my boss several times to resign from the task but we can't hire a new person right now, so basically I was told to keep at it. We have a young guy as an intern doing some of the more routine tasks but he also goes to university so his help is limited. The other guy who is responsible of this project is also very busy with other tasks related to his project and to other projects. So, if it isn't me, nobody else can do that.

I'm at my limit. Aside from the two projects I had last year, I have this new project, and a new one (related to those two I handle) has came up. Oh and also I'm expected to do yet another project. So that makes 5 projects and that's a lot for a single person to handle. I'm also studying for a master's degree and seriously I don't know how I've managed to keep my sanity up to this point. I'm an Aspie and I have been VERY close to have a full meltdown at the office. Thankfully I have had those under control but one of this days I know I'm going to blow up and things are not going to be so good since my meltdowns involve a lot of sarcasm, shouting at people and crying. No good at all. 

So, how can I tell my boss that I can't handle all of that before I explode? I really don't want to disclose being an Aspie. I'm not from US or Europe and disability aids are non-existing here and autism is still not well understood. "
36n3sg,7,2015-05-20,Getting first programming job as a recent grad in Kansas City,BenMcLean,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36n3sg/getting_first_programming_job_as_a_recent_grad_in/,"I am in somewhat of a unique and seemingly disadvantageous situation here and could really use some advice as to my next move. I've looked at some of the FAQs and they seem to be telling people to do stuff that it's too late for me to have done at this point.

I love programming. Always have. It's something I'm good at, and probably better at than most of my classmates in college -- although not as good as people with real professional experience I'm sure. But my point is that I really want to do some programming, not IT or academic research.

I have a visual disability ([congenital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder) [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus)) so that my vision is bad enough that I cannot obtain a driver's license, but good enough that I can't seem to qualify for aid to the blind. In 2008, I found it was impossible to get started in any professional job without a degree.

So I worked very hard over the past 6 years to make it through college mostly on student loans. Last week, I graduated from UMKC with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a second full Bachelors of Arts in Philosophy. I took up the philosophy because I needed something that would be easy (easy for me anyway) to space out the more difficult math courses (I had to take Calculus II three times before I passed it) so that I didn't have to take them on all at once. And then it was just one more semester's worth of classes to turn it into a full Bachelors so I went with that.

I had to be enrolled full time to keep my college apartment (since as a non-driver, living on campus was mandatory for my situation, not optional) and work-study job and I couldn't get into any internships because getting transportation to the internship and back to the college in time for classes every day just wouldn't work for a non-driver. So I was struggling to pass those last few classes right up until finals week. I made it! And so I'm starting my jobs search only now, in late May.

Unfortunately, I seem to be finding that most, if not all employers expect you to have either experience from an internship or else at least a 3.0 GPA to get started as a developer and I have neither. My major GPA is 3.0, but my cumulative GPA's pretty pathetic. (2.3) Although I'm looking at a few grade replacements the college should have done that might bump it up a bit, it's not gonna be a 3.0.

So how does someone in this situation find work? It seems like a really daunting task. I'm nervous as hell talking to employers, and that comes out as talking way too much. But I have come up with a [decent looking resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N0Wsa2RfejpCZMTgrDndLLlzLMDjiyQuTquaXRIpQas/edit?usp=sharing). I am confident that if I can get into a place that's willing to train me in how to use their tools, I can contribute and succeed. But getting that first start is the trouble. Any suggestions?

What kind of companies should I be looking for and where should I be looking for them?

What salary should I be asking for?

Is there anything I can do ***at this point*** to improve my chances of reaching my goal? (I don't want to hear about stuff I should have done while I was in college. It's too late for that)"

*Little backstory:* I'm currently studying mechatronical engineering at one of the polish Technical Universities. For those who are not aware what mechatronics is (don't feel bad, by my experience few people are), it's a mix of different fields consisting of mechanics, electronics and IT. 
This is my fourth semester so far and in 3 years I should be looking for a job. When I began my studies there were 120 of us, now we're closing on to 30.


*Why am I here?*
 I'm not writing this to whine, even if I cursed my choice on more than one occasion, I'm generally quite pleased. If this subreddit teached me something important about getting a degree it's that engineering is usually not an easy career choice and if you are studying it, complaining comes naturally with it. 

The simple facts are, by studying a synergic subject as complex as mine, you can't hope to learn everything there is to know about mechanics or electronics, therefore I have some question to those more advanced in their studies or simply wiser than me.

 1. Should I focus on some aspect of mechatronics rather than the whole?

 2. What are the probable career paths for someone like me around the world?

 3. Is internship at Nokia or other software based company a good choice? (I've had courses on C, C++, C# &amp; Assembler)

 4. Should I consider switching fields if the current one shows little promise or is it too late? (In poland we get first degree in 3,5 years so, I'm rather close.)

 5. For european students: do you recommend mechatronical engineering in your University? Yes/no, why, where? Should I think about going there for a semester or two?

I had a scholarship and my parents paid the rest, so I'm debt free besides a truck.

Some job history.. I started at an event management company part time in high school as an intern working after school every day.  Fast forward 4 and a half years and I was the warehouse manager/event coordinator making $12 an hour.  As soon as i graduated (a few weeks ago) i was placed on the company DoD (simulation) contract making 37,500 per year w/ eh benefits and 3 weeks paid vacation a year.  I think the DoD is a great opportunity for me.  Although i am a contractor, I am confident that I can get a government position in a few years because I am a hard worker, young, etc.  I will be making tons of contacts, building my credentials, etc.  I am very happy about this new opportunity with the DoD, but the company I have been with for years and I am still technically under, sucks.  There is no room for vertical development within the company, it is a pain to get reimbursed for anything, tempers flairing constantly, etc.  It is very very small... under 10 employees.  However, I could probably get out within a year and work solely for the gov't.

On the flip side... An old coworker at my current job has landed a job doing medical simulation and really wants me on board over there.  All the management over there really likes me and wants me on.  I am having a meeting with them hopefully at the end of this week to discuss some tweaks to my resume to fill their position.  I would be making 40-42k starting there, with better benefits, a larger corporation, better culture, more interesting work, and tons of room for advancement.  I could be making 55k within a year or two.

I am not sure what to do.  With DoD spending going down the tubes, the simulation industry could be going downhill and i could lose my job.  However, i could also land an awesome government position if i play my cards right and have a fruitful career.  But in the meantime... my current job isn't all that great.  The medical simulation job, on the other hand, would yield greater pay and room for advancement, sooner.

I feel very fortunate for these opportunities because a lot of people can't find jobs and I have such a general degree.  

Any advice on what to do??

It gives the perspective of extreme careerist oriented, status obsessed female college students in the USA who say they prefer drunk hookup culture because it involves less time and commitment. They want to invest all their time and energy in their late teens and twenties to build impressive resumes by joining ridiculous amounts of school clubs, after-school activities, projects, internships to foster the connections and qualifications necessary for social climbing and scaling the career ladder. For that they willingly sacrifice normal more long term male-female relationships for the type of dubious fling described below.

&gt;“You go in, and they take you down to a dark basement,” Haley, a blond, pink-cheeked senior, recalled of her first frat parties in freshman year. “There’s girls dancing in the middle, and there’s guys lurking on the sides and then coming and basically pressing their genitals up against you and trying to dance.” 


&gt;Dancing like that felt good but dirty, and like a number of girls, Haley said she had to be drunk in order to enjoy it. Women said universally that hookups could not exist without alcohol, because they were for the most part too uncomfortable to pair off with men they did not know well without being drunk. One girl, explaining why her encounters freshman and sophomore year often ended with fellatio, said that usually by the time she got back to a guy’s room, she was starting to sober up and didn’t want to be there anymore, and giving the guy oral sex was an easy way to wrap things up and leave. 


&gt;In November of Haley’s freshman year, a couple of months after her first tentative “Difmos,” or dance-floor makeouts, she went to a party with a boy from her floor. She had too much to drink, and she remembered telling him that she wanted to go home. 


&gt;Instead, she said, he took her to his room and had sex with her while she drifted in and out of consciousness. She woke up with her head spinning. The next day, not sure what to think about what had happened, she described the night to her friends as though it were a funny story: I was so drunk, I fell asleep while I was having sex! She played up the moment in the middle of the night when the guy’s roommate poked his head in the room and asked, “Yo, did you score?” 


&gt;Only later did Haley begin to think of what had happened as rape — a disturbingly common part of many women’s college experience. In a 2007 survey funded by the Justice Department of 6,800 undergraduates at two big public universities, nearly 14 percent of women said they had been victims of at least one completed sexual assault at college; more than half of the victims said they were incapacitated from drugs or alcohol at the time. 


&gt;The close relationship between hooking up and drinking leads to confusion and disagreement about the line between a “bad hookup” and assault. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, 10 to 16 forcible sex offenses were reported annually to campus security as taking place on Penn’s campus or in the immediate neighborhood. 


&gt;In January, Penn announced that it was forming a commission, led by a faculty member, to study the impact of alcohol and drug use on campus, with a particular focus on sexual violence. 


&gt;When drinking is involved, Haley said, “Guys assume that the default answer is always yes.” 


&gt;“I think a lot of guys get the idea: ‘O.K., this girl’s coming to this party, and she’s drinking. That means her goal of the night is to hook up with somebody,’ ” she said. “They’re like, ‘O.K., she came out, and if she dressed like that, it must mean that she wanted to hook up.’ ” 


&gt;A friend of hers, Kristy, shared a story about a different kind of coercion. She had been making out with a guy at his house, not sure how far she wanted to go, when he stood up and told her, “Get down on your knees.” 


&gt;At first she froze. “I was really taken aback, because I was like, no one has ever said that to me before,” she said. Then he said something like, “ ‘I think that’s fair,’ ” she recalled. When she still hesitated, he pushed her down. 


&gt;“It was at that point that I was like, ‘I’ll just do it,’ ” she said. “I was like, ‘ “It will be over soon enough.’ ”

The biggest being the usefulness of multiple monitors.  Additionally, I recently realized that my Lenovo Y50 was not as portable as I thought it would be at college.  I planned to take it to classes and such but with the mouse, average battery life, and bulk, I ended up not carrying it unless I absolutely needed to.  

So with these two things in mind I did some research and found that you can link two laptop screens via synergy.  Thus, my new plan is to get a small laptop for a relatively cheap amount to act in both of these capacities (portable and monitor).  

I am a programmer so I like to work on one screen and have references on the other; i.e. the small laptop would mostly just be to pull up a browser with some tabs.  But I would also like if it were able to run eclipse so I could program more easily.  

**So the specs I am looking for would be:**  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Country - USA  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Price - Preferably less than $200 and $350 absolute maximum  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Screen - Preferably 13"" or 15""  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RAM - Probably &gt;2 GB for eclipse  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hard Drive - Probably just needs to be &gt;128GB in case of virtual box or something  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Battery Life - High  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Weight - Low  
   
Thank you guys for all of your help.  I hope everything is clear and if not just holler.
  
Oh yeah.  I also forgot to ask about an SSD for the Y50 as another note.  As far as I can tell the SSD will fit within the housing but I thought it might be good to hear some confirmation.

36nugr,2,2015-05-20,"Job Offer Scam [Louisiana, USA]",ElmoTheRapist,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/36nugr/job_offer_scam_louisiana_usa/,"I'm so, so sorry about the length of this post. It's just important I get all the details out. I'll give a **TL;DR: excoworker is claiming he works for a refinery now, can get me a job, is trying to scam money out of me, I'm not stupid, should I go to the cops?**

In 2010, I started work at a grocery store a few minutes from my house. This is where I met this guy, let's call him B, who also worked there. For a short while, B and my sister were talking but that ended suddenly and when I asked my sister what happened all she told me was that B had ""problems with lying."" Fast forward in time and B quit the store job and a few months after that he made it onto my parish's (LA) inmates page because he stole a check from his grandfather. B disappeared for a few years and I never heard from him again. Fast forward to about a month ago he came in the store, where I still work, and him and I had a conversation. In this conversation I told him I'm looking to leave the store because this fall I'm taking a class which requires me to have a job or internship in my major, the oil and gas industry. He said he was working at a refinery in Baton Rouge, LA and that he would talk to his boss for me. Fast forward another week when I'm at work doing something in the warehouse and a coworker comes find me and says that someone's looking for me. So I step out the warehouse and there's B and his (I'm assuming) girlfriend. He nervously says ""Hey man, got some place we can talk?"" I told him ""yeah, right here's fine whats up?"" B then tells me that he talked to his boss for me and the boss says he wants me to start ASAP, pitches the job to me including great pay, great benefits, and that his boss would pay off any student debt. Sounds too good to be true, right? So then he says he needs $10 for him to give his boss for me so I can come to the refinery and take an aptitude test on basic safety protocol stuff. Alright, this is suspicious as shit but hell it's just $10. So I give him $10, and he says alright man, my boss is gonna give you a call Monday. That was a Friday. Waited all weekend for Monday and lo and behold, no call Monday. It's worthy to note that this whole weekend I was expecting him to be bullshitting me but I figured $10 was worth the gamble on whether or not he's lying to me. 

I thought that was the end of it until last night. I was sitting outside on the swings at my grandmother's house as I usually do on my off nights when suddenly my girlfriend texts me ""Answer your phone!"" Little FYI, both me and her work at that store mentioned earlier. I work stock, she works the service desk and the office. I asked her what was up and she said ""[Refinery] just called for you at the store, I gave them your number and they said they'll be calling you soon."" So I figure ""Sweet! B wasn't bullshitting me!"" I rush home and wait for a phone call. Five minutes later, my phone starts ringing and something caught my eye. It was a Kenner, LA number calling. Here's a little LA geography lesson. Kenner is close to NOLA and easily an hour and a half drive from Baton Rouge. That's odd, why would a refinery in Baton Rouge be calling me from a Kenner number? So I answer it. ""Hello?"" ... ""Hello is this [shortened version of my first name] [last name]?"" I recognized the voice after the first three words. It's B. So I play along. ""Yeah this is Larry from [refinery name] and I'm calling about a job inquiry."" I knew something was up at that very second. Why would B be on the phone lying about who he was? So I played along some more until ""Mr. Larry"" says ""So you'll start out at $25 an hour, and after 30 days you'll receive your benefits ***and all that good shit***."" Now I'm new to this job hunting game but I do know one thing, no professional would ever curse like that on the phone. So I let the conversation die and then we hang up. 

Fast forward to just 2 hours ago where I wake up to a text message from the **same exact number that called me last night** saying ""Hey man, it's B. Congrats on the job bro"" I ignore it. Not 30 minutes later I get this text from **the same fucking number** saying 

*""Hello mr [shortened version of my first name], this is MR larry with [refinery name] in baton rouge we need a security deposit for your test and uniforms. $ 80 is the total you. Can you bring your money to [B] before he comes to work in a hour""*

That is the exact text message. Here's what I replied word for word:

*""But 'mr Larry' how are you texting me on the same number [B] just texted me on if he's not at work yet?""*

""Larry"" then claimed they were in a meeting together. Then a different number texted me telling me it was B saying it's his personal phone and suggesting we meet at the store I work at so I can give him the $80. I ignored it. Then back to the other phone number saying *""[B] just texted me saying hes waiting for you at [store]""* All while typing this out I've been getting phone calls from private numbers and the whole nine yards.

So my question is, should I go to the cops with this and report it as a scam/fraud? Some friends are telling me I should, and my stepdad and mother are telling me to leave it alone and block him. I really don't want to call the cops because I believe B is on some drugs and the guy knows where I work, the times I work, and might even remember where I live from that one time he came by the house when he was talking to my sister. But I think I don't have much other choice. If I had the means I would arm myself to the teeth but that's not an option out of respect for my mother's belief on guns since I still live under her roof, and the fact I don't have a concealed carry permit yet."

Can you suggest me any filling lunch menus that will keep well during travel and will also be satisfying, so I can avoid whatever sugar &amp; calorie bombs there may be at the office.

36oa3e,2,2015-05-20,"Good academics, good skills, getting over an illness and resume' stinks. Advice?",mirfine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/36oa3e/good_academics_good_skills_getting_over_an/,"I have a bit of a problem.  I did great in school--had a full academic scholarship to a good university, and graduated with a 3.8 GPA in English Lit.  Towards the end of college, things started going downhill.  I developed an illness--I call it a spiritual illness, but it's been diagnosed as a mental one.  The good news is I'm very much better than I have been, well enough that I'm sure I can finally hold down a regular job.  The bad news is that my resume stinks.  TL; DR of the resume is that I have tons of jobs that only lasted a couple of months, in part because of the illness.  I did pretty good at most of the jobs.  I worked hard.  But sometimes I got sick and couldn't show.

If you want the full version of the resume: (Most of these are part time)  I've got the 2- and 3-month jobs I had during the summer when I was in college, then a few tutoring jobs that lasted four months because I joined the companies in the middle of the school year (twice), a couple of retail jobs--one of which I left because I got sick, but which lasted a good while, a job that I never should have taken because I cannot manage 10 kids at a time (2 months), one! job that lasted a year but I left because he paid five measly bucks an hour, then another stint at the same place that lasted a couple of months (went back 'cause he doubled my wage; left 'cause he didn't give me fewer kids like he'd promised and the stress was killing me)  an internship that didn't work out--I got a major cough that lasted a month and couldn't go enough--and two jobs that I held at the same time but left because my life was in danger (seriously--and no, that's not the mental illness talking), and also because of the illness.  In fact, I left a few of them because of the illness, combined with the factors I mentioned.  Most of those were part-time to supplement the SSI I get, but I shot myself in the foot by leaving when I didn't need to supplement my ""income"" anymore.  Oh, and they're spaced out over the course of the past twelve years, with months and years between them.  Now, I'm trying to get something full time.  

But I don't think I'm going to find anything (I haven't so far), because nobody wants to hire somebody who only keeps a job for a couple of months.  I'm better.  I am.  But I can't prove it.  And if I go in saying ""oh, btw, I've got this illness"" to explain the job history, they're going to pass on me 'cause they don't want the headache of the illness.

I also shot myself in the foot a couple of times by taking some of the short jobs off my resume' but leaving them on my LinkedIn profile :(.  

I write well.  Usually.  I type quickly, like most English majors.  I'm good at customer service, and I'm pretty smart.  I just haven't been able to hold down a job, and now that I'm positive I can, I can't prove it.

So Reddit.  Any advice?

**TL;DR** for the rest of this post: Lots of research, a couple presentations/posters on those. Decent and ongoing clinical volunteering. Quite a bit of non-clinical volunteering, mostly teaching-related. 122 hours physician shadowing, varying specialties. ECs include leadership roles in large premed club, starting a shadowing program, being on an advisory council to the dean of the college, leading teams for healthcare alternative spring break for two years and some other random stuff. Should have strong LoRs from two science profs, one philosophy prof, and my two PIs. Honors include Interdisciplinary Honors and Departmental Honors. 

Research: Worked in a pulmonary and critical care lab (UW affiliated) for 2 years. Presented a poster at UW's Undergraduate Research Symposium for this. I was first author, I guess. Did a talk at the same symposium this Spring for my work at a biotechnology company. I've been working there since last January, and we are submitting a paper currently. I'll be one of the authors, right smack dab in the middle of the pack.

Volunteering (clinical) – Burn Unit at Harborview Medical Center. Only got about 40 hours because the program had some scheduling issues. I've been volunteering at an HIV/AIDS house that has both inpatient and outpatient basically providing companionship, 4 hours a week. I started that a couple months ago and will be there for the next year. Also am starting a patient navigator position soon with UW school of medicine's student-run free clinic at a transitional housing organization.

Physician shadowing: 122 hours total (with some DO and PA), 107 hours MD, various specialties (lots of primary care, some internal med, peds, surgery, and gastro)

Non-clinical volunteering:
-36 hours as a teaching assistant at Garfield High School in an underachieving science class
-2 weeks as a volunteer English teacher on the Taiwanese island of Kinmen. Taught 3rd graders and tried to avoid land mines on the beach.

ECs:

-Honors: Part of the Honors Program (Interdisciplinary Honors) and getting Departmental Honors from Biology.

-Treasurer of the Alpha Epsilon Delta Premed club on campus, which is a huge club at my school. Managed to keep us out of the red. Not medically related at all but it was my first role as a campus leader and I learned a LOT. Weekly meetings and lots of extra activities.

-This year: Vice President of Internal Affairs at the same club. I've started a shadowing program that links our best members (through blinded application) with University of Washington physicians for shadowing. We had 40 physicians participating this year. I basically consider myself a professional email-sender at this point. Still have the weekly meetings and extra activities, plus lots of volunteering events with the organizations we partner with (Check Your Boobies, Epilepsy Foundation, Hope Heart)

-Two years (continuing) membership of the Arts and Sciences Advisory Council for Students. We meet weekly with the Dean of A&amp;S to talk about matters concerning the progress of our college. Has taught me a lot about the operation of universities and interdisciplinary learning.

-Two years of being a team leader for Healthcare Alternative Spring Break. Basically we put together a week of shadowing in rural Washington for other prehealth students, and then lead the group during the week. We also volunteer at the local high school for a morning during our trip to present on our experiences with higher education. This entails bi-weekly meetings for organization purposes and lots of calling and emailing to organize the shadowing.

-Undergraduate Research Leader with the UW's Undergraduate Research Program. Our goal is to promote undergraduate research among students and help them find opportunities. We have monthly-ish meetings to plan, we table around campus to spread the word, and do class announcements. We also help put on the Undergrad Research Symposium by screening and editing people's abstracts.

Employment history:

-I'm technically a paid intern at the biotech company, and work there part time. I worked there full time last summer and will be working there full time during my gap year.

-Paid research assistant for an NIH/NIDDK study at Harborview with the Kidney Research Institute. Duration was full time for one summer. I helped the research coordinators and actually got a lot of patient interaction by doing consents and patient visits.

-I also teach flute every summer for side income. Just a few hours a week.

Interest in rural health: yes

LoRs: Will be getting one from my philosophy professor, one from my medical physiology professor (he is an MD), one from my histology professor, one from my previous PI (he is an MD/PhD) and one from my current PI (he is an MD, but does a lot of research and is pretty well-known within the UW research system). I think my letters should be decently strong!

And if you managed to slog through all this, THANK YOU! And thanks to anyone who responds for the input. I realize that applying wisely is more than half of the battle."

First, the background story...

After suffering from some mysterious cramps in my lower right quadrant and on-and-off fevers for about two weeks, I decided in early May that I'd go see a doctor to check up on these symptoms. He sent me to take a CT scan, in which the doctors found that my appendix was extremely large. They had never seen anything quite like it. They told me I needed to go to the ER right away, and I obliged. After showing my surgeon my CT scan photos, he informed me that I needed an appendectomy (removal of the appendix) immediately. 

What was supposed to be a 45 minute laparoscopic surgery quickly turned into a four hour open appendectomy with an incision of about five inches when they realized that my appendix was too large to remove laparoscopically and that my colon was also inflamed. The surgeon said that it looked like I had Crohn's Disease.

I refused to believe this and convinced myself that I instead had chronic appendicitis. I stayed in the hospital for seven days recovering from the surgery, not eating or drinking until the last two days. The recovery was pretty brutal with intense abdominal pain that restricted my breathing and intense nausea and vomiting of stomach bile. At one point, they decided shove a tube all the way from my nostril into my stomach to pump out all the juices in my stomach just so I could get a decent night of sleep. I eventually recovered, and I finally got my JP tube and 15 staples removed today. After a pathology test taken on my appendix, however, it was confirmed that I have Crohn's.

I'm really lost at this point. I've done quite a bit of research on the disease since I've been home, and I'm blown away by the severity spectrum of the illness. Before the two weeks of cramping and fevers, I've never really had any issues with my bowels - I was always a really ""gassy"" kid and a little bit lactose intolerant, but other than that I never had any real issues.

Now I'm in quite a predicament - I don't really know what to do with myself. My doctor told me I should follow up with a GI doctor immediately to start treatment, but I have an internship four states away that I'm supposed to fly out for in three days. I've already delayed the start day by a week because of my surgery and I can't delay it any more without giving up the job. I'm a 21 y/o male in college, and internships are really priceless. I also don't want to be stuck in an ER without my family. I'm currently not suffering from any symptoms other than some surgery recovery - related soreness. I'm eating fine, using the bathroom fine (although more frequently), and I only feel a little fatigued. I also get some occasional mild cramps in random parts of my abdomen. I guess overall, since my surgery, my Chrohn's is very mild and maybe even in remission (?).

At this point, I really don't know what to do and I'm reluctant to listen to my parents because I don't think they grasp the intensity of the situation. It's all too real for me right now and I'm trying to keep from getting too worried or stressed because I know it doesn't help Crohn's. 

So, I guess this really is me just reaching out for some advice and help. Anything works, I just want some advice from people that know what I'm going through.

Thanks so much guys. This means everything to me right now.

Edit - grammar

Basically I'm looking for any resources to learn about developing applications through Visual Studio and using Team Foundation Server for collaboration. Also anything on developing enterprise level applications 

I started an internship today and have no experience with any of this and so I'm trying to do everything I can to get ahead. I know they'll teach me quite a bit but it'd be nice to gain some extra knowledge. Also I've tried some resources but everything I find seems to treat you like you already know all of the terminology and basic concepts. 

I have experience in Java, Python, and Javascript but of course programming small applications is much different than enterprise scale applications.

We were together at uni, and had a great relationship. No fighting, great sex, kept genuine ties with our separate friends, and had a healthy balance. Now that it's summer, I'm away at an internship and she's back home- we're about 3 hours apart. We got to the ""I love you"" phase a week or two before the school year ended.

We've only been apart for 2 weeks, but I can already feel myself growing in apathy. There's something about being apart from someone that makes it difficult for me to keep that bond. I felt so consistently in love with this girl so recently, but now, being so far away and surrounded by lots of other women where I'm living (all of us interns live in a condo complex together), it's hard to feel that spark. And along with that, it makes it hard to keep talking to her regularly while still showing that I'm invested in the relationship. I know that once I see her and can be around her more often, this will go away- at least I hope. Taking a break for the summer just doesn't really seem like an option, as that doesn't ever seem to work out. 

What do I do to recall how I felt about her so recently? I was so scared of parting ways for the summer and missing her. I know what we had wasn't just a honeymoon infatuation- so why am I starting to feel disinterested? And how am I going to make it through the next 3 months?



   
**tl;dr**: Was in a healthy loving relationship, and now that we're apart for the summer, I'm having trouble staying engaged."
36p2vp,0,2015-05-20,I'm a [24/M] stuck in a massive pickle between two girls i love.,Polandsprings89,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/36p2vp/im_a_24m_stuck_in_a_massive_pickle_between_two/,"Hey guys,

need some help and advise on my rather unique story/situation. Its a very long one so bare with me through the details along the way. note to readers i am so bad at spelling and grammar, so chill on those things and again bare with me...

I, 24 M have been with my current GF for 9 years. Yup 9 years we have dated, since high school. We went to different colleges (she lived at home, me a regimented military like academy (no service required after graduation). 

After graduation she did not want to move to another sate with me (4 hours away) do to concern over not being able to get a job. I had a wonderful job and went there to live. We managed to live apart for a hear and 6 months, one of the hardest things i did, but it essentailly was similar to college being away so much. 

about a year and 8 months ago she pushed me to move home, upset where our lives where going. I passed up a promotion and took a lesser paying job back at home. Original company had a ton of growth potential, but she didn't want to move. 

I sucked it up and moved home, and got paid 8 K less for a job with more responsibility and ""work"". Through my hard work, i got a rasie and a promotion in 7 months, so now the pay is no longer an issue. 

However, being together for 9 years, we have never lived together. She has a almost sever anxiety disorder which the idea of sleeping over my house, and essentially makes herself always go home. She doesn't have the best family (shes a 1st generation American) and he mother is a paranoid schizophrenia, that cant get diagnosed and because of that, her (my GF) living at home essentially terrible.

She basically looks herself in her room when home, and cant even trust her mom to do much of anything for her because of the fact she might do something have harmful or scary...  

now we have been trying to move out for about 14 months now. She does not want to rent and get an apartment do to her serious ideas to not waste money to do so. I am 50/50 on the issue but i refuse to ask her marry me while i myself also live at home. We have talked openly of marriage for many years, and its a know fact with our family's we will once the time is right (live together).

our house search has been awful, and we just cant find a house we both agree on, or is in our price range to buy. I think we have seen upwards of 40 houses, and still cant find the ""right house"". 

Ok so now this is where it gets hairy.... She work 12 hour night shifts, 3x a week. i work a normal 9-5, M-F. Her night shifts essentally equate to sleeping the day prior to work (all day prior to going in, and then the day after her shift shes miserable tired. i get her maybe 3 days a week, 4 at best if she actually sleeps. Shes very irritable when shes sleepy, and i cant stand her. She wont switch to days though because she is afraid if the extra work day shift does, and her anxiety kicks in and she just gets pissed off and yells at me for bringing it up when shes tired. 

Also in the last 6 months shes essentially lost her best friend (she was a bitch anyway) so our ""circle of friends"" has been reduced a ton. We no longer have a go to friend/couple to hang out with, and often end up doing nothing or going to the city with my college roommate (he is single, and lives an hour away).

i unhappy with my life started exploring twitter as an ""anon"" just to get the social interaction i don't get otherwise (i don't have many friends also, I'm quiet and keep to myself). I work in sales, so its not like i cant have freinds, i just choice to keep my circle of freinds small as i just like it better. (also the husband our her old BFF i was close with, so he went out the window)

in the anon world i didn't have a care or agenda, just interacting and being a normal person (many it snot that normal, but i was comfertable). through doing this for many months i came acrosse someone.  yup this is how it gets hairy.

i meet her three months ago. She followed me randomly, i deicide to DM her as she seemed cool. She turns out to be a 21 year old college student from CO, single mother, with a ""finance"" living in CA. her finace is not her sons dad. I knew this quickly after talking to her but i didnt really phase me as she was fun to talk to, and i ha dno agenda or desire. fast forward 3 weeks of nothing but talking all day, we descide to call each other. Then after week change of that we skyped one night. 

From there on ill be very honest i feel in love with this girl. Shes amazingly down to earth, shes fun, shes very relaxed, not stressfull, not materialistic, and shes a 10. No joke she is a 10/10 on the looks scale. she could be a model is she wasnt short (under 5' tall). but he looks dont phase me (ok they do, shes just beautiful), what gets me is how much she enjoys just talking to me. We talk all day, all night (when my GF isnt around), and often stay up to 3-4 am talking about life, just nothing. all along she knows exactly what she is doing, as its evadent quickly there is simething between us, something different then just a sudden lust. 

her finanace is very absent from her life. they got engaged after not talking for 4 years, and what she described as a month of lust, followed by him moving home (to work) in CA. he uses a busy life being in the army or something to say he doesnt hav etime to EVER talk to her. In the 3months iv know herm he has had maybe 10 phone conversations with her. I know thi sbeacuse every waking moment i can i am talking to her. 

We are open about it all too in that shes engaged, yet she isnt happy. Shes not the babby momma drama type  at all, and is the sweetest person i have ever meet. Shes the disney princess type, that has a few passhions and runs with themm 

so here is one of my issues, i have never been able to tell her i have a GF of 9 years. I couldn't do it, tried a few times, and just couldn't. my GF is absent from my life, so its easy to get around.

me and her have gotten to the point we openly talk about how we love each other. We talk how i am going to try to get out to CO this summer and see her, and how amazing and happy we will be. Shes got an amazing 6 month internship set up for the fall + winter in FL, and we talk about visiting there and again spending time together.  I love this girl, im crzy about her, and i havent felt like this, in 8 years. yeah because i love my GF here too. 

MY GF here i also love. I literlly love 2 women at th same time, and i have zero idea what to do. CO girl is leaving her finance, as she feels he doesnt love her, and isnt putting any effort in. She sok with it, as there was a reaosn they lost contact fr 4 years. So now i have a very big issuye at my hands. Do i stay with the girl i love, but am not happy with and am starting to feel ike she is pulling me down? Do i stay with the girl who has a steady job (makes more then me) who on that same ""hot"" scale is at best a 6.7.... Do i stay with the girl i have invested 9 years of my life, 38% of my living time with? Do i stay with the girl who if i leave her, looses not only her best friend, but the love of her life? DO i leave the girl who doesn't have a great family, and uses my family as almost hers and an escape from hers?

Or do i take a gamble, and go test the waters with a girl I'm so in love with i cant sop thinking about her day/night sleep or awake? Do i follow my heart and go to CO to see her and meet her to see if what we have is real? I cant live a day or even a damn hour without looking at my phone, or thinking about whats shes doing right now. Im so in love with her it makes me sick sometimes, especially when i have to think about the situation we are in. I think often well what if our love is because we both lack something from our ""other relationships"", but i know its not just that. I do not know what to do with myself sometimes as i feel I'm living 3 different lives. Im living mine with my GF here, my real ""double Life"" with essentially 2 GFs, and the third where i lie to my CO girl. I am so far screwed in emotions i cant think straight. 

i need help if you couldn't tell. Im sure this took you about 30 minutes to read, and 80% you said damn he is a dumas and cant spell. But I'm stuck, I'm stuck in a love triangle and i do not know what to do.

For a short version of my situation, I have not had any internships, have a few personal projects, and my overall GPA is low due to my first attempt at a bachelors going horrible (2.9 overall, 3.2 Major). 

I feel I have a hard time really describing to anyone who does an initial phone interview what I want to do. I try to say something along the lines of Application Development or Backend web development depending on the company, but this seems to not be the kind of answers these places are looking for. I guess the only thing I can say that I don't want to do is Front end web development or anything heavy in UX/UI design, since I just don't enjoy these areas. 

I also have a bit of an issue of finding places to apply to. I have been mostly using Indeed.com and Engineerjobs.com, along with checking my school's career board and Craigslist daily to check if anything worthwhile is on those. I didn't do a great job at networking while at school, so I don't really have any friends in relevant areas that I can draw for jobs right now.

Since I met him 4 years ago, I have always had dinners with my mom and him, and my step dad where I felt very shy and cautious to speak. At dinners, both have a tendency to take over the conversation and talk about something rather impersonal and academic--sometimes it's the news-- with a lot of authority. I always felt like I was being lectured, and all I could do was nod since I didn't always know what they were saying or had any sound counterarguments. When I speak they often take over quickly with something opinionated or sarcastic (like a really lame joke) and just move on, because what I say is typically just a short snippet of what I know. 

Since I have been at college/University (and so has my step-brother) for the past 2 years, I have felt more intelligent and have managed to keep a 4.0 GPA. At recent dinners with my family, however, my feelings of shyness persist and my step-brother has become even more intense in his lecturing. He is studying economics and I am studying sociology. He goes to a very different type of school than I do, in the sense that my school is very artistic and down to earth, and his is very scientific and competitive. I feel stifled when he talks about economic theory and even sociological theory sometimes, and I just have no idea what he's saying. In my opinion, he sounds ridiculous because you ask him a simple question and he goes on a rant using several unknown concepts in one sentence and doesn't fully explain the meaning, nor the importance of anything. His dad and my mom listen intently and are very impressed with his knowledge, and ask more questions or use wacky examples that they think connect to what he's talking about. 


Anyway, I was never asked any questions about myself and I was probably visibly uncomfortable as this was happening, because I literally just stared into space/at the ground the whole time, or watched my cat. I didn't feel appreciated/validated, and even though I got straight A's again this semester no one asked or cared. On top of that, I have an internship in a foreign country coming up this summer that I found myself, and I think is really cool--- and when finally asked about that, I told them about it, and all I got was a lecture about how I need to research the country and watch out for dangerous things. When asked about what I liked most about the organization? I answered and no one responded, my mom just said ""that's cool..."" and changed the subject. And I literally saw my step-dad shake his head and mutter to himself something when I was talking... I don't know if he was upset with how his son was eating (he was kind of staring off in his direction) or was annoyed with me. I feel really awkward and I wish I didn't. I am not sure how to deal with this, I want to be more confident and not let this get to me. :/

TLDR: Mom, step-dad, and step-son get along and converse on topics I don't care about. They don't seem to care about what I want to say, or topics I am interested. I feel ignored and not-special as a result but I want to feel self-assured. Looking for advice on how to work through this. "

36p9ld,0,2015-05-20,Need advice to break into Backend Development (24F),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36p9ld/need_advice_to_break_into_backend_development_24f/,"Hi all!

So, to start, I'll begin with my background: I graduated last year with a B.A in Computer Science and Economics degree, with no internship experience in either field. The reason for no internship? Well, I didn't pick up CS until the end of my sophomore year, so the last two years of college were extremely difficult (my first concentration was Economics). I was so discouraged by the CS courses I took that I never had the courage to pursue an internship - in fact, at one point, I told myself that CS was just not for me, but I decided to finish because I had already invested a lot of my time studying CS. The only comfort I had was that almost everyone in class was also failing. As you may suspect, I wasn't entirely satisfied by graduation day...

My struggle: Despite the countless hours I spent studying and stressing to pass, when I graduated, I felt like I just didn't know enough to be able to get a job in engineering since I only knew Java, didn't have any personal projects, or any internship experience. To make matters worse, for some rebellious reason, I waited about 2 months before I started looking for a job after graduating. 

The hunt: In the beginning of my job hunt, I rigorously applied to many places for Business Analyst position because I wanted to do only SOME programming. Unfortunately, I wasn't having any luck. So I decided, perhaps desperately and curiously, to apply to some programming jobs. After about another 3 months of trying, I finally broke into the industry as an Application Engineer in NYC.

Ok, so why am I posting?: Yes, while I was extremely excited and happy the first few weeks starting as an Application engineer, I grew unhappy as time went on. First of all, I'm extremely and beyond grateful for the opportunity I got to learn. I learned so much on the job. I learned and frequently exercised SQL (I only had one course in college). I was given the opportunity to build a webpage (I never built one before hand), with the internet being my only source of guidance as no one in my immediate team had any web development experience. I also became very familiar with Linux commands, shell and perl scripting. If you're wondering what my role was, I was just as confused for the first couple a weeks as to what exactly my purpose was, until I started to get trained more and more on PeopleSoft. It was definitely an interesting experience learning to code using PeopleCode to create programs within PeopleSoft Financials. I lasted about 8 months there, until my bf received and accepted an amazing job offer in SF. I had to drop it all.

Where I stand now?: I was excited to move because I knew I needed to leave PeopleSoft one day and what better opportunity did I have than to move into the tech hub. As my move to SF grew near, I started looking for jobs. But field did I fit in? My exposure to web development at my previous job helped me decided what I wanted to pursue next: web development. Looking back, I felt great learning HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP on my own. I didn't take any classes for these, so I only researched what I had to know in order to put the single webpage (I learned jQuery before exploring JavaScript bc of the time pressure at work). I also realized how much I really enjoyed working with Oracle SQL. After connecting the dots, my likes and dislikes, I have decided to look into backend development, but I've been having the hardest of times in San Francisco. Two months ago, when I started applying to jobs in SF, I barely got calls back. From those companies where I actually passed the phone screenings and coding challenges, I just couldn't get myself past the on-site interviews (even for the internship positions). I felt like it was because I lacked personal projects and I couldn't really demonstrate my limited web dev skills.

So I've been teaching myself Node.js and MongoDB for the past two months, after formally taking some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses on CodeSchool and Codeacademy. I've also started working on one big project this entire time to showcase my potential. I'm hoping to jump on the job hunt again, and so what I'm seeking here from Reddit is advice. Is this enough to get my foot in the door? What should I do to increase my chances of getting a job as a backend developer, especially in a competitive market like San Francisco? I don't really see ""Jr. Backend Developer"" positions either, so where should I look? Where do I start? 

How did you (if you're in backend engineer) break into the industry?

TL;DR: I just started learning Node.js and MongoDB two months ago and began my first project that I can showcase to recruiters. I already have working knowledge of Java and SQL from school. I have prior (8months) professional coding experience unrelated to web development. I also graduated about a year ago. Is it possible to get a job in SF with my background? What am I missing? What should I be doing now? Am I applying too soon? If you're a backend engineer, how did you get in?

Thanks!"
36pa0e,1,2015-05-20,26M4F Unleash your inner slut; five prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/36pa0e/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_slut_five_prompts/,"I've had a LOT of fun with these prompts in the past, and I'm at it again. A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages (a few paragraphs, and generally I can play out each scenario in anywhere from a few hours to a few days). Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing!

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

The minimum requirements are a 3.2 GPA and enrollment in a STEM program at an accredited university. Currently, I have a 3.85 GPA as a math major, am in a collegiate honor society, have extracurricular/volunteer experience and am currently employed at this crappy-ass fast-food job and my friend's dad's junk hauling business. 

The reason why I'm asking this here is because The Red Pill is a community that is aware not only about women's true nature, but the harsh realities of the world. Part of the applying process (which is all online) is submitting a résumé as a PDF. What types of things should I put on there? What should I *not* put on there? What type of language should I use?

When we first started dating, we'd have sex every time we saw each other, but now, at the 8 month mark, it's been over a month and a half since we had sex. I don't know if the whole lesbian bed death thing is truth or shit, but it seems that some circumstances have caused this.

First, my girlfriend has gained some weight since we started dating. I mean, so little that I actually did not notice. I still see no difference, but it's hurt her self-esteem immensely. I think she's super sexy and want to have sex with her but she keeps denying me because she feels ""gross"" about herself.

Recently some really tough shit has been happening with her family that is challenging everything she thought she knew about her dad and it's clearly affecting her. I've been attributing these two things to the lack of sex.

Here's the issue: I truly believe good relationships need semi-frequent sex. I also know that she is depressed, and she's even acknowledged it, but is apathetic about getting help for it. I had a previous girlfriend who was like this and it ultimately led to the downfall of that relationship.

I've already told her I want her to work on her self-esteem issues. I understand that family stuff is hurting her right now so I'm trying to be understanding. It's just hard, you know? I miss the girl that really wanted me and the one that I had an emotional connection with. 

I feel like this is a glorified friendship with occasional kissing. I'm bored. I'm also almost 6 years younger than her and wonder if there are girls out there with her qualities, but with higher sex drives. She has amazing qualities: she's incredibly thoughtful, goes out of her way to help me out, cooks often for me, and is very affectionate.

But there are downsides: she's so shallow. She's so concerned with her looks and wrinkles and shit (she's fucking 26, she has none of that), and is pretty judgmental. The other day, for example, she told me if I were into comic books she never would have dated me in the first place, which I found really shallow. She's obsessed with her appearance and she's actually very attractive, so I don't get it. I'm definitely more of a dyke, while she's really feminine, so maybe that's why.

Also, not to mention, I have an internship two states away this summer so I won't see her as often. I'm hoping space will fix things.

How do I tell my super insecure girlfriend that our relationship is not going well?

   
**tl;dr**: Relationship with girlfriend is not as great as it used to be. How do I bring this up without making her cry?"

I am just taking a step out of my comfort zone here and reach out to this amazing community. Before I get in too deep, I'll explain my background. I am a 20 year old student, who is devoutly christian. I originally was brought up in a largely Christian house. My mother was always volunteering and taking active positions assisting within our church. I obviously grew up around the faith, however I only really pondered it when it was of convenience me. Fast forward a couple years and I find myself moving out of the house and living in the dorms at my university. Once the dust settled I found myself deeply depressed, as I realized that I lived for, (Family, Friends, My Daily Routines, Surroundings, etc.) or things that Tim Keller would call 'Counterfeit Gods'. This separation took me to the brink. I called my family and immediately drove home to re-up on the numbing and sheltering that I had been so fond of. However, when I returned, I realized the illusion was shattered, and no matter how many hours I spent with my family or friends, I would never be able to find longing happiness in those things. 

So I plunged myself deeply into apologetics. I, being a very logical and analytically minded person, decided rather than despise my mother for what seemed like blind faith, I wanted to investigate the authenticity of her endless days of steady and joyous temperament. What I found, and I am sure some of you who have taken the time out to do so, was a religion not founded on blind faith, but rather a factual faith founded on love.

This fortunately enough strengthened me enough to put aside the counterfeit gods that crippled me, and move out onto my own and build my own life. Thus far it has been good, I am doing very well for myself with multiple internships, near perfect G.P.A, and a solid foundation of numerous new and previous friends I surround myself with.

However, at times when I am alone, given I am a natural extrovert. I feel myself slipping into loneliness. I feel moments of the Holy Spirit however, nothing to keep me satisfied as well as the constant surroundings of other people, family and friends. 

I have discovered that being by myself for more than 8 hours, drives me crazy and I try to pray but it doesn't seem to quench my thirst for companionship.

So I come to you all, in need of help. What would you as a community of Christians, suggest for myself?

**Tl;Dr: I struggle with solitude and aloneness. I find my soul aching for companionship and need help alleviating that need with Christ.**

*Thanks for your continued support, I love and wish you all the best. God Bless :)*"

I started an internship in November of last year, which after a month turned into a junior position, and now I'm returning home overseas for college and have been extended the opportunity to continue working remotely which I've accepted.

I was wondering if there are any remote devs here who could offer some guidance and advice? From talking with others and some general reading, it's pretty apparent that working remotely is associated with its own pretty dramatic positives and negatives depending on the employee and employer's approach, aptitude, and so on.

36q8kz,0,2015-05-21,About to graduate college at 29... never had job. Looking for support.,RasRays,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/36q8kz/about_to_graduate_college_at_29_never_had_job/,"I want to preface this post stating that I know I have an uphill battle ahead of me to overcome the laziness I've allowed myself to enable over the past decade, but I'm determined to turn things around. Is it too late?

&amp;nbsp;

How am I in this mess? I was a bum after high school and stayed out for about three years. I planned to jump straight into college, but didn't know what I wanted to do and was afraid I'd drop out if I did, so I waited. After a few years I determined enough was enough and got back to school to get a forensic science degree. It went well up until half way through the program when it got discontinued and I didn't finish in time. So I had to move to a new program and pick up a new major, now criminal justice. Tack on another few years and I'm finally at where I am today. I have two classes left, Spanish and an internship.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sort of freaking out as it's well passed crunch time to job search and establish independence. I have no references, no experience, no volunteer work to make note of. Just school. The probably only other rewarding thing I've done is travel a lot. I have networked with tons of people across the world and experienced many things. I've also completely turned my physical self around. I went from being heavily obese to becoming an avid bodybuilder.

&amp;nbsp;

The steps I'm taking now to try to fix things is looking for volunteer and internship opportunities while still applying to jobs. I may never land anything, but if I can at least land something to tag onto a resume it can only get easier from here right? I'm also looking into taking up a job that I can through networking without experience just to make some money. I happen to know a lot of people with connections to various bars/clubs that have already said they'd help me find something to do (I'd like to become a bartender ultimately. It's always been an interest of mine). 

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short. I am just looking for confirmation that it isn't too late for me to find a decent career life. Spending nearly 9 years in college is going to raise a ton of eyebrows when applying for work, especially when it's coupled with not working. 

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice or criticism is appreciated."

36qgph,1,2015-05-21,Our Journey: Enroute Pipes,Pipes_app,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/36qgph/our_journey_enroute_pipes/,"It’s been a long &amp; laborious journey and I don’t think I’ve seen the half of it but here’s a little on it. After 17 years of birth, I finally began my journey trying to put purpose to life. Having started with my revered sport, Cricket, I decided to move on and try my hand at Business.

Food For India (2011 – 2012) 
Started in early 2011, Food For India aimed to be an online portal that allowed you to order your food online. Not revolutionary by any means across the Globe, but ‘FFI’ as it were known internally was unique in the country we live in; India. We had a team of 17 young interns who helped us build a company from the ground up.The experience was enriching; filled with enthusiasm, energy, passion, novices and teens! Our average age, believe it or not, was 19. However, due to lack of experience, flaws in the model, poor industry judgement &amp; lack of finances, FFI tanked. My partner, Siddharth Goliya, 24 (you’re going to hear a whole lot about him) and I, strung together 10,000 USD (6.5L) for the business. We’d done multiple jobs for over 2 years to stitch that number together.In retrospect, the amount may seem exceedingly small but that’s the best you can do in your teens I guess, especially in a country where the currency doesn’t bark your cause.The venture never took off, my team worked their backsides off, we couldn’t even afford to pay them; the returns were few, learnings, too many.We had 1500 USD left in the tank of the available 10,000 and we decided to build a digital solutions company and we launched, Doodle Creatives.

Doodle Creatives (2012 – 2014) 
We officially launched Doodle Creatives on the 5th of November, 2012. We had a great Web design at the time, it was unique &amp; it’s exactly what got us business. Doodle’s numbers in a matter of months shot through the roof, we recovered everything we lost with FFI and were back on our feet.Life seemed normal again.Doodle was something we did for a good year and a bit; we gathered immense technical know-how working on websites, backend softwares, apps &amp; I’d like to think the both of us honed a little of our business acumen there as well.Again, we had an incredible team who backed us with this. Only 3 remained, from the original 17.We had it all, the numbers, esteemed client portfolio, projections, team, all seemed to be in our favour but deep down, it’s something Siddharth &amp; I never really loved, we just didn’t want to spend the rest of our lives doing it. We wanted to build products that could potentially reach out to hundreds of millions of people. It’s something that always bothered us &amp; we decided to cross-subsidise our funds from Doodle to our first product and made the shift to Blood Seva.

Blood Seva (2013)
In May of 2013, bootstrapped, we head out to build our first product. At the time we didn’t realise it, but it was Social entrepreneurship. For all the English speaking folk out there ‘Seva’ stands for ‘Service’.

Blood Seva basically captured a very desperate need in the country and tried to solve it. To get Blood in an emergency that matched the required Blood Group was next to impossible in India.The concept was simple, all you had to was send an SMS and you’d know exactly where you’d get the blood you want. We took 3 months to build it and hopped VCs, Industrialists before deciding to throw in the towel. We were told the idea was great but they wanted something more commercial. And, rightly so. There was no way Blood Seva could make money, it would only &amp; only be a CSR activity at best.Nonetheless, we did choose to go commercial. 

Pipes (2014) 
We conceived the idea of Pipes close to a year ago. The both of us (Siddharth &amp; I) always felt the need to personalise the way we got our news. I mean, we always believed everyone has something they love, right? Something they are so very passionate about and want to keep up with it all the time; across categories from Business to Politics, Fashion, Sport, Technology &amp; so much more.Today, thousands of Pipes have been added, some of ‘em beyond the realms of what I could have ever imagined.

It’s an incredible feeling. 

Off late this is something that’s become really cliché but the feeling of springing right out of my bed every single day excited and going to work is unparalleled. And this is with my entire team, their commitment, perseverance, passion for Pipes makes Siddharth and I push ourselves that extra mile.Staring at my cup of coffee, it feels like a long time ago to me when we worked out of homes &amp; cafes before we got to our wonderful office that we have today.We think we’re on the verge of something really cool, and we’re very very excited with what the future holds for us. As I write this, we’ve already uploaded our next update and I can’t wait for all you guys to see what it is!"

36qiy7,4,2015-05-21,Should I do a double Bachelor or try to find a part-time job ?,myheadhurts2day,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36qiy7/should_i_do_a_double_bachelor_or_try_to_find_a/,"I am currently finishing my first year as a computer science student. . I started thinking about it and I realized that next year I want to waste less time so was thinking of either 

a) getting a double bachelor - starting Electrical Engineering

b) trying to find a part time job regarding CS ( programming )

I am very conflicted on which path I should take and I have to make up my mind really fast. Positive reasons for choosing Electrical Engineering are that I really like math and physics in general and would like to use it more and learn something usefull( not so much math so far in computer science, 0 physics ). I am not sure, but I think that the job opportunities are way more varied for a EE+CS graduate.
On the other side, I think getting valuable experience from an internship,part-time during school looks very good on ones CV,especially if you can find something where you have to program in languages like Java,Python or JavaScript ( ofc it depends on what you program as well ). What would you suggest ?

Then again even with a double Bachelor I could find during the summer some really interesting internships where I could apply and gather some experience as well, which would be nice.

There are some economical aspects as well. The money from a part-time of course won't hurt. If I go for a double bachelor then I would have to switch universities ( to one which is a tiny tiny bit better ). In my current university I have already talked with some of my professors in order to be student assistant next year. I don't think this would be possible if I switch universities ( since I think you have to apply around this time, and I do not know any professors ).

What I am worried about is what if I remain at my current university and don't manage to find a part-time ? I still have the student assistant job ( which pays pretty well ) but then a lot of free time. Of course I could use this free time to learn something more ( which I have already been doing ). So far I know Java,Python,JavaScript(jQuery,ThreeJS),HTML &amp; CSS. I have been talking to various people which are deeper into the field than I am and I have a clear idea of what I should learn next (php, .net) etc.

What I am basically trying to figure it out is if doing a double bachelor would be a better idea for my career than a part time with only a computer science. And if it is better, how much better ? One thing that I am worried about after I finish my computer science degree is being stuck somewhere programming something mundane. In my mind its all fun and games but I started realizing that a programming job might require a lot of endless debugging to figure out where that small error is or this sort of kind. I know it sounds silly coming for a first year bachelor student, but I don't want to become burned out in 10 years with programming and start hating my job. This is why I think an EE degree would help maybe find new opportunities where I have to program as well but do other interesting stuff ( not program all the time basically ). What is your opinion ?

However, recently I saw posts about Free Code Camp as well as the online training course of Epicodus. They both seem interesting but I have no idea which one is better. For now I still prefer TOP but I'm open to other suggestions.

I'm 20 years old, 21 in a week or so, and I think it's a good time for me to start working my way towards an early retirement. I'm mainly posting to get some advice specific to my situation.

I currently have $14,442.08 in student loans, which I don't need to start paying until January 17th, 2016. I owe my parents ~$3,000 for helping me pay for college, which is something that we agreed upon. I will be working all this summer, getting paid $16/hr at my internship (I'm a computer science major). I have ~$350 in my 401k right now from my last internship, and I'm checking to see if I can put money towards that at my current one, and if my employer will be matching my contributions or not. I use You Need a Budget to keep track of my spending and saving.

My main question: what can I start doing *right now* to help me on my way to FI? I know that I need to stop spending money on dumb stuff, and that's my first priority. My conundrum is whether I should start saving up to pay off as much of my loans as possible when Jan. 17th comes around, or if I should try to make enough over the summer to avoid having to take out more loans, etc., etc. Should I start saving a buffer? If yes, how much should I put in? Everything I don't spend on other things? Should I spread my income out by percentage instead, like putting 50% (or whatever amount) into my buffer each paycheck?

I don't really know where to go from where I am I guess, and this community seems to be genuinely helpful and a great resource. If I should post somewhere else, or if there is a place I should look for more information instead.

Thanks all!"

I am a rising CS senior interested in web development, namely backend stuff in Rails and Node/Express. I have not been successful in my search for summer internships as I figured out that I liked web dev/backend just a few months ago and thus had little experience aside from a few projects I did after school.

This summer I was planning on making a big change in my life and work to better myself as a web developer. I've made myself a curriculum to learn various technologies but more importantly build some projects. I know myself and I believe I can do this for the whole summer without getting distracted.

However, my mom's friend offered an internship at her company.  However (and this is from what *they* told me) I would not be programming most of the time (sometimes even fixing the printer, as they mentioned), and if I did I'd be using VB.NET. As someone who wants to be skilled ASAP, you can see why I don't want to do this internship.

The offer was for full-time and paid decently. After some thinking, I decided I would ask for a part time internship. This way I will have time for personal projects but also make some money and have something else on my resume.

My two questions are: What do you think of my choice? If you approve, how would I ""dress up"" this internship for when I am applying to modern Web Dev jobs?

Thanks for your time."
36rndf,54,2015-05-21,The Hole in the Wall,UnderAStormySky,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/36rndf/the_hole_in_the_wall/,"Hey everyone. I wanted to come here and report something that happened to my girlfriend and I not too long ago. When I read a lot of stories I get the feeling that they're made up. This one's an actual report, so the writing may be kind of crap.

About three months ago my girlfriend finished off an internship at a vet clinic where she was given free room and board in exchange for working after hours and taking emergency calls. She moved into the two-bedroom I had been staying in for the past six months following that (at the time I rented it I wanted to get a roommate but never managed to find one from my company).

I had been noticing some weird sounds for a while coming from my walls. I figured this was mice as I had heard mice in the walls before I moved to the city, so I ignored it. When my girlfriend moved in she started asking about it, though, and said it didn't sound like mice to her. I didn't really know what to do about it other than report it to the leasing office for my apartment, which I did.

One morning I woke up to get ready for work and as I was dressing my girlfriend got up to walk our dogs and we noticed there was a hole in the wall about the size of a half-dollar. This same thing actually happened to me when I lived with my mom (mouse chewed a hole through the wall above her bed, she discovered it because the cat sat directly under it and caught it in the middle of the night). I was naturally pissed and called the leasing office to report it, and they said they would schedule maintenance for later that week.

That night, I woke up staring at the wall for no reason. I was sort of half-awake and trying to get back to sleep but something was bothering me. That was when I noticed that there was an eye staring out at the hole from me. It wasn't a small eye, it was bigger around than the hole itself and yellowish. There were shuffling noises coming from the wall. I sat there staring at it, trying to convince myself I was dreaming and also freaking out, and then it blinked.

I screamed and sat up. My girlfriend woke up and started asking what was wrong, and I told her something had been staring at me from behind the hole. She told me I had been dreaming and that what I said was really fucked up and creeping her out. Neither of us could get back to sleep and so we moved into the other bedroom and slept there for the rest of the night.

After another few days the maintenace guy finally came and patched up the hole. He said Terminix would be coming by to deal with the mice in the walls within another week.

Next time it happened was two days later. We both had sort of decided the other night had been my imagination and even though I was still creeped out, the wall was patched up and we wanted to sleep on a real bed (instead of an air mattress). Just as I started to drift off to sleep I heard scratching noises. My girlfriend was out, she falls asleep in minutes, and I just sat up listening. Eventually the scratching got louder and then suddenly a hole opened up in the wall and something came through. At first I thought it was a worm, it was long and snaky and black and was moving in circles. Then I realized it was a black finger (not like African American black, but like charcoal black).

We had been eating some pasta earlier so I grabbed my fork and sat up as quietly as I could. The finger disappeared and then the eye appeared again. I stabbed the tines of the fork through the hole and there was this ungodly scream that was kind of in between human and animal, more like a human but not the right frequency I guess. A lot of loud clunking noises came from the wall. My girlfriend woke up and we were both screaming obscenities, turned the lights on, and got the fuck out of there. She started crying when I told her what had happened, luckily we were both okay.

I broke the lease to that fucking place and we stayed with friends until we could get our stuff out. Still have no idea what was there and don't want to know."
36rnv3,80,2015-05-21,[Need Advice] This summer is my chance to develop the good habits I need... How do I do it?,3dbattleship,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/36rnv3/need_advice_this_summer_is_my_chance_to_develop/,"I just walked out of my last final exam of the semester. I've got one more year before I graduate, so this is my last summer before the real world. I have an awesome internship, in a city that I've never been to. I'll be living alone.

I really feel like this is such a great opportunity for me to learn how to work hard and to prepare myself for my future. But I'm scared. I often start off strong when I get motivated, but a week or two into each of my grand plans, I start slacking again, stop doing anything, lose focus. I don't have ANY good habits- every time I want to do something other than laying in bed and surfing the internet it takes a lot of effort. I've been known to go a week without showering, because I just forgot or didn't want to. Sometimes I don't leave bed all day, figuring ""Oh, I'll eat tomorrow."" My floor is ALWAYS covered in stuff, which stresses me out because I hate clutter, but I can't really do anything about it because it just gets overwhelming, and I can never seem to just put things away after I use them.

I do manage to get the things that absolutely NEED to get done done- I did very well in my classes last semester, and I think I did ok this semester too. But that's not because I put effort into studying, just because at the last minute I went ""Oh shit"" and got everything done in one big spurt of energy at the end. This doesn't lead to sustained performance, though- and is terrible for anything lasting longer than a semester. I had a job for two years before coming back to school, and the only reason I didn't get fired was because I left- my performance just gradually declined and declined after that initial energy.

I want to get into a good routine, and figure out what things I should prioritize to really improve my life in the long run. This summer, in a minimalist apartment with a suitcase of stuff, a place I've never been and so I have no pre-existing obligations, and all new people who don't know the old me. I can re-make myself. This is my chance to hit the reset button.

How do I do it?"

Like many people, I was expected to go to college so went and graduated with a communications degree, making it by with no internships or real world experience. I live with my siblings in NYC and my dad has been paying my rent and been sending me money every month. I feel like a worthless leech, and he is really annoyed with me at this point, as am I with myself for wasting so much time.

The lease for our apartment is up come September, and I still have hardly even applied to any jobs for 5 months because I don't feel qualified or have any useful skills, let alone people skills because of my horrible anxiety. I dread the idea of moving back home, but I also need to take a stand and learn how to be independent and not be a burden anymore. 

I don't know where to start or who to turn to. Do I try and grab any minimum wage job as a dishwasher to survive? I don't want to be dependent anymore but I'm also so scared to even take the first step, I'm sick of it all.

I was just offered an internship which I would normally take but I was planning on taking a summer class at the local college because the class I would take is a weeder/GPA killer at my home university. I wanted to take it this summer to get a good grade (the GPA transfers) and not have to worry about it (I'll never need the learned material and supposedly it has a huge workload). If I do this there's a decent chance I could write code for a family friend to help out his extremely busy workload but this is not for sure. Worst case I would find some job to do while I take the class.

On the other hand the internship would be very helpful for getting future internships and look great on a resume (it also pays more). Basically I cannot decide because the class at my home college would take up an absurd amount of time for the work and is extremely hard, especially to balance with my already hard schedule.

Does anyone have any thoughts? Thanks!"

I am from California and I have been studying in Germany for the last 8.5 months.

I recently started losing weight by changing how much I eat (not so much *what* I eat) and basically cutting out sodas.

I've also started drinking a lot more water, part of which is mineral water. At my internship, the company provides bottled mineral and spring water to the employees. I never really drank mineral water at home (in California) because I would just filter tap water, but I like to taste, and the company provides it, so I drink it at work. Between 1-2  liters per work day.

I've noticed in the last week, however, that I've started feeling funny, and today I had a headache (I never get headaches) and had a few times where I felt lightheaded.

In trying to figure out what caused it, I realized that starting to drink mineral water was the only major thing that I have changed in my diet. So I did a quick google search like any modern person and found [this](https://www.paleohacks.com/water/mineral-water-causing-sinus-pain-7049). I would draw special attention to the first answer in the list.

Has anyone ever heard of this before? Is it something I need to worry about?

I would go to the doctor, but I don't want to deal with figuring out the German medical system just because I feel kinda funny [at least not before I try some other options :) ]

Tomorrow I am gonna switch to spring water and give it a few days, but I was wondering, has anyone ever heard of this before? Is it something I need to worry about?

________

Doot’Skorvic was squeezed in tight against members of his old crew as their shuttle fled the space station. Accompanying the three hundred members of the diplomatic fleet were another few hundred humans, most of whom were civilians that had *lived* on the station. It was another queer habit of the humans: they almost didn’t care where they lived, they put more stock in having a space than in whether it the space was worth anything. As a result, the Ex-Captain was treated to a view of dozens of shuttles, many even larger than what would have been a classified as a planetary assault heavy dropships, force their way into the planet’s atmosphere.

As the shuttles glowed a cherry red from friction, the captain lost what little sight he had of the station, now abandoned entirely of civilian population, left in the hands of the human military. Their *joint* military. *This species was located by pure chance when they were busy shattering one another, and now, perhaps forty of their years later, the tensions have stopped existing?* It was possible, and not an entirely alien mindset to the ex-captain; after all, many quasi-predator and predatory species were predisposed to a culture heavily dowsed in honor and tradition. Partly because it was one of the most efficient ways to keep the individual competitive members from hating one another. If you had a disagreement, then you would fight it out underneath a bureaucratic eye, and the winner, unless countermanded by a better fighter, wins the argument. As well as many variations along that general rule, all predatory species had a culture constructed along these lines.

Which meant the human equivalent made no sense. This was an *omnivorous* species that evolved right in the middle of their food chain, precedent clearly stated that this species would either never develop a sophisticated military tradition and the conflicts that went with it, or wipe itself out in a genocidal bout of nuclear fury. They were born to hate one another, to compete to the utmost degree and take any loss intensely personally; this was dictated by nature itself. Yet without alien intervention, this species not only pulled itself from the brink of its demise, but pulled itself *together* into a mutually beneficial relationship. 

 Admittedly, there were many factions still remaining, but their ‘Brothers War,’ had destroyed all but two major powers, and left the handful of lesser powers, miners in the asteroid belt, generation ships roaming the frozen wastes in the outer system, untouched. And yet, despite the strife that had happened well within the arc of one of their lifetimes, and the loathing that the sides surely must have developed for one another, they stood more united than the, and Doot’Skorvic hated to admit it,  phenomenally old Confederacy, which was the most civilized portion of all colonized space.

Even as the heat armor on the shuttles burned and scorched against the deceleration, another, similar spectacle would await the immense construction yard, habitat and general purpose space station. It was almost too large for Zoltak small craft to completely destroy, spanning a massive seventeen point four kilometers, several times larger than any ship ever built. And it was only one of many, the Terran humans had almost a dozen built to a similar scale during the Brothers War, and armed them with incredible amounts of defensive weaponry, to mimic the impenetrable barrier boasted by Mars. 

Unlike that war however, soon these stations would be tested, and against the nearly half-hundred Old War dreadnaughts, Doot’Skorvic knew that they would not survive the test. But they would provide an excellent place to skirmish and break the support elements of the Zoltak fleet. Weaving in and out of construction yard ribs and point blank active defenses would destroy the fighters and tear apart smaller ships. 

But those Ships of the Line. They would shrug off whatever defensive installations were installed on the stations, and they would weather an incredible amount of fire from the human ships before they could be destroyed. Doot’Skorvic saw none of the massive slug weapons in orbit of Mars, and no evidence of any missile armament beyond countermeasures.

But, he supposed the humans had another trump card hidden somewhere in their posterior. They always seemed to have one. 

______

“Station control gives us jump green ma’am.” The communications officer spoke from her consol.

“Take us forward then, captain,” and her direct underling obeyed inside his own bridge, and so ordered his astrogation officer.  With the new compensator improvements that came from the original Zoltak fleet, no pull of the sudden acceleration bled through into the ship, the slight four g’s of forward force was almost perfectly neutralized, and the her fleet steadily pushed forward into the stations immense wormhole terminus.

The station was old, and it showed in her size. Simply eyeballing the architecture and roughshod repairs, one could visibly mark the passing years of old scarred metal giving away to sleek new construct. There were several unconnected blocks to the station; it was a small neighborhood of power plants, fab facilities, hab shelters and the enormous construction ring, with ribs that would dwarf pre-second industrial age skyscrapers. The dark cube that was the generator and terminus plant for the wormhole sat silently in front of them, the only hint that the terminus would keep them from impacting the dense chunk of technology was a slight ripple of the space in front of them.

Visually at least. Switch over to gravatics and the space in front *seethed* with ripples of distorted gravity. Her ships drifted closer. There was very little pull from the terminus itself, especially in microgravity, but there were a nearly infinite series ripples that pulled the ship forward individually, by a tiny fraction of a *g* before fading away. It created a small but steady pull, one that the ships resisted with forward thrusters, at least until her captain reduced their power, and accelerated in. And so they pushed forward into the invisible, writhing mass of gravity serpents. 

-And emerged unscathed on the other side, deep in the void between planets. They had moved a significant distance towards their enemies, yet hadn’t actually traversed more than a fraction of the distance needed.

Then, using the generator onboard the Admirals ship, a new, smaller terminus was opened. One by one, ships filed through the distortion, and emerged far closer to the enemy fleet, but still not close enough. Sensors probed the abyss and information exchanged with Central back orbiting Terra, and the relative positions of the enemy small craft pinpointed. 

While the compact terminus generator on the flagship cooled, a second ship powered its own generator up. The required power to open the terminus often overclocked the fusion generators on human cruisers, leading to overheating and a general scaling down of operations onboard the warship. On the Admirals stealth ships, fission simply couldn’t meet the demands energy wise. Instead, the ships carried a massive capacitor that took nearly 24 hours to recharge, but it allowed the stealth ships a surprising amount of flexibility - especially after reactor damage, which would guarantee the demise of most fusion powered ships.

Moving through the third terminus, the fleet powered down its emissions. It would lay here at minimum power for four hours, about 12% beyond what estimates were of the Zoltak sensor cover. The alien fighters would sweep over them to attack Earth, and their orders were to let them be. However, when the dreadnaughts began to pass them, they were to determine which ships were carriers for the fleet, and when prudent, eliminate them.

_______

The fighters were rapidly opening the distance from the fleet, and would soon be cutting their accel to hit the human world. It lay about four days away, and the Commander stood patient, making sure his fleet was completely ready. *Leave it to the fighter commanders* he reasoned, *to command,* his own task was to keep the dreadnaughts and cruisers and screening elements focused on the blue and green planet while forcing them to stay alert for more human trickery.

*Would it be unreasonable to encounter their true fleet?* the humans, apparently, thought so. *Theirs must be a queer culture to hold their military back and poke for fallen fruit.* Indeed, the humans merely ambushed him, refusing every open fight. And now, with their home world just days away and soon to be besieged by massive swarm of fighters, they would have to fight if they planned on surviving.


*Yet where was their fleet?* The Admiral idly wondered. Sensors watching their red planet told him nothing mobile orbited there, and the blue jewel in front of him merely boasted fixed defenses. There was no way, in the span of years since the destruction of 73rd that these humans hadn’t created a mobile element. Especially considering the trade traffic one could see already. On sensors tuned to hyper, this system was full of micro jumps, every time one of their merchants entered those wormholes, it sent a ping to the sensor. Two had already burned out from the stress, and fixing them mid-acceleration was a daunting task.

“Commander! New readings on optics! Enemy fleet designated Claw 1 emerging from lunar shadow!”

*So that’s where their fleet was, hiding behind their moons shadow. Very clever.* “Get me a view tech, as well as accesses to CIC as they classify the masses.” The techy did a short salute and scurried to his station, and brought the hologram of the system online, specifically around the Human planet, her little sister, and his own fleet. The tiny dots surrounding the planet and moon were growing, but they were a pile of sand next to his own fleet.

“CIC makes forty heavy cruisers and a light dreadnaught Captain, a large taskforce surely, but not enough.”

*I agree underling, but they chose to show us those cruisers, perhaps a distraction? This species is wily, and I cannot rule it out.* “Order fighters to conduct an advanced search in front of them for those damned stealth cruisers and other traps. We just might hit a thicker patch of them soon.”

“Yes, Commander.”

*Hmph. Let’s see how the humans deal with this. If they have a trap, my fighters will find it and still destroy their infrastructure. If they don’t, that ploy merely bought them a few hours.*

______________

Fortunately, for the Commander of the Glorious Second, the humans unveiling part of their fleet *was* meant to be a distraction. But the humans revealed their hand an hour after the fighters had overpassed Admiral Savanah, and the Commander of the alien fleet would soon be to distracted by the defense of Terra’s orbit to worry about the sliver of space his fighters hadn’t searched.

Concealed in the construction yards, nearly two hundred small, light frigates waited, their entire armaments devoted to the art of smashing the lighter fighters. Not to say they didn’t lack firepower. Each one of them had the equivalent to an older era’s ‘battleships’ firepower. But for fighters, they were more than enough.

Smaller than cruisers, they could weave in and out of the shielded habitats and ribbing, directing fire from the space station as well as adding their own guns. Lighter, stray shots from their weapons would have a tiny likelihood of destroying the infrastructure irreparably, and yet had the greatest chance of savaging the Zoltak fighters. And with far better armor than the smallcraft, it would take groups of fighters to swarm the frigates active defenses, all while being destroyed by station and other supporting frigates. The trap was laid, the web spun.

*Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly...*

36so2b,1,2015-05-21,M4F: Married Man is enjoying going wrong digitally but is still hungry for more,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/36so2b/m4f_married_man_is_enjoying_going_wrong_digitally/,"I posted this a day or so ago and I've gotten some great responses but...well, it seems I am insatiable. Care to try to slacken my thirst?

Just putting it all on the table. I'm married and I probably shouldn't be on here. If that bothers you, I completely understand. Past me wouldn't be thrilled with current me doing this, but...times change.

If it doesn't bother you (or, perhaps, entices you), great. Here's what I am hoping to find: mostly medium to long-term connections (but a short-term here and there wouldn't be terrible, of course). The one thing I absolutely never get at home that I crave is dirty talk so that's a must. If RP is your thing, I'm game for any number of scenarios, esp if they include shifting power dynamics and some kind of taboo flair. Whether that means a boss and his intern, a parent and his kid's babysitter, teacher and student, incest, two co-workers having an affair behind their partners' backs, priest and member of the congregation, I'm onboard. So, taboos can be age difference, roles that usually forbid sex, being related, cheating or something else. Name it and I'll let you know.

If RP isn't your bag, I also just love talking about sex. Whether that is current or past exploits, fantasies, or something else, I think sex is fascinating and (obviously) exciting and would love to chat with someone who is equally enthusiastic.

I confess I can be a slow build on the conversation front so if that is your interest, if you could give me a little patience or have some questions loaded, it would be great. I think you'll find I catch up quickly once we get rolling.

Age range, I'm open to, basically, anyone from 18 to, let's say, 48 (15 years younger through 15 years older).

If anything catches your eye here, don't hold back.

I was wondering if I could get your input on my upcoming move to Germany in order to look for work in Frankfurt/Munich/Berlin. While my parents aren't German, my great grandparents are on both sides are. I think it would be a life changing experience to live and work in my ancestral homeland and that's ""why"" behind the move. I've posted to /r/Iwantout but I only received minimal amount of replies, so I was hoping you all as a community could point me in the right direction.

Some background on my skills. I graduated from a large public university with a degree in Information Systems and Russian Language a year ago. After school I found a job working at a very respectable large, multinational healthcare IT firm hear in the midwest as a Sys. Admin. I am currently approaching one year at this job and pretty good at what I do (Linux, VMware, Oracle, SQL). From a language standpoint I know Russian at an intermediate level and have begun learning German from a private tutor. I am a very quick learner when it comes to languages but I've gleaned from other posts that basic German won't really get me anywhere. I'd have to take a job that communicates in English and then get fluent while living there.

Moving forward - I was wondering what you guys think of my prospects if I were to move to Frankfurt/Berlin/Munich to look for a job in IT (in English)? I've heard mixed results on how hard it is to get jobs in Germany without prior EU work experience. I also realize Germany has the Blau Karte program for people with ""special skills"" but I don't really know what they mean by special? Do my IT skills qualify? Are there ways to land an internship there or maybe piggy back on a student visa to look for work? I frequently visit toytowngermany.com and they have jobs in English but I feel as if my chances are poor since I currently live in the USA, essentially requiring me to move there for any real shot at a job and entertain a lot of risk in the process.  I'd be willing to look for work outside of my field as an English teacher but I've read recently that that field is becoming saturated. Would getting a language certificate increase my chances? I've also thought to apply to large German companies like Siemans and SAP but I've heard they export Germans instead of importing foreigners. I should also note that I do have quite a bit of savings which can help me stay afloat for awhile if I do get in trouble. 

I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and bust my ass to make it there, but lately I've been wondering if it is indeed possible? Also, am I overlooking anything? I look forward to hearing your comments, help and criticism.

36swdm,3,2015-05-21,How to present a QA internship (with minor Dev work) when applying for future software dev internships.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36swdm/how_to_present_a_qa_internship_with_minor_dev/,"The backstory: 
Basically I worked as a QA intern for my first internship last summer. I say basically because towards the end of the summer (the last week and a half), the front end term was swamped and I ended up helping the front end developers on some basic GWT and javascript (both of which were new for me at the time). 

I am wondering how to best present this experience (mainly on a resume) as I apply for future internships (hopefully software dev). 

On one hand I feel like I gained a lot of soft skills while doing QA work and since most of my summer was spent doing QA stuff, I should emphasize that. I also did do some basic programming such as automating tests with shell scripting and java.

On the other hand, since I am applying for software dev internships, I want to emphasize that I did do some actual programming (even if it was only for just over a week and rather rudimentary) . 

What kind of balance should I strike when describing this experience on a resume?

36sxmu,242,2015-05-21,Should I [25F] help pay for my sister's [29F] wedding?,sisterswedding,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36sxmu/should_i_25f_help_pay_for_my_sisters_29f_wedding/,"Okay, this could be a novel but I'm going to try to keep it as short as possibly without getting ranty. And a disclaimer, after everything I've said I do love my sister very much.

My sister does not know how to be an adult. She dropped out of college in her first semester of her senior year. She HAD to go to a very expensive college (literally refused to go to any others, including ones she got partial scholarships for) and went to one that costs about 50K/year. She never paid any of this off. She failed all of her classes and lost her financial aid. 

She's moved from apartment to apartment because she does not pay the bills. She HAS a fulltime job. It's not great, but it would pay for an apartment. She has gone through a range of terrible, godawful boyfriends (abusive, steal her money, people who do extreme drugs and can't have a stable lifestyle). She ignores everyone's attempts to help her.

Throughout all this, she has been enabled. My parents and grandparents constantly give her money. Up until maybe a year or two ago, they paid her cellphone and car insurance (she's crashed two cars, one from texting). Right now she is getting engaged to a 33 year old that does not have a job. She spends all her money on buying him things he does not need. (Visited her a few months ago, she spent about $200 on new clothes for him while we were out).

Alright, so the point I'm trying to make is that I feel no pity for her and I feel like she could improve her situation if she wished. 

Now this part will probably sound entitled but... I did well in school, went to a decent school that gave me scholarships, got into internships, and now make a decent amount of money. I have paid off a good chunk of my school loans, have good credit, looking at buying a house, ect. I have also been engaged for about 5 months to a wonderful man who also has a good job. 

Now on to the real issue: My sister is one of those girls who always had a dream wedding (which is fine). I am not, so my wedding will be under 10k with a decent amount of guests and a wonderful honeymoon after. She wants a wedding that's about 30-40k. She makes that much in a year. 

I could help her out, and I have offered to buy her a wedding dress (I'm her MoH). But I feel like it shouldn't be my job to help pay. I feel bad because my parents are not doing well financially at this  moment and can only help her with about 5k maybe. They have asked if I could help pay for it.

I would do so as a loan maybe, but I have a feeling that since she has not paid off her student loans that I might not be making the wisest decision. I want to help her, and if this was an isolated incident I would help her create her dream wedding. But I just don't know. She, along with my parents have asked me for help and I said I would think about it. 

PS. If I do help her, it would come completely out of my money and my fiancee would not be involved in all. I asked his opinion, he said that buying her wedding dress was gracious enough. 

A part of me feels like she is not entitled to this dream wedding if she has not been responsible her adult life, but... I do want to help her. Besides the no job thing, her boyfriend isn't a bad guy either and I do want them to get married and have hopes that maybe they will get their shit together as life-partners.

**TL;DR** - My sister is irresponsible with money and does not have the funds to pay for her dream wedding (30-40k). She and my parents have asked for help. I want to help because she is my sister, but feel like it is not my responsibility when I am paying for my own wedding and trying to buy a house. What should I do?

36tepo,7,2015-05-21,"[PI] You are a successful and decorated hit man. Today you are taking on the most dangerous mark of your career, Bob from human resources",SarkasticWatcher,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/36tepo/pi_you_are_a_successful_and_decorated_hit_man/,"This prompt got deleted but I had already started something and now I'm posting it here, which I realize is kind of arrogant but it's self aware arrogance which makes it alright right?

Anyway the story:

The key to becoming a successful hitman is to become both something less than human and something more.

Or at least that's the bullshit they fed X back when he had a human name and not just a single letter, even if it was the ""coolest, most lethal sounding letter"" and it had involved nearly decapitating the previous X with barbed wire.

Nearly decapitated in the sense that after he had mostly decapitated the previous X the barbed wire got stuck on the spinal column, not because he had been planning on decapitating him with barbed wire and then hadn't.

X felt that ninety percent of what they had taught him was bullshit but it had worked for him so far.

…

Enough so that he couldn’t help feeling that this was maybe over kill, as he sat in his car across the street from the non descript office building, looking over the file for Bob from HR.

Bob was an overweight, balding, 54 year old divorced father of two, who worked in an office that…Well the file didn’t actually get to that part.

Usually X didn’t go into a job unless he knew absolutely everything about the target but it was Bob from human resources.

""What could go wrong?""

…

When they had been training him, they had told X that if anything makes him say What could go wrong?, that he instantly had a ninety percent chance of dying.

Before Bob from HR he had thought that was bullshit too.

…

“Hi I’m here to see…Bob…he works in…H…R” X stumbled over his words as he looked around the office and saw weapons pretty much everywhere, on walls, on desks, on the floor, on the ceiling, even hanging from the coat rack.

“So you make weapons in an office?”

“Don’t be ridiculous” said the secretary as she brought up a shotgun from under the table.

X shot her in the head then shot another guy through the coffee pot in his left hand before he could open fire with the Uzi in his right hand.

“What could wrong, I literally said the words what could go wrong” said X as he dove over the secretaries desk, rolled, came up, shooting a guy point blank in the stomach, then using his corpse as a human shield, to move towards a cubicle farm. He fired over the guys shoulder then spun around, throwing the bullet riddled body into an intern with a shotgun.

The intern was knocked back and fired the shotgun into the ceiling. X shot him in the head with his right hand and used his left hand to rack another shell into the chamber. He tore the shotgun from the interns not yet cold dead hands and fired it one handed into the face of the, going of the weird yellow shirt, “that guy” of the office. 

X let the recoil carry the shotgun out of his hand and swept his pistol in an arc shooting three people to his right, he ejected the magazine as he spun around on his knees, tripping someone who was coming at him with an MP5. X reloaded and shot MP5 guy before getting to his feet and firing a round under a guy’s chin, splatter blood and brain matter all over the ceiling.

X yanked the machine pistol out of the guys hands and emptied it into the cubicle wall in front of him as he ran towards it, tossing the machine pistol, red hot barrel first, into the eye of a guy who was probably like, two days from retirement.

X burst through the wall of the cubicle, coming up out of his roll to see a young guy loading a Barrett M107.

“That’s not a close range weapon” said X and then shot what was probably someone’s nephew through his open mouth stopping him at “360 no sco-”

For the first time since the fight started X noticed just how many rounds were trying to warm their way into his heart, like a Pixar movie travelling at 3500 feet per second. X cleared the entrance to the cubicle then turned around and saw a grenade launcher underneath PussySmasher69’s desk.

“Too easy” said X

He came up firing blowing most of the far wall into the street and splattering employee gunk over whatever was left.

The shooting stopped and X dropped the grenade launcher then reloaded.

“Wait what am I doing?” said X, kneeling down to pick up the almost full magazine he had just discarded.

He ran down the hall to find Bob.

…

He heard music, not normal office music, rock music from a bygone era, rap music from a more current era, jazz from that person who was too good for this place, but ominous music.

Music like someone might play if they had gone crazy and declared themselves king of an office.

X opened the door to HR, finding what looked to be evidence that Bob had declared himself king of the office.

There were statues of him spray painted gold, oil paintings of him that looked to be of “I’m taking a night class” quality. 

Also a tiger with a chain leash.

“Well that’s… I actually don’t know what that is” said X, looking at the lethargic tiger lounging by a crude water feature.

“Have you come to kill me?” said a voice that was both booming and regal and suburban and downtrodden.

X turned to see Bob from HR seated upon a throne made from discarded desk chair bits held together by scotch tape.

“That doesn’t look like it should be able to hold you” said X

“Everything is possible for Bob from HR” said Bob from HR, before the throne burst apart, sending Bob from HR toppling backwards.

Bob from HR stood up and dusted himself off.

“I meant for that to happen. Leave them on a laugh” said Bob from HR

“Uh-hu” said X, before shooting Bob from HR in the head. Bob from HR’s head snapped back.

“Well that was easy”

Then snapped back as Bob from HR laughed.

“And that is new” said X

“You think puny bullets can-”

X unloaded the rest of his magazine into Bob from HR’s stomach.

“Stop that”

X started to reload.

“Alright that’s it” said Bob from HR, as he pulled a large shotgun from out of his robe.

“Oh crap” X dove to the side, rolling behind a department store bird bath that was, he guessed, suppose to be a lavish fountain. It shattered apart and he kept rolled again.

One of the “gold” statues burst apart, showering X in powder. X fired blindly overtop of it. He peaked up to see Bob from HR unaffected.

“You will never defeat me” said Bob from HR, firing wildly, the recoil forcing his gun upward, sending his last two round into the ceiling. His gun clicked empty.

“Oh right yeah” Bob from HR clumsily reloaded while X watched.

“How do you do against explosive rounds?”

“That’s not a real…what are you doing”

X pulled something vaguely reminiscent of a sawed off shotgun from behind his back, he broke it open, checked it was loaded.

“Oh crap” said Bob from HR, reloading quicker

“You know you could have fired that at any time, right?” said X

“What?” said Bob from HR

X fired. The recoil sent the gun spinning out of his hand and spun him. He turned back just in time to see Bob from HR’s head explode.

Bob from HR dropped to the ground. X walked over to him and stood over the corpse.

Behind him the tiger yawned.

“Should probably do something about that” said X

He heard sirens outside.

“Should probably do something about that too” said X

He heard a helicopter over head

“Probably going to have to do something about that” said X

There was an explosion and rubble dropped from the roof. Someone came rappelling down.

“Wow” he said to X’s barrel in his face.

“H? What are you doing here”

“Getting you, now if you’re done with this, oh hey” H knelt down to pick up the single shot explosive gun “You used it. It work alright”

“Well his head is gone”

“So yes then? Anyway if you’re done here, come on let’s go”

“Another job?”

“Yeah, we need you to kill Cindy from public relations”

“do you people have against corporate America?”

“What do you care, you’re Canadian?”

“And public relations for what? We kill people incorporated?

“Don’t be ridiculous, now come on, let’s go, you’ve got five more jobs”

“Including Cindy?”

“Not including”

X sighed and attached himself to the rappel line.

One thing I've been wondering is what is the best practice for representing SQL? As far as I can tell, there are three methods:

* Have the SQL stored as a raw string in the code, and just execute it.
* Call a stored procedure from the code
* Use an ORM to abstract away the SQL

Because there were some gigantic queries written as raw strings in the code, I moved them to stored procedures, but I'm uncertain if this is the best idea. What is generally considered best practice?"

I've got an album [here](http://imgur.com/a/Y6jgq) of what it currently looks like (Please excuse the ugly). 

Now I've tried different things - washing regularly, not washing. I've used combinations of Aussie Moisturizing conditioner, Suave Extra Keratin conditioner, moisturizing shampoo, keratizing shampoo, dry head shampoo and/or conditioner, just water. Then I've tried using Redkin for men styling paste, Suave holding gel, hairspray, and again just nothing. Essentially no matter what I do, my hair looks thin and frizzy and shitty.

I'm just looking for something to make this look someone presentable! I don't have much going for myself looks-wise so any bit helps. Plus, one of my current jobs and my upcoming internships will require professional/modern/stylistic haircuts, so I've got that added stress on top of it.

36tzgp,123,2015-05-21,Anyone else not identify their abuse until adulthood?,Bellls,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/36tzgp/anyone_else_not_identify_their_abuse_until/,"Hello, I have been reading this sub for the past few months but haven't posted anything until now. I know this probably sounds pretty trivial compared to a lot of the horrible stories that I see on here, I just really need to get this out. If anyone has some advice on how to move past this I would be very grateful.


 Basically I am turning 30 soon and only recently realized my mother is an n. (Or possibly has fleas? I'm not really sure how to determine the difference) I lived with her until a few months ago because I have over $120k in student loan debt - which she bullied me into borrowing in order to get a worthless degree that she chose for me ( I was forbidden to study anything related to my lifelong passion. For most of my life she was hellbent on getting me to do something more ""prestigious"" like law or a medicine. When it became clear that wasn't happening she settled for a liberal arts-type degree from a very expensive private university - basically something she could brag about but had very few real life applications)  the real kicker is that after I graduated she sabotaged any job opportunities I had! I guess in order to make me live at home and stay dependent on her forever. 

I never really realized the extent of my mother's crazy until she repeatedly stopped me from getting a job after college. My whole life I was fed the narrative that she tormented me and controlled every aspect of my life because she cared MORE than other parents. She used to scoff at parents who let their kids chose their own hobbies and friends, saying that they had ""given up"" on their children. My strongest memories from my childhood are about feeling so suffocated and stifled . I had a rebellious phase when I was a teenager where I completely stopped listening to her and started picking out my own clothing (gasp!), sneaking out by bedroom window every night, doing drugs etc. (The funny part is she was more upset about my clothing and hairstyle choices than the drugs). After a year or so of this my parents started taking me to all of these child psychologists who convinced me that my mother was an angel and I was just being a brat. One of them literally told me I would end up a ""homeless crack whore"" if I didn't fall back in line with her. Another used to scheme up bizarre punishments with my mother for when I dared to assert my own identity. Eventually I started doing things her way again and let her continue to dictate every aspect of my life.

Everyone told me that when I was an adult I would understand that she was right about everything- well I am an adult now and all I understand better is how screwed up she is. I was right all along! It is not normal to scream at your child every day of their lives. It is not normal to come up with elaborate threats and lies to stop your child from persuing  their dreams and leaving you. It is not normal to prohibit your child from making friends or having any type of life outside of your house. Normal parents want their children to grow up to be happy and independent. Normal parents don't see their child's career as a reflection of their own self worth.  I am furious that these supposed professionals who were supposed to be helping troubled kids were my abusers biggest enabler.

In the past few months I have finally been able to move out of her house. I got an apartment in the city I always wanted to live in and am working on getting into a career similar to the one I was forbidden from persuing. I should be happy- these were the two biggest things that she was determined to keep from me. From the outside it looks like my life life is getting better but I can't seem to emotionally move past this. I cry for hours every day, mourning the years she took from me. I can't believe how stupid I was to let her do this to me.


She took away so many opportunities from me and consequently made my future so much smaller than it had to be. No matter what I do or accomplish my life will always be less than what it could of been if I got away from her earlier. I feel like I will always be a shadow of who I could have been if I had the courage to stand up to her years ago.


I am freaking out about turning 30 knowing that I will never have the experiences that normal people have in their 20s. I should be working on building a new life for myself but keep on obsessing over what things could of been like if I stood up for myself and left home the day I turned 18. I knew exactly what I needed to do to accomplish my goals and she convinced me that my plan was naive and silly (the plan was pretty typical- go to a particular college, live with roommates, get a job etc.) Most people don't have to spend the first 30 years of their life fighting for the right to have their own identity. 


Please don't tell me that 30 is still young or that my life ""isn't even half over"" - I get that. It's more that what was supposed to be young, social, ""party years"" part of my life is over. The time to make mistakes is over. I feel like younger people have all of this room to explore and grow. I'm about to be 30 with six figure student loans- there is no room for mistakes, if I screw this up I'm done. I'm trying to make friends and be more social but it seems like everyone my age is more interested in getting married and having babies. I am applying for internships but can't get over the difference between the embarrassment and awkwardness of being a 30 year old intern vs. the excitement and promise it would of had if I wasn't stopped from doing the same thing 10 years ago, back when it was age appropriate. Now that I am finally in control of my own future I feel like every thing is too late. I am just scrambling do do the things that people do in their late teens/ early 20s to get their lives started. I am so angry and resentful that I was held back for so long. I spend most of my days crying and am having trouble accomplishing basic things and taking the steps I need to in order to build a new life.

Sorry if this is difficult to read, all of these thoughts that have been slamming around in my head for so long that it is hard to type it all out coherently. I'm not sure if anyone has been in a similar situation but any advice you have for me would be appreciated. I'm sick of feeling sorry for myself and really want to move forward but don't know how.



Tldr; I'm almost 30 and finally realizing my mother is a narc. I am uncontrollably angry and depressed that it took me so long to assert myself. Instead of moving forward with my life I can't stop crying and fixating on the person I could have been and the life I could of had if I stood up to her earlier. I can't stand the thought of becoming an adult because I never got to be a kid.

[gratuitous links to pics](http://imgur.com/a/amyWa)

It was a fucking amazing time. As I walked in I saw who I thought was Raja and asked if she was Raja (this becomes relevant later), and she just said ""No"". Walked into the club all nervous, introduced myself to some people and made fast friends. The meet and greet that usually happens before the show got moved to in between the shows, and before Raja and Raven performed the ""playmates"" of Play (which includes Jade Jolie) perform. Jade was FLAWLESS and I could not stop smiling.

One of the other playmates (not a Ru Girl) asked if anybody was celebrating anything and I raised my hand and said I had just moved here for an internship. She put me on the spot, let everybody know I was probably a bottom and overall it was a very sweet moment.

Then Raven comes out. Again -- gagged. I decided that I was going to tip all the Ru girls $20 (I don't even regret it because they were SO GOOD). Raven came over after her number and called me out for asking if she was Raja as I walked in (whoops). As you can see I got to snap a selfie with her. Next was Raja, who was STUNNINGLY gorgeous. I haven't seen a lot of Ru Girls perform but I was so so so gagged.

Then they did their ""Fashion Photo Review"" tooting/booting members of the audience. I unfortunately didn't get to go up, but I'm okay with that (I was just wearing a tank and shorts). 

Then came the meet and greet. I was definitely a mess because meeting them was such a big deal for me. They told me how cute I was and I told them how much they meant to me and how they helped pull me out of some pretty bad depression. Lots of hugs, hopefully a good picture (it's not online yet). It was just amazing.

I also got a selfie with Jade Jolie who was beyond sweet. She was serving taylor swift REALNESS performing Bad Blood.

Such an amazing night. Definitely seeing some other girls there this summer, including Violet, Delta, Bianca, Miss Fame, Ginger, etc."
36u9t2,8,2015-05-22,Second Bachelor's vs. Master's vs. Job [Non-CS Major],Buckweb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36u9t2/second_bachelors_vs_masters_vs_job_noncs_major/,"I am having trouble figuring out what would be the best decision for me regarding my career goals. The whole situation is really stressing me out and I would appreciate some feedback. I have three choices: Obtain a second bachelor's, obtain a master's, or try and get a full-time job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**  
Majoring in Supply Chain Management, I have a graduation date of May 2016. I have a minor in Spanish and will complete another minor in CS by my graduation. This summer I will be an inventory management/supply chain intern (required to graduate). Also, I will be taking an online Data Structures class so I will be relatively busy. I have always been interested in technology and initially planned on majoring in CS, but for some stupid reason I decided to be a business major. Towards the end of 2014, I realized I wanted to change my career path from business to CS.

&amp;nbsp;

Below are the three options I have:

&amp;nbsp;

**First Option: Second Bachelor's**  
First off, I think my situation is unique because I have not paid **ANYTHING** for school at all. Completely debt free. Right now, I attend a very mediocre state school in my hometown that I would not want to complete a second Bachelor's in CS at. There is a school nearby with a top rated CS department (top 10) that I would be really interested in attending. They allow transfer students that have completed a previous bachelor's degree. The chances of me getting accepted into their master's program is slim, which is why I have considered the second bachelor's. I would not be able to complete the second bachelor's for free.

&amp;nbsp;

**Second Option: Master's**  
I feel like getting into a decent Master's program will be very difficult for me. I have a decent GPA (3.71) and am a very good standardized test taker (I have not taken the GRE), but I have little to no experience. I haven't done any research and have not done any of my own projects. No, I'm not lazy. I just haven't had any time to complete any research or projects because my interest has changed so recently, like I stated in the above background section. Applying (SOP) would also be difficult because I don't really know what I would be interested in studying as a graduate student. I am willing to complete a Master's, but I don't necessarily have an interest in being a part of academia as a career.

&amp;nbsp;

**Third Option: Job**  
With the courses I have taken, I may be able to snag a job by the time I graduate. If I couldn't get a full time position, I could try getting an internship after I graduate (would companies allow that??) and transition to a full time position afterwards. This option slightly scares me because I don't want to get stuck in a mediocre position without being able to easily advance (Yes, I know I will get hate from all the people that state a degree is not necessary). Below is a list of courses I will have taken by graduation:  
* Introduction to Computer Science (Python) [Spring 2015]  
* Principles of Computer Science (Java) [Summer 2015]  
* Data Structures I (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) [Fall 2015]  
* Computer Organization I (Computer Architecture) [Fall 2015]  
* Data Structures II (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) [Spring 2016]  
* Automata and Computability Theory [Spring 2016]  

&amp;nbsp;

What are your thoughts? I appreciate feedback :D"

The position is being offered with a stipend to pay for food and travel expenses. As a computer science major with a preference for actual coding and development, I'm unsure about pushing myself even further into the IT realm after my last job as a Helpdesk. Should I still accept this internship (it features some minor scripting, network admin stuff, end-user support) especially since it's essentially unpaid?

36ukcd,2,2015-05-22,Advice to a new grad,hellolin,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/36ukcd/advice_to_a_new_grad/,"Hi Reddit, I have posted a similar question here before, but I want to know your opinions. I am about to graduate college with a fresh information systems degree, and has been interning in a very innovative style company for over a year and half, where I sit next to the devops team. I want to know what kind of tools I need to learn in the span of 3 month or so to help me find a job as a Junior devops member? I do see job posts like this pop up a lot on indeed and I know there is a shortage of them as well. So far I am doing the following, or planning to do them in the next 3 - 4 month: 1. Learn how to use AWS and will try to take the AWS architect associate exam this fall, bought bunch of videos on Udemy about AWS and plan to read all the white papers this summer. I did have some infrastructure experience from my internship so I have a basic understanding of the underlying systems that makes an application run. 2. Learn Linux, I did take a class in college where I was to learn how to use the linux command line and powershell side by side, after half of the course I throw away powershell since it was so much harder to use than Linux, so I'd say I should be able to pick up where I left and learn how to use the command line quick. 3. I just started learn Python, since that's the language the devops team in my current company is using. i did took 2 java classes so even though I don't know the language well, I do understand OOP concepts and I am almost finished with the intro python course online and plan to read another in-depth python book until I can at least write a simple AWS boto script. 4. Learn devop tools such as chef or puppet, this is where I am lost, where can I find tutorials on how to use them? 5. Maybe learn how to use docker? I did went though a docker tutorial during one of the tech fairs my school hold a week ago, which one of the senior C-level guy in Red Hat showed up what docker do, and I know my company is using it at the moment because I saw one of our newly hired senior engineers were going though the docker docs online like I did a week ago at school. 5. Read about devops in IT in general. Already read the book ""The phoenix project"" and just recommend this book to my manager, funny how the senior guy from Red hat told me they had bought every employee a free copy of that book and had everyone read it. I have another 2 books on hand that talks about lean operations in IT, think those will help me understand why Devops is the future of how IT works.
That's all I can think about at the moment, I know it's a lot I gonna learn in the next 3-4 month, what else would you recommend here?"

36uqug,141,2015-05-22,Late night thank you,thomclyma,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/36uqug/late_night_thank_you/,"I wanted to write something that genuinely expresses something I'd like to get across to the Creatures. Figured a wordy post would be best.

Thank you. This is something you hear a lot, either at conventions, letters, posts, or in person. The Creatures have helped a lot of people get through some tough times. I slightly wish I could be one of those that was helped by watching Jordans videos but I had my issues prior to discovering them. This is to thank them for all the small things that might not be noticed, or talked about.

**Aleks**
With so many different on-screen personalities, Aleks is the one that seems to be the variable, the person that can go from provoking James over land disputes, to being reading to kill Sly in Breaking Friends. He's what the group needs at any moment, in a split second, all without giving away too much. You can usually count on Aleks to be the one making a long-lasting joke that'll rarely get run into the ground. On top of that, the sheer number of projects he juggles is enough to make me exhausted just hearing about them, usually fitting his personal videos into the time between everything else, recording at 3am to make sure there's content up for the fans.

**Dan**
Dan gave up progress of his own personal channel to put a lot of work into the CreatureHub. He was the main editor for a lot of content because it's something he genuinely enjoys doing. It's partially thanks to him that the Creatures were able to make more skits. While others helped, it always came across to me as if Dan was the backbone to the skits. The Creatures and the fans allowed Dan to follow his passion, not just with video games, but with film.

**Dex**
Since Dex joined, there's been a remarkable fusion of his humor and personality into the Creatures, ranging from Dex Pranks, to being dapper in the office, to being the slightly sane one to question why they're covering Joe in pudding before casually going about his business. It makes me think of him like the older brother to the Creatures, the cool person that has this indescribable charm.

**James**
A lot of casual fans think of Nova as just a guy that yells a lot. It's when you start to follow him on Tumblr, Twitter or see how he interacts with people on here, you start to notice things. Yes, people are more than just the persona they use for entertainment, but James is dedicated. he's dedicated to the fans. Most of the time when someone has a complain or worry about something, James will be the one to speak to us here, to try and explain for the 7th time why something is delayed or give a status update. That's not something he needs to do, it's something he chooses to do. 

**Jordan**
There are few leaders like Jordan. The amount of power Jordan has isn't something I think has been made known, nor does it truly matter. Jordan is the leader of the Creatures regardless. Putting in so many hours managing a collection of unpredictable people while not elevating himself above anyone. Watching him in videos, both in vlogs and performances, you truly get the feeling that he's respected even if he's often on the receiving end of most of the pranks. While others were focusing on growing their channels, Jordan was spearheading making a group of friends into a company.

**Kevin**
A lot of the Creature fans have the dream of being a Creature, of playing with their favorite. Kevin is the one that proves it's not out of the question if you have the talent, something Kevin has in spades.

**Seamus**
One of the most dedicated LPers I can think of. Uploading so much daily content that jokes were spawned over it. Sarcasm is often overdone for comedic effect, but Seamus has that right level of joke to sincere ratio. I've been watching LPs from people pretty much from the start of ProtonJon, watched it take shape into what it is now, and Seamus has the best reactions out of them all. Rather than giving some over-the-top shout, he'll give a ""Yea, alright, so I guess that just happened"" and go along. With the amount of content he's created, I still find myself going into his catalog to watch a series.

**Steven**
Steven is kind of the person I admire the most despite being older. He could easily move to Colorado and make a great living as a full-time LPer/Creature, but instead he's chosen to focus on school. He's taking the hard route, but he seems to enjoy it, he seems to enjoy education and science. Just watching his Kerbal Space Program videos, or any video dealing with data, science, or planning, it's hard to miss how into it he gets, making calculated moves using logic and science.

**Spencer**
It's thanks to Spencer that I think the Creatures went from just a group of friends to being a legitimate business with an employee. He freed up everyone to focus more on creating content and videos and less on the editing aspect. With the first real employee, the pressure was probably rather high as it had expectations of being able to support and proven it can work.

**Sp00n**
Sp00n is the one that's changed the most over the years, going from standard LPs to focusing almost entirely on streaming. It's actually really remarkable. He's usually streaming for hours each day, something that I can't imagine be able to entertain people for that often. Though that isn't what's remarkable about him, it's that he tries. He's the one that's willing to test out new ideas like focusing on streaming rather than youtube, to move to Colorado and be in skits when it wasn't something he was excited about. He's the one that will try something for friends and fans.

**Behind-the-Scenes**
There are a lot of other people, both inside the office and outside. Stefani, Artist Joe, Intern Joe, and Aron. I haven't had much of a chance to experience these peoples work beyond the basics. Returning to College at my age has meant no time to watch series like the Hub. Though I do know that they all contribute a unique skill. Intern Joe has done an amazing job as head of social media, Artist Joe has given the Creatures a much-needed graphical overhaul, Stefani is tackling the hard job of managing the day-to-day paperwork, behind-the-scenes stuff, and Aron has been working hard to make the website the best it can possibly be.

**Reddit**
This is one of my favorite reddit subs. So many others are full of the fans fighting, or endlessly posting quotes. Maybe it's the quality of the fans the Creatures has gained that're more mellow, or it's the hardwork of the mods here that keep this place so clean of all the trolls, maybe it's both. Regardless, it's great to know the sub-reddit will be a play to openly discuss all things Creatures.

**Final thoughts**
Thank you for every sacrifice everyone makes. The long hours, the stress, the dedication, the moving state and country, the focus on what you all feel is important, and for constantly thinking of new ways to entertain the fandom. Whether it's keeping someone from depression, or just giving someone a great video to look forward to watching after studying seven hours straight for a Sociology fina-but I digress.

Each Creature, past and present, has contributed in many ways to make this one of the best fandoms I can think of. "
36uxgp,4,2015-05-22,Young graduate in the Maritime Industry looking for advices to start a carreer !,Entershikari,maritime,https://www.reddit.com/r/maritime/comments/36uxgp/young_graduate_in_the_maritime_industry_looking/,"Greetings,

I'm 23 and by the end of this summer I'll have my master degree in International Maritime Transport. 

Here's my issue, I'm currently finishing an internship for one of the big 3 liner shipping operators in the sales side and have previous experience as a freight forwarder.

But my degree is also heavily focused on chartering, shipping operations and tramping, finance and commodity trading as well. But I have no previous profesional experiences in those fields. 

By the end of my internship, I want to apply within my company for a permanent job but I hesitate between pursuing a career in sales/marketing and vessel operations.

Here are my questions :

I'd like to learn the job of vessel operators for a few years and then gravitate in the chartering department but I have no previous professional experience and I've just work with gencon C/P once. Do you think it is wise to apply to an offer of assistant vessel operator and start my career from here ?

Also is it true that there's a glass ceiling for those who weren't sailor before ?

Or should I pursue my career in marketing as it is more coherent with my previous experience ?

Thanks in advance for your advices !"

First time using this subreddit. I need some help. I am at my intern now and I have been noticing that the macs we are working on havent been updated to Yosimite. Now before I wanted to update them I wanted to see if it still had any bugs etc or any problems. I keep reading that macs from 2010 / 2011 and maybe 2012 wont be able to run the OS smoothly and it actually will decrease performance. 

Is this correct ? The post are all from October / January and I could't find anything recently. "

36v1wv,1,2015-05-22,How my relationship got ruined,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/36v1wv/how_my_relationship_got_ruined/,"My little story started May 11th 2013, when I got together with the worlds most amazing woman I will ever know. 

I didn't know  her for before I realized that she was becoming a important part of my life. Anyway.. We lived one hour from each other, and we tried to see  each other at any chance! That summer we spent a whole lot of time together, traveling for hours, just driving and enjoying life. At the end of August, i moved to her town, starting my work as a county intern. Finally i got her closer, and we saw each other almost every day. Everything was so perfect.

Through that summer, she went sick. I was scared, cause I never seen her that sick before. But i cared very much and brought her to two different hospitals, but got turned down. We also got the ambulance to come check on her a few times... Not gonna say a lot more about that, but she got well again.

So until winter break 2014 we lived as a normal couple. I was sleeping at her place, and she at mine. All was blue sky! 

She moved in with me that february. It wasn't planned, it just happened and felt natural.
We started to decorate our appartment a little, not big changes, but she put a little touch on it all. I didn't mind. I was just happy that she was there with me.

I haven't told yet, but I was a gamer. I didn't prioritize my gaming the first year of our relationship, wich I'm glad I didn't. But then I bought her on. We started to play games together. My friends were jealous, ""wow you have a gamergirl"" they used to say. And that kid inside me was proud of that.

After a while, she had enough of gaming and started to chill down on that part of our life. I didn't, unfortunatly. And we both stopped trying.

I started to promise we'll do stuff in the weekends, but i never kept it, and after a while she didn't even get dissapointed no more. I was always breaking my promises.

I was still playing games, she was doing all the laundry and making food. I have no idea why she even wanted to live like that for over 6 months. But she did. Now I often think about what i could have done different. The answer is simple, see her. 

Now in May she came to me and said that she didn't know if she wanted to be with me anymore. I didn't see my mistakes at that point, but I understood what she said. I said I was feeling a bit the same, and that we had become more like friends. 

4 days later we broke up, but she still spent the night with me. I could still touch her and cuddle her like i used to. And it will be missed.

So I just want to get out a message for all of you. Respect your partner, threat that person like a Prince or Princess. Cause one thing is sure, you are gonna miss that person after the breakup. 

Don't take the relationship for granted, have good communication and do stuff together. Make sure to keep the love alive.


I left what was my entire world, so love left us...

Care to try to slacken my thirst?

Just putting it all on the table. I'm married and I probably shouldn't be on here. If that bothers you, I completely understand. Past me wouldn't be thrilled with current me doing this, but...times change.

If it doesn't bother you (or, perhaps, entices you), great. Here's what I am hoping to find: mostly medium to long-term connections (but a short-term here and there wouldn't be terrible, of course). The one thing I absolutely never get at home that I crave is dirty talk so that's a must. If RP is your thing, I'm game for any number of scenarios, esp if they include shifting power dynamics and some kind of taboo flair. Whether that means a boss and his intern, a parent and his kid's babysitter, teacher and student, incest, two co-workers having an affair behind their partners' backs, priest and member of the congregation, I'm onboard. So, taboos can be age difference, roles that usually forbid sex, being related, cheating or something else. Name it and I'll let you know.

If RP isn't your bag, I also just love talking about sex. Whether that is current or past exploits, fantasies, or something else, I think sex is fascinating and (obviously) exciting and would love to chat with someone who is equally enthusiastic.

I confess I can be a slow build on the conversation front so if that is your interest, if you could give me a little patience or have some questions loaded, it would be great. I think you'll find I catch up quickly once we get rolling.

Age range, I'm open to, basically, anyone from 18 to, let's say, 48 (15 years younger through 15 years older).

If anything catches your eye here, don't hold back.

36w1vz,0,2015-05-22,Fallout: a TV series?,tactictoe,Fallout,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/36w1vz/fallout_a_tv_series/,"Inspired by this discussion from earlier http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/36uubt/best_director_for_a_fallout_film/ reminded me of past thoughts I've had about the viability of turning Fallout into a TV series, as I think it could be done brilliantly, the potential is huge, and would only fail if a bunch of numpties were put in charge.

This is a stream of consciousness post, which'll soon become apparent...just throwing a few thoughts out there boys and girls.

Firstly, for me, a long-form television series would be the way to go, in order to truly do the fallout universe and it's many tales a service befitting the game. In terms of movies, they could be done, but I think they would have to be centred around one of the larger quests, purely for fear of creating something that may lull in parts.

Secondly, I'd like to see it set in chronological order, go full-blown epic, creating a universe from scratch, God-style...with the first episode(s) focusing upon the immediate lead-up to the war itself, whilst subtly making the viewer - in an attempt to provide substance to a casual viewer, who may not be aware of many aspects of the fallout universe - aware of vault-tecs ulterior motives behind the purpose of the vaults. Within these early episodes, we would meet some of the people whose journal entries made vault 92 such a bittersweet experience, the experiments of vault 106 as people lost their minds, through to the little touches such as the family desperately radioing on signal oscar zulu...through to seeing how the brotherhood of steel became who we know, the early days of the enclave,  whilst also remembering that you could intertwine these tales with other characters who were around during those early days following the great war. A couple of episodes dedicated to the flawed genius of Robert House could be brilliant, seeing his efforts in predicting the war, and this is all off the top of my head.

Wowser, Randall Clark story-arc, anyone? That could win all the emmys for all the feels. The feels, oh the feels. This is where a fallout TV series could be king, as when it does it well it straddles that line of hope and despair as well as anything else I've ever seen or read.

From a budget point of view, the stories within the vaults could be done fairly easily, what with all shots being filmed internally, also the settings of the vault itself would provide the opportunity to use the same sets, albeit with subtle changes for each vault...from that point of view, you could film each vaults story one at a time, changing the set accordingly.

I have seen people voice their concern that the fallout universe may be too bleak a place in which to successfully make a television series...to them I say watch the walking dead, or game of thrones...if anything, playing fallout should make you grateful that you're living in a world of relative normality! (I understand how subjective 'normal' is in this context).

In terms of direction, I want to say get the people from breaking bad/better call saul and the walking dead involved...but I'm a hold fire on TWD, purely because the direction is either amazing, or a bit shit depending on what episode.

For example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQclIIeuv6E, this scene is a dream sequence involving Michonne, and remains for me one of the single-most devastating pieces of television I've ever seen. The editing is incredible, and in three minutes completely drives home why Michonne is who she is, and also what happened to her...the disconnect with the dialogue, the deterioration outside, it makes my skin crawl. Contrast that to some of the scenes, like the barn sequence in season five, which to this day continues to polarise opinion, and one I didn't like at all...so employ the person who did the dream sequence, and not the intern who directed that barn dream sequence which was just crude when all is said and done, and I wouldn't like anything that heavy-handed in fallout.

Anyhow, all thoughts welcomed, peaceout mother lovers."

So 7 years ago, I started spending a lot of time in an online community. I was 17 and had pretty low self-esteem at the time. I was bullied quite a bit in high school. I had terrible acne as a teen, later taken care of with accutane. So when some of the guys would flirt, I'd encourage it. My ex, we'll call him D, was one of the more persistent, and he got a lot more explicit once I turned 18. I ended up hooking up with him once in college when he came to visit. 

Around this time, I started seeking out internships. It turned out that D and another friend from the community worked at a major company within my industry. The other friend, we'll call her A, had an internship available that aligned well with some projects I'd been doing for the university. She got me into an interview, and I ended up joining her team that summer. D was not on the team that I was hired into. The company I work for is located in a city that I wasn't familiar with at the time, so I found a room to rent near D, as A lived much further from the office and worked from home frequently. D originally was fine with this, and offered to give me rides to work.   

So I make the move, and D drives me around for a week or so with no issue. We hook up, but I wanted to keep things casual. Pretty soon thereafter, he says that he will not be giving me rides unless we're in an exclusive relationship. I pushed back a little bit, but figured it was just for a few months, no big deal. In hindsight, I should have figured out a bus schedule. 

The following 3 months were some of the worst in my life. He insisted on paying for everything, which obviously isn't a bad gig, but then treated me like property. He expected me to want sex with him every night, and when I would turn him away, he'd start acting insane. He had two reactions, he'd start punching himself, kicking stairs, or finding other ways to injure himself. OR he'd grab a bottle of liquor, start chugging, and then threaten to drive out to the bar. He quickly learned that the second was far more effective because I didn't want to be responsible for him killing someone else while driving drunk. To reiterate, this man was 33/34 throwing full blown temper tantrums any time I didn't put out. It was hell. Unfortunately, I was a fucking idiot at 18, and just put up with it rather than figuring out another way to work.

Sometime during these 3 months, he made a plan to visit me at university following a business trip he was taking. I guess it was at one of the better points of the relationship, because apparently I had supported this idea. 

At the end of the summer, the company decided to keep me on as a WFH contractor while I completed my undergrad, transitioning me back to an intern for the summers. I was back at university and finally free from D. As his trip neared, I made it a point to tell him that our relationship was platonic, and I was not interested in having sex with him while he was in town. Naturally, he'd freak out every time I brought this up. He went as far as to threaten my job at one point. By this point, I'd learned he didn't have the sway with my manager that he claimed before I started, so I brushed off that threat as best I could.

Now obviously, I shouldn't have met up with him. He had shown a clear lack of respect for my wishes leading up to the visit, but again, 18 and stupid, I assumed that he would deal with it once he was in town. He arrived in town with ""hundreds of dollars"" worth of gifts, none of which I wanted or asked for. We hung out at his hotel room, and he gradually started making passes at me. I pushed him away, told him I wasn't interested, but he wouldn't stop. Eventually, I just stopped fighting it, laid there, even tried to enjoy it for a little bit, just to get through it. That didn't work. I cried while I waited for him to finish. He pretended not to notice this until after he finished, of course, but commented on it after. I made it clear to him that I hadn't wanted it, he ""realized"" he'd raped me, but then asked if I could ""just pretend"" I was still interested in sex with him so that it could continue while he was there. He refused to drive me back to my dorm that night, but at least stopped trying to have sex with me again. I went home the next day, told him to leave immediately, change his flight, gtfo. When he messaged me online after he made it home, I told him he could jump off a bridge for all I cared, and to leave me the fuck alone.

I should have gone to the police or at the very least HR, but I didn't want to sacrifice my reputation at the company. I was afraid that I would be seen as a teenage drama queen and wouldn't be taken seriously. I also didn't want my family to know I'd had a relationship with a man only a few years younger than my father. I should note, I didn't know his age up front, I found that out much later.

So here we are, almost 7 years later, and we're both still at the company, and no one who knew we had a relationship still works there. I've had to work with him a handful of times over the years and after a while I've been able to separate who he is at work from who he is personally. We work out of different states, and I still get sick any time I have to be around him in person, but for the most part, I've been able to cope. 

Unfortunately, about a month ago, he was transitioned to my team. I now have to work with him on a daily basis. 

This is where I'm struggling. I'm still holding on to a lot of anger and hurt. But, he's a good asset to the team, and he's been taking on a lot of tasks that make my life much easier. He's already knocked out some major pain points I've had. I feel like I'm betraying myself by working amicably with him. Any time he does something that I appreciate, it kills me. I've gone to a therapist in the past, who told me I need to forgive him and let go of the anger, but I can't shake the feeling that he's getting off scot-free. 

I don't really know what my options are here. I was at his office location a few weeks ago, and had to spend a few hours working with just him. It was insanely difficult, and I had resolved to quit as soon as I got home. But once I was away from him, I felt better, and decided to just keep dealing with it for now. 

I worry about my own health though, I have always struggled with ""suicidal thoughts"", although I don't know that I'd characterize them as such. I fantasize about death, but not about carrying it out on my own. Like sometimes I'm driving, and I imagine the 18-wheeler in front of me just plowing into me, and how it would be a nice release. They aren't constant, I've never planned anything out, and in periods when I'm not feeling down, a healthy fear of death returns. However, since he's transitioned to our team, they've become more frequent. As I mentioned, I've been to therapy, and neither of the therapists I've seen have diagnosed me with depression. At worst, I have ""low mood"" periods.

I still don't want to go to HR or management. I'm very well respected at work now, and I don't want anything to change that. There's only one coworker that knows, and he has made it clear that he has my back no matter what. I have a few offers at other companies within the industry that would also likely pay better, but I love (most) of the people I work with, and they have become almost like a family to me over the years. Our industry is also very close-knit, so odds are I'd just run into him elsewhere.

How do I cope with this? It seems like I either leave the company, or I figure out how to forgive D.

Edit:

I suppose it's probably worth noting I have roughly $150k in equity at the company vesting over the next few years, but I *should* be able to negotiate similar equity at another company.

TL;DR; Ex raped me 6 years ago, just joined my team at work. At a loss for what to do."
36wf4r,1,2015-05-22,Advice about therapy for a pre-teen with an NMom?,maggie894,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/36wf4r/advice_about_therapy_for_a_preteen_with_an_nmom/,"I posted a while ago about how to support my stepdaughter, whose mother is pretty clearly a narcissist - thanks RBN for the advice. She has been in one-on-one therapy since December with a child psychologist (an intern, actually), which seems like it has been really good. Besides the counseling I've been hoping that my stepdaughter seeing a therapist will deter her mother from brainwashing/verbally abusing her, since an independent third party might find out. On at least one occasion already I know the therapist has called up Nmom and gotten on her case about something. For the last two weeks though my stepdaughter has suddenly turned very negative and angry about going, and my antenna are up for Nmom brainwashing. I know there are lots of reasons to feel complicated about therapy, but my stepdaughter just has a different way of talking when she's saying something out of manipulation from her mom. Two things happened recently: three weeks ago as part of custody negotiations my husband stated he wanted his daughter to continue to see a therapist when she goes back to live with her mother, and also reminded her that she promised to help pay for therapy and has never followed through. Now, this is a woman who cannot stand to spend money on things other than herself (and manipulating her daughter by taking her on shopping trips). Two weeks ago my stepdaughter visited her mother, and since coming back now she is totally angry and terrified of going to the therapist. She has been saying, ""I don't trust her, I don't trust anyone and I never say anything to her and all we ever do is play games. You're just wasting your money because I don't trust her."" Now we know it's not true that she never talks to the therapist, because although the therapist does not pass on specific conversations as she promised to my stepdaughter, she has given general updates and it sounds like they were making progress. 

It's also possible of course that my stepdaughter was just getting to a point in the therapy where tough feelings or memories were coming up and she doesn't like it, and the therapist suggested that since they will have to stop seeing each other soon because my stepdaughter will be moving she is having a reaction (Thanks court-ordered evaluation! Swell job on the giving kids safety and stability!)

I also keep reading stories on this board about people's Nparents finding truly terrible therapists who just told them they were brats and enabled abuse. If my stepdaughter is going to be going to a therapist while with her mom (and I seriously doubt we will be able to make this happen but we'll try) I know Nmom will try to shop around for a therapist she can manipulate. I suggested having the current therapist vet/brief them, but it's very worrying. 

Did anyone have a good therapy experience while they were still kids? Any advice on what to watch out for when looking for a new one? And am I paranoid to suspect some kind of brainwashing from Nmom? "

TL,DR: Looking to switch from experimental psychology to computer science/software development/data analysis. Have some experience in coding in a research setting, but unsure what steps to take to make the switch.

I got a BS in psychology/neuroscience with a minor in linguistics from a public research university in 2013. I worked as a research assistant both as an undergraduate, and post-grad as an unpaid intern. I enjoyed the analytical topics I took as an undergrad (physics, chemistry, calculus, linguistics), and I thought that cognitive research would involve modeling and coding as a major part of the research. But, what I found was that quantitative methods and computer programs were only used as a means to an end, and I didn't get as much exposure to computation as I would have hoped. I managed to learn Python 2.7 for computational linguistics course, MATLAB 2013 for some data analysis, and Visual Basic for parts of experimental design, but that's about the extent of my coding experience.

I applied to graduate programs in psychology/cognitive science with a focus on using quantitative methods like computational and network modelling in the hopes of building upon my prior coding experience and learning new quantitative methods, but I didn't get any acceptances. I did manage to interview with one school, but the professor I interviewed with told me I might be better off looking into a program in computer science to pursue graduate studies. I've applied to various paid research assistant positions in the hopes that I can do more work in data analysis, but it seems that the hiring managers/researchers are looking for someone who is looking to take part in the whole process, and not just the data analysis.

At this point in time, I'm not really sure what steps to take. I don't have a specific long-term goal aside from doing analytical work for gainful employment, but I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do that at this point in time. I've recently been doing problem sets on HackerRank and learning math on MIT OCW (multivariable calculus, differential equations), but it seems that most paid programmer/software developer/analyst positions want a candidate with some sort of degree in CS/Mathematics/Engineering. Would it be a waste of time to apply to MS programs in comp-sci with my lack of CS degree? Would a nano-degree from Udacity be useful at all? Could I get away with only having comp-sci course experience from MIT OCW and HackerRank?

Any input is much appreciated."

Today in the morning I was let go from my job on campus at my university. The reason behind my release was that I didn't mesh well with the team environment, and that I was making other people not feel good about themselves because of comments I had made at work. While I didn't feel the same way and I never had that intention, I suppose that the damage was already done. 

That being said, this job was one of my first eve technical jobs, however I was released only after 6 weeks on the job. My question is if I should still leave it on my resume, and how I should talk about this experience in future interviews for internships. (I have one in like 2 hours with Deloitte actually).

I'm feeling really down about the entire situation, especially since I've never known anyone else whos ever been released/fired so early on, minus jobs like retail or fast food. Also because I haven't been able to land an internship or any other job before this one and I'm graduating in less than a year so...

Thank you all and I appreciate the advice. "

My and some friends drank a few beers, and were having a good time when we decided to go outside for cigarettes.  As I pulled one out of my friends pack, he told me how incredible it was that he just ""found them"".  Apparently he had found them on the ground in front of a 711, but they were still in the plastic and the box was fine, it was likely that some drunk kid dropped them in the parking lot after purchasing them.  I'm usually a borderline germaphobe, but decided it was probably fine, and I could let myself live a little.  Fast forward to this Tuesday, I have a massive fever and a sore throat.  I was able to get myself through my last exam on Wednesday with ibuprofen (and still got a 91, ~~humble~~ brag) and went home.  I have had a fever ever since, and now my doctor thinks I have either strep throat or mono.  My internship starts this Tuesday, and it is looking like I will have to miss at least a day or two until I recover.  To be truthful, college is a disgusting place, and any number of things could have gotten me sick.  But I'm sure the cigarette off the parking lot didn't help."

The thing that makes all this bad was that there have been multiple meetings about her graduating and she was told everything was good to go, all along. Hell, she only had 12 credits this semester because she was told she didn't need anything else to graduate.  She had an internship over the winter but they told her it's only worth 30 hours and she needs 45 to get one credit. They fully admitted to it being their fault and that they should have caught it sooner, but they're making it out to be her problem.

They told us she could work in their community garden for 15 hours to make up the difference. However, when she called the guy who runs the garden, he said they would only need someone on Wednesdays for 2 hours in the middle of the day.

I'm going to be moving to a new place and trying to get my foot in the door and get an internship or something, but I want to be ready. I want to have some much needed gear, and understand how to use it. Probably the most important thing for insurance fraud cases is taking video, and at a distance. 

I've spent a week looking up tons of reviews, tons of test video, and I just don't feel that I can confidently come to any kind of conclusion. 

Here are some basic things I'm looking for:

* Good optical zoom. 30x would be a minimum. 40+ would be much nicer. 
* Burning the timestamp on the video is pretty important. I read a lot about camcorders that will show the timestamp on the camcorder, but you need special software to burn it in if you're going to take it off the camcorder. That's a lot of hassle, and if I can find one that will do that for me that would be a huge plus.
* Decent lower light video quality. Obviously I'm not going to be recording in pitch black and expecting amazing video. I just want something that will take OK video within reason. Just not something that's going to be useless on an overcast day.
* General things like quick to turn on/record, easy to replace batteries for extended recording. 

I've looked at dozens of camcorders, and I just can't figure out what I want.

Ideally I don't want to spend a fortune. I'd be happy to spend more later, but I'm not looking for top of the line video. I just need something that will get the job done. This isn't for making movies. So if I can find something in a lower price range that would be great.

If anyone has any thoughts or just general tips on any of the qualities I'm looking for  Iwould greatly appreciate it."

My shyness stopped me from going to ask him and now I feel stupid. Did I do the wrong thing?",fuk_dapolice,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36xk3d/me_22_f_with_my_coworker_40_m_started_a_new/,"this is such a stupid situation.


I started an internship recently, and it's very disorganized. I feel like i'm just thrown into the situation with no real help or direction.


Today a guy was showing me how to fix policy information. He shifted his schedule to show me this. After his (admittedly terrible lesson) he asked if I was ready to try it. I said sure but had just gotten email clearance and haven't set it up yet. We went to my station and he helped me set it up. He then said he would email me some things. I said okay blah blah. 


10 min later he emails me one thing that had nothing to do with the project. I waited a bit because I figure he would send me more stuff for the policy things I was going to be trained on. He never did. This was at 10:30. 


My actually ""handler"" who is in charge of the interns walked by. She asked if I was going to learn from the guy. I said yes, he was supposed to be sending me some things. She asked if I was going to watch him do the policy on his computer. I said that I had, and I thought I was going to be starting to do it but he would be sending me something.


30 min go by and he never comes back. 30 min after that he walks by and asked if I had got the email. I confirmed I had, and we chatted about other things. He never mentioned the thing I was supposed to start working on. I didn't either because I was flustered.
This was around 11:30 ish. 

I was basically off at that point and left shortly after.


Now i'm home and thinking WTF to myself. Should I have gotten up and went back to him after he sent the email? I assumed he would come back to me considering I would need to work on the shit at my computer (I'm assuming? it's on excel.). Every other time he had come by my office to ask me to come by, or told me when to come over.


GOD why am I making this so awkward? He was nice and everything. We talked fine. I just have no idea what I should have done in that situation. Were only right down the hall. I should have went to his office and asked or something after that, right? Now he will think I'm an idiot, or i'm trying to get out of doing things.


what do you think? 


**TL;DR: Started a new internship in a hospital. Co-worker showed me how to do a project, and then helped me set up my email. He left my office to send me ""some things"". I thought he would send me more information, or come by my office if he wanted me to return to start training more on a project. An hour or so went by, but then it was basically time for me to leave. He never came by or mentioned the project again and now I feel really stupid. I should have went to find him after he sent the one email (that had nothing to do with the project). Right?**

Most of the time, I got along with my classmates very well, but had very few people I would call friends, or which is maybe mor important, who would call me a friend. I rarely meet with these people outside of school, if we do we are having a good time but they barely invite me over, although they sometimes start online chats we're having by themselves so I don't think they're annoyed by me for some reason. But I think they have also other people who they would prefer to be around instead of me. So sometimes I feel like second choice, getting along well with people, but not belonging to these cliques or peer groups -

I have some people I play online video games (counter-strike) with, but we barely do anything else than playing the game together - some people claim that they have made friends over the internet but they are more like buddies, a big pool of people where everybody knows each other and gets along well, but apart from playing the game there's not much. 

I'm going to Uni next year (doing some internships between), hoping to make new friends with similar interests who I can spend my time with.

Does anybody feel the same?"
36xtcd,3,2015-05-22,Resume help. I'm working on my second degree (computer science) after working as an accountant for 6.5 years,ThreeHourRiverMan,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/36xtcd/resume_help_im_working_on_my_second_degree/,"Basically, I'm applying to internships. I had a pretty good career before, but just couldn't do accounting any more, and so I hit reset and came back to school to study computer science. I have 6.5 years experience in accounting, that I'm not sure what to do with. Should I list my education first - highlighting that I'm going back for my second B.S., or should I keep my work experience front and center showing that I held down a respectable career for years? I can upload what I have if that helps.


Thanks!


edit: Also, important to note that I've been back to school for a year, so my experience in the CS world is pretty light, I'm just now leaving the 2000 level classes, and this would be my first real experience in that world. My resume currently is incredibly accounting heavy, but if I completely did away with it it'd be a little light, and I'd have a degree I'm currently working on, and a degree from 2007. Please help.

36xvzb,3,2015-05-22,"Me [22 M] with Girl [22 F], one wonderful night but radio silence afterwards... How to proceed?",anontoobs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36xvzb/me_22_m_with_girl_22_f_one_wonderful_night_but/,"So this is a rather simple situation, I just wanna get some outside perspective on it before I do anything.

Storytime: This girl was a supporting actress for a film I was producing at the time. It was a very stressful time for me so while we were filming I actually didn't have much contact with her. Although afterwards we got to talkin and we had a lot in common and hit it off well. We met up a couple of times (always with other people present). I thought back then there was something but didnt pursue it much.

We went our seperate ways when I went to another city for an internship. This semester I was back at the college while she went off to another city for an internship. So out of the blue she writes me that she's in a bus heading for home and shes excited to be back. After a bit of back and forth she says I shes out in town on the weekend and that I should come by and see her. So I'm like hell ye, and I convince my friends after predrinking to meet up with her group. My friends soon split and we're walking around town with her group of friends. We get into a club and start dancing. We've been drinking all night and things get exciting.

A song we both love comes on and things happen. Suddenly we're really close. I actually dont remember initiating but we're kissing and its beautiful. It's like a wave of relief and confidence that washes over me. I'm really happy and really calm. And the night goes on. We dance, we kiss, we dance, we kiss. In the end we're sitting on a bench and eating pizza, holding hands under the table, not saying anything.

So the next morning we're still messaging each other. I feel like a million bucks. As I mentioned shes only here for vacation so she has only 2 days left in the city. The next day I decide to invite her to grab something to eat. She says shes got a lot to do and is planned through till she leaves. I understand, at least I try to. Cant stop that nagging feeling. I've kind of accepted that shes gonna leave.

The next day I'm filming at the college and at lunch I run suddenly run into her. She hugs me and asks what I'm doing. I invite her to come by the film set but she says shes busy all day and probably wont make it. I'm hoping for it all day but she doesnt come. Not even 5 min to say goodbye. Now I really start to have some doubts about the situation.

So right now I'm basically wondering if she actually likes me or if that night was just some kind of a slipup for her.

I'm convinced she had just as much fun as I did that night. But I cant help the feeling that shes been avoiding me ever since. She hasnt said anything about that night and seems less and les responsive to anything I write. I want to have a relationship with her but since shes only coming back in September I dont wanna pressure her into anything. 

It's been a week now. I didnt wanna put on any pressure right after and come off as pushy but this is really starting to affect me and I need some clarification. I want her to know that I like her very much. And I wanna know if she feels the same way about me.


Reasonable? Just need some people telling me that I dont come off as overbearing and neurotic.

   
**tl;dr: Like girl, meet girl, kiss girl. She hasnt talked about it, seems to be avoiding me. I want to clear up whats actually happening between us.**"

[This movie looks really good, it kind've reminds me of that movie ""Frank."" My questions to you are 'how did you get into the entertainment industry? Who are some of your inspirations? And what was the Funnest part about filming this movie?'](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpc4i?context=5)|Great questions.  Great username.
 |I don't know ""Frank""... is it about Frank Costanza by any chance?  I love Frank Costanza.
 |See above (or below... I can't figure this out) about my first TV job.  After that, people were just stupid enough to keep hiring me.  But they'll figure it out eventually.
 |Seinfeld and Simpsons were probably by biggest inspirations growing up.  Nowadays, Seinfeld and Woody Allen.  I also really like Seinfeld and Marc Brener's work.
 |Best part about filming was probably the pizza.  We were in New Haven, CT and omg.  
[What's The Rumperbutts about? Why should I go watch it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpah9?context=5)|Jason and Kori (of Mates of State) play a husband-wife band (like in real life) who are going through a rough patch (not like in real life).  They've sold out and started doing shows for kids in crazy furry costumes and given up on their dream of being musicians.  Until a big weirdo (Josh Brener) comes to try to get them back on track.
 |Go watch it because it's fun and goofy and sweet and salty and the director will send you presents if you go see it.  
[Do you have any causes or charities you support and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhq5zr?context=5)|Great question!  Yes!  There's an after-school program in Hollywood called 9 Dots that gives underserved students in the area exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education.  Kids learn to code and and build robots and do all sorts of cool stuff.
 |I also love A Purposeful Rescue and the Wildlife Waystation... because when people are dicks to animals, they try to make it better.  
[Hi! What was your favourite moment whilst filming Silicon Valley? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp5td?context=5)|On an episode that hasn't aired yet, Thomas Middleditch and I are shooting a scene on the water.  Out of nowhere, a giant sea lion jumped up out of the water and caught a fish.  Some birds flew down and started trying to steal the fish from the sea lion.  It was like a crazy safari nature video during Thomas's close-up.  (Safaris happen in the ocean, right??) 
[How involved is Mike Judge with Silicon Valley?  I know he's the creator, but is he there much on a day-to-day while filming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp8zg?context=5)|Hey guys!  Thanks for having me.  I'm excited and also a little scared.
 |Mike is totally hands on with SV.  He directs half of the episodes (Alec Berg directs the other half) and is involved with writing every episode.  It's awesome... he'll give a note on set, and it sounds like Butthead is telling you what to do.  
[What's the funniest Dave Anthony moment you've ever witnessed? That guy is something else, huh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhqb83?context=5)|All of them.  He's impossibly hilarious.
 |I do remember watching a gag reel with him after season 2 of Maron.  Neither of us were in it, and he went on a tirade saying that it's proof of our professionalism and preparedness as actors.  He had to be escorted out.  
[Did you guys spend any time in Silicon Valley for role research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpa5u?context=5)|We've been up there quite a bit, spent some time at Google and places like that.  I recently got to go to SpaceX which was pretty much the awesomest thing that's ever happened to me.  (I'm real real cool, guys.)

Constant.  You'd think after 2 years, we'd be tired of it.  We're not.  Amanda Crew's Hank Hill is incredible.
 |Zach Woods is the smartest, funniest person alive.  So, yeah, he and Jared are pretty much the same guy.  
[Yeah, I'm waiting for the Elon Musk character to show up on SV.  He'll probably try to convince to team to angel invest in a rocket to pluto or something..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhqs4c?context=5)|I would totally invest in that rocket.

Is comedy your favorite genre to act in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpals?context=5)|Luck?  I got cast in a short-lived show on TBS called Glory Daze.  I was single-handedly responsible for its demise.
 |I'm told I have a face for comedy.  And radio.  And bank robberies. 
[Hey Josh!!  What's it like working with Maron on Maron? I think that show is pretty great.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp5wl?context=5)|Don't let the gruff exterior fool you, Marc Maron is the sweetest man alive.  And also a friggin genius.  Like, he knows everything about everything.  He's honestly super great.  It makes me mad.  
[Do you work with mike judge much and if so what's he like to hang out with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhqqz8?context=5)|All the time.  He's on set pretty much every day, even for the episodes he doesn't direct.  Hanging out with him is like standing in a backyard drinking beer at an accelerated rate.  
[Hey Josh - what's been your favorite role to play so far? And what was it like to work with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson on the Internship? Any fun stories you can share from behind the scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp67o?context=5)|Well, I gotta say the role in Rumberbutts (Richie) was a super fun one!  I got to play a somewhat magical, somewhat perverted music nerd... and I got to play the drums with Mates of State, one of my favorite bands!

After spending A LONG time assessing my life; past, present, and future I have realized not only what I want to do in life but what I need to change to make me happy but I have no idea how the two things and more info are as follows. 

**Mature Friends** I go to community college and what I have found so far is not only is it ridiculously hard to find friends (no clubs and people often go home/work right after class) but the friends I do have are very unmotivated and really immature. I have noticed the people I tend to gravitate to are professionals. For instance I'm in physical therapy for an injury and everyone there; therapists, assistants, and receptionists are all people I click with instantly and are just so nice and mature, I honestly feel they are better friends of mine than the few real friends I have. It's like this everywhere. Every time I go to my dad's police department I end up befriending other officers and having great conversations with them and laughing. I'm even friends with some on facebook. Same with my doctors, dentists, teachers, professors, etc. most older even just by a few years but I just feel I don't click with anyone my age, or at least I haven't found any yet. However I feel there is a wall preventing me from actually being friends with these professional people in my life. 

How do I become friends with more mature people like the one's I listed? People who know how to have fun and yet get their goals accomplished, not make fun of me for reading a book and wanting to do homework instead of walking to the local food shop (yes those both happened). I'm going into the IT field (more on that next) so I will meet more people one day but for now what's the best way to find friends that are mature? I was thinking volunteering might be a start. 

**Work** Right now I work at a small store in the mall selling odds and ends. I have tried retail before and I thought this would be better but I just don't enjoy it. I have to deal with so many bad children that come in, I'm supposed to give customers BS sales pitches for products I don't recommend fully, and I just feel like I could be doing more. I tried to get an early start in IT but all of my leads; friends in the industry, college help desk (which doesn't exist), professors, and internship applications have lead to dead ends. I just want to work in a place I feel I am making a difference not worrying if my cash drawer is over or under or if I got enough membership sign ups to keep my job. 

Basically two areas I want to improve on are my job and my friends and I have no idea what to do or how I can do it. Please give me some advice or even some stories if you had similar feelings. Thanks if you read it all. 

**TL;DR:** Lacking mature friends and a real job to fulfill my happiness and have no idea what to do."

A Disconnected Observation: Illogicality of Feminists


The character of the third wave feminist movement that stands out the most in its actions and principles is Hypocrisy. The bullet points in the wishlist and rule book of feminism is of the form:

""Equality is Me having 'x' and You having 'y';  where x &gt; y if (x, y) are Benefits or Me having 'x' and you having 'y' where x &lt; y; when (x,y) are Liabilities"". Here 'Me' refers to a feminist and 'You' refers to an Individual or a Society. 


 Modulus operand:
	In order to reap utmost benefits and maximize social and emotional security in a given society, it is important for any feminist-organism that the social setting adheres to its principles and thought processes. (Feminist-organism refers to an individual, group or a country). It is utmost necessary to flush out any opposing school of thought. Below are the few ""stamp-out"" techniques that Thirdwave uses when challenged.


1)  Mal-tautology:  
	eg) "" You are doubting that innocent rape victim? You are a misogynist!""


2)  Prostration:
	eg) "" Women have faced oppression since Bigbang! you need to decrease cutoff score for a girl! ""


3)  Binary Argument:
	eg)  ""You either slutwalk with me or accept you are a misogynist""


4)  False-correlation:
	eg)  "" BokoHaram abducted ten girls, We should pass Yes-means-getaccusedofrape in Hawaii University""


5)  Adhominem:
	eg) "" You Bloody Boosh B, you look middle-eastern, no wonder you write such misogynist articles!""


6)  Mooted:
	eg) ""You misogynist! Have you stopped beating your wife?""


7)  Herd-justification:
	eg) "" Newyorktimes told women are paid less, pay two more bucks for your starbucks you white-male! ""


8)  Circular-Argument:
	eg) "" Feminists are never wrong, Anita Sarkeesian told so ""


9)  Trickle-truth:
	eg) "" Dear Media, my boyfriend slapped me! (not mentioning i hit his head with a brick first) ""


10) Anecdote:
	eg) "" Last week i had been to NY where a father was yelling at his daughter, no wonder NY is unsafe for women ""


11) Guilttrip:
	eg) "" Why are you not donating to feminism-society of SoCal? think of the poor girls in Africa!""


12) Flee:
	eg) ""you are arguing logically, i dont talk to racists like you ""


13) Burden of proof:
	eg) ""I dont have to prove you raped me, YOU have to prove YOU didnt RAPE ME "".


14) Blowout:
	eg) ""Out of the 10 people surveyed 5 claimed they were sexually harrassed, MICHIGAN HAS ONE IN EVERY TWO WOMEN SEXUALLY HARRASSED!""


15) Double-false:
	eg) ""Emma Sulkobitch was raped (she wasnt), hence Redpill must be banned ""


16) Ambiguity:
	eg)      Me: ""Are you sure we should do this now?""


		She: ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm""


		 Me: ""Are you sure you like me doing you from behind?""


		She: ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm""




		HE RAPED ME IN THE AAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS

For the past few days i am in a dilemma about wheather or not i should stop reading these stuff. The dilemma is similar to first-flight-fear of a baby eagle. Its so scaaryyyyyyyy.

ITS TIME 

In this letter i am going to write a small paragraph about the route that lead here.

ITS TIME

ITS TIME

36ykf4,7,2015-05-23,On the verge of losing my younger brother. What's a good Muslim brother to do?,ConcernedBlood898989,islam,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/36ykf4/on_the_verge_of_losing_my_younger_brother_whats_a/,"Salams, r/islam!

I'm a 20-year-old male Muslim college student, and my younger brother is 15, attending a local Islamic school. We come from a practicing household.

This past Saturday, my brother finally confessed to me that he and a girl from said school are in a relationship, ever since November 2013. He told me that he's wanted to tell me about them for a long, long time. Overall, I believe I responded well initially, since he seemed encouraged at my seemingly-nonchalant attitude that I put up.

Inside I felt incredibly scared, just like how any big bro would. What the hell has my brother gotten into? How far did the two of them go? Obviously, I did not want to start suddenly asking question after question in an accusatory or quick manner, as he'd definitely shut me off.

Firstly, I told him to not, by any means, emotionally invest himself in this girl. Leave this in a fun, flirty type of setting at worst, present no commitment option to her, I told him. I have seen girls string along boys for their own egos (and vice versa) only to cruelly leave them hanging. I didn't want him to waste time chasing after a girl who just might be slowly losing interest, all the while abandoning his studies, his friends, and his family. World doesn't work like that with women. The more desperate you appear, the more they'll drive you away. I did not want him to end up with a broken heart.

Unfortunately, he told me that he finds himself caring deeply for this girl. And says that she feels the same way. A very clear case of infatuation. Bullet one has found its mark for me. Ouch. 

Trying to put him more at ease, I asked him to talk a bit about her. How they met, what type of person was she, how did they come together, etc. He told me plenty, and seemingly relaxed. Apparently, they both follow Naruto (I do as well), among other things. He told me that the girl knew about me (it's a small school and I'm one of the school's more famous and popular alumni) and that she knew about me from what my brother told her. I asked who else knew about the relationship, and he said roughly seven/eight people in his class. And now me. He told me that there were rumors about them before, and that they put them down by faking a break-up in front of certain people.

I then asked to what extent have they gotten physical, if any. He told me that they've hugged and kissed. I asked him when and where they'd kissed, and he told me in a certain spot in the masjid a month or so back (he described it well enough for me to know exactly where) where they couldn't be seen. I nodded, and asked why they'd done it, and he told me ""We did it to prove that we cared for each other and were serious about this. That we were past texting.""

Oh boy. 

I just nodded in response, and told him that, forget everything else, kissing was crossing the line entirely. That's when he put up his first signs of defiance and said ""Well, we crossed that line."" 

I dropped the subject, and then moved to try protecting myself. I told him that were this relationship ever be caught (because they've gotten physical in broad daylight, right after-school hours and have seven/eight knowing people who can easily leak this to other students), that I would entirely disavow any knowledge of this, that I would not stand by him. I would act surprised like everyone else. I have no intention of burning bridges with any of the teachers or my parents over this. I will not betray our parents. I also told him quite simply that I did not trust the girl. I've seen too much to know just how manipulative teenagers of both genders can be, and I won't trust someone just because my teenage brother has fallen head over heels for her. He seemed put off by that, but grudgingly accepted both statements. 

At this point, I felt slightly annoyed by this. Did he honestly expect me to be wholeheartedly welcoming of this? That I'd go ""Atta boy!"" I felt a sense of guilt over how I've acted up until then. What have I done that showed him that I would possibly approve of this? Have I failed as an older brother, as a Muslim role model?

After this, I told him that I was there for him should he want any advice. He flatly said he didn't need advice. That he wouldn't update me on anything about them. All he needed was for me to listen. Our conversation ended, we moved on. My brother told me that he didn't want me to look at him differently, and I told him that he's still the little punching bag I'll beat the crap out of but still look after. He's still my little brother. 

And then it went downhill tonight.

We were playing video games in our basement, and I told him, straight up, that he needed to stop kissing her. That was a line that he simply could not cross; it was the gateway to a darker, graver sin. Keep the hugging, keep whatever fun texting you guys have, but stop the kissing. That's it. 

And then his face went downcast. He shut down. I pressed him, trying to get him to open up as to why he wanted to keep up with the kissing, trying to open a discussion. I told him that a relationship was most definitely possible without kissing (though it would be awkward to tell a hormonal girl that now that they've already done before, I acknowledged). I told him that, whatever he thought of me as a ""player"" or ""womanizer,"" that I've never kissed a girl. And I swore to God three times that I haven't. He grunted out that he wouldn't kiss her (on his phone the entire time, he'd hardly look up at me), and I told him that that wasn't enough. He'd lied to our parents, and kept this relationship from me this entire time. I had no reason to believe that he wouldn't be lying to me. I told him to swear by God. And he refused. He said that he could not offer that level of assurance. I asked why yet again; why couldn't he do that? Why not talk to me about kissing, perhaps he didn't view kissing as sinful? Just talk, that's all. Only to cycle through this again. He'd tell me to drop the conversation, saying that he already promised he wouldn't kiss her, and I'd tell him that it wasn't enough.

At one point, he gets up and says ""I shouldn't have told you about us."" I respond by saying that I have been as direct and as open as I could be, and that he's the one playing games and bullshitting his way through this simple conversation. In an attempt to get him to promise to me (because that's all I wanted, I know how clumsy he is, were he to continue kissing this girl, he'll get caught in no time. I know him better than literally any other person alive does. He's timid and careless.) I pulled out the blackmail-card. I told him that I would tell our parents about the two of them were he not able to promise to me that he wouldn't kiss her. 

He then swore to God he wouldn't kiss her in front of me, and then told me that we were both finished as brothers. No more talking. I told him that there's no way he'd be able to follow through on that, since our parents would pick up something being up if his attitude towards me changed. I asked him why he was shutting me out, all I wanted was to talk about it. He then angrily yells (using choice curse words) that ""People my class have done worse. You have no idea!""

At that point, I lost my head. No idea? Is he for real? I went to the same school, I know exactly about what students got into but never said a word to anyone, not my parents, teachers, or him for the purpose of keeping him morally straight. I'm attending university, where I see all sorts of moral depravity at certain times being committed by all people, INCLUDING Muslims. What the hell could I possibly NOT know? Does the fact that a small group of people he knows are committing wrong perhaps worse than he is make his wrong right or justifiable?

We got into a physical altercation. My dad heard the commotion and thundered into the basement, splitting us up. He demanded to know what was up, and I quickly covered for both of us, saying we had a dumb fight. Thankfully, he didn't question further. We went to our own rooms afterwards.

I hope to God that this thread doesn't disappear quickly. I'm really conflicted as to what to do. Semester has ended for me, and I have two more weeks until my full-time internship starts, so I've time to think this over. Above all else, I want to look out for my brother, that he doesn't end up expelled. And that he doesn't subsequently ruin our family's reputation in our community. 

Please, please help, brothers and sisters (if sisters even frequent this place, I feel like it's a sausagefest out here). I don't feel as though I'm the best Muslim (even though I'm a Hafidh), and I definitely would like some guidance as to what to do. Should I tell our parents? Knowing them, they'd demand the relationship stop entirely, and start policing my brother's electronics. Which would only further shut him off from everyone. Part of me wants to say good riddance, I have my own bright future to write. He can get into whatever drama he wants. I know that this relationship can go one of the following ways.

1. Ends in a break-up.
2. Being caught by parents or teachers.
3. One of the seven/eight people in his class who knows decides to tell others, spinning the rumor mill and forcing my my brother and his girl to minimize contact.
4. Carry into college."
36ylhw,0,2015-05-23,Does Dropshipping Still Work?,johnnyfd,dropship,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/36ylhw/does_dropshipping_still_work/,"Yes. Does it still work now in 2015? Yes. Will it still work 2 years from now? Yes.

In fact, I've come to the conclusion that if you can't follow directions, and put in the work necessary to get your store up and running and make at least $1,000 a month from it, then you probably wouldn't have done very well in any other online business either.

I used to believe the negativity of pessimists online saying that dropshipping is harder now or that all the good niches are taken, but at the same time, I meet people every week who had just started and is successful, and I just started a new niche with my girlfriend a few months ago that is doing extremely well.  

So 100% honestly, if you don't think dropshipping will work, and you aren't willing to put in the work, it won't work for you. 

My advice: 

1. Stop looking for shortcuts. 
2. Don't use directories. 
3. Don't dropship on eBay or Amazon. 
4. Put in the time to learn the business model.  Take a class, enroll in a course, do an internship, or read a book. 

I made over $50k in profit from my stores last year and am on track to double that this year.  It works.

36ytn9,4,2015-05-23,General Questions/Information,trs444,antarctica,https://www.reddit.com/r/antarctica/comments/36ytn9/general_questionsinformation/,"Hey everyone,

I know it's a bit early, but I'm planning on applying for some positions on the Ice for the 2016-17 season, and was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out with some general questions/information.

First, I've done a lot of research with regards to working in Antarctica, there appears to be a lot of information with regards to people getting positions through PAE, L-M directly, Gana-A'Yoo, etc. It looks as if most of the positions I would be applying for (IT dept stuff) would be through GHG, however, I'm unable to find much info on them.  Does anyone know when they usually post job openings? January? Any idea on what their hiring process/timeline is like? Anyone here who has had a contract with them?

Also, I am aware that these positions are highly competitive; by the time I will be applying next year, I will be graduating from a very respectable university with a B.S. in Computer Science, have had an internship working in industry, as well as roughly a year's worth of Tech Support/Help Desk experience under my belt.  Coming straight out of college with little experience compared to someone who has worked in the field for years, would I even have a remote shot at something like a Systems Admin or Help Desk position? Would my only realistic opportunities be something more along the lines of steward at this point? Any information or insight on landing IT jobs would be greatly appreciated.

Lastly, I see that many of the organizations which hire for these positions are still advertising, although from what I've read it would seem that most of these positions would be full by now.  Although I realize it's probably too late to have a shot at anything for this coming season ('15-'16), would it be beneficial to apply anyway, as a way to get my name in the system, so that when I apply next year I will be seen as a returning applicant? Or is this irrelevant?

Thank you in advance for any help you could provide!"
36ytzg,5,2015-05-23,so incredibly confused,zincoff,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/36ytzg/so_incredibly_confused/,"Hi all,

I've had a really tough month coming to terms with who I am. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, but until recently, have never questioned my gender. I'm 21 and gay. I've been exposed to the idea of being transgender my whole life, but until now have never identified with it. I'm okay with how my body is, and I like things like the hair on my tummy and facial hair. I'm really bummed about a receding hairline, but I think that's pretty standard for most men. 

I've tried not to draw too much on the past - I can remember trying on make up, but I can also remember feeling really happy to be a boy, starting to work out for a period (not anymore) and wanting to show off my new body. I can remember playing girls as characters on video games, but part of me thinks that's also because I didn't identify with the big muscly men. When I first hit puberty I worried that my penis would get really big, but now that I'm older I want it to be bigger. I was also worried about being too tall -- but once again, when I got older, I wanted to be a bit taller. Today I'm fine with my height. It seems like I can redraw my past in any way that I want. I've dressed up in drag before and put on make up and that was fun, but I don't remember having a huge sense of relief when doing it either. At the same time, I've never really felt confined by my gender. I dress how I want to, and when I've had to wear a suit for internships I've always felt okay doing it. I can admire what some women were wearing, but I've always been interested in fashion. 

I've struggled with really obsessive thoughts. My thoughts about being transgender started a month ago for a short period when I was scared of being transgender, I then concluded that I was happy being a boy and didn't want to change anything about my body. Then a burst of it started again yesterday. I'm in the middle of my finals so it's been a really stressful time. My only doubt is that I have a pattern of this kind of behaviour. 3 months ago, I started on a really unhealthy obsession that I had ALS (Lou Gherig's disease), feeling symptoms so clearly even though I now realise it was all in my head. I spent hours on doctor google (like I've done with being transgender) and lost a lot of hair worrying about it. I'd have to step out of parties and the library in order to pull myself together in a toilet cubicle. This kind of anxious behaviour is something I've been dealing with for a really long time. I certainly feel 'dysphoric', but I don't know if it's 'gender dysphoria'. I know that gender dysphoria can manifest itself in many ways, including these kinds of behaviours. The real positive I'm seeing from being transgender is that it might mean a quick fix to my depression and anxiety if it's all due to a hormone imbalance. 

I've already spoken to friends and family about this, and they've all been supportive, kindly accepting me for whatever I choose is right for me. However, they also expressed a small doubt that what I was describing sounds like an obsession with the idea. Part of me thinks that this might be it too - I've had bouts of this kind of behaviour before, and I feel like this might just be another 'episode'. 

I've had brief relationships with men that haven't worked out. I don't think this is a result of my gender issues, as I really did love one of them (even though I don't think he ever loved me) -- and he made me feel happy and comfortable with my body and with who I was, it wasn't at time where I could have ever imagined wanting to change anything about myself. Part of me thinks that a strong relationship, where I don't end up being heartbroken and damaged, will clarify a lot for me. 

I've done lots of thought experiments (e.g. if you could push a button) and to be honest my answer is a clear 'I don't know' -- part of me is happy with my gender, but I don't think I'd be miserable as a woman. I've been trying to imagine myself getting married and trying to see if I'd prefer being a man at my wedding or a woman at my wedding and I honestly don't feel a huge difference either way. If I think of myself having boobs and a vagina I have immediately shrug with discomfort.

I know the next step is to see a therapist, but I just wanted to seek some support from some people who might've been through similar things. "

I was telling him not to get too attached cause i might go back to my country and we'd have to separate. But we continued, we helped eachother finding jobs and to stay longer in this country, we went through difficult times but things were going on well, he seemed as in love as in the beginning, even more. But he was a jealous boy, there were other boys interested in me and he was always feeling i might leave him for somebody else. Later after our break up i found out that during our relationship he had access to my facebook, gmail accounts, he was an IT guy, he hacked them and was going through them everyday. I never did anything bad on FB, but later on he accused me of chatting with some boys or looking over their profiles. Also during our time together one of my ex boyfriends contacted me for a project, i was saying there is nothing to worry about, that i never liked him it was just a short relationship during school, that it meant nothing to me. But he was very sensitive and jealous. And eventually he says he wants out and, surprisingly, that he doesn' t love me anymore. We were together for 6 months and during this time i started to really like him and i asked him to reconsider, that i don't want to finish and that i am all his, never cheated on him, never did anything bad. But he started to blame me for so many things like never loving him and always playing with him.I tried for 1 month to save it, quite begged for several times. After 2 weeks from our break up he meets another girl, and starts posting photos with her, saying he is feeling amazing and happy. He even sends me a message on FB telling me he met a wonderful girl, so much better that me, that he is finally happy and asks me to forget about him forever, and then he blocks me. He starts bringing the girl everywhere to parties where i was also going ( we have mutual friends from our internship), kissing and hugging her all the time. He was behaving very childish, i was seeing that, but still it was hurting me so much. They are together for 4 months now, at the beginning i thought he was just looking for somebody like a rebound, but now i see that things are getting serious. All this time i was hoping for him to come back, i gave him space and time to think..but it seems i lost him forever. My problem is that i can't move on. I also met another boy, very good looking, smart etc., he likes me a lot, but i just can't seem to forget my ex. I think about him all the time and everyday i feel just pain and sadness.It s 5 months since our break up and still i am in deep pain and it is getting worse everyday. How can i just move on and be myself again, how can i delete his image from my head? I can't concentrate at work, i pushed my family, friends and also the new boy away and i am angry and sad all the time. I can't look at other boys, they all seem bad, the image of my ex appears immediately in my head. I thought this would go away, but it is actually getting worse. What should i do?"
36yzzl,3,2015-05-23,"College pastor suddenly quit, another in a long line of what feels like abandoning influences for me",datcracker,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/36yzzl/college_pastor_suddenly_quit_another_in_a_long/,"Growing up I've had consistent issues with pastors and religious influences. Various men and women that I looked up to ended up cheating on their spouses, enacting abusive relationships, so on and so forth.

When it happens enough times, you get to know the signs. Usually it starts with a disappearance. They stop showing up to church every week, or for some reason the assistant pastor or some intern seems to be speaking a lot more often than usual. Soon enough the questions build up, and then the assistant has to fess up to the congregation or the replacement arrives as a guest speaker who eventually just becomes the main guy. 

Sooner or later, either through rumor or legitimate hear say the story breaks. ""He cheated on his wife!"" Or ""he was cheated on and can't continue!"" Or some other story involving sin. 

Most pastors I looked up to didn't matter that much to me. In middle school and high school it happened plenty of times, but I didn't really care. Sure it was a bummer if I liked them, but usually it was just a sad surprise. 

This is different. This young man had my complete respect and admiration. I'd never met a more open minded, wise in counsel Christian in my life. When I was down and out (look at my post history and you'll find some interesting posts here from before) he helped me find answers, he helped me find peace. This guy stayed up till 12 at night on multiple occasions to help me when I needed it. He helped me get the job I have now (summer camp counselor at a Christian camp) and he's been encouraging, caring, and helpful all along. I truly thought he was different, and I really needed him in my life.

He's gone now. There's no way I can talk to him again. Not in the same respect anyway. 

He's not my pastor anymore and the help he provided, help that I needed, is gone. I've never respected or appreciated a pastor anywhere near as much as I did him, and I'm stunned. I don't know what to do. I leave for camp Monday and the reason I'm there has abandoned my church, and by the look of it, there's a story I don't want to hear behind it. 

Please pray for me. Pray for my pastor. Pray for my church. We all need it. Pray for his family, pray for all of it.

**1,459** proud folks, creating the awesome for **5 years** 

Being a new intern to SRoTD, I strive to do the best job I can on my features. Not for internet points mind you, and certainly not because the full timers here scare the jeepers out of me. For myself it is simply about being proud, knowing I did my best, and sharing what I've created with others. 

Turns out /r/IMadeThis is a subreddit that appears to be **a kind and gentle place** of the same ilk. Instead of focusing on a certain skill, /r/IMadeThis is an open forum where people are encouraged to bring their efforts forward.

***random quote from the /r/IMadeThis sidebar***

*Reddit is full of talented, creative people. This is a place for them to show off a little.*

*Do you sculpt? Paint? Weld? ...*

*... Go on Reddit, brag a little. Let's see what you've been up to ...*

— *What the heck does that all mean?* 

— *It means anything goes when you allow creative folks to show off their efforts*

Here's a walk-through on the making of a **pretty impressive** [hand crafted LED light](https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/1jj8ih/led_flashlight/). Is it perfect? *No.* Is it awesome? ***Hell yeah!*** Sadly I am no longer permitted to work with open flame, so I just get to look at the pictures of the planning and effort. A similar level of creativity and dedication can be said for this [chain mail bikini top](https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/239y5x/chainmail_bikini_top_i_made/). The skill and time that must have gone into is admirable. 

/r/IMadeThis also has these [Calvin and Hobbes stilettos](http://imgur.com/rAEYorf.jpg), a [treasure chest] (http://imgur.com/a/Xgidb#8INwrzP) made by a self proclaimed *pirate*, this simple (yet elegant) [Bart/Homer - Ying/Yang pin](http://imgur.com/3DFlOlH.jpg), this [this ""Nixie"" clock](https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/1xsey1/learned_electronics_and_made_this_nixie_clock/), and this **pretty incredible** crafted [GRILL](http://i.imgur.com/KIPFPgW.jpg).

&gt;&gt; I hate this question. Hahah. I'll give you my tinder profile: ""Writer. Musician. Idiot. I don't have my shit together at all.""

&gt;##2. How did you get involved in /r/IMadeThis?
&gt;&gt; I am constantly making shit. Paintings. Music. Stupid things out of construction paper. When I was looking for a place to put it (5 years ago apparently!) there wasn't anywhere that a lot of it really belonged. So, I made a place for all of the random and wonderful things we make.

&gt;##3. If you had to pick one, what would your favorite be post so far?
&gt;&gt; Either [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/21748g/after_13_years_of_collecting_hotel_keycards_it/) from /u/LeonSuperFly OR [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/17lfzg/i_made_a_converse_all_star_out_of_chicken_bones/) from /u/Chantysaurus because WUT.

&gt;##4. What have you learned from browsing/modding /r/IMadeThis?
&gt;&gt; I'm not the most active mod, but the community, though small, is super friendly, encouraging, and well rounded. A good group can grow and flourish without bans or bullshit.

&gt;##5. Tell us about the /r/IMadeThis Community!

Let me start with a bit about me so you can understand my situation:

They told me that their main language is Python, and that they will be expecting me to create automated tests, which I have never done any language at all. I certainly hope they will train me, but they haven't mentioned it. I am worried that they will be unhappy that I am not ready for this position at all, and simply fire me within a few weeks. I will do my best to learn the material that is needed, but I'm not sure if I will be able to do it quick enough.

After spending A LONG time assessing my life; past, present, and future I have realized not only what I want to do in life but what I need to change to make me happy but I have no idea how the two things and more info are as follows. 

**Mature Friends** I go to community college and what I have found so far is not only is it ridiculously hard to find friends (no clubs and people often go home/work right after class) but the friends I do have are very unmotivated and really immature. I have noticed the people I tend to gravitate to are professionals. For instance I'm in physical therapy for an injury and everyone there; therapists, assistants, and receptionists are all people I click with instantly and are just so nice and mature, I honestly feel they are better friends of mine than the few real friends I have. It's like this everywhere. Every time I go to my dad's police department I end up befriending other officers and having great conversations with them and laughing. I'm even friends with some on facebook. Same with my doctors, dentists, teachers, professors, etc. most older even just by a few years but I just feel I don't click with anyone my age, or at least I haven't found any yet. However I feel there is a wall preventing me from actually being friends with these professional people in my life. 

How do I become friends with more mature people like the one's I listed? People who know how to have fun and yet get their goals accomplished, not make fun of me for reading a book and wanting to do homework instead of walking to the local food shop (yes those both happened). I'm going into the IT field (more on that next) so I will meet more people one day but for now what's the best way to find friends that are mature? I was thinking volunteering might be a start. 

**Work** Right now I work at a small store in the mall selling odds and ends. I have tried retail before and I thought this would be better but I just don't enjoy it. I have to deal with so many bad children that come in, I'm supposed to give customers BS sales pitches for products I don't recommend fully, and I just feel like I could be doing more. I tried to get an early start in IT but all of my leads; friends in the industry, college help desk (which doesn't exist), professors, and internship applications have lead to dead ends. I just want to work in a place I feel I am making a difference not worrying if my cash drawer is over or under or if I got enough membership sign ups to keep my job. 

Basically two areas I want to improve on are my job and my friends and I have no idea what to do or how I can do it. Please give me some advice or even some stories if you had similar feelings. Thanks if you read it all. 

**TL;DR:** Lacking mature friends and a real job to fulfill my happiness and have no idea what to do."

Should I keep my 9.75/hour retail job and save for a car or shoot for a 9/hour internship in my field?,Sheehan7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/36zufr/college_student_at_a_crossroad_should_i_keep_my/,"I work in retail right now and it's not too bad but I'm getting burnt out already (5th week there) and I just don't see myself being happy long term. The thing is they are willing to work around my college schedule and have given me ~25 hours a week at 9.75 an hour. I'm trying to save all of this for a car. However I went online today and saw there's an IT Internship (Computer Information Systems major) that just got posted in a city over about 40 minutes by train from me, and I think I have a good shot at getting it based on the requirements. The thing is I have no idea what the hours will be like or how long it's for. However when I go back to college next semester I doubt I would be able to continue it anyway but the experience would be great. Also it's only 9/hour so I wouldn't be able to afford the car I need for next semester.

Thoughts? I'm thinking stay with retail until I save enough money and buy a car but I also REALLY want to work in IT and leave retail behind 

EDIT: I realize the title may be implying I would leave my retail job before getting this position but that's not the case. I would stay there until I for sure got the job"
36zzxu,128,2015-05-23,500+ workstation and still using static IPs,Decimaul,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/36zzxu/500_workstation_and_still_using_static_ips/,"Hello, 

I have recently been taken in by a company as an intern and I just found out still sets all of its workstations IPs statically. They also image every workstation manually instead of using a PXE server. 

I had a long talk with the boss in our one on one meeting and this just sort of came up and he asked me if I could change this, he really likes the idea of saving any amount of time and making things more efficient.

They use Symantec PC anywhere to remote into computer so the users can watch us if they need to, but they also have another way of remote in by using the IP of the computer and still watch us and it uses port 2000, ex: https://192.168.0.1:2000 and it brings up a login for your AD account to remote in. 

So if I was going to start this change to PXE, I'm going to need DHCP, but will this affect the ability to remote in by computer name? Because the computer name right now is mapped to it's static IP. And they have a script in the bottom corner of all workstations to show their IP and computer name. 

So I guess I'm wondering if it's possible to use DHCP but keep the workstations with the same IP as they had to not interfere with the remote assistance.

Or if you had any advice on what you would do if you joined a business with 500 static IP set computers.

I know some of this might be common sense, but I'm a new intern wanting to help this company make a big change and hopefully make it on full time and am over thinking everything.

Thanks,

370asj,2,2015-05-23,Guidance needed on current Restoration Projects/Downsizing,thedeadliestmau5,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/370asj/guidance_needed_on_current_restoration/,"Hello r/cars

My current restoration situation involves a few cars that we have kept in my family's garage for a very long time. It's a tough situation because we are running out of garage space to actually do things. Also, I'm a student and only here for the summer for an engineering internship, so I'll need to accomplish what I can in about three months. 

The dilemma is that I could either work on these projects and sell the cars so that we can make more space in the garage and I can pay off some student loans, or to avoid these projects altogether and just use the money that I would put into these projects to pay off some student loans. I'll try to explain this complex situation the best that I can.

My situation: I currently have a 2004 Nissan 350z going on 160,000. I take really good care of it and do regular maintenance on it every 3,000 miles. It's my daily driver but I would like to get rid of it and use some of that money on loans/a car that is a bit less flashy that I can drive daily.

There are three cars I can work on over summer. The first is a 1969 Mercedes Benz 280se w108 chassis with a m130 inline 6 engine. The body and interior is in excellent condition for a car that has been sitting for almost 20 years. My dad bought it in 1984 and he said that the car had head gasket oil leakage problems when he parked it. He parked it in 1994 and it hasn't driven since. Mechanically, I'm not sure exactly what it would need to get going again. It would most likely need a full rebuild/engine swap. We also cannot currently find the title, so how would I go about getting it registered and finish all that paperwork?

The next car is a Jeep Wagoneer SJ. I don't know too much about this car because it is my brothers, but he gave me full permission to work on it. He bought it in Wyoming for about $800 and drove it there regularly. The engine seized due to alternator problems and might have rod knock too.

The third car is a 1967 Ford Galaxy 500. This one is in running condition but barely. It would need a new battery, complete engine fluid change, and a new exhaust (my brother chopped the muffler off). My brother gave the car to my dad so he will probably not want to get rid of it. However, it just sits in the garage all day and I fear it will have the same fate as the Mercedes we have.

So this is my situation. I'll be here all summer and want to at least get one car running. So my question to you, r/cars, is what should I do? **Again work space is a constraint**

* Keep my car, sell the Jeep to make room, fix Mercedes, Sell Mercedes.

* Keep my car, sell the Mercedes to make room, fix Jeep, Sell Jeep.

* Sell the Mercedes to make room, fix Jeep, *sell my 350Z*, use jeep as daily driver.

* Sell Jeep and Mercedes, pocket cash, and call it a day.

* Do nothing at all, let cars waste space, and talk about how one day I'll fix these cars up.

Some help with this situation would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone knows somebody who is in the market for any of these cars, just let me know. I'm based in Southern California.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: I'll add some pictures of the cars up tomorrow

370b71,4,2015-05-23,"I [20M] broke up with my girlfriend [19F] of 3 and a half years, Was it the right thing to do?",beastmuchhh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/370b71/i_20m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_19f_of_3_and_a/,"This is my first time writing on the subreddit.

Basically, I broke up with girlfriend last night for several reasons: she STILL hadn't told her parents about us dating after three and a half years, she lied about a guy friend she has, and she isn't taking our dates seriously anymore, to name a few. Of course, there are more reasons after 3 and a half years, but I am just so tired of bullshit.

I agree when she tells me we are not getting married yet so we shouldn't rush our relationship by telling her parents (she comes from a family where relationships involving the daughter are pretty much prohibited). But, is it really so much to ask for when it has already been three and a half years? I understand her point, I completely do because some of my girl cousins' uncles are overly protective on them as well. However, from their experience I know that after maybe a couple weeks of being angry, the parents simply accept the fact that dating must happen. I mean, did my girlfriend want to tell them after she finished getting her master's? Did she expect us to simply marry after getting it and skip the whole ""dating"" phase in her parents' eyes? I asked her these question but she could not answer them.

The next reason is a tricky one. To sum it up, she has this mentor for a health education program she's in. The guy goes abroad to Spain, and one night when I'm sleeping over her apartment, he snapchats her at 12 A.M. with an address. She didn't let me see the address, simply saying that he meant it for someone else because he is in Spain. We argue that she was hiding it because she didn't want to show me so she tells me that she deleted him (which I can't clearly remember her doing because I was half asleep). Some weeks after I am spending the night again and see she gets a snap from at around the same time. My two questions are: I thought you deleted him? Why does he always snap you this late? She get very sad and worried, but I sympathized with her and told her I'm just getting too jealous. She has never broken my trust before, but that time she did. She was trying to hide the snapchat, but I was the one to grab her phone and let her know she got a message. 

After the snapchat incidents, I notice that this guy posts a picture of her on Instagram to wish her a safe flight (she is going out of state tomorrow). Why her out of all his friends? They seem to be pretty close if he is dedicating her some pictures on social media, no?  

We're almost at the end guys! So a few days ago I wanted to take her on a really special date for being appointed leader in a club she is in. At first I wanted to take her on a surprise date but knew that would be impossible as she is taking on extra work because she is leaving out of state tomorrow for an internship she was accepted into. When I planned the date for her, I repeatedly made her aware I wanted it to be a special date, or so I thought. When I get to her school to pick her up, she is dressed less than casually, almost like a last minute getup (a jean jacket with an undershirt, but making the undershirt exclusive because the jacket was open, not buttoned). It did annoy me, because she had always complained that I did not care to dress up for our dates. To top it off, she goes to ask me a question that we had endlessly argued about in the past. Why bring something that is potentially an argument when I want to show you a really good time before you leave, is what I asked her. She just said, ""It was just a question."" Did I overreact? All I wanted was to show her a good time.

These two reasons along with many others made me choose that it was our time. I broke up with her just yesterday but I am losing my mind. It is not easy to let someone go. It's even harder to think that it's all done after three and a half years.

I appreciate any criticism of my behalf. We are not perfect. We are all human. I am flawed, so let me know how I was wrong so I can correct it.

**TL;DR** My girlfriend of 3.5 years still hadn't told her parents about us dating and was not planning to in the near future. Also, she has a guy friend who seems to only snapchat her late at night.

I needed to study (studied my ass off to get scholarships and leave) and needed to get back in the house. My dad yelled at me for upsetting him. My brother got to go away to college without full scholarship while I was told I was supposed to stay home so he can keep an eye on me. 

Anyway now I'm in my mid-twenties and he's in his early twenties. I am applying for grad school (shaky application, of course my dad called to let me know I was wasting his money, but not to pay him back because he loves me and it's a gift. Also it's not his money it's my grandmother's and she doesn't mind) and my brother has been to court an awful lot. For shit that would actually endanger others! My dad paid for the lawyer. He fucked up again and told me he didn't care because my dad could just get another lawyer and make the problem go away. His resume is mainly fraternity bullshit and his facebook photos all involve beer.

He texted me because his record made him lose an internship ""it's my fault I fucked up. It's always my fault. I always fuck up."" I don't know how to feel. It's kind of not his fault in a way because my dad never enforced boundaries. But also, wtf? He fuckin' bullied me all through school for studying and said I was a loser who would die alone and him and all his friends felt bad for me because I am a nerd. I'm sitting cozy with a programming internship. Cha cha cha suck on that. He might ask me for money or something, I don't know. My parents stopped helping him with living expenses because he was being a fucking animal and doing frat bullshit instead of studying. 

All those years of misery living in that house between the two of them and my Emom. Should I feel bad for my brother?"

So I am someone of Indian origin living in the USA. Brought up here, the whole deal.

I came across lots of studies saying that western sounding names perform much better in resume call backs. Is this leftist propaganda for more affirmative action? I don't know, it's possible. But let's get your opinon.

I was wondering if you guys believe there to be even a small amount of name discrimination in CS/engineering? Should I use a western nickname when applying for internships? 

I am aware there is a large amount of Indians in CS, so perhaps for this field especially, this is obsolete?

So I told you guys about moving and working with my family's new company anddddd it went terrible. Turns out money can bring out the demons in people.- they paid me shit for four months of work and never showed up so it was just me working about 70 hour weeks. Causing the other lady to quit on them today and me getting fired. But they were being just dumb and I wasn't gonna quit cause I'm bad at it.
Also I firmly stood my ground after they refused to give me a paycheck yesterday.

Anyhow I got this second job/paid internship awhile before I thought shit was gonna hit the fan. Mainly because they hadn't paid me in like two weeks and were expecting me to live off my parents like I did in college. Naahhh thanks. 

Adjusted my schedule. I'm like at 11% body fat thanks to waking up at 6 am. My new internship is freaking awesome and I've been learning to code. And I learned a few extra skills and my bank account is in the black. :)

I've now decided to keep that internship and start my online thing back up..... Becausssse im gonna move back to the UK in April for good. &amp; if everything works out well, I will have about 6 months of rent secured, some new equipment annnnddddd some more education.

At the moment I'm attending night classes in Computers Science ( 1st year, almost done with it) and during the day I'm doing a training as a front end developer.

Contents of the training: 
*HTML5
*CSS3
*Javascript
*AngularJS
*jQuery
*NodeJs
Web oriented Photoshop/Illustrator ( logo ""creation"", PSD to HTML, slicing etc)

**Content of the night classes:**
C#
SQL Server/Access and I played with MySQL
Web ( HTML5/JS/CSS3) 
And lots of theory,
 PHP is teached in the 2nd year

I have also signed up at Treehouse/Codecademy to exercise in my free time and Wallangues to learn dutch and german.

I am a little bit lost since I'm not sure if I will be able to land a job after completing this training, also I'll have to do a 2 months internship in September/October which I'd love to do in Brussels and maybe get a job...

So... about those questions.

1. Which websites did you guys use when you were looking for jobs or internships ?  I'm using ictjobs.be , indeed, monstage, forem and google.

2. Will the content of my training give me the chance to get a junior position ?

3. When you were being interviewed , how were they going ? What kind of questions did you get ?

4. How hard were the first days of the job/internship ? 

5.How popular are CMS platforms ?  I played with WordPress/Joomla.

6. Is some kind of portfolio/resume website really needed at the moment  ?

7. Is becoming a freelancer today a good idea ? 

8. I heard that  salaries go around  1400€/month in Wallonie and 2300€/month in Brussels or the flemmish area. Is this difference real ?

9. What else should I learn to be sure I'll land a job ? 

Before starting this post I had lots of question but I did not write them down, big mistake.

Well thanks for taking your time reading and answering to my post. Have a nice day/evening/morning.


L.E. Thanks for your answers guys !

I'm a college student with 2 internship offers for the summer. 

Both are at venture funded, relatively small startups. 

Company A Pros: Structured, I know what I'm doing, interviewed with the people I'd be working with, there are more than 4 engineers to talk to, mentorship, standard SF startup perks and whatnot. Company has a ""hacking"" culture and altogether seems like a fun place to be. The code I push can reach lots of people.

Cons: Far away from my living quarters. I'd need to take Caltrain to and from, and then more transportation from the respective stops to my residence or office, and pay is a bit less than the other.

Company B Pros: Good $$$, and close to my residence. I could walk there if I pleased. Fundamental technology seems fairly interesting.

Cons: I don't know what I'd be doing. My interviewer himself acknowledged he wasn't sure what I'd be doing. It also doesn't feel very large, or very ""startup-y"" . I'm afraid I'd end up bored at best, and an outlier at worst. Feels somewhat unstructured.


Thoughts?

EDIT: Totally forgot to make it clear I would be an intern."

I graduated from a reputable school w/ a 3.0 and I literally lead all my marketing groups and I had fun doing it. I got along with everyone and felt comfortable in groups working on assigned projects. In terms of job opportunities, I get calls from recruiters for unreliable companies (consulting, recruiting, cold-calling). About 1/5 times I get a call from a good company for a phone interview, and end up butchering, stuttering, and forgetting how to convince HR.

I don’t want to do sales and calling, I want to be working with teams. But, at the workplace, I felt I had little confidence and felt the fear of opening up. Kinda weird considering I loved working at school groups. I want to learn but I just feel afraid when I speak out in a place full of older people that know what they’re doing. At my internship I was exposed to all sorts of concepts, marketing and non-marketing related, but communication needs to be worked on, I just cant get myself to do it. I have an interview with my favorite company (wear the clothes all the time) soon for a digital/email marketing position and I feel it’s a great entry-level opportunity.

I really cannot afford to live in the area I am living, even with the summer job I currently hold. Is deciding to leave a good idea for me?

If I choose to go back up to school, I do not think I will be able to afford my lease, so I would see if a fraternity brother would allow me to share a room with me to cut costs. My biggest problem up there is I do not have a job. Here is my plan that I have thought of for the last few hours, please give me constructive criticisms or new ideas that I am missing:

1. Arrive in the town where I study. Note I do not think I will be able to afford school for at least 2 years, as I do not think it would be wise of me to take on debt this early unless I can for sure pay it off, and this would give me full time to work and save money

2. Apply for a 5k loan. This would be used to purchase a car (I am thinking a 90's Honda Civic, or a Toyota). The rest of the money would be used to pay rent and finance the car until I saved some money (I do not know if this is a good idea, please let me know)

3. Find a job. Currently I life guard at a country club, and I was the only returning guard that was immediately rehired, the rest are doing return interviews. I really do think that the company I work for likes having me around. That being said, I plan on asking my boss, or the GM if they knew any places in Reno that they could personally recommend me for to help me off the bat. If not, I would see if they would just write a strong letter that I can use when I apply.

4. Continue my paid internship. I have a paid internship that I do on a laptop, and it pertains to my major of study. The two issues I have is I got it through my father, and I do not think it is open to non-students (which i think I will become for a short period). I do very well in that too, and I am one of the top (if not the top) intern they have (only out of 5). If I can keep that, I can make a solid income while away from school.

5. Be frugal. I will have to save money to pay back the loan I would take out asap in order to prove good credit, as well as not be hurt by interest rates (again, I do not know much about debt and credit, so please correct me if I'm wrong).

6. Acquire a new cell phone, I will try to get a cheap mobile plan (maybe pay as you go, since I do not call or text very often)

7. Sell my computer. If you look at my profile, I have a good computer that I could sell for a good deal of money, I will probably sell it first once I arrive in the city I am going to.

8. Work for 1-2 Years. If I can save up enough money, I will be able to take out some loans for school after this point (if there is another idea here, let me know)

9. Attend school and work. It may be tough working and doing school work, but if I am paying for it myself, I will most likely be much more invested in it, and may actually do better then my previous years at university.

10. Graduate in 2 years, Find a job, and Move on. Hopefully if I apply myself harder then before, I can graduate and being moving forward with my career.

Coincidentally it ended on 10, but I can add or remove depending on suggestions. I don't expect anything, but don't feel like you have to respond to every question or point I have if you don't want too, I am here to take any suggestions and if there is area of expertise from someone on here that only wants to chime in on one point, I would be that much more grateful.

It’s a research-based position so I will be spending a lot of time in the office with a few fieldwork trips here and there. I’m assuming it’s leaning more toward casual— sandals are allowed and most people wear jeans on Fridays— but I do want to be a bit cautious as these people may hire me when I graduate from my program and I really want to make a good impression. Due to some unforeseen financial circumstances, I can’t really afford to go and buy anything new. I’m budgeting about $150 for a black blazer and black or dark brown flats, but that’s all I can really do right now until I start getting paid at the internship in a couple of weeks.

[I put together an album](http://imgur.com/a/fUeVK) of the work wardrobe I’ve tried to scrounge up from what I already have. It’s heavy on dresses (VERY heavy on dresses, actually) but I’m not sure if that matters. I generally just wear dresses and skirts in my everyday life because I’m on the shorter side and finding jeans and pants that fit me well is nearly impossible. I am not at all sure about the floral and striped dresses.

I have three cardigans that I can pair with the sleeveless dresses — one black, one gray, and one beige with pink flowers (not sure about this one). I am planning on buying a black blazer in the next few days. 

As far as shoes go, I have leopard print flats with black ankle straps and tan wedges, both pictured in the album. I’ve posted about the leopard flats here before in Simple Questions and was generally told to return them. Not pictured but I also have somewhere: black ankle boots with a 1-inch heel, sky blue TOMS, and two pairs of lace-up suede ankle boots in brown and navy blue. Like I said, I can afford to go and get a nicer pair of flats.

I’d appreciate any help or critique I can get. My main questions are:

* Is what I’ve picked ""business casual"" enough? 
* Are there enough options so that I’m not wearing the same things all the time?  
* Are floral patterns and stripes okay for business casual or should I lay off them entirely?

Another concern is dressing according to my age and status as a graduate student soon to be on the job market. I’m 23 and only about 4’11"". I’m conscious of the fact that half the time I look like a little kid dressing up in my mom’s clothes, so I’m trying not to look juvenile here.

Like many of you, I have my fantasies about living in NYC. Grew up in Korea where everywhere's crowded, bars never close and all that, NYC resembles lot of that scene and I want to try it out myself.

I'm a senior who has one semester left (ends next fall) and major in Physics and Communications at a big state university (wisc). I have a decent gpa (3.7/4) and a decent extracurricular (internship, research).

But my question is, what field would I be able to work at?  I don't see myself going into further research in Physics or anything related to that really. Rather, I want to do some things that's related to application of that knowledge, like tech industries. But do they hire people who didn't major in computer science? Also, what range of salary am I expecting to get because I know that the cost of living at the city is just outrageous. If the salary is too low to afford an okay quality of life, I'd rather stay with my parents and save up in rent and food...

Anyways, do any of you guys have a similar experience of getting a job in tech field/anything else coming from physics?
If you could share your thoughts and stories that would be really helpful!

I broke up with my GF three days ago because we both realized that there were needs that each of us wanted that were not being fulfilled by the other. Specifically, it was our sexual compatibility with each other. Everything was almost perfect... but due to me graduating and moving to NYC while she went to the West coast for her internship before returning back to college (in NY) for her last year, I felt that we could not solve the issues that we had while we were in a LDR. Every time we spent the summer apart, though we talked every day, I felt that our bond grew weaker. Then, when we got back to college, of course things started to become better. However, I did have these doubts about our sexual compatibility - all throughout the semester - and we decided it might be for the best if we split up. We were very emotional and talked for a bit after that before I left her place to go back to mine.

The first day after the breakup, we continued to talk seemingly normal and it was the same for the second day. Then, we started texting a little less - I assumed this was cause she was busy at her home packing for the summer and just spending time with her family. We still FaceTimed each other at night, talking about our day, and we said our good nights to each other. Today I told her that since I needed to wake up early tomorrow that if she wanted to talk with me we should talk no later than __. She asked me if __ was okay and I said sure and then when that time came, she asked if I was ready and I said yes and then we FaceTimed. We still talked about our day with each other, and at some point she said that her battery was really low. This has happened before when we were dating so I definitely do not think that she was lying about this. Anyways, then she said that she should get back to packing as she had nothing else to talk about. Usually our conversations keep continuing for a bit even after one of us says that we do not have anything to talk about and I so we continued. I was in the middle of my own train of thought and then her phone died. I messaged her something to the effect of laughing at the fact that her phone died and also added the rest of my thoughts and said good night.

Now, in the past if her phone died, she would immediately call me once she charged it and then we'd talk for a bit more and then finally say good night. This time, I did not receive a call back (it's been well over 2 hours) and I did not even get a text (good night, sorry that her phone died, etc.).

We had said to each other that we did not want things to get weird with each other and I guess this was cause our breakup was 'amicable'. The fact that she didn't call me back or text me is bothering me and I realize that since we did break up that things will start to become different... I know I still have some feelings for her - we've been together for around 1.5 years. I do not want to go no contact, she's still a good friend, but if things like this bother me I feel as though it might not be good for me in the long run.

Should I have expected a call/text back from her? I want to talk to her about this and get her say on why this didn't happen. If she says she feels that she does not need to do this anymore because we're broken up, I guess I know where the 'weirdness' factor stands. Then again, what if she is not direct? Ugh. Sometimes I think I shouldn't have broken up with her due to this issue, but I tell myself that if I ever got frustrated at her because of sex, I would never want to hurt her feelings. What do you guys think I should do?

tl;dr - broke up with GF amicably but things have just started to get weird/I am thinking too much into things... how should I move forward?"
372pgz,5,2015-05-24,Citrix vs Startup,cseboy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/372pgz/citrix_vs_startup/,"I worked as an intern at Citrix for 6 months Ft Lauderdale and I have a full time offer as SW Engineer 1. The work would involve kernel level development, unix, networking etc. Quite a lot of work is bug fixes, feature implementation etc and the work culture is very relaxed.

Meanwhile I also have an offer from a Series A hardware startup with 30 people working on a new smartphone based on custom Android OS solving some other problems. I would be working on the upper layers, apps maybe some firmware too. The founder has also promised me to keep shifting between teams so that I get to learn.

Also, the team at Citrix I would be joining isn't that new tech oriented, old experienced kernel developers. (Average age: 30)

Startup might give me more learning and responsibility, but the MNC will provide structure, credibility for future jumps, perks etc.

PS: I recently graduated BS from top-30 and pay is similar. $70 - $80k

Which one should a recent graduate opt for ?"
372w8x,78,2015-05-24,Thank You.,StressedOut_Student,CHICubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/372w8x/thank_you/,"Ever since I can remember I wanted to play ball for a living. 

Growing up, every day was an opportunity to play the game. I'd play with whoever I could find and for however long as they could stay. Then, once whoever I had found had to go, I would find a nice brick wall and practice fielding self-generated ground balls. While many of my friends growing up decided to eventually quit the sport, I couldn't help but continue falling more and more in love with it. I'm sure many of you can relate to this. I was a little boy in love.

I played for years and was successful until one day being a dumb teenager caught up with me. Due to a mountain biking accident I damaged my shoulder the year before reaching high school and sat on the bench for almost my whole last season of little league. 

By high school my velocity had dipped and I lost the control I previously had. My bat was not catching up to pitching for some reason, and I was slow, relying previously on my power. I had the jersey ripped off my back that year.

I abandoned baseball shortly after that. Stopped watching. Stopped caring. I felt like a failure and decided it would be easier that way.

Then I found this sub, or at the time /r/cubs I suppose.

I was a lurker for a long time. I didn't even make a reddit account until about a little over a year ago. Something about this place, or rather the community behind it, brought back those feelings I used to have about baseball. 

It was at about this time that I realized I could still make a career out of this sport, but in a different capacity. Ever since senior year I have been working towards someday working in the front office for the Chicago Cubs, with the lofty dream of maybe someday being the next Hoyer or Epstein. 

During Spring Training this year I was lucky enough to go to Mesa for a whole week. One night while eating dinner with my family I got lost looking for the restroom when a table near my person set about asking me Cubs related questions. They weren't wearing any Cubs gear like myself, but it was evident they were fans trying to test me on if I actually followed the team or was just there for the ride. Using the knowledge I got from all of you guys through this community, paired with my independent studying such as reading reports/essays, learning how to create scouting reports, and writing analyses, I was able to really stun them. Periodically throughout the conversation the the two main people grilling me would look at each other with ""holy shit"" expressions on their faces. At this point we were just talking about tons of different things like the positive attributes of Edwin Jackson (his accountability), advanced metrics, Pedro Strops slider, prospects still all the way down at single A, my family history with the Cubs, my girl back home, and my dream of being their GM.

Little did I know at the time I was talking to Mike Cather and Derek Johnson. AAA Pitching Coach for the Iowa Cubs and Minor League Pitching Coordinator for the Chicago Cubs, respectively.

They invited me to stop by the bullpen the next day and I went. ""Hey, this is /u/StressedOut_Student! That kid I was talking about!"" I got nods and some waves from the bullpen and he and I chatted more before giving me some souvenirs. I was invited to minor league practice the next day where I was able to watch ball and talk more with Derek Johnson.

""Keep in touch, /u/StressedOut_Student!"" was the last thing he said that day and I recently sent off another email to him asking for more advice with building my portfolio for when I can apply for an internship. 

As of now I am positioning myself to take a job with my college baseball team next season and also planning a trip to visit Chicago where I will be, hopefully, enjoying free seats at Wrigley that two very awesome people I met in a little restaurant in Mesa offered me.

Long story short , thank you to this amazing, amazing community not only for reinvigorating my passion, but for giving me the tools necessary to really learn and grow. Cubs baseball is something truly special that we all share and if by extraordinary luck everything works out and I find myself in the Cubs front office someday, this post will serve as a testament to how thankful I am to you all.  You guys are amazing and I can't wait for many more seasons to come. 

Cubs baseball: there's nothing better than falling in love again.

**EDIT**: Thank you to /u/HelloControl_ for my first gold!"

I just finished my freshman year at a top university with an original intent on being premed. I took pretty much all premed requirements (chem, bio, orgo, etc) and did very well in all my classes, however, I just found them to be boring. Those classes were nothing but memorization and even though I did well, I had no satisfaction from them.

I took multivariable calculus and linear algebra also and enjoyed both classes since I'm the type of person that enjoys solving puzzles and using what I learn in class to do so. Math is nothing but a logic problem and I really like applying myself that way. After speaking with friends and advisers, I think I'll give applied math - computer science a shot next semester.

Since I have no experience at all, I downloaded the lectures and assignments for the CS classes I'll be taking next semester and I'm working through them over the summer. I'm starting to really enjoy it! It's really tedious to learn the syntax of a language, but I'm starting to really appreciate the thinking involved behind writing code. 

I'm definitely switching out of premed, however, my only concern if I do Apma-CS is that I'll be starting a year late after ""wasting"" my first year. I feel like, compared to my peers in CS, I'll be too inexperienced to apply to internships next year and that I'll be at a disadvantage. 

What are your suggestions as to how I can catch up? I would also love to hear anyone's experiences from switching to CS from another major!

Interactions with Grail were fun, I liked looking at my NEXT ICE growing more and more powerfull each rez.

After including Corporate Troubleshooter I learned how much fun is killing someone with Merlin, but what I was waiting for was third (final?) NEXT. When Gold came out I decided to ditch Grails(I also didn't like that Lancelot and Galahad are so easy to destroy) and dive deep with NEXT family, added Turing and EBC for some weird economy/anti Bad Pub tech.

And sadly, this deck just don't work as much as I would like to. The anti Eater/Keyhole tech I heavily invested in (Crisium, Turing, Architect) never come at the right time, Parasites and Cutlery events are eating thru my poor Bronze and Silvers faster that I can reinstall them with Interns and most important, I never have enough cash to use CT or Ash properly, not even thiking about rezzing Gold on its own.

After humilitating defeat at my local regionals (went 0-4 with it and only one game was somewhat close) I just don't know what to do with this. I either don't have money to rez ICE, or don't have ICE in hand because it's cluttered with upgrades and assets I can't really install because they will just go to waste. Maybe I'm trying to make remotes too early, but how else I could secure my Adonis Campaigns or EBC? I went with only 7 agendas to make room for other cards, but I still feel I don't have enough economy and/or switching this to ETF would just work better.

373zzp,2,2015-05-24,"Questions about anxiety, medication, therapy, etc.",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/373zzp/questions_about_anxiety_medication_therapy_etc/,"I've never been diagnosed with any type of anxiety disorder. I've also never sought out help for any issues I've had. I've never been sure if I should get help, if I have the money, or if medication is a good idea or if my symptoms are even worth seeking help for. So I'd love to hear others' experiences and how the process started for you.

Background about me: I started having some kind anxiety issue a few years back, about halfway through college. I'm graduated now, 23 years old. I've had what I consider a panic attack twice in my life: once on a very crowded metro on the way to my first day at an internship, and one day at a different job while sitting at my desk randomly. Both times were terrifying, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, lightheaded, scared, almost like I was having a heart attack or something. The second one I cried a lot and had to call someone, the first one I got off the metro and hovered over a trash can for 10-15 mins. 

Now, I worry a lot. I over think about everything in my life. This morning it was hard to get out of bed because I spent an hour running through scenarios of what could happen. I analyze everything people say to me, worry about how I reacted, how to reapproach things, and losing people in general.

I think my best friend and my boyfriend have to deal with a lot of these issues/symptoms/whatever they are. Then I feel bad about asking for their help or to talk me through my fears, then I worry about what they are thinking and if they are annoyed/being burdered, bring that up, immediately feel guilty, get worse anxiety that I brought it up at all, etc.

It's a vicious cycle, and I struggle with ways to clear my head. Being around people helps a lot: my mind is a lot clearer when I'm physically near people I care about. But I can't just depend on the ones I love to be there for me 24/7.

I guess I just want some insight: when did you finally decide to seek help? How did it help you to deal with your anxiety? Are you on medications? Any other comments appreciated about anything related to anxiety."

So my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 1 year. Our relationhip isnt perfect and we have our fair share of fights but we deeply love and care about each other and thats how we make it work.

I recently moved home to work an internship over the summer and she stayed where we go to college at. Its about 2 hours apart. This has caused a lot of problems (the fact that I am leaving and such) but the last week we spent together we focused on our problems and made big strides. I think I improved a lot, and she even agreed with me. I left on great terms and the two days I had been home were going well. Normally we dont deal with seperation well.

So yesterday my mom asked about my gf's plan for the summer. I told her she wont be going to summer camp as a counselor anymore (that was the original plan) and instead she was going to stay and take classes and work.

She asked if she had a job yet and I said no (out of some stupid instinct) then I said ""well she does have an interview at a store and it looks really promising like she will get the job. Its a vape shop where the sell vape pens and e-liquids. Its way healthier than smoking and really has nothing bad for you""


My girlfriend already has the job and has been working there for a week.

Then later that evening I told my gf that I told my mom she wasnt going to camp and where she was working.

This morning my mom asked my gf (they talk) if she had gotten the job yet (or something along those lines. Im not quite sure).

So now my gf is very angry at me for lying to my mom and to her. I understand where she is coming from cause she has worried a lot what my parents will think of her working there. Now she is very mad and wants to be done with me. I have told her I am sorry, and fessed up to what I did. She hasnt responded to my long texts except with one saying ""just give me time"".

Ill be happy to answer any questions you have. I just need advice on how to get her back/regain her trust.



   
**tl;dr**: fibbed to my mom/gf but still got the general point across. Now gf is mad."

3747w3,175,2015-05-24,"*urgent* What sort of lawyer/lawsuit should I be looking for if the university entered into my apartment and discarded all my property during my stay at a hospital, then ban me from the university and refuse to answer any questions regarding the incident?",ponderexistence,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3747w3/urgent_what_sort_of_lawyerlawsuit_should_i_be/,"*urgent* What sort of lawyer/lawsuit should I be looking for if the university entered into my apartment and discarded all my property during my stay at a hospital (which they knew)? Afterward, they ban me from the university and refuse to answer any questions regarding the incident. Where should I start in my quest for litigation? Thanks!

The events surrounding the incident are quite complex. I was a graduate student at a major research university in Chicago &amp; lived in university housing. I had a nervous breakdown &amp; had to stay at a hospital. During this time, the university entered into my place &amp; discarded nearly all my property, many irreplaceable/unrecoverable (i.e. research, computer). I was then banned from the university without an explanation &amp; threatened with further disciplinary action should I seek litigation (discrimination? Intimidation?). The events have been very emotionally/psychologically traumatic (personal injury?). How should I proceed? What kind of lawyer/lawsuit should I be seeking? What area(s) of law does my situation fit? What are my chances of winning/settling a lawsuit?

With less than a month before possible statute of limitations taking into effect, I am urgently writing in hopes that someone may be able to help me with figuring out how I should pursue legal action against a major university in Chicago (where I was a graduate student) regarding a complex set of heinous discriminatory and biased actions made by the university which led to several personal injuries including the loss of my income, the loss of my place of living, the loss of countless unrecoverable, irreplaceable, and invaluable property and prized possessions, and the considerable loss my research as well as academic status and reputation, amongst other losses large and small, tangible and intangible. I strongly believe my civil rights and the reasonable accommodation protections for my disabilities were grossly violated by the university through their actions. The foremost reason I am writing is regarding the significant psychological and emotional injuries that have severely affected me; injuries caused by the university’s negligence and mishandling of a situation which occurred near the end of the spring quarter in 2013 (June 2013). Since the incident, I have considered pursuing possible litigation against the university, but not sure how I should proceed and have been held back in fear as the university is a huge and wealthy institution and I am not. Furthermore, the university’s intimidation of further disciplinary action should I pursue legal action has made me feel uncomfortable about proceeding with litigation. However, the persisting and worsening mental anguish and suffering, and unceasing emotional pain and distress, caused by the university’s actions continue to traumatize and torment my day to day life. After consulting the advice of friends and colleagues, and conducting some research online, I feel a civil rights/discrimination/injury litigation may fit my case suitably. However, I would like to hear about all the possible legal options I should pursue from someone with legal knowledge, preferably an experienced attorney. I would also like to know about the possibility of lowered or contingent fees, or if my case can be carried pro bono, as I am now on SSI Disability and have limited funds. Furthermore, as I understand, I may be limited in time to pursue litigation, thus please let me know as soon as you can about what legal avenues or attorneys I should pursue. That being said, I feel confident that someone here may have very appropriate and useful advice fitting to my circumstances, and if feasible, closer to forming a formidable lawsuit.

Brief Back Story: 

I was a graduate student at a major research university in Chicago (the one Obama went to), pursuing my Master’s in Sociology, from 2012 to 2013. I struggled (and still struggle) with several documented mental illnesses, the main ones being Major Depression, General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Agoraphobia, PTSD, OCPD, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. While I tried to manage my mental illnesses along with the stresses of the highly rigorous graduate program, to my misfortune, the mental conditions grew worse through the school year, culminating with me barricading myself in the university housing graduate student apartment I was residing at the end of the spring quarter of 2013 (March-June). I barricaded myself in my apartment by securing the front door with industrial foam epoxy. I did this to focus on my course finals and research, and to prevent myself from activities which might distract me. On the morning of June 14th 2013, I hear a large crash. My front door had been battered down by the police (Chicago and UCPD campus police). I was caught in shock. Police surrounded me and the Dean of Students escorted me to the student counseling center. There I met with an emergency counselor who forwarded me to Chicago Lakeshore Hospital. I stayed at the hospital until June 29th. Somehow the hospital had gotten hold of my parents during my stay, without my consent or knowledge. My parents flew in from Sacramento, California. The hospital would only discharge me to my parents and mandated that I must return straight to Sacramento with my parents (a command from the university as Lakeshore hospital is affiliated with the university). This was not explained to me: why I could only be released to my parents, and why I had to go straight non-stop to California. It turns out a great deal was not explained to me, to my parents (who do not speak English fluently), to my brother who came with my parents, and to a close friend who was living with me at the time. During and after everything that happened, the university and the hospital would deny my requests for information and explanations. The only piece of information that I was able to attain was my hospital records.

During my time at the hospital, the university went into my apartment and discarded nearly everything inside, save a few boxes which contained some possessions which I remember was on my desk such as one of my laptops (which was smashed and in bad shape). Several thousand dollars in cash I had in my desk were never reported for. More atrociously, nearly everything related to my thesis research was gone (hundreds of hours of work), including written materials such as notebooks and journals, as well as digital materials such as other computers and hard disks. Other items included irreplaceable, invaluable and unrecoverable possessions such as hand written mail, photographs, albums, art, jewelry, gifts, rare books and collectibles, amongst countless other possessions. 

The university never asked for my consent nor did they inform me about their entering into my apartment and discarding of my property while I was in the hospital. However, the university was completely aware I was in the hospital during this time. The university did not mention about what they did to my apartment and property until my parents arrived at the hospital and started asking questions – nearly two weeks later. By then, it was too late. Everything was gone. When my parents, brother, and close friend (who lived with me for parts of the year) went to my apartment to look through and rescue my property in the trash receptacle (the large rectangular kind that one would find typically at construction sites) placed in front of my apartment, they were immediately met with university officials who would not permit them to look through the trash receptacle filled with my belongings, which was then strangely towed away within minutes after my family and friend encountered the university officials. So, did university housing not want my family to know what valuables and invaluables had been haphazardly thrown out? Why did the university react with such immediacy to discard all evidence regarding their hasty clear out of my apartment? Would the university have done this to someone who did not have a mental disability? To this day I do now know the answers to these questions. The university refuses to answer any inquiries regarding the incident. My family and friends who have asked the university for answers were met with silence. My professors and thesis advisors who have inquired university administrative officials received silence. The university simply would not speak about the incident when asked. Shortly after the incident, Sam Cholke, a journalist writing for the Hyde Park Herald and DNAinfo Chicago, contacted me for some correspondence as he was trying to write an article about my incident at the university, which was beginning to cause rumors and theories amongst the community. Even Cholke, who was trying to objectively investigate the incident, was met with silence when talking with university officials regarding the incident. In addition to the silence regarding the incident and myself, the university has banned me from entering any university property, threatening me with arrest if I do. That is likely not going to happen, as I reside in California now, and I am trying to avoid anything having to do with university and my time there. However, thoughts about the university and the incident persistently intrude my mind and my life through painful emotions and memories, and violent flashbacks and nightmares. Not even in my sleep can I find rest from what happened at the university. But then again, how does one forget about the entity that took everything away from them and then refuses to answer inquiries about their egregious actions? I lost my pay (paid internship at a museum on campus), student body status, my most prized irreplaceable possessions (photographs and letters, gifts, rare collectibles, hard disks with several years worth of photos, memories, and other personal data), and substantial parts of my research. Figuratively speaking, I nearly lost my mind (psychotic episodes triggered from the distressing thoughts and emotions regarding the traumatic incident), and several times, nearly lost my own life (attempted suicide).

I guess you can leave a place, but the place won’t leave you. The heinous and discriminatory actions performed by the university have had severe and lasting psychological and emotional effects on me. It has now been nearly two years since the incident, and my mental state has not recovered much since then. If anything, I believe it has worsened. Through the many sessions of talking with my current therapist, I have come to a conclusion that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the ‘Chicago incident’ has significantly affected and altered my preexisting mental conditions for the worse.  To live through trauma once is painful, but to live through it again and again is a living hell. Not a single day passes without the thoughts about what the university did to me coming up, often several times a day. Now, as the anniversary of the incident steadfastly approaches, the troubling thoughts and flashbacks of what happened in Chicago attack me several times an hour, cruelly consuming nearly all of my waking life, and they do not stop there. As I mentioned before, thoughts and flashbacks that consistently trespass my consciousness while I am awake is troubling, but that the thoughts would ceaselessly invade me in my sleep, in the form of terrorizing nightmares, is beyond disturbing.
 
Ever since the incident, the thought of pursuing litigation against the university has been on my mind. However, I have been unsure of how to proceed. Furthermore, the intimidation and threats made by the university that they would make my life even more difficult (i.e. disciplinary actions) if I seek litigation made me even more wary about pursuing my legal options. However, at this time, with all the extensive injuries I have succumbed from the university’s actions, I am putting their intimidation and coercions to the side, and am looking for a capable lawyer who can fight for my rights and restitution. Furthermore, I hope to see retribution take place for the university. Above all, I am seeking justice.

The entire story and sequence of events that occurred would be far too long and nuanced for a brief back story. With what I have written, I hope to have explained a complicated and complex incident with as much clarity and concision as I can without losing the multifaceted contents of what had happened. I have extensive personal records of the events (i.e. journal entries, e-mails, texts, social media posts) as well as official medical records and records from witnesses, and the version of the story that the university has released to my parents. All of the records I have gathered are available if you need them to better understand and legitimize my claim that the heinous and discriminatory actions (intentional or out of negligence) of the university have resulted in several agonizing and lasting injuries for me. I have attempted to explain the injuries the university caused me as objectively as I can, and I apologize for the emotional overtones that can be felt throughout this message, but after all, if I felt no emotions towards the egregious errors the university has committed, I wouldn’t have been so compelled to write this letter or look for help at all. Though I am anxious and still have some apprehensions about how to go forward, I strongly believe that someone might be able to provide trustworthy and invaluable advice as I try to construct and execute a litigation that will have high chances of winning/settling. Any piece of advice would be extremely helpful for me as I try to pursue legal action against the university. 

With thanks,

I just graduated with honors from a fairly unknown state school in the Midwest with a BS in Accounting.  This summer I will be doing an audit internship with a BIG 4 firm in their local office.  In the fall I begin a new 2 year dual-degree program with a target school in the UK and a prestigious school in China.

Previously, I have worked as an intern at a local investment firm ($140+ billion assets under management) but in a more back end role.  During my undergrad I was a fairly visible leader on campus having leadership roles in a variety of organizations (both business and non-business related) and have a good chunk of quantitative results from this. 

First question, does any of this make me MBB potential?
Second question, at the end of the grad program I will have 2 graduate degrees, both management/business related, but neither of them will be an MBA--what role would I expect to be brought in as? 

Best wishes!"

I'm a transfer student hopeful who's waiting for the paperwork to be completed on their deferred decision (spring grades and all that nonsense)

I'm going to be a sophomore in pharm sciences or prepharm, and since I'll be admitted so late I'm worried I won't be able to get in the classes I need. I'm already a little behind and I don't want to set myself back any further. 

Since you all are familiar with Purdue's class scheduling, I figured you could help me out. Will I be able to schedule for my classes and stay at least where I am, or am I gonna have to stay on track at my current school because it'll be a setback? Does that actually matter? I'll be able to take summer classes if I have to, but I'd prefer to set that time aside to do internships and the like.

3749kh,2,2015-05-24,"*urgent* What sort of lawyer/lawsuit should I be looking for if the university entered into my apartment and discarded all my property during my stay at a hospital, then ban me from the university and refuse to answer any questions regarding the incident?",ponderexistence,legal,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/3749kh/urgent_what_sort_of_lawyerlawsuit_should_i_be/,"*urgent* What sort of lawyer/lawsuit should I be looking for if the university entered into my apartment and discarded all my property during my stay at a hospital (which they knew)? Afterward, they ban me from the university and refuse to answer any questions regarding the incident. Where should I start in my quest for litigation? Thanks!

The events surrounding the incident are quite complex. I was a graduate student at a major research university in Chicago &amp; lived in university housing. I had a nervous breakdown &amp; had to stay at a hospital. During this time, the university entered into my place &amp; discarded nearly all my property, many irreplaceable/unrecoverable (i.e. research, computer). I was then banned from the university without an explanation &amp; threatened with further disciplinary action should I seek litigation (discrimination? Intimidation?). The events have been very emotionally/psychologically traumatic (personal injury?). How should I proceed? What kind of lawyer/lawsuit should I be seeking? What area(s) of law does my situation fit? What are my chances of winning/settling a lawsuit?

With less than a month before possible statute of limitations taking into effect, I am urgently writing in hopes that someone may be able to help me with figuring out how I should pursue legal action against a major university in Chicago (where I was a graduate student) regarding a complex set of heinous discriminatory and biased actions made by the university which led to several personal injuries including the loss of my income, the loss of my place of living, the loss of countless unrecoverable, irreplaceable, and invaluable property and prized possessions, and the considerable loss my research as well as academic status and reputation, amongst other losses large and small, tangible and intangible. I strongly believe my civil rights and the reasonable accommodation protections for my disabilities were grossly violated by the university through their actions. The foremost reason I am writing is regarding the significant psychological and emotional injuries that have severely affected me; injuries caused by the university’s negligence and mishandling of a situation which occurred near the end of the spring quarter in 2013 (June 2013). Since the incident, I have considered pursuing possible litigation against the university, but not sure how I should proceed and have been held back in fear as the university is a huge and wealthy institution and I am not. Furthermore, the university’s intimidation of further disciplinary action should I pursue legal action has made me feel uncomfortable about proceeding with litigation. However, the persisting and worsening mental anguish and suffering, and unceasing emotional pain and distress, caused by the university’s actions continue to traumatize and torment my day to day life. After consulting the advice of friends and colleagues, and conducting some research online, I feel a civil rights/discrimination/injury litigation may fit my case suitably. However, I would like to hear about all the possible legal options I should pursue from someone with legal knowledge, preferably an experienced attorney. I would also like to know about the possibility of lowered or contingent fees, or if my case can be carried pro bono, as I am now on SSI Disability and have limited funds. Furthermore, as I understand, I may be limited in time to pursue litigation, thus please let me know as soon as you can about what legal avenues or attorneys I should pursue. That being said, I feel confident that someone here may have very appropriate and useful advice fitting to my circumstances, and if feasible, closer to forming a formidable lawsuit.

Brief Back Story: 

I was a graduate student at a major research university in Chicago (the one Obama went to), pursuing my Master’s in Sociology, from 2012 to 2013. I struggled (and still struggle) with several documented mental illnesses, the main ones being Major Depression, General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Agoraphobia, PTSD, OCPD, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. While I tried to manage my mental illnesses along with the stresses of the highly rigorous graduate program, to my misfortune, the mental conditions grew worse through the school year, culminating with me barricading myself in the university housing graduate student apartment I was residing at the end of the spring quarter of 2013 (March-June). I barricaded myself in my apartment by securing the front door with industrial foam epoxy. I did this to focus on my course finals and research, and to prevent myself from activities which might distract me. On the morning of June 14th 2013, I hear a large crash. My front door had been battered down by the police (Chicago and UCPD campus police). I was caught in shock. Police surrounded me and the Dean of Students escorted me to the student counseling center. There I met with an emergency counselor who forwarded me to Chicago Lakeshore Hospital. I stayed at the hospital until June 29th. Somehow the hospital had gotten hold of my parents during my stay, without my consent or knowledge. My parents flew in from Sacramento, California. The hospital would only discharge me to my parents and mandated that I must return straight to Sacramento with my parents (a command from the university as Lakeshore hospital is affiliated with the university). This was not explained to me: why I could only be released to my parents, and why I had to go straight non-stop to California. It turns out a great deal was not explained to me, to my parents (who do not speak English fluently), to my brother who came with my parents, and to a close friend who was living with me at the time. During and after everything that happened, the university and the hospital would deny my requests for information and explanations. The only piece of information that I was able to attain was my hospital records.

During my time at the hospital, the university went into my apartment and discarded nearly everything inside, save a few boxes which contained some possessions which I remember was on my desk such as one of my laptops (which was smashed and in bad shape). Several thousand dollars in cash I had in my desk were never reported for. More atrociously, nearly everything related to my thesis research was gone (hundreds of hours of work), including written materials such as notebooks and journals, as well as digital materials such as other computers and hard disks. Other items included irreplaceable, invaluable and unrecoverable possessions such as hand written mail, photographs, albums, art, jewelry, gifts, rare books and collectibles, amongst countless other possessions. 

The university never asked for my consent nor did they inform me about their entering into my apartment and discarding of my property while I was in the hospital. However, the university was completely aware I was in the hospital during this time. The university did not mention about what they did to my apartment and property until my parents arrived at the hospital and started asking questions – nearly two weeks later. By then, it was too late. Everything was gone. When my parents, brother, and close friend (who lived with me for parts of the year) went to my apartment to look through and rescue my property in the trash receptacle (the large rectangular kind that one would find typically at construction sites) placed in front of my apartment, they were immediately met with university officials who would not permit them to look through the trash receptacle filled with my belongings, which was then strangely towed away within minutes after my family and friend encountered the university officials. So, did university housing not want my family to know what valuables and invaluables had been haphazardly thrown out? Why did the university react with such immediacy to discard all evidence regarding their hasty clear out of my apartment? Would the university have done this to someone who did not have a mental disability? To this day I do now know the answers to these questions. The university refuses to answer any inquiries regarding the incident. My family and friends who have asked the university for answers were met with silence. My professors and thesis advisors who have inquired university administrative officials received silence. The university simply would not speak about the incident when asked. Shortly after the incident, Sam Cholke, a journalist writing for the Hyde Park Herald and DNAinfo Chicago, contacted me for some correspondence as he was trying to write an article about my incident at the university, which was beginning to cause rumors and theories amongst the community. Even Cholke, who was trying to objectively investigate the incident, was met with silence when talking with university officials regarding the incident. In addition to the silence regarding the incident and myself, the university has banned me from entering any university property, threatening me with arrest if I do. That is likely not going to happen, as I reside in California now, and I am trying to avoid anything having to do with university and my time there. However, thoughts about the university and the incident persistently intrude my mind and my life through painful emotions and memories, and violent flashbacks and nightmares. Not even in my sleep can I find rest from what happened at the university. But then again, how does one forget about the entity that took everything away from them and then refuses to answer inquiries about their egregious actions? I lost my pay (paid internship at a museum on campus), student body status, my most prized irreplaceable possessions (photographs and letters, gifts, rare collectibles, hard disks with several years worth of photos, memories, and other personal data), and substantial parts of my research. Figuratively speaking, I nearly lost my mind (psychotic episodes triggered from the distressing thoughts and emotions regarding the traumatic incident), and several times, nearly lost my own life (attempted suicide).

I guess you can leave a place, but the place won’t leave you. The heinous and discriminatory actions performed by the university have had severe and lasting psychological and emotional effects on me. It has now been nearly two years since the incident, and my mental state has not recovered much since then. If anything, I believe it has worsened. Through the many sessions of talking with my current therapist, I have come to a conclusion that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the ‘Chicago incident’ has significantly affected and altered my preexisting mental conditions for the worse.  To live through trauma once is painful, but to live through it again and again is a living hell. Not a single day passes without the thoughts about what the university did to me coming up, often several times a day. Now, as the anniversary of the incident steadfastly approaches, the troubling thoughts and flashbacks of what happened in Chicago attack me several times an hour, cruelly consuming nearly all of my waking life, and they do not stop there. As I mentioned before, thoughts and flashbacks that consistently trespass my consciousness while I am awake is troubling, but that the thoughts would ceaselessly invade me in my sleep, in the form of terrorizing nightmares, is beyond disturbing.
 
Ever since the incident, the thought of pursuing litigation against the university has been on my mind. However, I have been unsure of how to proceed. Furthermore, the intimidation and threats made by the university that they would make my life even more difficult (i.e. disciplinary actions) if I seek litigation made me even more wary about pursuing my legal options. However, at this time, with all the extensive injuries I have succumbed from the university’s actions, I am putting their intimidation and coercions to the side, and am looking for a capable lawyer who can fight for my rights and restitution. Furthermore, I hope to see retribution take place for the university. Above all, I am seeking justice.

The entire story and sequence of events that occurred would be far too long and nuanced for a brief back story. With what I have written, I hope to have explained a complicated and complex incident with as much clarity and concision as I can without losing the multifaceted contents of what had happened. I have extensive personal records of the events (i.e. journal entries, e-mails, texts, social media posts) as well as official medical records and records from witnesses, and the version of the story that the university has released to my parents.

I like it, I'm learning, I'm getting internships, all that; but the program itself is sub-par.

If you don't know my school tends to be looked down upon, a bit of a party school and for that I'm worried about future employment. The school I would want to transfer into is the University of Washington, but the MASSIVE drawback is I would have to take a year at a Community College to get in.

Is it worth it to delay my graduation a year? I get schooling for close to nothing because of financial grants, so the costs aren't too incredibly painful. But I was just wondering whether it would be worth it in the long run.

TL;DR should I delay graduation for a stronger looking alma mater?"

So! We're gonna dig in and get the ball rolling on some easy and effective activism we can do from now until Sunday (May 31st) to help show our support for those whom have already made the first crucial and necessary steps in restoring and defending our 4th Amendment Rights. [**These Senators**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mOfuUoGci7u-LmXCn9a5jny4YeHF-Cw4_E0RZytsHJk/edit) will be subject to extreme pressure this entire week from the Executive branch, intelligence industry lobbyists and even their fellow peers. It will be very crucial for us, as voters, to get a resounding message of support to those [**public officials who stand in favor of our personal liberties**.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/in-a-box-with-a-fox#.nidmwWJMML) 

We need all the help we can get collaborating everyone's efforts to contact Senators with phone calls and email letters. Anyone that wants to do some quick and effective grassroots work to ensure a constant flow of public pressure for ending the PATRIOT Act's Section 215, is encouraged to use and share ~ [**THIS DOCUMENT**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mOfuUoGci7u-LmXCn9a5jny4YeHF-Cw4_E0RZytsHJk/edit) ~ It will be used as a Central Hub of information where we can record our progress, easily share with others and encourage everyone to get involved and exercise their Rights as voters in this very important moment. 

Since it is a holiday vacation, there is a 99% chance you will be speaking/writing to an underpaid (if paid at all) intern or aide. Despite the contentious nature of politics, it is important when delivering your message to be clear, courteous and respectful. They will take your message and pass it along to the Senator when he/she is available.

**If you feel strongly about this effort, but aren't sure of political phrasing or the technical details regarding Section 215: We will have some template messages on the first page of &lt;[This Project Thread](http://www.ronpaulforums.com/showthread.php?475318-Activism-Alert!-Senate-Outreach-Project-Time-is-Short-Need-Help!)&gt; to get an idea of what to information to include or simply use word for word**

How to get Started!

Open the document link and locate, if applicable, your State Senator. If they aren't included or highlighted in RED, perhaps you would like to take this opportunity to respectfully let them know your disappointment with them as a representative. While it may not be the most effective use of our time, it can be quite fulfilling.
When you find your state US Senator(s) use the contact information provided to make a phone call. It will take all of 1-2 minutes and will quickly become easier and less awkward the more frequently you do. If it's your Senator, at the end of your message include a name and county along with mentioning votes you've cast for them (or future considerations). 
After you've made a call or email, please take the time to change the previous number in the corresponding [# of Contacts] column to reflect your contribution to this group effort. Being able to quantitatively see everyone working together as we influence change.
If you've called your own Senators, but still want to do even more, (you MVP, you) then take this time to find BLUE Senators and call them to leave a simple thank you. 
The last step and arguably most important is sharing this message. Forums, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and even your friends and family. Don't let the message stop at you, spread Liberty like wild fire.


If you've come this far and you're excited to do what you can (Even if its a single phone call) Then we're glad to have you standing with us. It is the small efforts that all of us can do together that will make this successful.

374r60,2,2015-05-24,Diversification,ApolloMichaels,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/374r60/diversification/,"Hey everyone, I’ve been having some strange dreams, and I thought this was the right place to talk about it. Quick background on me: my name is Apollo, I’m 25 years old, and I live and work in Midtown Manhattan as a financial advisor. They say “pick your boss, not your job”- I did the opposite. I asked my dad to help me get an internship here because I loved the idea of it— that was six years ago now. I know, it’s not popular nowadays, but financial advising can be noble. A good investment portfolio is like a strong heart, pumping every second to provide the lifeblood of money for the rest of your life.

You see, financial advising is about so many things. it’s about planning, it’s about balance, it’s about knowledge. It’s about making sure you have enough for the future. And if you’re investing for retirement, the stability is what really matters, not the individual investments. The bigger picture is what you need to focus on- diversification.

Sometimes my clients hear a “hot stock tip” from their friend down the street, and want to invest in it. Honestly, this kind of pisses me off, but it’s not my job to dictate, merely to advise. I’m like the Finance Minister to Kings all around the world, and then the Kings listen to their Court Jester.

So, anyway, sorry- I really like talking about this, I get that it’s not interesting to most people. This is what’s been bothering me. One of my clients, Farnsworth, he’s about 40 years old, big barrel-chested man. Always thinks he’s right. He was making absurd stock picks and wrecking his returns. Penny stocks left and right, and losing thousands on thousands of dollars. Of course, I don’t see any money from this either, because I get paid on residuals from mutual funds. It was a lose-lose situation, so I dropped him as a client. He was really upset- he kept asking me not to, but I knew it was for the best.

Here’s the thing. That was six months ago. I haven’t seen him since. But I keep dreaming about him.

The dream keeps happening the same way. I’m taking a lunch break and swinging by my place, but in that dream way— you know, where none of the details match your apartment, but you know it is. I walk in, and Farnsworth is there, lying on the ground. There is a pack of wolves snarling, ripping at him. And he’s bleeding, he’s bleeding so badly, but instead of blood, he’s bleeding dollar bills. I feel a panic attack coming on, and as I try to leave through the door I came in, it’s turned into a mirror.

I look at myself in the mirror, and I’m holding a heart. When I turn back around, Farnsworth is standing behind me, now with a gaping hole in his chest. The wolves are gone, and he keeps reaching into the cavity and pulling out fistful after fistful of dollars, offering them to me. He starts talking to me, but his lips aren’t moving, and it isn’t his voice— it’s mine. It’s gibberish, the lot of what he’s saying is gibberish, but he’s so desperate, he’s pleading with me, louder and louder.

I always ask him to stop. I always tell him that I only tried to help him. That I let him go not to hurt him, not to steal his future, but because I knew it wasn’t going to work out. That it was for his own good. I didn’t mean to take his heart from his chest, what pumps his lifeblood, but he gave me no other option. He was always only focused on the individual, making insane individual investments, begging for his individual life, not understanding about diversification. It’s about stability. It’s about long-term planning. He never understood that, and if you can’t understand that, why I do what I do, there’s no getting through. And he never listens, and all I ever hear is him yelling gibberish, in my voice, through the hole in his chest.

And then I wake up, sweating. See, logically, I know ending that relationship was for the best. But clearly I still feel bad about it. Does anyone have any ideas on how to make the dreams stop?

Oh, and if you have any referrals, I’ve got an opening for a new client."

Like to flirt, tease, talk dirty, and play? You found the right person. Let's have a bit of a build up until we can't take it any more.

I have a few fantasies in mind, but I'm open to other ones. In general, my kinks are D/s, exhibitionism, dirty talk, ageplay, incest (Dad/dau), bondage, some rough play, cum play, impreg. Limits include toilet stuff and non-con.

Here are the fantasies I've been thinking about:

1) Dad/dau play. Maybe you're my secretary or a new intern. Maybe you're just playing hooky to come visit Daddy at work. While others may think you're innocent, Daddy knows what a dirty girl you really are. Or maybe you're just an out and out slut. Maybe we can have some people watch or join in? Or maybe we have to sneak around.

2) I read a cuckquean scenario the other night and it caught my attention. I don't have a lot of experience with this one, but it sounds like fun. You're the other woman--younger, hotter, kinkier, wilder. What would you do to tease my wife while we play? How would you drive her wild with jealousy or put her in her place?

3) It started off innocently enough. You heard Mommy and Daddy making noises at night. That led to listening and peeking, and snooping. You found the outfits, the toys, the porn. And you liked it all. You wanted what Mommy had, and you were convinced you could do it better. Kinkier, louder, dirtier. Anything with Daddy. So you stated to dress differently, act differently. Flirting led to touching, then kissing, then fucking. And you were right. You are better. Daddy now prefers you. You just need to find ways to sneak around and have your secret fun.

We have a set boundary to not go to parties alone. I find out she went out to one without telling me by finding her tagged in a FB photo. I break up with her and she begs me for a last chance. This isn't the first time she's lied about going out. After an hour of begging and crying, I give in and tell her I'll take a month to reconsider us but not completely break up. She was sincerely thankful and gave the most enthusiastic blowjob ever.

&amp;nbsp;

However, a few days later I am certain she had sex with another guy. 

Here are the clues:

* I find out she changed the guy's name to ""Mary"" on her phone
* ""Mary"" texts her one day saying, ""Are you on your period? There was a little blood lol""
* Found condom wrapper in trash can, which she claims was her parents as they were visiting her for a week.

Technically, our relationship is in a vague hiatus, so it wasn't technically 100% cheating, but it still is disgusting.

I would totally break it off but, she has graduated and moved to NYC for her job and has been trying to convince me to find an internship there so we can spend the summer there together. She is a rich girl with a lot of connections. She offered to help pay for my expenses by giving me $5000 worth of used college textbooks to sell and split 50/50. She also straight up gave me $200 cash to help get there. She also hooked me up with a photography gig for the Tony Awards at the red carpet where I'd make around $6000. I'm a college student in short of cash, and this is also a great opportunity career wise. 

&amp;nbsp;


The only catch is that I would have to work with her for the same organization. Should I just plate her for the summer and cut her off once I return home for my last year of college? I'd reap the benefits of money, connections and sex before cutting her out of my life.
Or cut her off now and completely treat her platonically during the summer? 

Either way, I am NOT going to LDR this girl. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks guys."

In the meantime, I would like to gain some coding experience and broaden my skillset through an internship in the realm of web/software development. I have been playing around with web development and programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, PHP, MYSQL, Python/Django, some Java/JSP) for a few years now and gained some skills in scientific computing (Python/Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib and MatLab) through a summer internship and research project at the City College of New York last summer. I also have some limited experience with Node/ExpressJS/AngularJS. If my skillet aligns with your work and you are willing to take me under your wing this summer, feel free to shoot me a pm to discuss this further. I look forward to working with one of you.  "

377njm,9,2015-05-25,Everything was great for almost two years.,ldrthrowaway54321,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/377njm/everything_was_great_for_almost_two_years/,"**TL;DR: Amazing girl and I are in different places in our lives. Other than that, our time together was great and comfortable, but cut short. Distance (and the downsides it brings) was the reason for the breakup. It seemed to come out of nowhere from my point of view. Do you have any advice for me to cope and move on?**

5/26: Edited to remove some of the more specific things.

Wall of text warning, and I'm not the best writer. Here's our story:

We dated for 1.75 years, with the final 1.25 years of that long distance (5 hour plane ride, not counting the three time zones). We were good friends for several months before the relationship pretty naturally transitioned into existence. We met in college, through mutual friends and activities. I had accepted a job (really, my dream job for a while) across the country before the relationship began, a few months before my graduation. She still had 3 more years of school.

After I moved, I thought that once we got past a certain point in time (no specific length in mind, but I thought the year we had was pretty encouraging), we were pretty set in our long distance. Things were hard, of course, but we always knew she'd move out to join me after graduation. She managed to get a summer internship not far from from me last year, which was awesome. We got to see each other at least every other weekend during that time. This year, an internship for her in my city fell through, and we decided that the internship from last year (which was good experience, but not in the career direction she wants go) wasn't the best choice for her. She's currently interning in her desired field at a great company, but nowhere near me. I agree with this decision and absolutely would not change that.

She spent her breaks with me, and we always made the most of our time together, trying to fit as much in as possible, visiting new places, traveling. I returned home for holidays and special occasions, anniversaries. Whenever I was home, our families would get together and everybody got along so well. Every moment we spent together was special, and every moment we spent apart was looking forward to our next time together. It felt right, it was great, and I didn't realize anything was wrong until it was too late.

We had gotten into a bit of a funk, where we were both going through busy times and weren't able to talk as much. I tried to give her some space, so she wouldn't feel bothered while she was so busy. We still talked every day, just not as often and about fewer things. We discussed this, but couldn't seem to come to an agreement on how to fix it. After talking a bit more, she realized there was something deeper. From my point of view, this had all come out of nowhere, but it didn't. She had recently decided to pursue her PhD after graduation (which, at this point, is still 1.5 years away). This will probably add a minimum of 4 years of long distance on top of everything else. The schools near me just wouldn't be a good choice for her specialization. It's possible she'd move closer to me (where we are now, pretty much anything would be closer), but absolutely nothing is set in stone right now. She wanted to take a break (a few weeks) to see if missing me all the time was better or worse than not having me at all. Unfortunately, she's decided she absolutely cannot do long distance anymore. Our worsened communication caused her to feel less connected to me and caused her to start thinking a bit more about the future. The inability to just live our lives together and experience things together got to her, especially when it looks like it will continue for the next 5 years.

She is an absolutely amazing human being. The perfect combination of beauty, intelligence, humor, everything. We didn't fight, we rarely disagreed. Everything seemed perfect, and I truly believe she agreed. If we were in the same place both in our lives and physically, I think we both believe this would have worked. It's so hard to come to terms with the fact that this was out of our hands. After reading some of the advice threads here (I don't know how this was my first time visiting this subreddit. Maybe it would have helped), I'm convinced I could have done more. I could have written her letters. I could have visited more. We could have Skyped more or more regularly. We could have been more clear on our next opportunity to be together. Whether or not any of those things would have helped, I wish we had the opportunity to try. Do you have any advice for me to cope and move on?

Thank you for reading."
377rlh,34,2015-05-25,90 Days Progress Report,RatSuitErotica,eroticauthors,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticauthors/comments/377rlh/90_days_progress_report/,"Hi all,

A couple weeks ago I hit 90 days since I published my first story. It’s been an interesting three months, and I've had some successes and some failures (mistakes were made, my third month brought in about half of what my second did).

[You can see my main pen here](http://www.amazon.com/Regan-Irons/e/B00TMIMN60/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1432563942&amp;sr=8-2-ent). Check it out and see if you can guess which stories were successful and which werent. I’ve listed my top performing releases below. I’ll continue publishing on it until my current kink falls flat, then I’ll start publishing more focused niches/kinks on more pen names (so that I can cover some more ground without diluting reader experience). Look for an update on that in the next month or two.

If you have questions about anything, I’ll be happy to try and answer them (but forgive me if I’m slow getting back to you, I just got back from vacation and have lots of writing to do).

* February 12 - May 25
* 45 Published Titles (38 live) - Erotic Shorts, 3300-9000 words (most are between 4000 and 6000)
* 445 Sales and 2850 Borrows to date (~4500 USD)
* Software used: Google Drive, Photoshop CS6, Microsoft Excel
* Covers: I do them all myself in Photoshop using stock from DollarPhotoClub (previously I used Marcus Ranum's stock photos, which are great. Just make sure to read his terms before using)

This is what I would tell myself if I was starting over.

* Keep your kinks narrow on each pen name. If you want to write a new kink, do it on a new pen name.
* Make sure your readers know what they’re getting when they look at your title and cover.
* Your covers should be sexy, suggestive, titillating, etc. Make sure the title is clean and easy to read.
* Keep backmatter relevant. I like 2-4 stories with about a paragraph description for each.
* Marketing is the most important thing you do. 95% of marketing is packaging your product. Sexy cover. Descriptive title. Blurb that hooks the reader. Look Inside that shows off your sexy sexy writing.
* Do not half-ass production/marketing. In fact, start here. Pick a sexy stock photo. Think of a story for that photo. Make it into a cover, give it a title, write the blurb, write the story.
* When in doubt, go back to something that has worked for you before and iterate on that.
* Write what you want to write. If you aren’t having fun, do something else.
* Don’t let perfection stand in the way of good.
* Outlines and prewriting are your friend.
* Don’t worry so much about editing. Write quickly. Read once. Fix anything glaring.
* Readers like to insert themselves into the story. Give them lots of chances to do so and enjoy themselves.
* Write. Publish. Repeat. Everything else is noise.
* You will fuck up. Don’t sweat it.

Top Titles

* Let’s Dominate the Intern ($870) - BDSM Menage
* One Night with the Biker Gang ($630) - BDSM Menage
* One Night with the Groomsmen ($500) - BDSM Menage
* The Director Makes Me Choose ($240) - BDSM First Time
* One Night on the Tour Bus ($230) - Menage
* Sasha Submits to the City Slickers ($190) - Cuckold Menage
* The Hotwife, Her Husband, and the High Rollers ($180) - Cuckold Menage

Series dominate my revenue stream. My top earning story was originally published as 3 shorts, then I released it as a bundle. Same thing with Biker Gang. I’ve yet to release Groomsmen as a bundle.

The next four stories are all stand alone. Most of my early stories were BDSM Menage. I tried writing a lot of different stuff and I think it kind of turned off readers. Lately I got back into publishing primarily one kink (infidelity) and it’s helped to get me back to better earnings. "
377vem,1,2015-05-25,(UK) [Planning] I need advice on finalising a plan,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/377vem/uk_planning_i_need_advice_on_finalising_a_plan/,"I honestly never thought that I would be posting on somewhere like this but I am..

Background info: I graduated from university last year and got accepted into a MA programme.  Sadly, I completely fucked up my last exam which meant that I missed the overall requirement by &lt;1%.  I got turned away afterwards.  I was never happy with studying but with a degree being a basic requirement nowadays, I always saw it as something I had to do because I'm not the type to work within a trade as a long term career.  I was always interested in a Master's degree because typically it's only a 1 year commitment and should improve my employability massively (I hope).  *I never disregarded a Master's degree even with my dislike of studying and losing out on my offer because it was simply only 1 year for a much better degree.*  Although, I really do want to be done with education ASAP and just starting earning steady money, where the Master's degree would be the final step.

So the start of the academic year in the UK always starts around mid September.  Since graduating in July 2014 and a 5-6 month internship afterwards, I landed a temp job for 6 months which I started around mid-March this year so the contract expires around mid-September (when the school year begins).  The pay is more than sufficient to pay off all of my monthly bills and have decent spending/saving money on the side too especially with the lack of experience a recent graduate would have.

I wasn't sure at the time, how likely it was that I was going to do a MA (I always wanted to get it over with ASAP if I ever decided to do it) but unfortunately I couldn't physically live with my family/friends for a multitude of reasons.  I was going to stay in the same city where I attended university because it's a larger city within the UK and the unemployment rate at my hometown is at an all time high so there was no point and that decision also ruled out living with my parents.  I have semi-affluent parents, we have enough to travel wherever/whenever we want but not enough to buy assets of various sorts on a daily basis; upper-middle class if you will.  As I said, I was very unsure of what my life was going to be like for the next 3 years after graduation (still unsure) but I knew for sure that I wasn't going back to my hometown and was likely to stay here and get a job because I had months to look for one.  My dad is really supportive of me and he thought the best idea was to BUY a 2 bedroom flat for me because he thought paying rent was pointless if I was going to live here for x years and my parents can stay over anytime they come to visit or whatever.

I do not hate my job or the company I work for by any means and I have every bit of confidence that they will want to keep me on, however the industry is just not for me and I would leave if the right opportunity came about.  However, I have come to the realisation that I want to go back to school and pursue this particular programme as I feel as though it would really boost my employability and salary.  The ideal scenario was to do a PT MA for 2 years as opposed to the FT 1 year, as this allows me to continually work FT and earn money to pay off my bills but unfortunately this programme is FT only and I think that's it's pointless to invest 2 years into a PT MA that I'm not content doing.  Now here is where the problem begins:

As you can tell up to this point, the problem is the flat.. if I am a FT student I can't pay off the bills to put it simply (roughly £800/month for everything).  I recognise that this is entirely my fault for not knowing what I really wanted sooner but I really didn't want to take a year out after graduation and just do nothing; I had to earn some money or get some experience.  However, owning the flat has really limited my options and given my asshole a right good lubing;

* it's far from school
* high living costs when you have no source of income
* limits what schools I can apply to (irrelevant because I want to do this MA in the same city where I live)

**So I have come to the realisation that I have the following options and would really just like some advice in general:**

* ask parents to pay monthly bills for the next 12 months, I REALLY REALLY don't want to do this because I don't want to have to ask my parents to pay for my shit anymore.. *sigh* I greatly appreciate them financially supporting me so far and I am really fortunate to be in a situation like this but I just don't want to have to borrow money from them anymore especially for something that was my naive fault.
* save any money I make now and use pretty much all of my savings as well as borrow what money I can to survive
* study and get a shit PT job and apply to option 2
* assuming someone's interested, rent the other bedroom to cover my living costs; although I'm not sure if my dad would even be happy with this as he bought the flat for me and our family to use really... we would obviously have to discuss this although I'm not even sure if I could find someone interested in it.  If this option was discussed, he would probably say that he will just cover me but whatever, just throwing it out there anyways
* fuck the Master's degree and just work, simple, no worries..

I'm guessing most are going to say option 1 and it wouldn't be surprising, I guess I just want some reassurance...

**Oh and just to clarify, ALL of this is obviously assuming that I get an unconditional offer for the Master's programme as I've yet to apply (I should be optimistic, right?)**

Anyways, apologies for the long-ass backstory and wall of text.  Any advice is greatly appreciated :)"
377xp0,25,2015-05-25,Looking for a technical job in oil and gas industry? Pointers inside for college students and newly degreed people.,engineeringguy,oilandgasworkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/377xp0/looking_for_a_technical_job_in_oil_and_gas/,"I like to help people.  I had a tough time getting into the oil and gas industry as an engineer and want to share some pointers that I've shared with multiple redditors through the years.  This is from an email that I sent to someone that approached me for help.  I've edited it heavily but I hope that someone else finds it helpful:

Right now is probably one of the toughest times to get into the oil and gas job market.   At my company, we have slowed down recruiting from 48/ yr to 2/yr.  Our contractors have gone through multiple rounds of layoffs as well.  In short, nobody is hiring.  

When I was in school, I was very much in a tough situation.  I had done no internships and my GPA was below a 3.0.  Actually, it was well below, 2.4 or 2.6 if i remember right.  I had a recruiter tell me I would never work for his company because my grades were so low.  I was quite discouraged and wondered why I spent my time at one of the top engineering schools.  I spent the first nine years of my career building my resume working for various contractors in the oil &amp; gas business so I could work for a major operator.  What worked for me may not work for you but here’s my suggestion:

* If you can, go to where the oil and gas is. Houston, North Dakota, San Joaquin Valley, Canada, etc.  Where there’s oil, there’s going to be contractors and ways you can make connections.  

* Look for engineering opportunities large engineering companies that have a path into oil and gas.  If they are diversified enough, the slow down isn’t hurting them as badly and they’re still hiring.  Get your foot in the door and make it clear that you want to work in the oil industry but understand that now is a difficult time.  Companies like Parsons, Stantec, Mustang, Bechtel, Fluor, Jacobs, URS, KBR might be a good place to start. Some of those companies do projects that cost many billions of dollars and those don’t get canceled when times slow down.  These are all construction contractors so they design and build ‘stuff.’  If you are young and are interested in being 'global and mobile' let these companies know.  Oil is in a lot of places.  Oil and gas is never in nice places like Cancun.  

* On your resume, try to get it to be at least a page.  There should be things that elaborate what you have done during your career to make you different than the other kids at your school?  You indicated you did projects for AICE.  Elaborate a little on those.  Visit your career center.  This was something I wish I had done while I was at school.  They should have a ton of references to help you get your foot in the door.  If there are job fairs at your school, go to them, bring your resume and sell yourself to them.  Did you do anything where you demonstrated leadership skills?   Nothing is off limits but be prepared to discuss how it applies to the job you are applying for.  If it is for something that is not allowed to be asked on an interview, like religion related( ‘led bible study for local church’) then you open the door for them to ask about your religion affiliation.  

* If you are interested in Petroleum Engineering (finding the oil in the ground and getting it out) consider getting a Masters in Petroleum Engineering.  Colorado School of Mines, Montana Tech, USC, UCLA are all schools that the major oil companies recruit from.  This does a couple things.  It will keep you out of the job market while it is terrible.  It will give you an opportunity to get internships under your belt.  It will let you rebuild your GPA.  When you are applying to companies like Chevron, Oxy, Shell, Exxon, etc., you are competing with worldwide talent.  It irritates me that my company focuses on GPA so heavily (the average incoming intern has a 3.9+) especially since there are other things out there that define your work ethic beyond GPA.  I had a learning disability and didn’t do well in school.  I’m now one of the top performers at my company.  

I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to post questions to this thread and I'll do whatever I can to answer them.  It is a tough market and I'm willing to help wherever and whenever I can. "
377y1r,3,2015-05-25,Deciding between two job offers.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/377y1r/deciding_between_two_job_offers/,"Some months ago, I started working as a consultor for a consulting company, this is: Client(CompanyA(CompanyB(Me))).

The pay was low, the project wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but the commute and the office location was great (20 min, in the center of a big city, with everything at walking distance), and basically, I needed the money. There's some programming to be done with modern, stablished tech everyone asks for in their job postings, but there's only one dude working with it, and is a basically stablished and finished application with only graphic details remaining.

After few months in my current job, CompanyC (which I interviewed before I accepted this job) sent me a new offer: Way more pay than CompanyB, full development position (what I'm looking for), but really bad location (1hr commute, far away of everything, like most of the tech related work in my city), and kind of old tech into what seems to be some a chaotic, but stable, project.

I accepted, both for being able to code again 8 hours a day and to get a more decent salary, and told CompanyB and CompanyA that I was leaving. Now, after some talks, CompanyA is offering me more or less the same salary than companyC to fill in the post of the dude who was working developing, as he's leaving to other client.

I've researched a bit on CompanyA (Big consulting company), and it seems no one says anything good about it. Everyone says that its a good place to start a career (I have 1-2 years experience, with internships), learn, but sink 10-12 hours of work a day and left when you burn out. The project here, though, is really relaxed and slow paced. 
Also, I haven't really saw a lot of development work coming our way. I don't know if this is good (as I could spend the time learning the tech behind the application) or bad (As I would end up doing not related to programming stuff or moved to other project).

So... basically I'm between two ""not excellent but nice"" offers (With similar economic conditions):

CompanyC:

* Actual development work. Part of a development team with old, known tech.
* Potential messed up project. Seems to be patches over patches over patches.
* Unknown coworkers and working conditions. There's nothing on glassdoor about it (Not US company) or in other webpages.
* No mention to overtime on the interviews I did.
* No mention on future salary raises.
* If everything goes right, I can have a nice post in a development team which uses a tech I'm somewhat familiar with and grow a bit as a developer with some stability. If everything goes wrong, I will be in a messed up project pushing spaghetti code every month.

CompanyA:

* Relaxed project. Close to home, near the center of the city. Great work environment where I could end up calling ""friend"" most of the coworkers, and I'm not the most sociable guy around.
* Most of the people who wrote any comment on this company talks about it being a terrible place to work. Most of the complains don't affect our current project, though.
* No actual development schedule for our project. No development team or support on the tech. Honestly, I don't even have a written confirmation that I would end up in the coworker's post (Although the need for someone to fill in is real).
* Current tech everyone uses, clean project, cool stuff. But huge as hell, lot of stuff to learn before being operative. Quite a challenge I'm not really sure I could take on quickly.
* A bit suspicious that CompanyA agrees on moving me from ""somewhat developer"" to ""full time developer"" after so few months of work for them. Maybe its impostor syndrome. Maybe its just them wishing to finish the project so they can fire me.
* If everything goes right, I will be near home, in a great environment, learning useful tech at my pace. If everything goes wrong I could end up in a different destination which could negate all the pros of my current position or if I don't move, I could end up not being able to catch up on the huge application as I would be mostly alone with it.


I have to end saying that I truly value my time outside work. I don't mind spend some weeks ""with no life"", but I want to do more than wake, work, sleep every day for months. I want to have time to side projects and stuff not related with computers, and the unpaid overtime of CompanyA is kind of scaring me.

377yth,2,2015-05-25,"Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [24M] of 18 months - My boyfriend has lied to me, but I don't know how to confront him without disclosing the source (his best friend).",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/377yth/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_of_18_months_my/,"Alright, Reddit, I really need some advice here. Basically, I went to an event this weekend with my boyfriend, “Chris”, where we met up with a lot of his old college friends. His best friend and roommate through college, Julian, was there. Julian is an all-around great guy; he’s honest and would have no incentive to ruin my relationship in any way. The two of them are really close friends, and they make a strong effort to see each other as much as possible now that they live four hours away.


Anyways, Chris drank too much and left the event early, and Julian and I got to talking. I asked advice on what I should do about an awesome internship that would require me to leave for 10 months that Chris was wildly unsupportive of. He doesn’t like to be alone and has has had of a lot of friends move away over the course of the last year, so he doesn’t have a lot of people to hang out with. I should put extra emphasis on the fact that Chris really doesn’t like to be alone - he gets sad when I work a lot of nights in a row and has to be alone at our apartment. Basically, Julian, who was pretty intoxicated, flat out told me that I shouldn’t trust Chris for that long. Chris told me he cheated in his first relationship on his girlfriend Marco (at 17), but Julian said that his history of cheating extended to his next relationship (where he cheated on his current girlfriend, Jamie,  with Marco). Chris’ last serious relationship ended when he was ~19, but Julian saw Chris treat women with a lot of disregard over the remainder of his college years.


Julian assured me that Chris has not cheated on me during our relationship, and he has not seen him feel about a girl or treat a girl in the same way he does with me. Chris has made a strong effort to change in a positive way, and he’s been a pretty great boyfriend. While he does have his flaws, he has attended a lot of my family events (which he would have never done in past relationships), helped me out when I was without a car for a few months, and has made more of an effort to stop drinking (which, to be honest, is a whole separate issue).


Julian mentioned that Chris told him that Marco had contacted Chris asking him to “hang out” about a week ago. Since Marco has made moves on Chris at the start of our relationship, I asked Chris to tell me whenever she contacts him. I try to be as trusting as possible, but Chris never told me about this. Julian did note that Chris did not hang out with her, but I do not appreciate his dishonesty. 


Now, I really do not know how to confront Chris on this issue. The whole thing is making me feel really sick. He gets mad whenever I mention Marco, and he told me that his relationship with Jamie fell apart because she couldn’t stop worrying about Marco. However, now that I know he cheated on Jamie with Marco multiple times, I feel like Marco’s feelings were pretty warranted. 


Julian begged me not to tell Chris about what I told him, and I want to respect that. I lied to Chris and I told him that I went through his phone (sidenote: I would never go through his phone) and that I saw his conversation with Marco. He denied everything. Since I didn’t know which medium Marco contacted him through, my story was not very plausible. When he asked me why I was suddenly so upset, I told him I was feeling insecure because he said her name in his sleep (I even felt bad about lying about that.)


Now that I know about Chris’ past indiscretions, I’m really upset about them. Had he told me from the start, I would have trusted him. However, he has done nothing but lie about his past with me. I don’t know what’s real or what isn’t. I’m also upset that he lied about Marco - I don’t see why he could not have just told me. I don’t want to be with someone who is a liar, but I can’t confront him either without telling him that Julian told me. 


Please, I really need some neutral advice. I don’t even know how warranted my feelings of concern and disgust are. I feel really stuck right now. Chris and I are in a serious, committed relationship, and we even signed a year long lease that begins in August together.


TL;DR: Boyfriend’s best friend told him that my boyfriend cheated more in the past than he ever admitted and that his past actions towards women have been very sketchy, but I cannot confront my boyfriend about this without exposing his best friend. What should my next step me?"

I met her in one of my classes last year, and over a few weeks we got closer and closer. I'm not a social type, so I had only had one relationship prior. Anyway we went on a few dates and started dating and we were inseparable. She's amazing: smart, nerdy, pretty much every quality I could wish for in a significant other. This is quite different from my first relationship about 2 years ago which lasted for a year, but I never truly loved her like I loved this woman.

Things were great for all six months. We saw each other probably 5 or 6 days of the week. One important difference between us though, is that she is very religious while I am not (I consider myself agnostic). We talked about religion occasionally, but it was usually from a philosophical standpoint... we pretty much agreed to disagree in beliefs (the discussions were always mature). Because of our differences in religious beliefs, she had to hide me from her family and religious friends (a big part of her friends are with her in a Christian group on campus).

We celebrated our six month anniversary about three weeks ago, and then she went on a church trip with this group that she had been looking forward to for a long time about a week ago. Everything was still going great, we were texting every single day saying we loved each other many times. A few days ago she texted saying she wanted to ""take a break from technology"" so I replied that it was no problem and that I loved her.

Last night when she got back she told me to meet her somewhere an hour from then. My stomach sank and I had a feeling what she wanted to do because she was texting really strangely, not saying she loved me, etc... I sat there for an hour tearing up, knowing that this was probably coming but still hoping otherwise. It felt surreal, like a bad dream. She met me there and said she had to breakup with me, that she loved me but she couldn't keep lying to her friends, family, herself, and me. I told her I loved her and that I understood and we went our separate ways. Last night was the hardest I've ever cried in my life, it felt like I'd lost a loved one. I wished I woke up from the nightmare.

I don't know what to do now. My life is in a great position (I have one year left before I graduate and am starting a great internship in a week.), but I just don't know what to do. I fully understand her reasoning and don't blame her, but I just wish I would wake up and find that this has all been a nightmare. I still have sentimental things we got together (like two stuffed animals we named, cheesy stuff like that). She even found a rock in the shape of a heart at the beginning of her trip that she gave me last night which makes me think it really was some kind of revelation during the last few days. She never showed any indication of thinking of breaking up with me before... it was completely out of the blue.

I just don't know what to do or think. I loved this person so much, she knew everything about me and now it's like I have no one here, like I have to start from square one and break that barrier again with new people.
   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend broke up with me after a church retreat trip because she is religious and I am not, even though we still love each other. I don't know what to do or think."
37832r,2,2015-05-25,Thank you all but my internship isn't ideal..,gwkuser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37832r/thank_you_all_but_my_internship_isnt_ideal/,"Hi everyone, I used to be frustrated that I would apply and get lots of interviews but I would never get an offer extended due to my lack of technical skills. It turns out firms still hired in the spring and they were not the big companies that screen through technical capability but a willingness to learn, and this subreddit made me realize that and I listened to the advice and kept pressing on.

With that said, I now work in an insurance firm in the IT department but they do mainly web applications and not lower level stuff at all, which is more along the lines of what I want to do since I'm an ECE major interested in firmware. I am having trouble learning all the web development stuff with all the different confusing platforms that link together in a very confusing and cloudy way, which are .NET, c#, html, JavaScript, css, jQuery, SQL, and more stuff I forgot at the moment. 

My first reaction is why the hell do we need all this stuff just for developing the web? And my second reaction is that I'm open to learning more object oriented programming to hopefully further my capability in interviews. My third reaction is then would having an internship in web development hurt me in trying to get a more systems based internship next year because HR ppl may think ""he applied for the wrong job, he would be a better fit for web development""... If not, how would I word this internship in my resume to make it more fitting for systems based roles? Can someone address my concerns? Thanks very much."

While I am confident in my abilities to pass the technical interviews, I hear that most people never get a chance to show themselves off in an interview because they get rejected solely on the basis of their CV.

This really worries me because my academic record, while not exactly terrible, is not excellent either (70% average from a UK university, which roughly translates to something like 3.0 GPA from a US university), and the closest thing that comes to ""work experience"" which I have is for one of my courses I had to create an app that allowed you to connect, set-up and communicate with an arduino-based ""home security system"" via bluetooth. I put it in quotes because it's not a real security system, just something that Microsoft wanted for a demo at one of it's conferences. Also I don't think there is any official record anywhere that I did a project involved with Microsoft, so I can't really try to make myself stand out by putting a fancy brand name in my CV either.

I have about 4-5 months until I have to start sending applications, and I would like to do something in those months that I could actually put on my CV. I have few ideas for personal projects which I could put up on github, but I really doubt those count for much. It's an issue of time really - there are many things that I can do to make myself a better programmer, but I only have time for some of those things and not all of them I can put on paper to make myself look like a good programmer when a recruiter is reading my CV in 30 seconds and then deciding whether to forward it to the interviewer. ""Read CLRS"" or ""Learned about concurrency"" is definitely useful, but not something you put on a CV :).

So my question is: How can I spend the next 4-5 months to enhance my CV enough to get to the interview stage of the application? If you're a recruiter, what would make you reconsider throwing a CV into the garbage if you see a mediocre GPA and no proper work experience?

P.S. I know some people will probably say that I should still apply for jobs or part-time jobs or something like that, but I don't really see that as an option because right now I have a good breadth of knowledge, but lack depth. The only two programming languages that I am moderately comfortable with are C and Java, and I am also currently studying Haskell. For C I know enough to be able to program a robot on two wheels (with some provided libraries) and with some sensors to explore a maze while mapping its location and then find the shortest path from beginning to the end and drive along it. For Java I know enough to make some very simplistic apps."
378gz1,34,2015-05-25,One Man's Opinion on Network Security as a Career,pegun,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/378gz1/one_mans_opinion_on_network_security_as_a_career/,"Reddit, let’s have a discussion on Network Security as a career.  There was a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3714v9/would_anyone_be_willing_to_talk_for_an/) the other day asking for information security professionals to respond back and ask questions of.  The questions essentially came down to ""how do I get into the Network security industry?""  This post is meant to be my opinions on the subject, and I welcome the community to chime in as well.  
  

**The Essentials**  
  

There is no single way you get into the network security industry.  The following is just my opinion based on my journey.  Network security, in my humble opinion, is typically a second step of the networking journey. The reason for that is you need to fully understand the protocols that the network runs over. My undergrad was computer science and the weakness I had was protocols weren't covered in as much depth as I needed to understand to be an expert in security.  I had to both get a graduate degree, and work in the industry for years before I was remotely qualified to be in the security area.  Now, that isn’t the tried and true path.  Many colleges offer networking as a major now, as opposed to having to get a computer science degree.  
  
That being said, no matter what major you take, you’ll need to learn some sort of programming language.  It doesn’t matter whether it’s BASH, C++, C#, Java, Python, VBScript, Power Script or any other.  The attacks that will be launched on your network will be script based in many cases, and you need to at least be able to look at a function, a structure, an algorithm, and be able to decipher bits and pieces of it so you can understand what you need to repair or prevent against.  The best class I actually took was a Programming Languages Translation course where the professor would put up the same structure in different languages to illustrate that the syntax was different, but the structure did the same thing in all cases.  This made programming interesting to me personally, and I despise programming even today.
  
Remember, the network needs to be secured, which means you need to *understand* the network and all the protocols that run over it before you can secure them.  Typically, network security isn't a ""straight out of college"" career for that reason, and you'll see seasoned professionals who worked in networking for 5, ten or more years before getting into the security arena.  This isn't the rule, and for those who go through a network security program in college like those offered at [RIT](http://nsa.rit.edu/), [RPI](http://rpis.ec/) and [University of North Carolina](http://cs.unc.edu/~fabian/intro-security.html) may go straight into a network security administration career, but I'd say it's not the overall norm and takes quite a bit of ambition.  

**What to Understand**  
  

What that all means is the first thing I would do if I wanted to get into network security early in career is to understand TCP and similar protocols (UDP, ICMP, etc). TCP permeates everything in the networking world. The [TCP/IP illustrated book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321336313/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1/179-2056854-9226221?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1QB1NAMTWFH7VFMDXWRD&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_p=1944687442&amp;pf_rd_i=0201633469) is great at doing this, along with [Routing TCP/IP](http://www.amazon.com/Routing-TCP-IP-1-2nd/dp/1587052024/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432568017&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tcp%2Fip+doyle) and are sworn on by most networking professionals. Combine that with experience in networking via gns3 or iol and you have your first step.  Again, understanding the routing and flow of the network, which you can get with these programs is essential.  You don't need physical equipment to start out with, and any of the Cisco certs you take will be virtual, so why not mimic what they are doing?  

Also remember that [data centers are hugely complex structures]( http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/streetview/) made up of layers and layers of security, as designed by seasoned professionals.  This means you’re not going to typically be doing cabling or focusing on who plugged what into your network.  While this does happen, and it needs to be prevented against with [configurations]( http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/port_sec.html) on [individual ports]( http://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos13.1/topics/example/port-security-configuring.html), you’re more going to be interested in data [flowing]( https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/cisco/cisco-openflow/) across your network, [correlation]( https://www.lancope.com/solutions/security-operations/network-visibility) of that [data]( http://www.forescout.com/solutions/agentless-visibility/).  Therefore, in your learning, you should focus on not only the routing above, but look into [Identity Services]( http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/identity-services-engine/index.html), [RADIUS]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS), Data Correlation, and [secure design]( http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise/design-zone-security/howto_40_webauthentication_dg.pdf).
  
**Daily Duties**  
  

The other thing you should remember is that network security isn't all about the hackers that you see on the news daily.  Most of the threat to your company's network is going to be [insiders.](https://www.lancope.com/blog/slic/insider-threats-part-1-%E2%80%93-who-attacking-your-network) [Partners, and insiders are your biggest threats.](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/06/it_attacks_insi.html)  Therefore, the biggest piece to network security is keeping policy current, ensuring devices are kept up to that policy, and if something does occur which is not prevented by policy, then knowing what steps to take. That means understanding your weaknesses, specifically those of the network and what protocols could be used to exploit it. The [most damaging attacks](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/protecting-insider-attacks-33168) are carried out by [insiders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Childs) or those with intimate knowledge of the network, our job is to understand the network well enough to prevent those insiders from taking advantage of those weaknesses. When the hacks you see on TV do occur, someone is getting [fired or forced out](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/05/08/targets-ceo-steps-down-following-the-massive-data-breach-and-canadian-debacle/). Your job is to prevent yourself or your coworkers from being blamed and proving you did your due diligence.
  
**Career Path**  
  

The biggest ask is how to get into the network security area.  In my experience, a college degree is on almost every recruiter’s basic checklist for this career.  I’ve known a number of people who go through the military or have alternate ways of getting into the industry, but this is the most common aspect that I see.  Do you need an Ivy League degree?  Hell no.  My undergrad is from a state school in Computer Science.  It saves a ton of money and gets your foot in the door.  
The next step is internships.  I HIGHLY recommend looking into internships for the summer or more.  Technology based schools will go so far as to require students to take 5 years to complete college so they can get a paid internship for a full year.  This says something, again, in my humble opinion.  I would start looking into these internships in high school if you have a local program that offers high schoolers the ability to intern with parent permission.  My company does this and we’ll have two lab interns this summer.  For those in college or without that ability, internships are best once you start taking classes in your major and find that you actually enjoy the material.  Doing it sooner may limit the exposure you have had to the technology, which some employers see as essential.  An internship is also a great way to build relationships and see what others do in the company that may be part of different teams.  Many employers use the internships to hire direct from colleges, which is why a little bit of background in the area you’re interning within can go a long way.  
  

Certifications.  This is a highly debated topic in this subreddit.  Directly from my manager: “I don’t care what certifications you have.  You need to know the material I need for that position and have the soft skills to talk to the customer.”  I would stand by this.  A paper CCNA or CCNP means nothing to me and I’ll interview them with or without the certifications.  The key is how far can I take you down a rabbit hole before you admit you don’t know something?  Then, how do you present yourself and how confident are you in presenting that correct information?  Certifications are great ways to learn the material, and I stick by my recommendation to consider looking into them to build out knowledge.  Certifications like CCNA, CCNA Security, JNCIA, CISSP, Security+, and Network+ are great to build basic knowledge.  That being said, if you’ve never applied it and can’t speak to the material in a real world scenario, you’re also not overly useful.  Therefore, consider getting the certifications while in your internship or in an area where you can apply the knowledge, rather than just learning theory.  
  

Hope this is useful to the community, feel free to chime in with your experiences.

So if anyone here can relate to the anxious and oblivious intern they may once have been- any help or words of wisdom would be appreciated!

Company laptop- if I am correct I will be getting one. Is this something I have to bring home and back to the office everyday, or can is it expected to be left at the office? Asking because I have a train ride but a somewhat long walk, so want to be prepared bag-wise. Also, do they provide laptop bags for you, or should I bring one with me the first day?

Full-time offers- Is this something you are expected to give a definitive answer to when (if) they offer you, or is it more of an apply when you graduate if you'd like then and we will accept sort of thing? What if you intern in two departments one after the other?

Business casual- seem to be slightly less casual though. Is a sheath dress too formal for the first day? What about heels? Can you tell I'm female? Does my coat/ jacket have to be business style also?

How soon should I expect another e-mail from them about the first day?

Any words of wisdom to do well?

EDIT: Bonus question, should I add people I meet from work on LinkedIn or is that a faux pas?"

work which is in a bar (However no benefits and PTO).  I understand for an entry level 

position I would not make as much as someone with more experience/Bachelors, however for 

the type of work I would be doing I feel the offer was a bit low.  I asked what I would 

be doing and I would first be starting off working on documentation of the software and 

getting to know the programs and then would begin coding and developing applications for 

them.  I have looked at various websites about starting pay/bottom percentile pay in the 

same field and experience and it seems be a good amount more than what I am being

378t17,13,2015-05-25,I feel hopeless [TW suicide],soundofperseverance_,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/378t17/i_feel_hopeless_tw_suicide/,"I have posted a post before this one on this subreddit. This subreddit has helped me with realizing so much, however, I still get feelings that maybe I'm the one who is insane or bratty. But reading from other people's experiences, I also feel as if my parents are the immature, toxic toddlers they are. 
At this point, I feel hopeless, I am 19 turning 20, I just moved back in from dorming from college, and I am beyond thankful to even dorm (for now) and I am halfway through college. I am also very glad I have a a huge scholarship. However, whenever I move back in I am struck with major depression and anxiety. At this point, I feel hopeless and I feel as if suicide is the only option I have to escape my nparents. I have no friends, and I get very annoyed when I go on social media such as facebook and instagram and I see all of my past friends or acquaintances having a great life. Yes I am aware that I shouldn't be going on these sites, because they're false glorifications and everyone has their own problems, however, my depression makes me feel as if I am the only one drowning and everyone else is able to breathe normally. I have no friends because I am extremely shy and I have a problem with trusting people, I have been bullied a lot all throughout my school years and sexually molested as well a year ago while I was a freshman in college. I only have my boyfriend at this point, and he is really great and sweet and supportive to me, but I really can't rely on him to have an excuse to leave the house and my nparents. Even my nfather hates me boyfriend, he doesn't want me having a boyfriend at all, however my mother is okay with our relationship. My nparents cause me great anxiety and distress, they constantly make me feel as if I should be guilty of existing. My father always criticizes me and is extremely negative and the world's biggest narcissist. He is a HUGE control freak, and no one is able to convince him at all. He controls me and my mother's finances, and wants order in the house. I feel as if I can't open up a bank account secretly and save up whatever money I have, because he is aware of my checks I receive from my jobs and does my taxes for me. I feel as if my heart races and jumps whenever he walks in the room. He wants me to do meaningless jobs at corporate settings even though I plan to do animation and special effects for my career, and I plan to use this summer as a way to build up my portfolio for future internships. However, he wants me to do filing jobs that aren't even paid and is constantly comparing me to his niece. I get straight A's in school, and he is never satisfied with anything I do. You get the gist. I would list more of the things he does to me, but it's way too much to fit. My mother is a parasite and is extremely dependent off me. She feels abuse from my father but she is a leech to me and I feel as if if I moved away, she won't be able to handle herself and possibly commit suicide. I am very vague with both my parents, and I am very quiet. 
So I feel as if suicide is the right choice for me. I cannot pay for my college tuition since I am financially dependent off my parents with everything, but I cannot even deal with them treating me like I'm still a toddler and taking out all their negativity on me. I cannot go out when my father's home, and I have a curfew of 7pm because they think I'm a slut and going to get raped. When I confront my mother about the abuse and trauma my father does to me, she says ""well deal with it"" I really would like to move out, but I am extremely terrified with even talking to my parents about anything because of the way they react, they react like little kids and start yelling even. I feel as if there is no hope at all anymore, I am so motivated and content when I am at school and I enjoy working, but once I live back here again, I really do not want to do anything with my life and I find myself thinking of all the possibilities of how I can improve my life. But I can't. Anything I think of seems like a dead end to me. I feel as if suicide is really the right choice, I find myself researching ways of killing myself and painless ways to die, even though there really is no painless way and there's the possibility of a failed attempt and me ending up with permanent damage. I just can't think of anything.. I really can't. I have no friends, I do not have relatives who can support me and a lot of them are aware of how my parents treat me but they simply don't care, I have a boyfriend who is willing to take me in if it comes to those circumstances but I would not accept that because he still lives with his parents, and my nparents control every aspect of my life. I want to die, I feel like I am dying everyday, I feel like I am suffocating and there's nothing I can do.
Frankly, I am tired of everyone including my therapist at school telling me to ""stay strong"". Yes I know that's pretty much the only thing I can do at this point at least until I graduate. Even so, I feel like I will be living with my nparents for a very long time because of the living expenses in nyc being so high and their unwillingness to let me go. 
I also cannot see my therapist during the summer because he is a school counselor and my father stigmatizes mental illness and sees it as a problem. My mother stopped going to her psychiatrist and went off meds because it's not ""natural"" she watches a lot of cnn and dr oz crap. She would impose her crazy views on myself, I definitely feel like I need medication."

All my projects were trash. I have zero experiences. Therefore, my resume is trash. CS has always been my life and soul, and it will continue to be.

In college, professor is treated with utmost respect, so I usually start with Dear Professor [last name], but given that I have been very casual with recruiters by addressing them with first names like ""Hi Thomas"" and that this is a tech company, I feel like starting any email with ""Dear ..."" is a bit overdoing it. Should I just address him with his first name as well?"
379wza,1,2015-05-25,Going Into Monk Mode; Have Some Questions.,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/379wza/going_into_monk_mode_have_some_questions/,"A few weeks ago, I finished my sophomore year of college as a computational math major with a 3.85 cumulative GPA. Right now is a perfect time for me to enter monk mode. I would like your guys' feedback as to what else I should take into account/consider during this summer.

Standing at 5'10"" and weighing only 135 pounds with muscle and a bit of stomach/lower body fat, I'm going to become as physically fit as I possibly can in this summer. For the first time in my life, I'm actually washing my face and taking care of my skin. Unfortunately, said skin is a golden-brown color because I'm half Native American/half white. Meditation is something I have also taken up because I operate like a boss when I do it in the morning before my day starts. As a way to take advantage of my voice and become more comfortable around people as communication is one of my weak points, I'm joining Toastmasters. Right now, I'm working a lame-ass crappy-ass fast-food job as a cook and to be honest, I'm quite embarrassed about it. So, I've decided that it is my goal to have a paid internship by next summer and am going to be doing whatever I can to make me and my resume stand out from the rest of the student body (that is a whole different topic that requires much more depth). I'm also going to be reading beginning RP books such as *How To Win Friends and Influence People* and *No More Mr. Nice Guy* so that I can not only work hard during this time period, but also learn how to have some fun and bond with other men. As a guy that grew up with a Beta/absent father, I believe that this would do wonders for me and my self-confidence. Finally, I have joined /r/NoFap because I have been suffering from a porn addiction for quite some time now. 

When it comes to the opposite sex, I feel as if my situation has become *worse than ever.* When I was 17, multiple girls were interested in me and some guys were even jealous of me because I was dating a ""hot chick."" Now that I'm 20, have more muscle mass/tone than ever, better posture and a better projecting voice, I haven't gotten a single IOI in over six months. When I'm in public, girls don't even look in my general direction and walk straight past me. I was at a party a few months ago and a few girls introduced themselves to me, but I gave them the cold shoulder because they most likely saw me as a potential sucker that would do their homework for them. During this summer, I have decided that I will not actively pursue chicks in hopes of getting my dick wet, but rather just get comfortable being around them and talking with them. Nothing sexual or flirty, just basic conversation crap. 

What else should I do during this summer of Monk Mode to maximize my SMV gains by the time the semester starts? "

We have since lost contact and I've been following catalyst athletics programs since.

My form is consistent but not perfect, and I'm reasonably strong for an 85kg lifter. 

I recently moved to a small town in the absolute middle of nowhere for an internship, and now only have access to am Anytime fitness. They've got a squat rack and plenty of plates; but when I talked to the owner about doing the full lifts he completely shut me down.

379xsx,2069,2015-05-25,This year [2015] in film should be an unforgettable one. Here's a list of 35 movies to be released in the upcoming months.,mookiebomber,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/379xsx/this_year_2015_in_film_should_be_an_unforgettable/,"Every year we see dozens upon dozens of films released. Lately -- the past four years to be exact -- we have seen some great years in film. 2015 looks to be no different from the previous years. I will list some of the films that I am hoping to see, and hopefully some more get added by some of you as well, I will continue to edit the thread if it has some success to be used as a guide for the year.
I see some great directors releasing films, some great actors as well, and hopefully we get a year of many, many Oscar-worthy films. I will write a brief thought for some of them to hype up their release as well.


1. [The Walk]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3488710/) (Robert Zemeckis): Zemeckis who directed the Back to the Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, Contact, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, etc. Brings us his version of the famous story of the french high-wire artist Philippe Petit, as he attempts to cross the Twin Towers back in the 1970s. ""Flight,"" was his last release in 2012.
2. [The Sea of Trees]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3450900) (Gus Van Sant): The man who directed Good Will Hunting, tells a story of a suicidal man (Matthew McConaughey) who travels to Aokigahara; the suicide forest.
3. [Everest]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2719848) (Baltasar Kormakur) A thriller starring the always underrated Jake Gyllenhaal based on the non-fiction book ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer. Think ""Into the Wild,"" but with Mt. Everest as the setting.
4. [Spectre]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713) (Sam Mendes) The man who brought us, ""American Beauty,"" and the greatest modern Bond;""Skyfall,"" will again direct a surely beautiful film.  
5. [Bridge of Spies]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3682448) (Steven Spielberg) Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg doing a thriller? If it's half of what ""Catch Me If You Can,"" was, then sign me up!
6. [Black Mass]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1355683) (Scott Cooper) the same Scott Cooper who directed ""Crazy Heart,"" that finally won Jeff Bridge's his oscar, now directs a biopic. The true story of Whitey Bulger. Who? I don't know either, but I can't wait to find out about him. Just looking at the cast, it will perhaps be a good one. Johnny Depp, Dakota Johnson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Juno Temple, etc.
7. [Love &amp; Mercy]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903657) (Bill Pohlad) I'm a huge Brian Wilson fan, and it is a biopic about him, so that's that.
8. [By the Sea]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3707106) (Angelina Jolie) Brad Pitt stars in a drama about a couple that travel France together in the 1970s. 
9. [The Revenant]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663202) (Alejandro González Iñárritu) Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio starring in a movie by the current holder of every Oscar. I will not skip this one.
10. [The Martian]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388) (Ridley Scott) You've seen [the pictures]( http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/first-look-matt-damon-as-an-astronaut-in-ridley-scotts-the-martian-20150523) and if you don't know anything about Ridley Scott, you might as well just take my word for it. He makes great movies.
11. [Self/less]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140379) (Tarsem Singh) I'm fascinated by the whole /r/singularity and /r/futurology thing. So here's a movie with a great story it seems, and it should explore some very interesting topics as well. It even starrs Ben Kingsley. This should be good.
12. [Snowden]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3774114) (Oliver Stone) A movie about Edward Snowden, starring Gordon-Levitt, and directed by Oliver Stone. I'm thinking a modern-day ""JFK;"" a political thriller that will answer a lot of questions for sure. 
13. [Joy]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2446980) (David O. Russell) Russell returns to his winning formula of Cooper, Lawrence and De Niro. This time he tells the story of a family that goes through four generations. Expect a huge successful drama with this one, and his always spectacular soundtracks. 
14. [Concussion]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322364) (Peter Landesman) Football is a great theme, and an NFL drama starring Will Smith, should be a blockbuster. Not to mention some of my favorite actors are in it; Albert Brooks, Alec Baldwin, Paul Reiser and Luke Wilson is rumored to play Roger Goodell. Sounds exciting.
15. [Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496) (J.J. Abrams) You can come up with a thought of your own for this one. 
16. [In the Heart of the Sea]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1390411) (Ron Howard) A biographical disaster drama-thriller in the 1820's. From the man who brought us ""Rush,"" as his last theatrical release. 
17. [Secret in their Eyes]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741273) (Billy Ray) A remake of the famous ritically acclaimed Argentine film [El Secreto de Sus Ojos]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305806). Oh if by the way you haven't seen it, please do. Ricardo Darín is splendid in it.
18. [Rock the Kasbah]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3164256) (Barry Levinson) Perhaps it won't be as great as some of the films listed, but it does have Bill Murray in it.  
19. [Steve Jobs]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374) (Danny Boyle) A very anticipated film, set to be released in October. Directed by the incredible Danny Boyle, it tells the story of Steve Jobs. Hopefully it does indeed tell his story in an honest, unmerciful way, that could make this movie very special if it does. It stars Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and a surprise casting of Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. If he pulls it off, he could get some love in the awards season. It is not often that we get to see Seth in a biopic drama.

20. [Pan]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3332064) (Joe Wright) A blockbuster, and a story that's been told in every decade it seems, so we'll see if Wright can take advantage of his cast and a great story.
21. [Adam Jones]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2503944) (John Wells) The cast attracts me, the story doesn't provide much; A chef assembles a crew together in an attempt to create the best restaurant ever, per IMDb;
22. [Sicario]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3397884) (Denis Villeneuve) The man who gave us ""Prisoners,"" tells a story of a carter hitman in a border town. It has Josh Brolin in it, and Benicio del Toro. It can be great.
23. [The Visit]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3567288) (M. Night Shyamalan) Hasn't really live-up to his Sixth Sense potential, but still, he deserves a mention in the list.
24. [Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381249) (Christopher McQuarie) Nothing more than a summer blockbuster film, but Tom Cruise is always very entertaining.
25. [The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1638355) (Guy Ritchie) Who doesn't love Snatch? Hopefully this one lives up to his older releases.
26. [No Escape]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1781922) (John Erick Dowdle)
27. [Trainwreck]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3152624) (Judd Apatow)
28. [Masterminds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2461150) (Jared Hess)
29. [Creed]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3076658) (Ryan Coogler)
30. [Crimson Peak]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2554274) (Guillermo del Toro) The other famous Mexican director has a movie this year as well. Hopefully it can become more than just a date-flick.
31. [Ricki and the Flash]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3623726) (Jonathan Demme) The director of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and the Oscar-magnet Meryl Streep working in a very unusual story of an aging musician who wants to be a rock and roll star? Surely it can't be that bad.
32. [The Gift]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4178092) (Joel Edgerton)
33. [Southpaw]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798684) (Antoine Fuqua) A boxing film by the man who once directed, ""Training Day."" It stars Jake Gylenhaal and Rachel McAdams.
34. [The Danish Girl]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810819) (Tm Hooper) Eddie Redmayne plays a man/woman Lili Elbe. This one is actually inspired by a true story, and it has oscar nomination written all over it for Redmayna again.
35. [Demolition]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172049) (Jean-Marc Vallée) Another film starring Jake Gyllenhaal, this time a drama, and directed by the same director of ""Dallas Buyers Club.""
36. [The Hateful Eight]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252) (Quentin Tarantino) The movie that was leaked. And no, it wasn't Snowden. Perhaps Mr. Orange? So the script is out, but the fans are still waiting for the actual film to be released.
37. [Jurassic World]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610) (Colin Trevorrow) Come on, who doesn't love the original? Steven Spielberg, directing one of the greatest American films ever. Using what it is perhaps the greatest CGI to date, and a film score for the ages. Those are some very big shoes to fill.
38. [Inside Out]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673) (Peter Docter, Ronaldo Del Carmen) A very ambitious story if you ask me. It can potentially work out as a very original and enjoyable family for all ages.
39. [The Good Dinosaur]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979388) (Peter Sohn)
40. [Triple Nine]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1712261) (John Hillcoat)
41. [The Intern]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2361509) A Nancy Meyers film you say? Sure, I respond. ""The Parent Trap,"" and ""The Holiday,"" are both great, timeless family movies. Will look forward to this one.
42. [Trumbo]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3203606) (Jay Roach)
43. [Carol]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402927) (Todd Haynes)
44. [Goosebumps]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051904) (Rob Letterman) Could be a great adventure movie for the young ones. 
45. [Straight Outta Compton]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1398426) (F. Gary Gray] The story of N.W.A. produced by Ice Cube, unfortunately he isn't featured in the cast. Hopefully we get a cameo.

Edit: Added #36 to #45. Thanks to /u/GamingTatertot /u/Dazed_Cactus /u/MarioMoon for the suggestions and the reminders. 


So those are the ~~35~~ 45 films that I am looking forward to, the most. I Can't wait to watch every last of them.

37a1e5,1,2015-05-25,I'm being emotionally abused and I'm sick of it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/37a1e5/im_being_emotionally_abused_and_im_sick_of_it/,"I've been with my current girlfriend for almost two years now, and the first 18 months I was the happiest I had ever been. We were long distance for the first 9 months when she went off to college and we stuck it out and I was lucky enough to get a full ride to the same school in film, I was through the moon happy. The summer she came back was the best of my life, we were both working but were so happy to have the time we had together, knowing that we would be together all the time come the school year. 1st semester everything was great, sure I was homesick a lot and she was too, but we had each other and we were happy.

I don't know when or why it started happening, but suddenly 2nd semester she was a completely different person. She was angry all the time, usually not at me, but without a good output for that anger suddenly a lot of it was coming towards me. I took it, because I know she has had anger issues in the past and I wanted to help, but suddenly I realize that I wasn't helping at all, I was only enabling her. It started with her just yelling at me from time to time, she would just yell her issues out at me and it was okay because in the end I thought it was getting better. Then it was the insults, she wouldn't just let out anger she would then turn insults towards me, calling me everything from a jerk to a useless piece of shit, you get the idea. There were nights where what she said would keep me up crying all night they hurt so bad, but for some reason I didn't leave or even try and talk to her about it, I just accepted it. I know the kind of person I am, I like to see other people happy, I always have put the needs of others ahead of my own and it never was an issue before. But now I look back on all of the times she's said these terrible things towards me, all of the times she has hit or slapped me when she was angry, all of the times where what she said has hurt more than anything else could, and I can't fucking believe I let myself get into this situation and let it happen like this.

She literally tries to control my life now, it was never like this before but now she tries to dictate who my friends should be, what I do on a day to day basis, and I've let her for some reason. My best friend since the 6th grade, the guy who I honestly could look at and say that he is the closest thing I've ever had to a brother? I haven't talked to him in 6 months because of her, I let her control me, because I thought love was sacrificing anything for someone, and it's ruining my life because I don't even know if my best friend for years even likes me anymore. I've been emotionally and (to a lesser extent) physically abused for a long time now, and the worst part is that I knew what was happening and I have done nothing to stop it. I want to, I know that it's better to be without her, it would be better for both of us probably because maybe then she would realize that there is something wrong with her that she needs help with too. I know all of this yet after every fight, every insult, I keep coming back to her. She's away for 3 months with an internship over 600 miles away and right now she doesn't want to talk to me because she's angry about something as usual, why am I still wanting to be with her? I've heard the stories before, I've read all about how I just need to do it and get it over with, and that I'll come out better for it, but *why* can't I sum up the willpower to do it? Maybe I just needed to let this out, maybe advice from people here can help who knows, I just want things to go back to the way they were before I was with her, where I had my group of friends and we were inseparable, where I could make my own decisions without factoring someone else's feelings into it. I am a good person, but lately I haven't been acting like one, to both friends and family, and I want them to be able to see that I'm still the good person I always was."

I will be moving to the netherlands this upcoming fall to start a masters degree in Computer Science. Previously I had completed my bachelors in Computer Science in the US, and fell in love with a lovely dutch woman who moved back to the NL which threw my life to another continent and country.

However, there isn't perfect happiness as I am now worried about job prospects in the Netherlands. In the US I had a very hard time, not only personally, but with finding internships as an international students. I found many business in the midwest were not so receptive to foreigners, among other things...

So my question for all of you is; What can I do now to increase my chances of obtaining an intership/work during the summer months, and after I graduate?

(lengthy post),ManicMoney,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/37a7qm/was_it_a_good_idea_lengthy_post/,"I'm a 30 year old male, high school dropout. I have one kid,and an SO, who helps me out with EVERYTHING. I've been working in retail ever since  I was 22, yet I've never made more than 10.55 an hour.  I was pretty bad with money, decision making, thinking, hell everything in my twenties. I wasn't disciplined enough to save a dime, and ended up with $5,800 in credit card debt that has now been in collections for almost two years. About 3 years into my stint with retail, after finally getting promoted, I came to the conclusion that I absolutely hated it. I ended up getting my GED at 24, enrolled in community college and found out that school was easy relative to actual life.  My GPA was stellar, and after 3 years I was given the opportunity to transfer to a state school with a major in Accounting. I've already taken out loans, to the tune of about $13,000.  After this next year, I should be around $25,000 in student loans. I have one year and 7 months until graduation. I estimate that I will come out of college with about $30,000 in loans, which is extremely high for the small amount of time I have spent at the state school, I know.  The job prospects are wonderful for my major though, and the odds are that I will at least start at around $40,000 a year. To be honest, if I were to stay in retail I would have topped out at around $40,000 a year, miserable and bitter, now even more so after seeing that 22 year old interns make double what I make after 10 years of work. With this Degree I feel like my opportunities are a bit better, even at my age. I want the opinions of you all though, who seem much more successful than me. Was it a good idea to go back to school?  In your opinion, even with ten years less of return potential, is the ROI worth it?"

I currently know the basics on classes, inheritance, objects, and etc. in C++, javascript, php, and soon to be Ruby. I'm specializing in JS and have already completed the codecademy JQuery course and am currently going through the same thing but on CodeSchool as that also covers AJAX stuff (I've already learned about DOM Traversal as well). Soon I'll be moving onto Angular and other frameworks (see the CodeSchool javascript path, that is what I'm going through) and then Node hopefully by the end of the summer. Assuming I'm able to complete everything by then, will I have sufficient knowledge to apply for an entry level position? Also I'll be looking for a summer job soon, would my current knowledge suffice?

Any suggestions on how to speed up my progress would be greatly appreciated as I know being on the job will make me a much better dev.

Thanks!"
37argn,6,2015-05-26,Computer science program.,Throwaway49708,CalPoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/37argn/computer_science_program/,"Hi, I will be a freshman in the fall, and I'm looking into the program in which I'll study. I read the following on College Confidential regarding the program. 
&gt;""I'm a parent of a Cal Poly CS student who is finishing his third year. I'm also a CS Engineering Director with 30 years experience, so I think I am in a good position to evaluate the Cal Poly CS program. It is a state of the art program ... for 1995. The Cal Poly CS student *will* work his/her ass off, but so what if the material that they are learning is out of date? I know Cal Poly CS has a huge reputation, supposedly because the CS grads make more money than grads of any other college, except for Berkeley. Based on what I have seen of the program, I am not impressed. I would hire a Cal Poly grad just because they have to be extremely smart and hard working to get through the program, but I know they would require *a lot* of training so they can be useful in today's CS world.

&gt;Let me be more specific.

&gt;ASAIK, no CS student is taught anything about web programming. I think even in SLO they must have the internet, yes? But, no Python, Ruby, web architecture, nothing. Why isn't Python taught in every intro class, like at Berkeley. At Cal Poly, you get to learn Dr. Racket, a LISP derivative. Hello 1985?

&gt;And, don't point to the catalog which lists all these cool courses - they are not taught! They don't have the talent.

&gt;In the hellish 357 class, there is a big emphasis in writing code in the minimum number of lines and saving a few bytes of memory. Great stuff when computers had only 1 MB of memory, but I think we have moved past that. No emphasis on code being readable and maintainable, which is what the real world is all about.

&gt;How about the networking class, where the students have to write program after program based on incomplete specifications? The students gets to spend hour after hour trying to guess what the spec is - now how is that like the real world? Oh well, in the 1995 world networks are not all that important, so I guess it is ok if we do not teach them very well.

&gt;To top it off, my son is actually doing well in these classes, but he has not been able to find an internship. I'm starting to get skeptical that the Cal Poly reputation is really all that it is supposed to be, and maybe for the reasons I have mentioned here.

&gt;I spoke to the Dept Chair about my complaints, and he said that the root of the problem is that it is difficult to attract talent to a sleepy little town in the middle of nowhere. I don't care, I'm not impressed. This is not acceptable.

&gt;No rant about Cal Poly would be complete without mentioning the highly stupid registration system, which gives freshmen the same priority as seniors for access to the classes. There is nothing like going term after term and not getting your class because you are just not high enough in the registration rotation. No wonder why virtually no one graduates from Cal Poly Engineering in 4 years!

&gt;I would love to hear from parents whose students are in CS programs in other universities. Tell me the other programs suck so I don't feel so bad!"" 

Could those familiar with the computer science program at Cal Poly give some light to this?

Today is my first day.",tortoisefeasor,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/37axtk/rant_constant_crushing_anxiety_about_my_upcoming/,"I've been ""hired"" to work as an unpaid intern for college credit, and ever since the hiring process began (which has taken about a month), I've been pretty much unable to even think about anything besides (what I think of as) my impending doom. It's the second job I've ever had, the first job that will require me to exercise a specific skill I'm supposed to have (IT work), and I'm worried sick about how it will go.

I've been having that feeling where I can hardly even care about anything that's going to happen *after* my first day on the job, because I feel as if I'm more or less going to be annihilated one way or another. I'm not at all confident about my ability to do the job (and I don't think that's just me being negative -- I really do suspect I'm unqualified), I'm not even clear on what the job *involves*, I have severe social anxiety that's going to make it difficult and embarrassing to interact with people on the job, and it's just generally hard to envision this going any other way than terribly. I'm afraid that my first day will end with me having a panic attack, running home, and never showing my face anywhere ever again.

I'm trying to take solace in the fact that it's an unpaid position and so expectations can't be astronomically high, trying to remind myself that I'm not in any actual physical danger and that anxiety itself is my number one enemy here as usual, and trying to encourage myself to view this job as one small part of my otherwise happy existence, but I can't seem to stop being consumed with anxiety and having this feeling like I'm about to go to my execution. The best I can hope is that that feeling will subside after the first day, but I don't cope well with having to go in to work on a daily basis and I'm afraid I'll only feel more and more consumed by it.

I'm going there in five hours from now and I really don't know what I can do at this point besides deep breaths. I'll come back here later and report how it went, assuming I miraculously haven't been eaten by wolves. Thanks for reading my rant.

**UPDATE:** Thanks so much to everyone who's posted support. I didn't get incredibly anxious when I got there, somehow; I think being sleep-deprived from staying up all night out of anxiety might have had something to do with it. It seems like a very low-pressure job so far, and at this point I'm mostly worried about not being able to find anything to do for six hours a day. Having to go in every day is scary to me, but it's good practice for being a functional member of society, so I'm going to do my best to bite the bullet. I'm still worried that things will take a turn for the worse, but one day at a time."
37ay36,1,2015-05-26,I [20F] need help dealing with my bf's [19M] mom and her irrational disapproval of me,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37ay36/i_20f_need_help_dealing_with_my_bfs_19m_mom_and/,"Long story warning! Also, this is a throwaway.

TL;DR: My bf's mom doesn't approve of me but there's no reason for it. We just Skyped and she got upset that he was talking to me and I don't know if I can handle it anymore.

Backstory: I met my boyfriend almost 2 years ago in a class our freshman year of college. He was dating a girl at the time who was really close with his mom. I think she saw/sees this girl as her own daughter. My bf is an only child and his father passed away while he was in middle school so it's just him and his mom. He and this girl broke up last May (2014) after almost 3 years together. His mom was pretty nasty to him about the breakup even though he did nothing to warrant that treatment. He was pretty close with his mom before this breakup, so it was really strange. It became clear that she didn't like me or approve of our friendship (we were best friends by that point). My family lives across the country from him so when the spring semester was over, I didn't see him again until the fall.

Come fall of 2014, we were back at school so we started hanging out more than ever. We slowly started to fall for each other and in November we became a couple. We've been together for 6 months now and we couldn't be happier. I love him to the moon and back and would give anything for him. However, his mother is still an issue. It looked like things were getting better for a while but tonight just crushed all hope of that. 

We were Skyping and I noticed he was a little off and he seemed to be in a bad mood after a bit. Turns out his mom had come in and was upset that we were chatting. We both got upset and he started apologizing and I was reassuring him that it wasn't his fault (because it isn't, at all). After a little bit, he said he had to go to bed because he has to get up to go to work in the morning and he just wanted today to be over and that's when I started crying. We hung up but now I don't know what to do.

I cannot take this any more. This woman is just making it so much harder for us. I did *nothing* wrong. Absolutely nothing. And neither did he. I don't know why she hates me so much. She's met me once. I am at a loss and don't know what to do because this is upsetting him and that upsets me. I love him to death. But why is she doing this? What can I do to cope? I have a history of depression but I move around a lot (I see a counselor at school but I'm home at the moment and won't be back at school until August and I have an internship in another location in between) and this isn't helping.

This is my first relationship and I've never dealt with this before. My friends' parents all like me (they've also met me more than once). I'm definitely far from perfect, but I'm pretty straight-laced, I'm a good student, and I don't get in trouble. I love my boyfriend more than anything and we have a great relationship and really good communication. I don't want to tell him how much this is really bothering me because he'll feel bad and that's the last thing he needs and the last thing I want for him.

Back: http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a209/casey0818/image%203_zpswc8hq4dr.jpg

I’m a 22 year-old female and I’ve been living with a seemingly unidentifiable skin problem for over a decade. I’ve lived in the state of Nevada for a majority of my life, and for reference, I’m 5’4”, roughly 115 pounds, identify as Asian and Caucasian, and I’ve always lived a rather active lifestyle. As a young adult, I cycle daily, dance in a studio several times a week, and I’m currently training to run a marathon. Additionally, my diet has seemed to be relatively consistent and balanced over the course of my college career. I rarely consume alcohol (0-2 drinks a month since turning 21) and I don’t utilize any recreational drugs or smoke.  On my Father’s side of the family, there’s a history of gout, whereas on my Mother’s side, there’s a history of high blood pressure.

As a second grader (age 6-7), I can recall an instance when I was sitting in the restroom and I was overcome with an immense amount of irritation along my left labia. I began to scratch at it profusely, and this behavior would continue for several weeks. After roughly a month, the pain and irritation had seemingly passed, without any medicines or treatment. 

As a fifth grader (age 9-10), an irritation began beneath my navel. At the time, it seemed to have been caused by excessive sweating over the summer, but the irritation continued into the fall season. As a result, I would scratch at the area as I would sweat or while I slept, which left the skin raw and eventually scabbed over. Over the next year, the irritation would progress from my stomach to my arms, prompted by a prickling feeling that tingled as if bugs were crawling beneath my skin (just the sensation, I didn’t actually believe there were bugs under the skin). Uncertain as to what was causing the irritation, I went to my Mother for help, who believed that this irritation was caused by the cheap metals used in my belts and bracelets. After eliminating these items from my wardrobe, my Mother suggested that I applied Celestone G Cream (containing Betamethasone) in small doses to the affected areas, which helped sooth and reduced the irritation. 

Just when the irritation across my navel and arms seemed to have subsided in the sixth grade (age 10-11), I began to experience episodes where one or both of my labia would swell, accompanied with an impulse to scratch around them. Each episode would last anywhere from 2-7 days, and they would occur at random from the fifth grade, all the way until the eleventh grade (age 15-16).

Meanwhile, a similar irritation that I experienced across my navel and arms returned to me as an eighth grader (age 12-13). The same prickling sensation returned to me, but this time, both of my legs were affected. I would wake up throughout the night scratching at them, and would subconsciously scratch at them throughout the day, too. When viewed by my parents, they would tell me to, “stop scratching,” but I didn’t understand what was causing the sensation or irritation. From middle school and all the way through high school, this same sensation would move from my legs, to my rump, and eventually under my armpits. From what I can recall, a rash was never present before the itching; rather, visible irritation would become present only after I would begin scratching at the affected areas.

Towards the end of my high school career, I began to consider what could have been the cause of my irritation, and I had led myself to believe that it was eczema. While I identified that most of my irritation was caused by a prickling sensation, the symptoms seemed to have intensified whenever I was stressed, as the seasons changed, or when I moved from a relatively warm environment into a cold environment, or vice versa.

I began college in the same city I grew up in, and I also lived primarily at home, so my environment remained the same during this next chapter of my life. At the beginning of my freshman year in college (age 17-18), all of the skin irritation I had experienced throughout middle and high school had seemed to have come to an end by the winter season. I wouldn’t have another impulse to scratch my body profusely again, until the end of my Sophomore year. 

At the end of my Sophomore year (age 19), I noticed that my underarms and back had become overwhelmingly itchy. The same patterns that I had experienced as a child and teenager began to return, as I felt a prickling sensation beneath the skin that prompted subconscious scratching of the affected areas throughout the day and even in my sleep. With the ability to see a physician without my parent’s consent, I visited my campus’ health center to help identify the cause of this irritation. The first physician who saw me prescribed me a Triamcinolone 0.1% Cream for sparse use and referred me to the campus’ dermatologist for further investigation. When meeting with the campus dermatologist, he softly removed a sample of dry skin cells from one of the affected areas and viewed it under a microscope. He assured me that what I was experiencing was neither eczema, an infection, or a disease, but rather caused by an irritant that I was either applying directly to the skin, or I was living amongst in the household. As a result, I brought every product I had used in the household--ranging from shampoos, lotions, soaps, detergents, etc.--to him and asked for his guidance to determine which products were recommended for my sensitive skin. After eliminating a majority of the products, I relied heavily on Dove sensitive skin products (soap bar), as well as Aveeno products (lotion). 

During the summer between my Sophomore and Junior year, I studied abroad in Italy, which was a much more humid environment then I was acclimated to. With a reduced pool of hygiene products and a new environment, the visible irritation began to clear. After a month in Italy, my roommate began to notice that I would scratch in my sleep. Over the next few weeks, I had fought with my skin, as the prickling sensation that felt as if it were beneath the skin returned across my back and beneath my underarms. 

After living in Italy for two months and returning to the state of Nevada for my Junior year (age 19-20), the scratching and irritation had begun to settle. I had little to no irritation throughout the winter and early spring, but in the summer between my Junior and Senior year, I had moved into my campus’ residence halls as a staff member for a summer program. Within the first two weeks, I began to feel a surge of prickling from beneath the skin of my back that prompted me to scratch at it throughout the day and even in my sleep, and for the first time, my eyelids also became irritated, swollen, dry, and flaky. I visited the campus’ dermatologist again, in which the products I was using were reevaluated, and I began to transition from Dove and Aveeno products to Vanicream (soap and lotion) and Hydrocortisone (ointment). I was also provided a Kenalog shot that seemed to have reverted all of the irritation present across my body, but this was a temporary fix to an ongoing issue, as the irritation on my skin returned within a month.

When returning to the same dermatologist a few weeks later, I expressed how the Vanicream and Hydrocortisone products were providing more relief to my irritated skin than anything had before, but they didn’t eliminate the prickling sensation that I felt across my back and underarms. At this point, the dermatologist told me that there were no other solutions he had in mind, and at best, he suggested another Kenalog shot. I politely declined the recommendation and haven’t been back to see him since.

After spending the summer living in one of my campus’ residence halls, I moved back home for my Senior year (age 20-21). Over the course of this year, I noticed that not only did the prickling sensation under my skin come and go, but my skin began to dry out immensely--especially beneath my underarms and across my back. The skin seemed to have become more dry than it was irritated, which led my scratching to be caused less by the prickling sensation beneath the skin, and more so as a result of the dryness, especially throughout my sleep. I began to apply larger quantities of Hydrocortisone ointment throughout the day, but this seemed to have been counterproductive, as it didn’t heal the affected areas; rather, it kept the irritation at the same intensity.

I spent the following summer, between my Senior and “Super” Senior year of college back in the residence halls as a staff member for the same program as the previous summer, and similarly, my eyelids and back became irritated once again. Experimenting, I strayed from using the Vanicream line altogether, and began to shower with water alone, and moisturized afterwards in Hydrocortisone ointment. As a result, my back began to clear up slightly, but not by much. 

In the fall of my “Super” Senior year (age 21-22), I relocated from Nevada to Florida for a four-month internship opportunity. Similar to my time in Italy, my skin had become remarkably clearer in the first month of being in a much more humid environment, but then it began to backfire the worst it’s ever been. The irritation in my skin had seemed to have been prompted by both its dryness and a prickling feeling beneath the skin. I began to experiment with products such as Free&amp;Clear, Aquaphor, and Lubriderm, all in which seemed to irritate the skin even more; the irritation continued to spread from my back, to my legs, across my arms, on my neck, and in small patches across my chest. On my back, the skin was broken to the point that it was scabbing and scarring, whereas all of the other areas were blotchy, the skin appeared to have raised, and the were hot to the touch.

When I returned home for my last semester in college (age 22), I began to consider that maybe all of the irritation I’ve been prompted with over the years haven’t been a result of a product or my environment, but maybe it was a result of an internal issue. I began to brainstorm life-events that may have prompted my initial irritation as a child, and realized that my parents began their separation when I was a second grader and finalized it when I was in the fifth grade. I also realized that as a result, my diet had changed, as I lived between my Mother and Father’s houses on select days of the week. I also began to experience menstrual cycles in the fifth grade and on my way into sixth grade, a puppy was brought into one of my households.

Upon returning home, I also began to incorporate Goldbond's non-scented lotion into my daily routine, as well as Gaia Baby Organic's 2-in-1 lavender shampoo and soap. 

During this past April, I visited my campus’ health center again and I requested a full blood count to be completed, to see if a deficiency may have been the cause of my discomfort. The blood sample was taken after a 12-hour period of fasting, and upon receiving my results, everything was within their respective ranges, with the exception of my BUN/Creatinine Ratio that was a smidge higher at 23.8 and my Hematocrit that was slightly higher at 45.5%. The physician reassured me that neither of these areas were alarming, nor would they be the cause of my skin discomfort. 

When prompted by the physician to see the campus’ dermatologist again, I politely declined due to my previous experiences with him. In turn, the physician had referred me to a dermatologist in my community, and also asked me to see the campus’ psychiatrist and counselor, as I’ve been experiencing this discomfort for such a long period of time. I also began to consider seeing an allergist as well, since I’ve never been tested for allergies but rather have experienced them (consuming bell peppers make my eyelids and lips swell), which my physician supports, but I was encouraged to meet with my new dermatologist prior to pursuing it.

Soon after, I returned abruptly for an appointment with this same physician, as my hands and ears were overcome with an immense amount of irritation, and large amounts of dandruff began to appear from my scalp--which were alarming as these areas have never been affected before--but he too had no other suggestions for me other than meeting with my new dermatologist.

My appointment to see the health center’s counselor is coming up in a few weeks, but I had just recently met with the campus psychiatrist a few days ago. After sharing my thoughts about my skin irritation, the potential causes of it, and the reasons why I scratch the affected areas, the psychiatrist agreed that my irritation doesn’t seem to be driven by a psychiatric reason, but to see if it helps, I’ve been prescribed a 30-day supply of Prozac (10 mg capsules, one per day). I’m to meet with the psychiatrist in a few weeks to see if the medication is helping and to see if this skin condition is linked to my mental state of being, but so far my itching has intensified across my arms, face, ears, and upper thighs, to the point that I’ve woken up in the middle of the night from scratching so hard. I’ve tried to sleep with gloves on, but I tend to subconsciously take them off as I’ve slept. I’ve also been keeping a diary of the side-effects the medication has prompted me with, and I’m planning to reach out to the psychiatrist and see if I should continue using the medication.

After scheduling an appointment with the dermatologist I was referred to, I was informed that the soonest I’ll be able to be admitted is this coming September. With this skin condition becoming progressively worse, I’m a little uncertain as to what other options I may have for further investigation in the meantime.

When considering each of these experiences and attempting to research my symptoms and tendencies, I have a few theories as to what may have caused all of this discomfort over the years:

*1.* An uncommon allergy to an environmental consideration, such as the sun. I used to wear sunblock (banana boat spf 30) on a daily basis throughout college, as I spend a good amount of time outside everyday, but ever since my skin irritation has peaked, my skin will become inflamed and stings immensely if I apply it. If I'm out in the sun for too long, my skin appears to raise up in red blotches, until I have a chance to soothe it with lotions, ointment, or a cold wash.

*2.* The possibility that my skin may be so damaged from years of scratching and irritation that it may be experiencing it’s own version of tinnitus, where negative messages are being sent from the skin, to the brain. I think this is a good description as to how the prickling, bug crawling sensation beneath the skin feels like, but I haven’t come across anything online or in books that reinforces this as a possibility.

*3.* The possibility that this could be caused by an abundance of yeast. When I was meeting with my physician, I remember the topic of yeast was briefly brought up, but it was dismissed immediately. I’m a little fixed on this as a possibility though, as my initial irritation as a second grader was along my left labia and returned in episodes throughout my childhood. I’m not certain if it was necessarily a yeast infection, as I was so young when it occurred and I didn’t feel inclined to ask for help or treatment, but the symptoms seem to have aligned. After reading more about untreated or reoccurring instances of yeast infections, I noticed some of the common “symptoms” consisted of unexplainable itching across the body, dandruff, and cravings for breads and sweets. What’s funny is I have a huge sweet tooth (especially for ice cream!) and my favorite food is bread, which reinforces the latter. Additionally, it seemed as if when I lived in Italy and Florida, which were rather humid environments, my skin felt soothed throughout the initial month of my stay, but reverted at full force thereafter. Could it be possible that this humidity reinforced the “yeast” (if this is the case) and encouraged it to develop more rapidly? I’m a little skeptical though, as my physician dismissed this immediately and when viewing my full blood count test, immunoglobulins weren’t included, only globulin, which read at 3.0 g/dL and was considered in range.

I feel as if I’m a bit in limbo, where I’m waiting to see my new dermatologist, considering having an allergy test taken before I’m recommended to, experimenting possibilities with a psychiatrist, and will soon be visiting a counselor to discuss all of this with. Just to reiterate, I didn’t begin to seek treatment for this condition until college, as my skin irritation had seemed to have settled down. As it reappeared and escalated throughout the latter years of my college career, I’ve been proactive to find out what exactly I’m experiencing. I’m posting this in hopes that maybe someone can identify these symptoms to a certain condition, or maybe reassure me that one of my theories may be a step in the right direction.

For the past 1 year and nearly 4 months I've been apart from my so. And it has been unbearable. Truly. 
She was able to visit me a couple of times last year (I live in Portugal) and this year, I've been to her place (UK) two times, roughly 2 weeks in total. But the sorrow just keeps increasing and increasing. 

I currently live and work in Portugal and I'm taking my Master's degree, which prevents me from getting together with her. And she has a full time job as a nurse. Also, I couldn't simply get on a plane without having something solid (job related).

But, sigh... everything reminds me of her and I'm afraid that we are not what we used to be... Skype doesn't help anymore, but we text a lot and talk on the phone, which is ok... It just kills me to think of the possibility that I might loose her and everything we've built so far and ultimately, I was one of the people who encouraged her to leave the country (she's also Portuguese).

After 6 years of relationship, I know that we can be happy together. But we need the together part... 

Currently I'm waiting on an internship opportunity that I may undertake after I'm finished with my master's (if this happens, it will be only in November and I haven't got a confirmation yet). But the waiting is so hard... being away from her all this time...

Anyway, was just hoping some of you could share some of your stories with me to try and make feel better/motivated. And yes, I do love her, with all my heart.

Wanted to upgrade and now the prices of my desired hardware went up.",lmaodude,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/37blgt/brothers_i_need_strength_wanted_to_upgrade_and/,"So I did a paid internship and I have finished by now. I want to use my last payment to upgrade to an 970GTX and a SSD. I've constantly checked on prices while I waited for my paycheck (you know that feeling I guess). For me It's the perfect moment to buy right now. You get two games for free with a 970gtx and theres a cashback promotion by ASUS where you get 35€. So the SSD (850 Evo 500gb) and the graphics card would cost me about 500€ after the cashback. Which is pretty nice and leaves me with a bit of my payment for other fun stuff (don't forget to go outside guys ;) ). Well today I received my paycheck and I thought I'll finally be able to purchase the goods. Jut another note: the game-key promo expires on 1th june. So... today I wanted to make my order and suddenly the SSD is 40€ more expensive and the strix is 10€ more expensive. So even with the cashback I would pay more than I would've paid before the prices went up. That sucks... I don't know if I should wait or not. I really want the witcher promo key. It's a 40€ game... on the other hand I think the key goes pretty cheap on ebay right now. Ahhh I'm just so annoyed right now :(  
That's me: http://i.giphy.com/GN14ap4Mx3Ko0.gif

So yeah. I just wanted to vent a bit. I guess many of you have been there. I'll just check price comparisons the whole day and hope that the prices drop off again :("

I will lay some background before I get to my question. My brother and I both attend a private in state University. At the University we both receive the same financial aid, which accounts for ~50% of the cost to attend. I am currently entering my senior year, he is entering his junior year. 

This so far I understand, but here come the NJ Tag. This year he will be receiving about 10k to go towards his tuition and I receive nothing. Two years ago I had internships where I was paid around 30k over an 8 month period, he has never done an internship. Last year neither of us did an internship. I am currently working part time and will be making a total of 20k for the year, I have earned about 12k of that so far. 

Is my internship hurting my NJ Tag candidacy? 

Which fiscal year does the Tag get calculated on?"

The needles in the bath towels, the wine bottles hidden everywhere. Every single day I remember the complete disregard you had for our safety because you were hurting. You took that hurt out on us.

The way to get by was to tell myself that nobody was right and nobody was wrong. I was telling myself that I forgive everything that happened between us and every sleepless night I spent sleeping with my sisters, or outside your room, to keep them safe from you and your meathead of a new husband. I bruised. I lied. I called the police. I never got anywhere because they wouldn't come. I never thought they wouldn't care about 3 children in your hands.

Now i'm living. I have an internship, my life can start so soon. I still come over because I have nowhere else to go. Your phone buzzes sometimes when it's late. I never touched it before today... I wish I hadn't.

You're still a cheater. You still abuse the drugs you went to rehab for. You never changed, Mom. I can't even think straight. I saw all of the messages between you and him, and it's almost funny how much you bring him up and try to tell me how disgusting he is. I deleted the messages because you deserve to know that someone is onto you. I'm not letting you do this to yourself again, Mom. I'll never let you. You have worked so hard to be where you are. I know your new husband surprises you with thousands of dollars due tomorrow almost every month... I know that everything is so hard for you right now mom... please don't do this. I won't hate you, but it's so hard to agree that you're doing anything right right now."
37bupl,6,2015-05-26,"Had surgeries for health problems after graduation, now it's been 3 years and I still don't have a job. Really don't know where to start.",throwaway93247297293,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/37bupl/had_surgeries_for_health_problems_after/,"After I graduated, I had two surgeries about a year apart, and recovered from my health problems completely. Now it's been a total of about 3 years since I graduated and I don't really know how to go about finding a job, or making myself desirable to a company. I graduated in CS, but I felt that I could get better advice on my situation here than on /r/cscareerquestions.

Pluses:

* I graduated with a good GPA (B.S in computer science).
* I had an internship with a large, reputable company the summer before I graduated.

Minuses:

* 3 year gap after graduation.
* I haven't done many projects in my downtime (which is somewhat important for CS jobs).
* I haven't spoken to any of my former employers/supervisors since I worked for them.
* My parents' house (where I'm living) is pretty noisy (from external factors like construction, neighbors' dogs), so I'm a little worried a phone interview might get interrupted or make it difficult to hear the interviewer.

Questions: 

1) How should I explain my post-graduation employment gap? I feel like if I mention surgery straight away, it is a heavy subject and can turn off the interviewer, or give them the idea that I might be a liability even though I'm fully recovered.

2) What's the ""right"" way to go about asking my old employers for a reference? I haven't spoken to my internship supervisor or manager since my internship finished (in 2012), but the internship ended on great terms. I also have had two other jobs even more distant in the past (one during the previous summer, and one as a TA for a quarter at college, both in 2011), but I haven't spoken to them since I stopped working for them, either.

3) What other advice can you give me?

Sorry my post is kind of long. I've really been putting off finding a job and I'm sure my parents are sick of me by now, but I could really use some advice. Thanks!"

37c689,84,2015-05-26,How much do employers judge you based on your physical appearance?,Pictocheat,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/37c689/how_much_do_employers_judge_you_based_on_your/,"Not sure if this is exactly the right subreddit for this, but since a lot of people post here about self-esteem issues due to weight or overall appearance, I figure you guys might be able to help me.  I'm currently in graduate school for Professional Applied and Computational Mathematics, and one of the requirements to graduate is to do an internship.  I've gotten two interviews so far but have been turned down from both of them due to other interviewees being ""more qualified"".  I can't really do anything about my work experience since the internship is where that experience will be coming from, but I'm wondering if they would make judgments based on my appearance.

I am not obese, but I do have a bit of a gut (probably can't tell unless I'm not wearing a shirt, though).  Otherwise, I'm rather skinny.  I barely have any muscle because I don't like exercising that much, although I'm contemplating getting a gym membership this summer to fix these issues if it would help improve my chances of getting a position (or at the very least, to do SOMETHING productive besides sitting at home playing video games all day).  I also have frequent acne breakouts on my face, but I'm trying to be more hygienic to hopefully mitigate them (I could use treatments like Proactiv, but they're really tedious to use and I don't like having stuff on my face in general).

Basically, I'm worried potential employers will infer that if I don't care about my physical appearance, then I won't care about performing the job I'm applying for either.  Though honestly, i can't say I do care much about my appearance other than what's necessary to make it in the world these days.  I know experience and good social skills/confidence are probably more significant when it comes to netting a business position, but if I can improve my chances by taking better care of myself physically, there's no reason not to try doing so.  What do you suggest?"
37c695,6,2015-05-26,Schedules issues and inevitable procrastination,gabzmartz,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/37c695/schedules_issues_and_inevitable_procrastination/,"Hi! I'm new around here. Got to make the Myers-Briggs test yesterday and it was overwhelming to read a detail by detail description of myself when I got INFP as a result. And I'm also Venezuelan. I consider myself sort of fluent in spoken English, but I can fail a lot in my writing so feel free to correct me nicely if you spot any mistake.

But my main topic right now would be my inability to cope with schedules.

I am a college student majoring in Sociology with a minor in Marketing, and I truly love my career, except for when it comes to doing research workshops because I can't possibly cope with the rythm they try to put upon us. And honestly I don't know how I've been able to keep up with Sociology School so far, because each day I'm less motivated to keep on the attending class and delivering homeworks in time thing, even if I love the topic I have to work on, it's hard to keep myself concentrated enough to finish one thing.

It really horrifies me because I know I can still delay my grad a year more and no one will mind over here, but I don't know if I'll be able to keep it up in a full work schedule. I've worked half-time as a community manager before and I had the hell of a time coping with my control-freak boss who wanted me to prepare everything with weeks in advance so she could check everything. Monthly reports were hell for me. I managed to get her to trust me more and stop asking me for showing her stuff in advance as I proved to be efficient by working on my own rythm and by my own judgement, but in the end she told me she still was frustrated with me because I couldn't work like a ""normal"" person. So if it was with a half-time sorta hobby-ish thing, I don't know how will it be when it comes to my Internships or my full-time job after I graduate.

The thing is that... is it only me or are more INFP having a real trouble dealing with doing things in time and sticking to chronograms and schedules? Does it affect your everyday life? Have you been able to put it under control and stick to the very necessary ammount of scheduling without going crazy?"

37c868,1,2015-05-26,on being single,[deleted],gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/37c868/on_being_single/,"hi. first of all i am writing this here because of the anonymity; i hate to admit, although i guess the other person knows, that i have fallen hopelessly in love with another person, who is 6 years my junior. you have a very remote chance of knowing me and i'm fine with that.

my name is eriond. i'm 27 and i'm gay. i have never been in a relationship before because as high school taught me, i am not that attractive. obviously i have self confidence issues but that, i think, is a story for another time.

where to begin? oh right i was telling you how i have never been in a relationship before. well that is not entirely accurate; i have had a girlfriend before but never a boyfriend. so there i haven't had a boyfriend before.

even though the world has drilled into my subconscious that i am less physically attractive that majority of its occupants, i have had my fair share of ""suitors"": people who are mostly in it for sex (not to brag but i have a good physique; i jog mostly everyday for 5 km, do 5 sets of various forms of sit-ups, 40 reps each, and other stuff). mostly that people who have approached me came from the gym, when i was still going to one; some from a local gay bar when it was still open. but whenever sex was over, i would lose my taste for the person. i dunno why, perhaps because i have been let down by a lot of people i genuinely liked in the past that as a sort of defence mechanism i don't expect a real relationship to spring up from a mere ""booty call"", or maybe i'm not that into those people.

years passed and i reached my final year in medical school. during the interim, i just managed to hook up with 2 other medical students, both a year lower than me and some random guys i met at bars. this is when fate decided to play with me.

let me go back a little. at the start of my internship, as with the start of every academic year, i look for cute new medical students. but i am merely doing it for the view since i have never approached persons unless they show interest first (remember i have self-esteem issues). i noticed this cute little guy who had a little moustache, who kept on talking fluently in english (you got me, i'm asian), who was also very noisy. as luck would have it, he also dormed at my dorm. other than the occasional glimpses that i had of him there, i sometimes also see him at our local coffee shop (during the times that i am not knocked out from 24 hours of duty and i feel like studying). but nothing happened between us. this would continue for the next 10 months.

during one of my post duty days (ie that is the day after i have done 24 hours, that is 7 am-7 am, with my afternoon being free that day), i decided to jog around the campus. as i was coming inside my dorm, i noticed the same cute guy, who we'll call steve, about to enter as well. 

he reached the door to our dormitory hallway first and held the door open for me. honestly i wasn't expecting anything so after the customary ""thank you"" i walked towards my room. i noticed that steve kept on glancing at me, so i decided to give it a shot. ""hey you're first year med right"" i said to him. ""yeah. and you're an intern?"" was his reply. i told him that i was. we then started talking. i asked him where his room was, out of curiosity. ""it's room 2***. i'm sharing that with 3 other guys"", steve said. since i wasn't really expecting anything, i thought that this might be the reason he decided to strike up a conversation, to see if i will be leaving the dorm this year so he can put a reservation on it. so i asked him, ""i'm at room 22**. it's a single room. if you have plans of transferring rooms next year, wanna see what a solo room looks like?""

steve agreed. still dripping sweat i ""toured"" him around my room; showed him my mini-library, my treadmill that i barely use, and the myriad other stuff on my room. steve immediately jumped on my bed. this actually pissed me off a lot because, being a little bit of a neat freak i never sit on my bed or chair unless i have bathed. but he was cute so i decided to cut him some slack.

minutes wore on. we talked about school, that he is a member of the dance club and other stuff. meanwhile, my sweat has dried on my shirt; i didn't change because i thought he would just take a look then leave. when i noticed that he won't be going anytime soon, i decided to take a bath.

remember that i dorm by myself so i am used to entering my bathroom naked and leaving it naked. hence, i forgot to get my boxers and lotion before going in the bathroom. plus i wanted to see if i can spark his interest (haha). so i left the bathroom only with a towel barely hugging my waist to get my stuff. steve looked up from his ipad then continued playing. i thought to myself, ""what is this guy really up to?"" when i finished dressing, we talked some more, he showed me videos of  him dancing at competitions, and he did a small dance routine in my room. 

what happened next surprised me. as he finished browsing his facebook using my laptop he as, ""do you have movies here?"". again, wanting to test him i said, ""i have, but i don't think they are ones you'll like. ""why?"", he asked. Laughing nervously i said, ""because they are mostly porn"". ""oh i love porn! let me see"", steve said. ""well,"" i hesitantly replied, ""they are gay porn. you see i'm gay. haha!"" ""oh"" he replied. after a minute of awkward silence we again continued talking about mundane stuff. 

he then said, ""ok, just out of curiosity, let me see these vids of yours"". so i grabbed hold of my laptop, opened the well hidden folder containing my stash, then played it. i left him to his own devices and grabbed my pharmacology book. after about a minute he turned the video off, then resumed playing with his ipad.

10 pm arrived. when not busy i usually sleep around this time so i can get up at 5:30 am. ""i'll just go wash up and prepare for bed"" i told steve, as some sort of dismissal. he said, ""ok"". my perplexity just grew.

when i finished i told him, ""i'm about to sleep now"". ""ok, will you be closing the lights?"" he asked. ""yeah but i leave my tv open. helps me sleep better"". as i turned off the light he put away his ipad then laid on my bed. i laid next to him then asked, ""so what now?"". ""depends on you"" he said. ""want me to close the tv?"". ""yup"" steve said.

as we laid there in near total darkness i looked at him, he was looking at me too. he has very thick eyebrows, full lips, a lean body and a naughty smile. he really is my type. i kissed him. he kissed back. after that awkward but passionate first kiss i told him, ""so this was your agenda. you should have told me sooner, saved us more time. haha"" he just laughed.

he had sex after. maybe it was because my last was before internship, but i was one of the best sex that i've had in a while. when we finished, he invited me to bathe with him. he then continued to sleep in my room.

i am a sucker for snuggling. for me that is better than sex. sharing the warmth of another, embracing each other, i missed this so much. it was one of the best nights that i have had.

morning came, and with it reality. before he left he told me that he added me on facebook. after approving him, we exchanged numbers. i was thinking then, ""God if this is the reason why i have been so lonely the past years, thank you"". 

i am not a person to text overly much, medicine demands so much. but if a text you that means i have an important thing to say or that you are important to me. "

3 days passed. steve and i barely saw each other. he seldom replied to my texts too. i know it's only been a short while, but i have been crushing on him since last year. i was a little bit devastated.

then as i was doing make up duty for an absence, steve texted me asking what i was doing. i told him that i was on duty but would be leaving in an hour. since i haven't eaten dinner, i decided to invite him. ""if you don't mind, can you just buy be food? i wanna eat in your room"" steve said. ""ok. what do you want?"". ""just chicken. pay you here. thanks bro"", was his reply.

the ER was very toxic that night, i ended up leaving at 10, an hour after my promise to steve. since no malls were still open, i decided to invite him at a nearby food truck. 

as we drove there, we talked about mundane stuff. i was late so i decided to treat him to dinner. plus i really like him. after dinner we drove back to our dorm. he said, ""i'm sorry but could you drop me off here, i don't want rumors spreading"". ""i understand, you're not out"". 

afterward, we met at my room and we again had sex.

to my dismay, he decided to leave early. he was apparently having allergies and preferred to stay at the comfort of his room. after a good bye kiss, which apparently would be our last, he left.

i did not sleep immediately. i spent the next half hour looking at a picture i took of him while he was sleeping then i prayed to God to please let him be the one.

days passed. messages went unanswered. i grew sadder by the minute. finally i could not bare it any longer. when i chanced upon him being online on facebook i decided to ask him this:

""hi steve, i don't want to make this seem like an order or anything, but i need to know, where is this thing between us going:
a) nowhere. last saturday was the last
b) same as before, just casual you-know-what
c) i want to continue to find out
d) other (specify pls)
i'm 26. it may not seem like a big age diff for you, but i think i'm past the period in my life when i only like playing around. you know i find you physically attractive. but other than that, i find your company pleasant.
so that's it. i told you before that i am a prideful person; know that composing this message has been difficult for me. hence, i would appreciate a decent reply.
good day""

after a day, he replied:

""eriond, the question is, what do you want to happen between us? I'm open to the idea of being friends seeing as I don't think we can have a relationship as of now. I don't think I'm ready for that level of commitment and seeing as I'm entering my summer break in a while as well as your graduating, I don't think a serious relationship would be feasible for us.

""Let's just be friends eriond, if that's alright with you""

as you can imagine it, i was pretty heartbroken. another person to add to my long list of people who rejected me. haha. i thought i was old for this but i cried after duty hours, as i lay awake thinking of him, his laugh, his smile, the way he talks, his lips, his body. but i didn't give up hope entirely. although i was then having my doubts as to his real reason.

the results of who would be progressing to 2nd year was released. previously he told me that he is crushing on this girl and that if she passed, he would court her. i believed him, just not that much. i also thought that if i was competing with a girl i have more chance since apparently he is bisexual and bisexuals are just a few inches away from being full-blown gay. 

still i was lonely so i decided to hook up again with a nurse who i went out with last year (again a story for another time). steve and i were still chatting. thinking that he would be more into me if there was some competition, i told him about me hooking up with the nurse. but the effect wasn't one i expected. steve, being competitive, decided to tell me that he also has another guy, and that is when i learned the truth: that he is in reality waiting for another med student from another school whom he met before he was first year med. apparently he and this guy would go on regular dates whenever their schedules permit it, and that he is just waiting for med school to finish so they can finally be an item.

again, another blow to my ego. when asked, steve had the decency to admit that he was just horny that day and that he was a sucker for sweaty lean guys. he apparently gave ""us"" a chance but we reportedly have ""too little"" in common, that ""chance"" being the one time we ate outside. haha. i thought, ""too little? we are both med, we both have a sarcastic sense of humor, we both hate stupidity, we both practice the same martial art, is that too little?"". again the reality of the world caught up to me, that people who are gifted with more ""attractiveness"" tend to get what they want (i looked it up, steve's guy is also kinda good looking).

currently i am reviewing for my board exam. good thing too, i don't get to think about steve that much. this is one of those nights that i feel lonely.

thanks for reading! i hope you found my story entertaining. any comment will be welcome. :)"

37cnkf,7,2015-05-26,How do I [22 F] date/understand/respect a guy [23 M] who just got out of a engagement abt 6 months ago?,millenialmalfunction,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37cnkf/how_do_i_22_f_dateunderstandrespect_a_guy_23_m/,"Hey Reddit! I'm looking for a little advice here. :)

A sorority sister of mine was talking to me about 3 weeks ago at a wedding we were attending, and mentioned she met a guy who knew me. We had gone to middle/high school together and he had asked her about me. I was super excited about that because I had always had a tiny crush on him, but figured it would never happen because he was engaged.

A little backstory about him: He had been in a 6-yr long relationship through high school and college and he and his ex got engaged senior year of college but ended it about 6 months ago or so (the ex is already dating someone else). I know through several mutual friends that his ex wasn't super nice to him, so, for his sake, I was glad when they broke up.

I messaged him on Facebook and we caught up a little, and he suggested we hang out. I was ecstatic. We hung out for a very long time that weekend and then hung out for the second time this past weekend (he lives in my town for college during the year, but currently is in a city about an hour away for an internship this summer). I had so much fun both times and I know that he did too. I admitted to him that I liked him a lot a couple of days ago and he admitted he did too. 

The hang up is that he was honest with me (which I very much appreciated) and said he was in a very weird place after the broken engagement, which I can completely understand, but said he would really like to continue hanging out with me. He is a good person, and I know he's not lying to me or anything to get out of this. I absolutely know I would want to date him when he was ready, and I think he'd want to date me when he was ready too.

How do I deal with this situation? Because I know we both like each other, I'm not sure how to not talk to him too often, or not want to act like his girlfriend, or whatever. I would really appreciate whatever advice you have as to understanding/respecting his situation and how to act. I like him a lot and I'd like to make him happy and possibly make this work later. :)
   
TL;DR: An old classmate of mine just got out of an engagement and LTR of 6 years and we've gone out on a few dates and like each other but he said he was in a weird place, so how do I respect his boundaries?"

37d3cv,1,2015-05-26,"Trying to choose between Product Design (feature-set, UI and/or UX Design), Networking or Software Development Fields...",xc3llerator,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/37d3cv/trying_to_choose_between_product_design/,"So (after several f/t internships, casual jobs, and reading multiple threads on IT fields) basically in the IT industry from the fields I enjoy learning about or doing:

- **Networking/System Infra**: Pretty much go into this if you want very little to do with designing the front-end of a (web/app based) product (or caring about its feature development). You're mainly ensuring the 'always-on' reliability with smooth consistent performance. Technical skills are interoperable between any company you hit. Things are pretty much black and white on paper (literally - look at Network Design papers) in this field. It either works or it doesn't, if it still seems like magic, well then you don't know all of the network(s)'s environmental variables yet.

Cons: Usually involves being subjected to long overtime (we're talking saying goodbye to your weekends depending on the size of your company, the smaller the worse for networking roles, since you'll generally be the only Net Admin, something fucks up, guess who's staying back until its fixed - you basically become enslaved to potentially an endless string of environment machine variables - this is very much a higher-class support role, so beware) and on-call off-peak hours. If you love networks/system admin... yeah no, you still love your sleep.

- **Product Design** (encompasses [UX](http://on.fb.me/1BnGoX6), UI/Interaction Design): Basically go into this if you want everything to do with the (front-end feature set) product's development, but don't really care about its back-end! (As long as it's up, which the Infra guys are responsible for, or more colloquially known as 'server/router monkeys'). Design skills are interoperable between any company you hit. This group is generally colloquially known as 'hipster designers'. 

Cons: Involves dealing with subjective decisions/behaviour on a daily basis. Your precious design work may be torn apart and replaced by another (perhaps younger?) designer's work who seems to have a better fit design in the eyes of another higher up Manager or Designer's role (If company doesn't practice UX Research and A/B tests). This would easily cause a social imbalance if the company's management is shit like this and doesn't know how to boost designer morale. Nothing can be really deemed as solely 'right or wrong', but rather relies upon subjective viewpoints and decision making, this will cause distress among Designers of contrasting perspectives. May also involve long hours, outside of work hours, thinking about inspiration and drafting up ideas. But if you truly love design, it wouldn't feel like work at all. You'll love it!

- **Software Development** (Basically just coding and/or creating DBs): The glue between the Infra and the Product's Design. (Makes shit work on [and off] the screen). Skills are interoperable (depending on language and programming paradigms you're familiar with). Probably more colloquially known as 'geeks/nerds' to the general public. Lets you pretty much craft anything computers can do today or will do.

Cons: Involves dealing with long stretches of potentially tedious code, perhaps even old code bases with poor documentation. In larger companies, you'd get lesser say in the design process (Product feature sets) and would rather just be tasked with developing the solution given the set of (front-end) design requirements. Involves long periods of staring at a screen, looking at thin lines of code. Has been known to drive people mad and away from IT. Can also involve long hours depending on your company, if you love code that much, you may love this!

I think probably Product Design would be a good fit for my passion AS WELL AS interest ([Great TEDx talk w/ 2.4 million views. 'You will have 20 different interests, but you must choose one as a passion'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKHTawgyKWQ)). I think in Networking/infra and Software Dev, I definitely have interest, and some passion in each, but probably not as great as getting Product (UI) designs right and developed. I'm a pixel junkie. It's why I prefer to take my time with things, get them right (or near right) the first time round.

I think it's perhaps time to start an app (startup?) and utilise all three! :D Screw being pigeon holed into one role? LEARN ALL THE THINGS! Fuck it, Entrepreneurship b1tch! 

In summary, I just see Infra/Support roles are something that HAS to be done and many IT people usually just choose this route by default due to a traditional Mr/Mrs fix-it around households when System or Network issues arose during their early childhood/teen/early adult lives. Not saying that it's the equivalent (in pay or environment) to a garbage man or cleaner, but the routine based maintenance (backups, system performance monitoring) can certainly feel like that at times in contrast with Product Design or Software Dev (who literally don't even have to worry about that shit given that the company is large enough to have an infra team to take care of that, sometimes a Software Dev will be tasked with both roles of coding and infra work in bootstrapped companies - I can't imagine Dev productivity being any good as it scales though). Product Design has this sense of bliss, pure negligence for infra/system admin based tasks, has the most influence (out of these roles) over the product's feature-set direction. Generally appeals to people you develop a keen eye for detail, especially in user interfaces, and being continuously empathic to the user's viewpoint. May occasionally involve testing and submitting bugs to Software Devs. Software Developers are generally the 'fix-it's or 'built-it's from a virtual point of view. Probably appeals more to people who like TECHNICALLY creating things from a set of pre-defined requirements. Some Software Developers would care less about design if the company has Designers on hand. 

I think all this can go back to passion for ***Lego*** as a kid. All three of these fields can relate to Lego in their own way:

- Networking, it's like the best of both worlds in terms of getting physical stuff to play with + also getting the logical schema requirements right or following them. The requirements come from technical capacity requirements.
- Product Design, the lego pieces are just UI elements, the requirements are collected from users through UX research or user feedback.
- Software Dev, the lego pieces are pretty much code functions or strings of code. Requirements generally come from other Software Devs and/or Infra dudes (for back-end work) + Design team for front-end work.

This is a good response (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26vl9k/sysadmin_jobs_are_dying_learn_to_code_software/#chvq6mm) I came across towards the end of last year. Although it doesn't mention anything about Product Design since it's out of the scope of that thread. Interested to hear other peoples' thoughts. 

PS: I've had probably over a decade exp troubleshooting tech issues at home and have interned for 6 months f/t in a  corporate Sys Admin/IT Support role talking to a Network Admin as well. Support is VERY routine based and doesn't allow any influence of a products feature or UI direction. I've been interested in UI Design even since playing video games (BFBC2) as a (16-17 years old) teen, and thinking about how they design the nav menus in the way they do. I'm nearing the end of my 4 year IT degree. Thinking about studying Android Development (and UI Design) next semester as my final subject/elective. I currently have an offer with Cisco to intern with them for 6 months f/t (8:30am-5:30am) 9 hr days, for about AUD 4k a month (AUD ~$16.8 an hr) which isn't bad as an intern, but I'm nearly a graduate, so I should technically be looking at applying for grad roles now and not wasting time on sub-paid internships (Applying for a job is a f/t job in itself at times, but I use InDesign and my resume is neat af!). I'm currently 21, turning 22 next month. I'm thinking if I don't make the jump into the Product Design world now, I'll get sucked into doing support things for the majority of my career. My future aspiration or goals in Product Design would be to secure a job in a reputable web company doing Product Design. (E.g. For [Facebook](http://on.fb.me/1BnDgdO) or Google). A few years ago I was thinking of going into a [26-month support role](http://linkd.in/1BnCE7Q) ([Technology Residency Program (ITRP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w2YUJie9Bs)) at Google. But this role is more than 2 years, and looks like it would only benefit people wanting to further their career in support/infra based roles. *IT Residency alumni have advanced on to a variety of positions, both at Google and other top-tier technology companies, in roles such as networking, security, site reliability engineering, system administration and support.* No doubt, the Cisco internship would be beneficial if I was to apply for the ITRP, as it does give you a CCNA paid by Cisco, but it's a very remote field from Product Design. I want to be able to have influence about how a product's feature set actually is and the UI involved. Which is probably more like being an [Interaction or Motion Designer](http://linkd.in/1BnDaCO). 

I guess the [ITRP does offer a route to Product Design too if you want to afterwards](http://linkd.in/1BnDtxH), but doing IT Support is something I want to steer away from, since it becomes drastically harder to build up design experience. I guess what I did Support for so long is because I care about the end-user experience being right so much! So it just seems like an opportune transition into Product Design (UI/UX). I guess Support is like a technical version/support of UX to the user. :P (But UX in this context as two meanings, the ACTUAL end user user-experience and the FIELD user experience). Maybe it would be worthwhile taking that Cisco role. (It's a B2B lvl 3 support role, I would replicate network issues if needed to solve client issues), but it does feel very distant to Product Design! I did a quick Google search and found top Interaction Designer profiles at Google. [This guy](http://linkd.in/1BnE16G) ranks out on top (Not sure how LinkedIn ranks profiles, but I assume just from recommendations and amount of profile data). He has worked at Cisco too, but as Product Designer, not support. Kind of stuck in a rut. I have 5 days to decline or accept the Cisco offer (The hiring process was EXTREMELY quick, within 2 weeks of applying, they offered me the role, I guess I just did to see what the interview process would be like and to see if I'd pulled through it, but I'm having [severe second thoughts/hesitation accepting](http://on.fb.me/1BnGcag) another support role, since I know what they're like and it isn't my full ambitions to continue with the support field, even though I'm deeply curious about anything IT technical  and would spend hours fixing stuff if I have to (I become deeply infatuated, but that's all it is, infatuation because a modem went down and I'm wondering why from the logs, there is no longer vision or goal there as what I have with Product Design spotting so many UI issues or feature improvements that COULD be made, but often take years or are never made)), I just feel like my time and values can be better aligned in a Product Designer role, despite the subjective views you have to deal with in Product Design. I haven't had much time to apply for other companies yet for Product Design roles, but I've been [rapidly looking this past day or two](http://on.fb.me/1BnGfD6), and an Atlassian recruiter got back to me already for [Product Design](http://linkd.in/1GyjKRK).

In the words of Steve Jobs, 
*“If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.”*

Is anyone else in or has been in the same position? I haven't proof-read this, if I have time later I will, it's currently 5AM in Sydney. Open to any advice. Thanks!

Oh yeah, I guess [my LinkedIn](http://linkd.in/1BnFM3y) would help for previous exp. I've done a fair amount of wireframing work during High-school and university, just not much to show for it in a dedicated Interaction Design role yet. (Apart from a Testing one). I don't want to let previous exp influence my future much, but a lot of those previous exp. I didn't really have a strong say in which role I would go in (or was limited by company offerings during sponsorship of my degree).

I think I want to have a diverse Dev + UI Design skillset like [this Facebook Product Designer](http://linkd.in/1BnGM7S). (I already know a fair amount of how web scripting and markup works (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS,) URL encoding, SEO stuff) and already know how to make interactive wireframe (that is easy), I just need the design glue in-between, called EXPERIENCE! Aha (Hence, why I'm thinking of taking an Android Dev elective to ship my first Android app, I've only even shipped a poorly designed interface [VB.NET 3-in-1 Snake, Space Invader and Light Cycles game program](http://bit.ly/1FVbLj5) - requires Windows] in high school and a [mobile responsive (media queries) semi-outdated 2013 portfolio site](http://j.mp/1wPKkmf). (Needs an update, thinking of a new design + URL to showcase design work). I found that my IT degree was so broad in terms of field scope, that it was incredibly demotivating at times to think about completing and even choosing a field in IT to launch into, but there is one thing that remain consistent, my passions and their varying degrees for the three different fields I mentioned above. I'm pretty much just finishing off my degree to satisfy Visa (2 year) working requirements for overseas (US) jobs."

Then sudden HRwiener at my door ruined my score, I noticed someone lurking in the background.

&gt; HRwiener: This is the guy that keeps letting spam through to our mailboxes. *laugh* no, really he's a good guy and does a great job keeping things working.

With that he waves and leads the little squirrelly person off. I shrug and go back to my break and try to recover some of my ratio.

Later that day....the phone rings, I answer it with my normal joyful self, I get interrupted as I begin.



&gt; HRwiener: There is still no equipment at Squirrely's desk.

&gt; Me: Hi, I'm doing fine! How have you been?

I can hear the gears cranking up in HRwiener's brainbox, after a few moments he finds his words.

&gt; HRwiener: I'm fine, but the new user is still without a workstation and her phone is set to vacant, it should have her name.

I flip through a few programs and I can't find any new employee data for Squirrely.

&gt; Me: I got nothing for a new employee, which department is she in? 

I thought maybe the manager just didn't click submit like a good little worker drone.

&gt; HRwiener: She is in marketing, how do you not know this?

&gt; Me: Because someone didn't submit the forms, I don't have a machine pulled, imaged and setup for Squirrely.

&gt; HRwiener: Typical, you guys are so lazy down there in IT.

&gt; Me: I don't know what to tell you, I'll call MarketingManager and see what's up, ok?

That seemed to appease him, somewhat, and I spend the next 20 minutes finding MarketingManager.

&gt; Me: hey we don't have the paper work on this new hire of yours. Do you have here resume or details tht you could send me.

&gt; MarketingManager: I didn't hire anyone, I don't know what your talking about....

That rung some bells, I thanked him for his time and headed up front. I found HRwiener in his office, I walk in and set down across from his desk.

&gt; Me: Where is Squirrely? We didn't hire anyone for marketing. 

&gt; HRwiener: What do you mean? She said she was here to start in marketing today!

&gt; Me: What I mean is, you let some strange person in the building and you've been walking here around the building. Even gave her a desk, I hope you remember where you left her...

He jumps up and dashes off to find the mystery woman, I tag along in his wake grinning, thinking this was grand ol' fun. To sum up at this point, there is now a missing girl in the building and we have gotten security involved. While they are dashing around checking and locking rooms, I head to the server rack with the cameras.

I find her at the vacant desk and follow her to one of the exits, which the door is locked without a badge, an then she goes to one of the restrooms.

I let security know an they go in swat style, and find her crying in one of the stalls.

Poor kid was an intern for the company down the street, HRwiener took some initiative and nabbed her from the lobby since the receptionists couldn't find MarketingManager.

*The company was in the process of changing the name slightly so we didn't have any signs up outside the building at the time. The poor girl was just 15 and her mom dropped her off at the wrong address. HRwiener wanted to charge her with trespassing. This is what earned him the name...*

37danl,111,2015-05-26,My story on internalizing red pill truths and overcoming the anger phase,chimpchimperson,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/37danl/my_story_on_internalizing_red_pill_truths_and/,"Hello all. First, I want to thank you guys for creating, maintaining and writing for this forum. I have only been posting sporadically on RP for a few months, but I would like to share my story. There have been a few good posts recently in regards to the anger phase, so I want to share with you what led me to accept the Red Pill as truth, and also how I used the anger phase to my advantage. Sorry in advance if this is long.

I got cheated on and lied to by a girl I was in a LTR with for over 5 years. I started dating her once I was honorably discharged from the USMC. I had bought an engagement ring and was going to propose when I discovered that she was cheating on me with her boss. I found out because she accidentally left her Facebook signed in and then she took a shower while I was hanging out in her bedroom; so I, naturally, starting looking at her FB messages (I never completely trusted women, mostly from seeing first-hand what women are capable of from my time spent in the USMC).

There were FB messages upon messages upon messages of my soon-to-be fiance going back and forth with her boss describing how she loved sucking his dick and riding his cock. She frequently complained that he was an asshole to work for (go figure, women like assholes with power). I also found out that she fucked her boss on my birthday weekend. She lied and said she couldn't come to my birthday party because she had to work that weekend (she worked in retail), when in reality she never went to work: she was getting deep-dicked by her boss at his house.

As soon as she got done showering I confronted her; she admitted to cheating and tried to hamster her way out of it by blaming me for never having time to see her because of MY school and work schedule. She cried, apologized profusely, then begged me to take her back. I told her to fuck off and never contact me again, then I left her apartment and cut ties with her. Of course this didn't stop her from contacting my family and friends begging for me to talk to her again, which I never did. Last I heard, she got fired from her job and moved back in with her parents.

After I found out she cheated, I started reading relationship forums and watching YouTube videos to try and figure out why it happened. After all, in my mind, I was a great boyfriend (I was really a beta that she was using for my utility) and she was a ""good,"" educated, God-fearing Christian girl who went to church every week and had a good relationship with her parents. I was shocked that she cheated and I needed to figure out why it occurred. I eventually stumbled upon Sandman's YouTube videos inadvertently after watching a Hodgetwins' video. After watching a few Sandman videos, I was addicted and had to watch all his videos to learn about the true nature of women. I was hooked on Sandman because everything he said matched up almost exactly with how women actually behave, rather then how society's fictitious, ""every girl is a benevolent, unique princess"" narrative propagandizes their behavior. I then started lurking on this Red Pill forum every day, and the rest is history.

The way I started my anger phase was as follows: I just accepted that I had been brainwashed - starting from when I was a young lad all the way up until I was an adult - as to the nature of women. Eventually I went nearly mad trying to justify the cognitive dissonance of how women actually behave versus how society tells us they behave, and I just had to accept that women are not at all like what society tells us they are like. For example, just observe how women are depicted in movies, commercials, TV shows and in the media; then compare those false notions to how you have seen women behave throughout your life. Huge difference, right? I eventually just accepted that I had been brainwashed by Cultural Marxism and feminism, then I tried to cut through the propaganda to access the truth.

The next step of my anger phase was rough. I was hateful and spiteful, not just towards women, but to society as a whole for perpetuating feminism nonsense (especially 3rd wave feminism). I especially hated white knights and beta males, and I would not associate with anyone who I considered to be one. I cut ties with a few friends who were betas, with a few shitty family members, and I followed MGTOW for over a year before my hatred and disdain for our society diminished. In this time, I went back to training BJJ as much as possible, lifting weights and eating a lot to pack on muscle mass, I got an amazing internship and worked hard, and I went into full-on monk mode in which I read and studied as much as possible.

Now I hold a belt in BJJ and I regularly compete and medal in state and national tournaments for a prestigious BJJ school in Chicago. I also graduated college with two BAs, I am studying for the GMAT and will soon apply to a MS program in accounting, and I have a great job in copywriting/marketing/website development, which I got from my undergraduate internship. In the future, I plan to finish my master's degree, become an accountant, open my own accounting firm (I can dream, can't I?) continue progressing in BJJ, and start training MMA. The only thing that sucks about my life now is that I don't have enough hours in the day to accomplish everything I want to accomplish in life. I rarely ever go chasing after women, but I get laid regularly by plates because I've both internalized the RP truths and actively do my best to improve myself every day, although I still have a ways to go and sometimes still act beta.

This forum literally changed my life for the better so much that I cannot express it in words. The one piece of advice I can offer you newer guys is to use your anger to achieve goals - anger is a very strong emotion and can benefit you greatly if you direct it to achieve healthy goals that you set for yourself. The anger phase taught me to A) say fuck society and B) focus on improving myself rather than conforming to how society conditions men to act (like betas).

The anger phase is great because in it you work to improve yourself and your status rather than waste time trying to pick up women. Upgrading your SMV is key; the bitches are secondary, and they will flock to you once you better yourself. Embrace and revel in the anger phase, my friends. There is no going back to the blue pill falsehoods once you understand the red pill truths.

And another thing to guys who are new to the forum: don't ever get married and don't ever trust any woman - even your own female family members. I could write an entire novel based on all the times in which I've seen female family members, female military spouses and female military personnel completely destroy mens' lives without an ounce of shame or remorse.

A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages (a few paragraphs, and generally I can play out each scenario in anywhere from a few hours to a few days). Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing!

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

PROMPT #1: You're a young intern (18-21) at the office I work in. We don't talk much outside of a few short conversations, but I (though a bit older) notice you've got a body that's absolutely built for sex.

Through some side video editing work I do for a shady strip club boss in town, I've discovered you're also stripping on the side (and possibly doing other things, too). It's 5:30, nobody's in the office but us, and I've decided to let you know I know.

""Hey, can I see you for a second?""

---

PROMPT #2: It's a wild party in the setting of your choice (nightclub, pool party, strip club). The drinks are flowing, it's late at night, and it's essentially turned into an orgy, with asses bouncing, clothes coming off, and people making out (and more).

Maybe you're a college student out on the town. Maybe you're a cougar looking for a younger guy. Hell, maybe you're a stripper or hooker who just wants cock. At any rate, you're wearing THAT outfit in your wardrobe that excels at covering up very little, and you're out for one reason: To fuck and get fucked.

---

PROMPT #3: You're the neighborhood MILF and you know it. You spend days on end lounging by the pool in your bathing suit, which barely covers your gigantic fake tits and shapely ass. One day, I see you from out of my apartment window. Your husband is never home, and you've resorted to exhibitionism, pleasuring yourself in full view of many apartments.

---

PROMPT #4: I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

PROMPT #5: Anything you'd like that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you!"

My issues is I also received another offer from a company that is paying me 48k salary with great benefits and it's a lot closer to me. However, their technology isn't as cutting edge as it's PHP and CMS based and it's a religious non-profit organization which I am a little hesitant to have on my resume. It's important to note that I have virtually no experience with web development in a professional environment so both of these opportunities are amazing.

I am a little torn because the internship I have right now is awesome and they really like me and have been really teaching me a lot, plus I'm learning AngularJS. At the same time, I am a little old for an internship as I've been out of college for 5 years now and need to focus on job stability. My question is, how should I handle this situation? Is this a no-brainer?"

It’s the combinations of these skills that make me believe I would be a great candidate for the position of ________ Internship and a good addition to the __ team.

My role as a Business Manager, Freelancer, and IT technician has given me experiences in what is expected when building a team, and working on projects. I thrive in a project-oriented environment both as a leader and a team member.

In addition to being responsible and flexible, I'm also great at keeping details, researching and presenting a project to a group of people or business. One of my most recent projects, and one I'm incredibly proud of, was developing a Business plan that I created for my family restaurant. As the main manager, I was able to create a business plan that covered Marketing, Sales Strategy, Increasing the business reach and increasing our profit margin. After taking over the family business, I've been able to increase our profits while also dramatically decreasing our cost of goods to an estimated 21%. I believe in applying this same level of business analysis to all of my business and career ventures.

My past experiences in freelancing and in the technical field have taught me how to become a self-sustained, problem solver and solo team member. Through freelancing, I've been able to not only reach my proposed Website design business to individuals, but I’ve also been able to reach local businesses in the Las Cruces area. In addition, as a Computer Technician I have fixed computers that have been deemed as unfixable. 

I appreciate your time and consideration as a candidate for the internship; I look forward to meeting you personally to discuss my suitability for this position.

I've never held a job longer than 9 months, I'm from a poor country, i actually paid to be accepted in an internship. This is job 1.

Job2: I graduated, company from job 1 didnt want to pay people, so i got job 2. Employer in job 2 pays late (1 month), deducts from salary to pay our income tax (this is the normal thing in my country), turns out my 9 months of working there 6 months tax werent paid. So i noped. And found job 3.

.

Job3+Job4(abroad): best job ive had i spent 9 months total, from that 9 months i spent 3 abroad because company wants to have the production up and running on that plant abroad. Essentially the same company, but i am getting paid for job3 and job4. Though, I had to leave because my father offered to give me working visa in the middle east. 
.
.now in middle east

Job5 as treatment engineer: earned 1/4 what i am making from job 3+job4. Took a toll on my health, company gave me a maid's health insurance , so nothing is covered. Delayed salary for 1 month, took only me only 4 months before I quit.

37eh9x,6,2015-05-26,"[Super Long] I finally pulled myself out of a lifelong slump, and am standing at a crossroads. Both options terrify me.",conflictedthraway222,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37eh9x/super_long_i_finally_pulled_myself_out_of_a/,"I don't even know what kind of help or advice I need. Career? Psychological? Social? Monetary? Courage? All I know is, it's been bottling up inside for nearly 60 days and I need some help. The biggest problem is - I don't even know how or who to ask. Like, I'd need to give my damn life story. So I apologize for the length! This seems like the only place I can let this out, and it's as short as I could make it.

I'm 24, nearly 25. Until age 21, I felt overwhelmingly anxious, tired, depressed (feels weird and fake to outright say it.).  Really the only emotion I felt was guilt for some reason. It's a long story, and I hate just saying this stuff, but I guess that's the situation, without going into detail. Guilt was why I was still alive, essentially. Eventually I sought help, and turned my life around, especially after realizing that I *did* want something from life. Friendship, and to move out of the Midwest. Which sounds assholish, I know.

There's nothing bad about the Midwest, but I just feel so isolated - not just from the people, but, I dunno, the environment. Once, trying to break my inactiveness, I went to the east coast to visit some internet friends (my only friends are online, only time I ever got close to ""getting"" someone, and vice versa). It was amazing. I finally felt like I had a reason to live, bizarrely enough. Things just kinda clicked, both with all the people, and with the environment. Cities varied, but especially in Newark, I just kind of suddenly didn't need to argue with myself to keep living.

So, it took a while and a lot of hard work, but I overcame issues enough to go to school. Point is: moving to Newark was the carrot at the end of my stick. I got over the self-loathing, worked hard, built myself up enough to be employable - and after a year, I made it! I moved in with my Newark friend, everyone in the social circle was great and was excited. I never had to play tricks on myself to keep going, day after day - I liked life. And I guess I needed physical friends. Plus it was practical from a job standpoint, too - it would be hard to find a web design job there, but it was a hell of a lot better than a farm town. But, three months later, things went sour, job-wise: I was pretty naive about the internship I landed. It was a remote job, and despite the promotions, I barely ever got a cent of what I was promised they weren't legally bound (independent contract made it clear), and I was too dumb to see how clearly I was being played. I ran out of money, and had to move home.

I immediately plunged back into self-loathing and depression. But I still had the motivation - I could just make money again, move back with my roommates, who were happy to wait for me. But time really stretched on. I kept working for 4 months until I was eventually let go for stressing how urgent my financial situation was becoming, and that I needed to get paid. Again, super naive. Also, a long, long story.

Anyway. I'm getting older, and I struck what feels like a once-in-a-lifetime chance. It's a really great 90 day internship that, from my understanding, ""would likely lead to a full-time position."" My thinking was, they figured we'd discuss it then. Not really the case: I was badly needed and have been learning and training for that full-time position since day 1. They treat me well, and I love it, on paper. Best job I ever had, but with my environment and the life situation, I'm still barely getting through day by day.

Newark's really all I got. I love my friends there, but I'm scared that's too big a motivator. And I can't stomach the idea of leaving this job - I'm constantly reminded how my coworkers assume I'm here forever, and how bad they needed a third person in that department. Just today, I was told that part of the decision on why I was hired was because I wasn't from a university, since you can't be sure if the student will stay on, and they badly need another member, the way they're growing. They're always being vocally grateful for the decision they thought I made.

I've no idea what to do. No matter how much introspection I do, I can't come to a conclusion.  I can't get to an emotional or logical angle for either. Both feel like a massive mistake.

Again, sorry for the length."

[The WIR Intro plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D09sNLghN8) before fading in to the Suburban Bingo Hall in Norfolk, Virginia

**Paisner:** Hello Norfolk!

**Crowd:** Yaaay!

**Paisner:** I probably shouldn’t be telling you this but things have been pretty hectic backstage here at WIR over the past few weeks. I mean, it’s almost been one whole year! How about that? How are we doing, good?

**Crowd:** YOU STILL GOT IT CLAP-CLAP-CLAPCLAPCLAP

**Pasiner:** Now, I gotta keep this short, my speech writer’s not here today, he got a bit sick, so we had some intern write it.

**Crowd:** Hahahahaha

**Paisner:** If I could be serious for a moment though, this weekend could be a turning point in WIR history, because Malcolm Whi-

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Please. Malcolm Whi-

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Haha, come on guys, I gotta finish or we can’t start the show. As you know Malcolm Whi-

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** I’m just gonna say it really fast. Malcolm White and Team Ballsweat want to take over our company. Well if they think they can do that they’ve got another thing coming!

**Crowd**: YAAAAY!

**Paisner:** But if they do win, I assure you that the WIR superstars will do everything in their power to fuck Malcolm’s shit up, but for now ladies and gentlemen, I encourage you to enjoy the show. Javier, catch!

He doesn’t catch the microphone

**Javier:** Ahh crap

**Paisner**: NICE ONE!

**Crowd:** Hahahaha

**Javier:** The following contest is scheduled for one fall with a 30 minute time limit! Your referee is Mia So Hung!

**Javier:** Introducing first...

[In One Ear hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkHe7syl7b0) and David Harvey makes his way through the curtain

**Crowd:** YAAAAAAAAAY!

He walks down to the ring, high fiving fans while he does

**Javier:** From Mesa, Arizona, weighing 205 pounds, the Wildcat, DAVID HARVEY!

[The music of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIjmRzfnfIA#t=75) Roisin O'Brien hits. She bursts through the curtain and runs to the ring, she climbs a turnbuckle and bows to the fans before flipping off

**Javier:** His opponent, from Navan, Ireland, weighing in at 140 pounds, ROISIN O’BRIEN!

**DING DING DING**

We're underway as both competitors circle the ring. Harvey shakes his wrists as Ro paces back and forth. They lock up Harvey has the strength advantage and muscles Ro into the corner.

1!

2!

Harvey breaks the hold. O'Brien jabs Harvey in the throat and goes for a quick roll-up but Harvey kicks out before the one count

**Paisner:** O'Brien looking to take advantage of a stunned Harvey there

Harvey quickly rises to his feet as and Ro begins firing away with successive kicks, Harvey stumbles onto one knee and Ro catches him with a kick to the jaw. She goes to the apron and springboards in an attempt to drive her knees into Harvey's back but he rolls out of the way and drags her up before dropping her with a cradle suplex. He doesn't release the leg and rolls over lifting her up again before dropping her into a powerbomb

**Crowd:** OOOOH!

1!

**Paisner:** Kick out by Ro!

Harvey grasps the legs and attempts to lift her full weight, but Ro grabs his head and throws him with a monkey flip but Harvey lands on his feet while Ro taunts the crowd, not knowing Harvey is on his feet. He spins her around and hits a jumping DDT.

**Crowd:** OOOOOH!

1!

2!

**Woodbridge**: Another kickout by O'Brien!

Harvey begins banging on the mat, attempting to get the crowd chanting.

**Crowd**: HAR-VEY! HAR-VEY! HAR-VEY!

**Paisner:** The crowd are firmly behind David Harvey now.

**Woodbridge:** Heh, when aren't they?

Harvey rolls Ro over and attempts to lock on the Wildcat Special but she rolls out of the ring.

**Crowd:** BOOOO!

But Harvey is quick to hit a baseball slide kick, knocking Ro into ringside fans. He grabs a hold of the ropes and slingshots himself into a senton, they collide with chairs as fans stumble out of the way.

**Harvey:** YEAAHHHH!

**Crowd:** YEAAHHHH!

Harvey drags Ro to her feet and throws her into the ring before going for another cover.

1!

2!

NO!

**Paisner:** I don't like her, but you gotta give it to her, she's one tough daughter of a bitch.

Harvey climbs to his feet with the assistance of the ropes, he imitates slicing his throat and the crowd pops.

**Paisner:** Ooh, Harvey looking for Diamond Crusher.

Harvey drags Ro up with an inverted facelock but Ro slivers her way out and hits Harvey with a double knee armbreaker, he stumbles back onto the ropes before rebounding with a bicycle kick which Ro ducks. She sweeps Harvey's legs and jumps onto the top rope, she blows a kiss to Harvey before flipping forward to hit the ""laoch na hUaimhe"" but Harvey catches her and powerbombs her in the centre of the ring before [bridging a pin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBAeeeSQu_U)

1!

2!

**Woodbridge:** A fourth kickout by Ro, maybe, just maybe she could find a to win this!

Ro rolls onto the apron and springboards over, dropping Harvey with a springboard clothesline, he quickly comes to his feet before being hit with an STO, he pops up once more where O'Brien attempts to hit a sunset flip, only for him to stop her and lock her in an inverted facelock.

**Crow:** YAAAY!

**Paisner:** We know what this is!

Suddenly Ro pushes herself up over Havey's shoulders and drops him with an inverted DDT

**Woodbridge:** Nevermind.

Ro makes her way up top, she blows a kiss to Harvey and propels herself off, she flips in the air and he feet collide with Harvey's ribs.

**Woodbridge:** GEOLICK SMECK!

**Paisner:** Probably easier to say ""WHAT A STOMP!""

Ro dives back onto Harvey and hooks his leg, as well as his tights, something the referee is oblivious to.

1!

2!

3!

**DING! DING! DING!**

**Crowd**: Booooooo!

**Paisner:** I'm pretty sure we all saw that, she clearly had hold of the tights!

**Woodbridge:** It's too late now, she's won the match.

**COMMERCIAL**
[Warlock’s music hits](http://therobpeters.com/video/Run.mp4) and he appears from behind the curtain slowly making his way down to the ring looking around gazing around at the crowd. When he gets to the ring he slowly lifts up his arm his hand making a W with his thumbs and index fingers. He grabs a microphone and slides into the ring.

**Warlock**: It’s seems that there are a lot of people in the back that want to be part of the Torneo Cybernetico each with their reasons, but mostly it’s to see a change in the leadership structure here in WIR some want Malcolm to have complete control over everything that goes on in this company, while others want to go back to the old status-quo and give Allen his former, full authority.

The crowd cheers at the thought of Paisner being back in charge.

**Warlock**: To make things even more interesting the last person standing will become the WiR Heavyweight Championship, which, quite honestly, is part of the reason I'm out here. Since Malcolm gained a modicum of power in this company he has only stopped at damn near killing me to keep me away from the title I get attacked by members of his team, cheated out of a rematch and hung out to dry when I came so close to regaining that title!

Dewey Needler’s [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrPfMRXlf5E) hits and he and the Superstar come rushing from back to the ring and start attacking Warlock who side steps The Superstar and superkicks Needler. Warlock turns around, his burning eyes stare at the Superstar

**Warlock**: I told you, you two were pawns here to devalue the title, so I took care of you, much like I'm going to take care of Malcolm’s team at Vintage. Get out of my ring now or you will suffer!

The Superstar doesn't take heed and charges at Warlock who lifts him up and delivers a Burning Hammer.

**Warlock**: Malcolm White, at Vintage your End is coming…

Warlock climbs on one of the turnbuckles

**Warlock**: And it’s going to come at the hands of the Rising Phoenix.

Warlock delivers a Rising Phoenix that hits both Needler and the Superstar.

**Warlock**: Run while you can Malcolm.

Warlock’s music hits again as he laughs lying down in the middle of the ring.

37eju9,0,2015-05-26,[Emergency] Please help me figure out how to respond to my failed drug test situation. I still currently have hope!,IENTI,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/37eju9/emergency_please_help_me_figure_out_how_to/,"I know that this is a long read, but I do need the help so please help out a friend in need.

So I just started an internship that supposed to last until January last week on Monday. I knew I would be drug via urine test at earliest the day I got there 5/18/15, but my test was actually Wednesday 5/20/15. I knew I started on the 18th, from the time I was accepted, so I had to decide when to quit. After doing research on the internet (Both Reddit and other sites) I learned that THC stayed in would stay in my system as a frequent smoker between 15-30 days. To describe my previous smoking habits I'd started smoking about a year and a half earlier, I smoked almost everyday, and had probably 30-40 days not smoking during this time usually in at least 4 day increments with the longest being 10 days. My normal smoking habit being 4-8 2-Liter Gravity Bong hits, about .05 g per bowl though maybe up to .08 g and I would smoke at most a half G a day. All of this was coming straight from dispensaries so it was high quality.So I decided that 4/20 would be my last day; that way I could smoke with friends and still have time to get it out of my system.  Being as uptight as I am, in the last 3 weeks before 4/20 I didn't smoke on the weekdays leading up to the celebration, but did smoke about a half G a day on the weekends. At this point I suppose I should mention I'm very much into fitness, and exercise 3-4 times a week and drank plenty of water. Most of my friends thought I was paranoid quitting that early as they had passed drug tests in periods of just 2 weeks. Because I was paranoid I did some research on drug tests, how they worked and how THC was stored in your system. I learned that Initial drug tests generally tested for 50 ng/ML of THC-COOH, Knowing that THC has a half life of of 4 days and rule of thumb being that you needed 6 half lives for something to basically be out of your system, which in case of THC amounted to 24 days I figured I was safe with. Now some of you might be thinking that one's body type and lifestyle effect this. I'm 6'1 164lbs, with almost no fast probably around the 12% range at most. In general I'm your tall skinny guy with a fast metabolism; I actually even has a metabolism booting disorder.  I exercised daily after I quit in an effort to help hasten the removal of THC from my system. I both lifted weights, and did cardio, I stayed away from junk foods ate a lot more salads and ate very clean in general. I would drink about 1/2 gallon to a gallon of water a day. On top of that this was part of the last month of school and finals rolled around so I was taking my vyvanse 60mg daily except for about maybe 2-4 days out of a 3 week period; I only mention this because I know vyvanse increases your metabolism. So at this point I finish my semester and come home for about 2 weeks of summer; I've been clean for approximately 14- 15 days (from memory could be off by a few days) I've exercised at least 3-4 times a week, and my diet has been clean, and I've been drinking tons of water. I figure ""Okay so far so good 2 weeks clean, plenty of exercise, plenty of water, and plenty of the right food"" bust I'm still paranoid, so I buy an at home drug test from the store to test my self. It comes up with a NEGATIVE result for THC (I want to mention at this point for a few hours before I tested myself I reduced water intake so I wouldn't get a false negative because I'd just pissed water), as in at that point I should have been in the clear. About a week or two later I arrive for my internship and take my drug test on 5/20/18, they don't ask if I take any medications, but I do mention that I'm prescribed vyvanse I was told that if it showed up on the drug test I would receive a call and then be asked to verify my prescription. I hadn't taken it over the break so I was pretty sure it would be out of my system as I'd heard it left your system rather quickly. Fast forward to today. I received a call from the testing facility that my test had been positive for THC - No mention of the vyvanse. I'm stunned, I asked if there was anyway this could be a false positive or even if it was someone else's urine sample. I knew I should have been clean by then! I wanted to know exactly what had flagged the test The doctor told me that my sample had failed the initial test and then failed a secondary confirmation test that said there had been indeed THC.

Though there are other things I'm going to do the reason I'm posting this is that I was told that another vial of my urine from the same original sample could be sent to another lab to be tested at a cost of $125 to me. 

SHOULD I DO THIS? 
and 
WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THESE RESULTS?"

I am incredibly excited but very nervous and I want to dress well for my first day. For the interview I went with a dark navy blue polka dot Uniqlo dress shirt, Clark boots, and dark jeans. I went frugal because well... I'm a poor college kid. I don't mind shedding a bit of money for the job since I got the job in the end :)! 

Wing tips, blazers/jackets/pants/etc etc 

One of the interviewers was wearing jeans, and a puffy white sweater. Looked awesome. So I guess the attire there is some what casual as I take it most IT jobs are. 
All advice welcomed.

I'm studying an engineering / CS combo, and I would really like to get an internship during my degree however I have found that the program provided by the university for helping to place students is only open to people studying single CS degrees. 

If anyone has any advice on how to find an internship on my own, apart from relying on google, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently maintaining a HD average in my CS classes. I've seen a bunch of posts specifically about America, I'm just wondering if there are any Australians employed in the field that have any insight over here :)

As of late April my sister totaled my Honda Civic leaving me with car loan that I have to finish paying for and no money to get another car. Thankfully my boss paid me for 2 weeks in advance for another car but with my credit being so bad I can't get an auto loan. 

I have my sister to co sign but that may not work since her credit isn't any better. 

With all that going on, the girl I had strong feelings for suddenly stopped talking to me a couple of days before the accident. I haven't spoken to her for about a month until last night where I reached out but that went nowhere. She replied a couple of times and stop replying back. 

Which hurts  I was there for her and all of her small time issues and I'm here with a serious unforeseen event happened to me and she nowhere in sight. I just wanted someone to ease this shitty situation that I find myself in. 

I feel I have no control with my life and everything is just going to shit. I have no girlfriend, no car and I'm carrying a lot of debt with an internship that barely paying me and on top of that im suffering from depression and can't talk to anyone about it. this is really taking a toll on my welL being. i don't know what to do to get my life back on track.

And to think only a few hundred years ago the world still had adventure and alarm clocks and electronics weren't around to dictate everything. These days even if you live a sleep-deprived and stressful life, you need more talents and larger skill sets than ever before just to compete. What was once just knowing how to write has become knowing how to write and type has become knowing  to use numerous programs and operating systems and using them as efficiently as possible. That is the new basics. Being able to read and write is no longer enough, you've got to be able to do it in multiple languages and forms, you've gotta know how to drive, use gps and a cellphone among many other things. Life is too complicated and the expectations far too high.

The worst part is that globalization has made people compare themselves to the top percentile of humans and try to achieve what they have (often times given to them through birthright), meaning now we've got to compete with those competing with us who are often times stronger, smarter, with better advantages due to looks or family inheritance etc. Don't forget we've got to compete with people from different countries with better upbringings or costs of living. It's not enough to be the best at writing in town anymore. You have to be the best in the world. Life has gotten too hard too fast.

Maybe what many of our Boomer parents don't ""get"" is that we truly are the products of their creation. It's much more difficult today to get out if you didn't have a good enough childhood these days. Training toward successful adulthood is a necessity starting from birth, and advantages given to us during our critical years are even more necessary than ever before.

Life is indeed just too competitive. But can I even complain when it seems like everyone is fine with it? Or are they not?

It's like life is a big sieve. And the more people there are the more people succeed but also more people slip through the cracks. But because society generally works on the assumption of free will there is no one to catch these people. Companies are happy if more people graduate because they have a bigger pool to choose from. They don't care that it means that more people will be jobless.

Despite all the social security it's a dog eat dog world out there. You can't even relax if you have any kind of ambitions. If you work 10 hours on something a day there are people that are able to work 16 or even 20 hours a day. If you are proud of your degree there is someone with better grades and better internships. I get this demonstrated to me when I play some game and manage to achieve what I think is an incredible score but then I look at the scoreboard and I am not even close to the top 10000."

I'm finishing up my undergrad with next year being my last. I am dual majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I've been a part of a few projects and am now interning at a large company as a QA engineering intern. Originally I wanted software development, but after they told me they no longer had positions open for the software development team I decided to go with this just to get my foot in the door. Regardless, I am loving everyday of it. 

My dilemma is that after this summer I may have the opportunity to apply for their program for graduated students to somewhat test drive a full time role. I would probably apply for software development. But I'm also interested in data science, especially after taking my advanced level econometrics class in which I wrote an entire statistical analysis on income inequality in the U.S. I enjoy collecting data and playing around with it to discover what it can tell us. 

I think my ideal plan would be to get a full time job as a developer and go to school part time and get a degree that would allow me to combine my love for cs, econ, and my curiosity of data science. I know of a few good data science programs, but I'm afraid I may not have the grades for uc berk, cmu, etc. Could anyone recommend some options or paths that I could consider? I was looking at a couple programs (specifically Boston University's MS in Statistical Practice and Northeastern University's MS in Business Analytics). Does anyone have any sort of advice regarding these programs? Whether or not they would put me in the right direction or not? Or even if data science is right for me?

It's a long and short story at the same time. I'm going to try to tell you my problem in brief. I'm from a developing, Arabic country in north Africa. I participated in an exchange program sponsored by the U.S. Dept of State to study one academic year in the U.S. I took the TOEFL and an interview in my country then I got accepted to get this full scholarship. Otherwise, I'm from a middle class family in my developing country and my parents cannot provide me this much money to study abroad.. It's a dream.. almost everyone's dream, especially studying in America. Anyway, I traveled to the United States.. I studied, I had an internship, I made ton of friends, Americans and from all across the globe, we shared some incredible memories together.. I traveled inside the States. I discovered the American culture and life-style. In one year I did a lot of things that changed my life to the better. I got my specialized diploma in IT, I volunteered in many events, I helped Americans while they taking their French classes (As it's my second language) I got couple certifications in English (It's actually my third language after Arabic and French). Other certifications of completion.. I presented my country very well. I remember I did a country presentation and it was appreciated by everyone in my college. (My video is posted on Youtube and has more than 2000 views). I had the chance to meet some high level officers in the American gov as a part of visit to the U.S. Dept of State. I was published many times by the American Embassy in my country in their Facebook fan page and much more.. I feel I'm loved by most of the people that I know, because I simply was a very good and inspirational person..

My year was really successful I feel I became a little bit Americanized. 

The big problem is.. When I came back to my country couple days ago.. I don't know why may be because I'm used to the US but I find everything is bad around me. The country, the infrastructure, the people, how they act, how they look at you, how they actually talk.. Everything is bad. I can't appreciate anything. 

In my country you study all your life then if you're lucky enough to fidn a job you'll get very low salary. You can buy a car like after 5 years of working.. 
Corruption in administrations and everywhere.. Most of the people is unrespectful in a way or another..

It's a developing country.. Only people who live or lived before in a developing country will know this situation... I feel really bad.. I wanna just immigrate and live everything behind me..  Even this choice is not up to me.. 

What whould you do in this situation? My problem is bigger than this, I just tried to explain you how  feel in 30 minutes... 

Thank you very much in advance for your time reading this.

So at this point I finish my semester and come home for about 2 weeks of summer; I've been clean for approximately 14- 15 days (from memory could be off by a few days) I've exercised at least 3-4 times a week, and my diet has been clean, and I've been drinking tons of water. I figure ""Okay so far so good 2 weeks clean, plenty of exercise, plenty of water, and plenty of the right food"" bust I'm still paranoid, so I buy an at home drug test from the store to test my self. It comes up with a NEGATIVE result for THC (I want to mention at this point for a few hours before I tested myself I reduced water intake so I wouldn't get a false negative because I'd just pissed water), as in at that point I should have been in the clear. About a week or two later I arrive for my internship and take my drug test on 5/20/18, they don't ask if I take any medications, but I do mention that I'm prescribed vyvanse I was told that if it showed up on the drug test I would receive a call and then be asked to verify my prescription. I hadn't taken it over the break so I was pretty sure it would be out of my system as I'd heard it left your system rather quickly. Fast forward to today. I received a call from the testing facility that my test had been positive for THC - No mention of the vyvanse. I'm stunned, I asked if there was anyway this could be a false positive or even if it was someone else's urine sample. I knew I should have been clean by then! I wanted to know exactly what had flagged the test The doctor told me that my sample had failed the initial test and then failed a secondary confirmation test that said there had been indeed THC.

Though there are other things I'm going to do the reason I'm posting this is that I was told that another vial of my urine from the same original sample could be sent to another lab to be tested at a cost of $125 to me.

SHOULD I DO THIS? and WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THESE RESULTS?

I filed for ACHHS (government assistance) to help pay my medical bills. In doing so, I had to file for unemployment. When speaking with unemployment reps, me quitting my previous job had turned into me being fired... since I didnt come back after rehab. How big of a problem is this?  So far I've been putting that I was terminated on my job apps and then explaining that I had resigned. 

3) I have an ASS and BS in CIS but my real world experience is limited to desktop support, two years as a user interface developer intern, and 6 years doing residential/business tech support in a call center. Do I still have a chance at getting a corporate job?

37ewaj,1,2015-05-26,Investment Strategies for a noob investor,Chudnation,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/37ewaj/investment_strategies_for_a_noob_investor/,"Hi Reddit,
I have been a long time reader of this sub-reddit and first time poster (and a little nervous as this is all very new to me).  As a new CCP believer, I am hoping to get some advice or thoughts on my proposed investment strategy as well as answers to my questions (which I am afraid may be a little on the basic side of things).  I am setting up two investment strategies, one for my money, and a second one for my son's education (he is currently 5 years old). In reality they will both become his so would like them to both do well :)

A little about me, I am 42 and sadly have paid insufficient attention to my personal finances.  This forum has demonstrated to me that it is never too late. I have taken the first step by consolidating all of my various little pots of money into a TD Waterhouse account - pain in the ass but all done now (detailed below). I also have a good job (and one that I enjoy) with a pension that should leave me with approx 100k/yr in my retirement (indexed). I anticipate working for another 15 years before this happens. As such, I believe I can have a rather aggressive investment strategy for this money with a time horizon of 15-20 years before I would ever envision needing to access it. 

Money details: RRSP = 30k,  TFSA = 6k, cash account = 5 k, Resp = 15k. I plan on using the CCP Strategy and investing about 5 k per yr into my TFSA (as I see little point in further contributions to my rrsps). I will also contribute approx 2.5k per yr to my son's Resp (I believe that is about the sweet spot where the government will contribute to his Resp as well). 

1) Strategy One - my finances 
I reviewed the CCPs 'aggressive' investment strategy for TDW and like it, but was thinking it might not be aggressive enough (mistake number one?). Was thinking of the following (remember 15-20 year investment timeline, and I do have a pension):
TD cnd bonds tdb909                 -  5 %. (CCP recommends 10%) 
TD cnd index funds tdb900        - 15 % (CCP recommends 30%)
TD US index funds tdb902**        - 40 % (CCP recommends 30%)
TD intern. Index fund tdb911.      - 40 % (CCP recommends 30%)

Questions
1) am I being too aggressive by lowering the cnd exposure in both funds and bonds? Is this an amateur mistake? Does it unnecessarily skew me towards too much risk? 

2)** I really like the U.S. Index fund (s&amp;p) but there are 3 of them at TDW! The one above with cnd dollars, tdb952 using US dollars, and tbd904 using currency neutral dollars (currency hedging I believe). I am leaning towards either tdb902 or tdb952. Is there any real discernible difference with the timelines I am looking at?  I would do the Norbert gambit to purchase the U.S. Currency if I go down this route. Or is it too much hassle for a lazy CCP'er? I was also wondering  are there any U.S. Tax implications for the U.S. Version (tdb952) - sorry for noob question. 

2) investment strategy for my son's education

Approx 14.5 k now with 2.5k contribution per year. While I believe the kid is bright, he won't be needing this university/college money for at least 13-18 years.  I don't feel as comfortable being as aggressive with his money as I do with mine above, but I am also cognizant that 13-18 years is a long time for it to be sitting and I should take the opportunity to invest it. I was thinking of maybe investing it in a CCP 'balanced' or 'assertive' Strategy, but am very interested in your thoughts. Also, final noob question, if I buy TD cnd bonds (ie., tdb909) it's not like real bonds that have a maturation date and I have to wait years to remove it is it?

Thank you very much readers and posters of reddit, it has been hard for me to get to this point but I am starting to feel like I am taking control of my finances and it is very empowering.

37ewr1,191,2015-05-26,How to be successful in College: Networking.,zaj209,howto,https://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/37ewr1/how_to_be_successful_in_college_networking/,"Good Afternoon everyone, I am posting here because of all the positive feedback I got in this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37c2p3/high_schoolers_what_do_you_want_to_major_in/crlf5j9


A little background I am an Adviser for a program whose sole purpose is to boost the college attendance rate of my county. I work with highschool students. I've been working there for 3 years and have been attending college both full time and part time during those 3 years. (Worth noting I live in the United States, California specifically so I may not be familiar with how college works in other states or countries)


Now this is going to be a long read. But I hope it will help many of you out. Please feel free to correct me and or ask questions.


One of the things I get asked again and again is ""what do I major in?"" The major its self is not that important starting out. Bare with me here, on average a student changes their major 1-5 times in their college career.


I personally recommend that you pursue a major that strongly interest you.


However pick up a minor in something that is more marketable out of college, or a major that is more marketable after graduation with a minor in what interest you. (or vice versa)


This is important because you have a back up plan in case you cannot land a job with the major that interest you.
for example I started off as a nursing major and realized while I enjoyed the field I was only doing it for the money. I had always wanted to teach history.


&gt;I know that history majors are not in demand and that teaching history classes at any level is competitive. So I am now majoring in History with a minor in Vocational Nursing.


This next part is extremely important


You want to NETWORK! During College


Now I am sure many of you have been told this but may not know what it means. Merriam-Webster defines it as
:: the exchange of information or services among individuals, groups, or institutions; specifically : the cultivation of productive relationships for employment or business::


But in simpler terms just go out and meet people!


This is for people living in the dorms there first year in college, after you have everything situated leave your room door open when you are in your room. People will stop by and talk to you! This is how you make friends fast! If you are going to college this fall and dont know how to bake. LEARN HOW TO BAKE! If your dorm has a kitchen bake cupcakes/ cookies/ muffins on your first couple of days there and give them out to people. People love free food! Trust me they will remember you after that!


When I say go out and meet people I mean that you should join clubs, organizations, and I know for some reason people on reddit dislike them but Fraternities and Sororities.


For the last two I strongly recommend Professional or International Frats and Sororities. From my experience these are a lot more social in a professional manner and are not as invested on the whole ""party life"" of things.


You meet a lot of different people from all walks of life, majoring in different things. Interact with them, find common interest and become their friends. Be the best person you can be when you are around them. Most importantly keep in contact with them. You will never know who may end up working where or doing what after graduation. And they can be a reference to the company and or organization they are working for and or may help you find a job lead later on in life.


:: if they get you a job in their organization PLEASE do not be an asshole or make a bad name for your self in that company. This is crucial because this person put their name on the line and vouched for you!::


When you join a fraternity or sorority you want to be an active member!

One of the awesome things about greek life is that they do A LOT OF VOLUNTEERING. The chapters I am familiar with raise a lot of money for charities and do All kind of events for the community. So Volunteer! Go out and help the community through your Greek chapter. Not only does that look killer on a resume but you do not know what type of people you can meet!


When you are volunteering make sure to introduce your self to who ever may be volunteering with you and act professionally!


If you find your self volunteering with the same people repeatedly develop a professional relationship with them.
You may find your self volunteering with the CEO/Hiring Manager of some company who will see you in action. You can later ask for any job leads or even a letter of recommendation or who knows they can ask you if you want to work for them.


Clubs and Organizations
Just like Fraternities and Sororities these are huge for meeting new people. Now Clubs and Organizations fall into two different groups for me. Which I will bold. Group A and Group B.
Group A


These Clubs and Organizations are the things that personally interest you. For instance I will be transferring from a community college to a University this spring and will be joining the Rugby, Christian fellowship , Bowling, French, Gaming, Interact and Latino Leadership Clubs. I am not sure what to expect but I am sure that I will be meeting a lot of new people.


I was in a variety of clubs that interested me in High school and still keep in contact and help out the advisers from those clubs from time to time. They still help me find scholarships and even write me letters of recommendation when I need them.


Like Fraternities and sororities clubs volunteer and help out the community! So make sure to do that as well!


Group B


Now these are clubs related to your major. These clubs are usually advised by a Professor in said field. For instance my history club is advised by multiple History professors.


These clubs are crucial for getting your name out there. Like Greek Organizations and other clubs you want to be an active member! So VOLUNTEER!


Now before I go on group B is going to break off into 2 major things professors and club officer positions (officer positions can also be utilized in greek organizations and Group A) .


Now you want to be an active member in these clubs related to your major because the professors become aware of who you are. You make a name for your self in your respective field of study. You can do this by volunteering with the club, getting to know your professors and running for officer positions.


I am going to have a bit of a section on getting to know your professors so I am going to dive into officer positions.
I was personally told by a professor that you want to run for an officer position for a club because it shows you have interest in that club, and that you want to maintain that clubs reputation. This is huge in a club related to your major because when its time to apply for Masters programs or even a job related to your major the employer/ committee for the masters program will see that you are passionate for the subject at hand.


When you do become an officer make a name for your self. If you are only the club secretary, Will then be the best dam club secretary the club has ever had and will have. You want to make a name for your self. The professors will see that you mean business and are passionate about the field.


now on to professors


It is important that you get to know your professors! You can do this by joining a club related to your field and doing what I suggested above. They will take interest in you if your show that you are passionate about their field and will do anything to help you! (This help once again can be job leads, letters of recommendation, or they can even ask you to do research with them!)


Now you also want to go to that professors office hour. An office hour (correct me if I am wrong) is an hour or two they set aside each day or every other day where you, the student, can come in and talk to them if you need help. But dont just go when you need help! Go when ever you can! Go introduce your self to them! Talk to them about something that interested you in their lecture! Or ask them whats it like working in the field or what advice they can give you for going into that field!


It is crucial that you get to know your professors and they can get to know you! Numerous times I have heard professors tell me that they have students at the end of the semester who come in and ask for a letter of recommendation but they can not give it to them because well they have no idea who they are. So it is crucial they get to know you and you them!


now this has come up

&gt;Starting college next semester I always read that I should go into my profs office hours whether I need help or not. But what do I say if I don't need help? Wouldn't it just be annoying or a hindrance to my prof if I just ""pop in to say hello?""


And my answer is that you


No! they want you to come talk to them thats why there office hour is there for! Just walk in and introduce your self tell them you are ""zaj209 from (insert class here)"" and tell them you are looking forward to their class. go in chat with them ask how they are doing talk to them about your field of interest etc.


Now it is worth noting that networking will only get you so far. Do your best in school as well! If you need help, ask for it!


And I understand some of you did not do this and got great paying jobs. That is awesome. Unfortunately we are not you and this helps you maximize your future employment.


I apologize for formatting, and or spelling errors. I will add a couple of other things that I feel are important here.


If you like someone and you see them around school a lot, go talk to them! You may not see them around next semester.


If you do need help finding a job I highly recommend using your schools career office.


Also talk to your schools counseling office for help in the job market.


Apply for scholarships! Millions of dollars in scholarship money goes unclaimed each year!


If you are an Eagle Scout who is going to college in the fall I highly recommend looking at any troops in the area your university is in. Volunteer with them! Not only will it make your transition in college easier but you will be working with people from that area who may help you out. And you will at times interact with the parents of the children who may help you find a job lead after graduation.


For any one interested in Nursing (or the medical field for that matter) , I highly recommend you volunteer in a hospital or clinic. Also get your CPR and First Aid Certification done. This is crucial for applying to Nursing programs because some do take your volunteering into account when they take in applicants.


If you feel that you cannot afford college I strongly recommend filling out your FAFSA application over at FAFSA.ED.GOV


Also talk to your parents and see if they can find out if their place of work offers any scholarships for children of current employees.


If you feel that you are not cut out for college. I recommend the technical schools. Look into The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. http://www.ibew.org/

the Job Corps
http://www.jobcorps.gov/home.aspx

or Ameri Corps ::this one is great for new grads:: 
http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps

they all offer training for free.


I also recommend at looking at adult schools in your area as some do offer certifications and a technical school of some kind.


If you are interested in going into law enforcement I highly recommend majoring in something out side of criminal justice. A few of the officers I know (and a former homeland security agent) all stressed that the skills you learn in the college class room and all taught at the Police/ Respective law enforcement academy. It is better to major in something that you are interested in and or something that deals with people like Psychology and Sociology.


The reason being is if you get injured a criminal justice degree is not as versatile as a Psychology or Sociology degree.


For those of you wanting to be doctors. I have been told that you should major in what you are interested in (or minor in it) and do your prerequisite classes for medical school.

 Some medical schools require an interview and Ive been told by a couple of my friends who got into medical school that the interviewer did not really care about the biochem degree but was more interested in her Woman's Studies degree. They are looking for well rounded individuals.


I know NASA has a bit of a presence of reddit so I am hoping an employee or intern can chime in on this part. But 2 of my friends interned for Nasa and both said that when they went in for interviews they were not looking for the Albert Einsteins or the Sheldons (The big bang theory character, suppose to be really smart but anti social) to come work for them.They wanted people who were smart and sociable and could work on a team.


My final words of advice is learn a language! Being Bilingual looks great on a resume!


And if you ever need help with a resume feel free to PM me or head over to

Have a great day hope I helped!"

Looking at my options post military (current job in the military has no civilian equivalent). So looking at using my GI bill to go through the OSU 1 year program and then perhaps to a master program.  My only coding experience is codecademy HTML/CSS which I knocked out in afternoon and really enjoyed it.  I understand that it really doesn't mean anything and is less than even scratching the surface.  But I have always been fascinated with the how/why technology works, and problem solving.

I understand that the 1 year OSU program is less than ideal since it doesn't offer a summer internship opportunity so perhaps could do more like the 1.5 program if that matters.  

Providing I can do well in classes, what kind of job opportunities are people seeing? With what associated incomes? I'm interested in gaming but more interested in other tech fields. 

Is the masters even worth it initially or keep the GI bill balance in the bank for a few years to get more experience and try and do it more in an executive masters course instead of doing 3 full years of full time academics?"

I'm a university student(Canada) -&gt; (I think it's the same thing as college in the US). Anyways I'm a first year who switched into Mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science.


So this summer, I decided to take summer classes since I'm in my first year and getting an internship is pretty hard early on. Today is an usual day. Wake up, commute, go to class.


This is where the TIFU happens. I'm in a Computer science class today. I'm pretty sure this happened to others before. The classes are 3hours long and I got bored. So I casually take out my phone to browse reddit and I land on tifu something I haven't read in a while. I read a bunch of tifus and was running out. So I went into the **top from past year**. And I landed on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2mlo1u/tifu_by_outfarting_a_cabbie_on_the_way_to_the/). I was grinning throughout the read because I could relate somewhat to the guy with a exploding bladder where you just can't stop pissing. That 1 time at the movie theaters when the movie ended I rushed out to the bathroom and started doing my business. Since multiple movies ended at the same time and new sessions were about to start, the bathroom was crowded and people were waiting in line. That day, I discovered that I could hold at least 3 times as pee as the others since I stayed at the urinal and peed enough for 3 rotations, I felt bad for the guy waiting in line behind me. 


Anyways, back to the tifu. I was about to swallow (wrong word use) my good old tim horton's coffee while I made the horrible mistake to open [pic!](http://imgur.com/Jss4egJ). You'll understand if you read the other story. 


I have no idea what happened and why. I was so into the story, forgot my surroundings and had no idea what the professor was talking about. I spat out my coffee (fortunately no one was in the front seat) while the professor apparently asked a question and it was dead silent. Silence ensued. It was the most agonizing and awkward 5 seconds of my life. Then my friend yells out lout: *He's browsing a dark corner of internet: reddit*. Everyone bursts out laughing. I guess people in computer science all know about reddit. My professor then asks me what was so funny and asks me to share it with the class (I know he is also a redditor, when he opens a chrome tab, you can see most visited websites tabs as reddit) . I insisted it isn't appropriate content to show to the class, but he insisted to see it. So i walked down the stairs of shame and showed him the story. He might be a avid tifu reader and immediately saw the link to the narrated video. He opened Reddit on his computer and opened the link and we just listened and I just stood there like a frozen stick while we listened to the story of the man who passed out while his dick is hanging out pissing into the air like an angel statue all over himself.


Edit it didnt show what i typed: Everyone had a good laugh, but you know that if you ever experience anything like this. You probably want to put your head in a hole and not see anyone for the rest of the semester. I didnt look up and walked and even tripped walking back up to my seat. now probably everyone thinks I'm a piss fanatic or they will all be reading tifu tmw in class. Hi classmates :)


Tl;dr read a tifu about peeing too hard, teacher made the class listen to the story, now everyone thinks I'm a piss fanatic



Edit: Sir, if you read this, please don't show it to class"

I just graduated college last week with a double major in Math and CS. The thing is, my dream career is in federal law enforcement/national security - and not necessarily computer systems (but not opposed). More field work, even still leaning towards joining the military soon. 

I was never as passionate as my CS peers here and pursued other extracurriculars rather than hackathons and side projects. I worked, studied abroad, volunteered, never wasted my time but as for programming, I only know the bare minimums to pass my classes with average grades. 

But I never disliked it either. And I don't necessarily want to move to law enforcement right away. Right now I really want to explore the actual software world, and work for about a year before taking time off to travel and possibly volunteer abroad or go into the military. Not to mention I need the money, and I see my friends going right off into $100k+ jobs in Manhattan. 

My problem is: I feel so far behind now. I don't have any personal projects to show, I've had no internships to speak of, and now I don't even know where to begin applying. Everywhere and anywhere? Super low-level stuff? I'm in the NJ/NY area so I can't imagine there's a dearth of options, but I just feel so overwhelmed and like *I don't actually know anything about programming* that I don't even know where to begin, and I don't know what the next step is for me to take. 

If anyone has any advice or a direction to point in, I would greatly appreciate it!"

I had fucked up an unpaid internship with the state parks department during the summer of 2014. I had a internship with a museum that focused on 19th century interpretation. I was in the background, working in the archives.

One day, I decided to go to the museum. I made a remark about something the interpreters were eating for lunch. I was curious about what I saw there, because I didn't know they had that food item for the time period. (The museum has a period kitchen that actually works.) One woman got very offended, and it snowballed into an almost-fight. Not quite there, but very tense. She felt like I was being rude to her by questioning what she had, while I was mad because I felt like she was being rude to me because I was genuinely curious about the history of food. It's not something I've studied. But in any event, I should've handled that better.

The directory of my internship basically ""fired"" me (I was never an actual employee) over the phone two weeks later. No one ever approached me about it. He didn't just vacate me from the internship- he made some incredible personal remarks to me. See, I was a volunteer at the same museum 10 years ago, when I was in high school. I got bounced because they thought I was distractedly rude and disruptive to the interpreters. But in the mean time, I had undergone four successful internships, so that's what I put on my resume, not my high school volunteer work from a decade ago.

But John basically called me a liar for not bringing this up (even though, again, it was high school), and then he brought up all this various gossip that people have told him about me going back to say 2004-2007. He then kept repeatedly telling me that I have a bad pattern of behavior that I keep repeating, and told me that people find me ""off putting"" and ""creepy"".

It was batshit insane how he went off on me, especially because the guy was going off of second-hand gossip from memories that were a decade old when I was in HIGH SCHOOL that he wasn't around for, and the feeling was that because I ""harassed the volunteers"" that day it meant that I was same ol' me, i.e. basically the Devil.

Then he basically told me all these complaints that my supervisor had for me- that I thought I was too good for the internship, that I rolled my eyes at having to do basic tasks, and that I wasn't working hard enough. This after I had basically cleaned from top to bottom the entire archives, wrote a 12-page cleaning manual for said archives, handcounted 5000 slides, etc. My supervisor was a nice chick to my face, but apparently couldn't tell me that she wasn't happy with my performance because she said maybe three critical comments to my face the entire time I was there.
Then he basically told me that ""my reputation"" proceeds me, and that it's a small job field in a small state, and since then I've basically felt like the only way I can do anything professionally in my field I have to leave the state. I'm essentially blacklisted by the state parks department.

Since then I've volunteered with a small historical society to keep my degree relevant, while working odd jobs to pay the bills. I'm actually pretty well-loved by them, and they trust me enough to have a key and open and close the museum.

As for ""lessons"", I think the biggest thing I took from this is that I was pretty arrogant going into this. I thought that because I had 4 successful internships, this would be a piece of cake, and I also thought they wanted my feedback about how things could be run because I did have some very positive volunteer/intern experience. I also thought that because my original fuck-up with the museum was ancient history- 10 years ago- they were over it, and I was VERY much wrong, and I got the feeling that the administration felt like I had ""conned"" my way into the internship and were therefore looking for any kind of slip-up to justify ""canning"" me.

Above all, I learned that you have to read whether or not you're being solicited for advice/feedback on how things are run/should be run. I earned that right and respect at the small historical society I've worked with, and I did not do so at the state park.

 Finally, at the end of the day, if you feel a co-worker is being rude to you, don't be defensive and rude back and just walk away.
In hindsight, it was just an unpaid internship that I don't have to put on a resume...but it does mean that I can't get considered for any position in the State Parks department, and I feel paranoid that if I try to apply for a position in a department that's related to State Parks and this director finds out about it, he'll try to talk them out of hiring me.

I'm upset about it still, but I feel like I got some pretty good lessons out of it. It's made me much less trusting of people, though."
37fe7a,4,2015-05-27,What should I focus on now to get an internship at one of the Big 4 by the start of next year (Software Engineering Student)?,nightorday,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37fe7a/what_should_i_focus_on_now_to_get_an_internship/,"First off, thank you to everyone who responds to this. I really do need help in deciding what to focus on for the next 6 months or so. 

I'll start off with my experience. I just finished 2nd year of uni (Software Eng.) with a 3.98 GPA. I have pretty much zero personal projects at this time, never really had time for them because of school projects and part-time work.

I've done 3 major school projects (C++, Nodejs/PostgreSQL, MEAN stack). During school semesters, I've worked as a part-time web developer (PHP, MySQL), adding up to almost 2 years now. Last summer, I interned at a small start-up, web development in Grails, Redis, and MongoDB. This summer, I'm at BlackBerry, working mainly with Nodejs.

Now, my situation, and I'm sure many people here face the same situation is to figure out what to focus on. After my 9-5 internship, and on weekends, what can I do to maximize my chances of getting a job at one of the Big 4? Should I start on some personal projects? Should I practise my technical interview skills? What would you folks suggest? I hope this is useful to other students in the same situation."

Feel free to ask questions about details I may have left out.

I am a recent college graduate from a top 20 university. I have a mediocre GPA (~3.17). Some people say that is actually decent for my university, but it is worse when compared to schools that grade inflate. I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. 

I did not have an internship during college or during the summer. I also did not have a research position.

I have applied for what I feel like is a lot of jobs (around probably 100), and I have only heard from three really. Some of these are more applicable to my degree, and some are less. For example, some have been engineering, sales, and consulting. Some(probably 5 now) have emailed me about skype or phone interviews, but then they have not actually called me or responded to emails after setting up a time. 

The first one was a software consulting position. I made it to the final round, but I wasn't hired. The second one turned out to be a multi-level marketing firm that lied on the job posting. The third one is a sales position. It's sales for services to businesses, not sales to people for personal needs (PM if you want more info). I have technically accepted this job, but I am really having second thoughts now. And I don't know what I am doing wrong about searching for jobs since I have had so few responses.

This job is 100% commission(there is no base salary) based which really makes me nervous. I might be fine with doing sales, but I don't know for sure. The estimate that I would make in my first year was around $40k-$60k. I was told that that yearly pay would probably go up each year since there is residual commission.

I am expected to drive on the job as it is sales. However, they don't pay for that at all. They have training a few hours away. For that they would pay for hotel and driving there, but they would not pay for my time. 

Also, the job is in a city that I do not live currently. I am currently staying with my parents while I find a job. Because of this, I do have to sign a lease for an apartment which would potentially be my biggest risk about accepting this job. The other thing is that if I did not do well, I would not get paid much if at all... 

As far as end career goals, I believe that I want to further my education with a Ph.D. or M.B.A., but I do not know for sure. Part of the benefits of doing this is that I would use this as a gap year if I did make that decision (I have not applied to any grad programs). A job in a lab would definitely be better for applying to grad schools in a year, but I haven't really thought too much about getting a job in a research organization yet. 

I want to be able to do something requiring more complex thought and doing something more analytical. I honestly do not want to be in sales for the rest of my life. Whether that is analyzing companies' decisions through consulting, performing scientific experiments, analyzing biomedical data, or something else along those lines, I have not decided what I really want to do. 

I feel like I accepted the job because it was a job. But at the time, I was extremely excited about the opportunity, but I have grown much more skeptical as time has passed.

I am still searching for other jobs that would be closer to where I want to be in the future, but I do not really know if I will get one before I would start (I would go to training within a month). I am also looking into applying for grad schools soon and seeing what I should do to prepare for that. 

I don't really know what my all of my questions are, but I wanted to type that all out. What would others in my situation do? Is it wrong to decline a job offer after accepting it if I get a job that I would prefer? Is it wrong to just decline a job offer after accepting it just because I hastily accepted it and I later thought about it and decided that it was the wrong thing?"

I'm moving to LA in less than a week for a summer internship. I'm from a 'little big city' so my parents are a little apprehensive about being safe by myself. For instance the whole time I was in college I walked everywhere because I didn't have a car. I will have a car in LA, but I'd still like to walk around by myself and explore a bit without getting mugged/purse snatched/ etc (my mom's worry). I know the church I'd like to attend is walking distance, stuff like that.

They don't want me to go out at night but I plan on, you know, living and seeing shows I don't have access to here (coughUCBcough) and if I'm able to get a part time job it'll probably be at night due to my internship hours. 

Anyway, I'll mainly be around the Los Feliz, Silver Lake, and what google maps is just calling Hollywood areas. Zipcodes 90027 and 90028. Where I'm living is around the corner from the Chinese Theatre, if that helps. How safe are these areas (day and night)?
I've looked at crimemapping and the LA Times crime map, but I'd like to know what redditors have to say.

So, if you have any tips or quirky things I should know about living, surviving (or even driving, since I've heard about the LA traffic nightmares which I know are way less than anything I've ever had to deal with) in LA please bring 'em on!
I'd just like to keep all my money, possessions, and limbs for the summer ;)   
Thanks!

They all know, some are casually dating too, it's fine.

The latest guy I met I like the most and am the most attracted to BY FAR because he's extremely handsome, so much that it's made me lose almost all interest in the other guys. You could say I'm physically infatuated with him. I'm constantly craving to kiss him even when he's not around. 

I should add that I am his first everything and his only experience with girls. He just hasn't had the time/place or self-assurance to pursue anything before. He made the first move in asking me on a date, but beyond that I'm pretty aggressive which is why something finally happened and continued happening despite his previously reserved and tentative nature (it's been constantly improving a lot since we started dating).

Anyways, I'm not sure how to act with him or what to do. He knows he's good looking, he just also knows he needs more experience with girls. He mentions when girls hit on him/have hit on him in the past and he knows when they like him (he's not clueless like some guys). He's still on tinder talking to people (no idea if he goes on dates). Says that he's indifferent to the fact that I'm seeing other guys besides being a bit curious as to who they are. He's not good at texting which is fine but I'm used to guys making more effort to keep in contact if they're actually interested. When his mom asked if I was his girlfriend (I was not present) he said something to the effect of 'not really'. When we talked about theoretically getting more serious (if he doesn't have to travel for a summer internship) he said he wasn't sure what that would mean and that he was 'too lazy to update his facebook relationship status'. When I asked how many times we were going to hook up in the future he said ""3 (if he has to leave for an internship) or 12"" (I'm not sure where he pulled this number from but I assume its # of weeks until summer is over and he might head back to college though he's considering taking a semester off)

However on the other hand, he's said quite some time ago when I got a bit offended at a joke he made about me being kind of a 'sexual Sacagawea': ""We've both expressed some level of being unsure about what we wanted from the relationship. I try to respect that you said you wanted to keep things casual/open, but that might sometimes translate to what seems to be disinterest on my part. I think I would enjoy a more serious relationship with you despite not fully knowing what it would entail. I also enjoy what we do now. You are an engaging person, and I especially appreciate your wit and willingness to adventure.
It is hard for me to articulate all of my thoughts on this topic so what you interpret, what I mean, and what I’ve written might differ. I want to emphasize that I really do value you as an individual and friend, and never had any intention of using anyone.""   

He also always holds my hands with fingers interlaced when we're together, is very respectful, always asks what I like/would like him to do (how often to shave, a preference for glasses on or off, if I care how he cuts his hair) and follows my opinions to a T. He's stayed the night and cuddles/hugs me close like a champion, rubs my head and temples without any asking if I mention I have a slight headache, and other small gestures like asking permission to put his arm around me when we're out walking or just coming over and giving me a hug as I'm making some breakfast at the counter. He's also fairly good at staying in touch despite his lack of experience with girls and overall slight awkwardness (he went on a road trip and sent me pictures of what he was up to every day).

All I want to do is be able to keep hooking up with this guy, nothing else really matters. I'd be very happy with an open relationship in fact. 

When we find out if he's going to be staying in town for the summer should I mention it or will that scare him because it seems like he's not interested in that? Should I make some distance because it seems like he's really not interested and I need to back off? He's got me very confused and I find myself both craving him, feeling insecure, scared that I'm being used, and stressed.

Thank you for any insight as to what could be going through his head (I try asking and all I've gotten is what's written, plus we don't know if he's going to stay in town yet so it doesn't ned to be seriously addressed yet) but it's really causing me trouble and confusion. 

tl;dr: Can't tell how how a guy really feels about me and how I should act towards him. Looking for any insight or hints that I'm missing.

As I said in the title, I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering major with absolutely no experience. I typically enjoy the classes that I take, but I don't have a clue how I can use the skills I've learned in real life - everything just seems like concepts thrown around to give us general knowledge on a lot of things.
I'm actually doing really well - I have a 3.9 GPA - but it seems like school is the only thing that I'm actually good at. I have no motivation to start any projects on my own time (and, to be honest, I wouldn't even know where to start if I did), and after reading 
all of the stuff that's been said on this sub, I feel like it's going to be impossible to find a job without that. On that note, I don't even know where I would want to work (or what I would want to be doing). As the school year comes
to an end, my parents are pushing me to find a job/internship over the summer so I can have some experience (and, well, they've pretty much given up on me finding anything related to my field, and just want me to work in retail or something).
I figure it's far too late to try and find an internship now, so I really have no idea what to do. At this point it feels like I'm going to end up graduating, working at Wal-Mart, and finding some way to slowly kill myself.


Okay, maybe that was a bit melodramatic, but now that I'm a year away from finishing up college, everything is getting so real. It seems like I'm so far behind and I have no idea how to catch up. Sorry for ranting, I just feel so lost right now.


I don't know, maybe this post isn't really appropriate here, but I'd appreciate any advice. Extra info that may or may not be relevant: I've taken several classes on C++ (including data structures), worked a decent bit with Linux (especially in an operating systems class),
took a class with LabVIEW (though that was a while ago), worked on assembly language (LC-3) in one class, and am currently taking a robotics class using Arduino. Oh, and I've taken a few classes with coding in Verilog (one of them using a Spartan-3 FPGA board)."

I am living in Germany and writing an application in english is not that easy for me, could you guys take a look at this and tell me if you find something which is wrong or which i could express better.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for the internship advertised at your carrer Homepage. At your convenience, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the position and my candidacy with you. 
This Spring I graduated from the xxxxx School in Germany as a Bachelor of xxxxx. Currently I am working at the xxxxx Insurance Group as a student trainee, in the marketing Section. My Degree Program was Insurance and Finance, which also contained the risk Management, the Management of financial service providers, Insurance Company’s and Controlling. Additionally it contained courses like Economics, Law, Commercial English and Business Administration. During the past four years at my university, I gained a great theoretical insight in these subjects and during my internship at the xxxx Insurance Company I also gained the practical knowledge in this sectors. In the attachment I send you my Bachelor Certificate, the Diploma Supplement and the Transcript of Records.

I have decided to complete this party of my carrer not in Germany, but rather in Spain not only to learn more about this country and the culture which charmed me since I was kid, but also to get in touch with the work life and the work climate and maybe to put the first brick for my afterlife in Spain. Therefore I am searching for an opportunity to discover this foreign business.

The nature &amp; business services offered by your company are of great interest to me. I have learned a lot how German companies take care of their risk management, their management and controlling and I am sure I can maintain a lot to your company. I am open to be exposed to new business experiences and I am a very communicative person with the ability to tune very quickly in to new problems. I am also able to work self-contained. Not only personal strengths in analytical thinking, problem solving and identifying the determining factors of success, but also very good communication skills make me feel being the right person for this internship. 

In what has been communicated to me I hope that your company can offer me an internship position that suits my skills and interests. I am very excited to become an intern in your company. I attached my resume for your review. I can be available for interview at your convenience. Thank you for consirdering my application. 

yours faithfully....

I am thankful for every help.

As of now the only programming classes in my major have been a C class, an html5 class, and a java class I am taking this semester along with database management. 
Next semester I'm taking advanced java, scripting languages, and will be doing a for credit internship. 
I'm taking five classes this summer semester and the java class and the computer maintenance class I have to take both allow me to take a test at the end where I can get a certificate. 
Then there's also a technical certificate I can qualify for just by doing my major it seems? I'm a bit confused by this all and will talk to my college counselor about it, but I was curious on how certificates are actually seen and if they are things I should try to achieve. 

I've dabbled in C for that class and I am just stepping into Java. I feel like everything is so soon and the two years after the associates are very important because thats when you specialize and when I would learn basically everything I need to know. However, the money I had to go to school with is running low and I think I can only make it until this winter until I get a job and can afford to go back to college for my Bachelors. This is really scary for me because I feel like I wont be able to stand on any leg at a company with how inexperienced and unknowledgeable I am compared to everyone else. Would people hire me with such little experience? Am I behind where I am and so I shouldn't be expected to get a job at this time or should I have done more myself? 

I would only need a job that paid about 22k a year to go to school and take care of myself, although I would have to save to be able to handle a job and go to college unless it was part time.

I've tried to teach myself and had no idea about anything I was reading until I learned a bit in college to help me be able to learn on my own. I'm ahead in my Java class because I really do want to learn and am passionate about it, but I just always had trouble with guidance. There's no one giant book I can read that will answer all of my questions and teach me what I need to know. (If there is please direct me to it)  I haven't really been able to find a place online for support besides IRC's where people tend to mock the way I choose to practice. Besides doing the interest rate problems that the school has given me, I take time to find out how to do small game dev stuff. I do not want to do it as a career nor does it really impact anything. It was just the only thing that piqued my interest that I could think of to do on my own for practice. Is there a better way to practice other than the basic bank math in the books? That is the way these teachers are teaching. Sending us home with a book to copy the examples. Although I am learning, I need more. I'm 21 and would like to find others who are learning and maybe work on small projects with them to get better or even if there are other ways I could practice I am all ears! 

I wrote a lot, if anyone needs anything expanded on just ask! I am very grateful for anyone who reads this I know it's a lot, but I'm just pretty scared and hope that someone can shine a light on a few things for me.

During the previous summers since I dropped my faith I've always had a job to keep myself away from home during Ramadan, this summer is my first one unemployed, ironically, I'm unemployed now because of Ramadan. I worked at this place with a Muslim boss related to me, he's rarely at the shop during Ramadan but the reason why I can't go back is cause he went full blown Nazi mode and installed 12 cameras around the shop, so no more drinking water, no more eating to my heart's consent, no more cigarette breaks out the backdoor every few hours. The job is tedious, long, and I work with a fucking industrial oven, like fuck, man. If I get caught I'll get blasted on the 10PM news in Lebanon (not really but you get the point). I've been applying to jobs all over but it's so hard for me to land something because of my anxiety, no job opportunity in my lower income town, and I'm a seasonal worker. Too late tk find internships. Worse yet, this is bittersweet cause I'm on the verge of completing my final year of college and becoming an actuary; I can safely guarantee myself this is my last summer living here. 

But I have to study all summer for an actuarial exam, I gotta have my smokes, for fuck's sake I gotta eat and drink. I can't fucking stand how superficial everything is this month. My parents are generally assholes but for this one month its all reciting Quran, blasting sermons around the house, family time 24/7, and then comes riding along the feelings of uneasiness, paranoia, and isolation. 

Unlike many of you, and very fortunately, my parents - although very religious - aren't hardcore. They sense that I don't pray, I guess it's a don't ask don't tell kind of thing between us. However if they find out I don't fast it'll crush them. They might kick me out. They will ostracize me, hate everything about me, and never get over it. I cant let my parents find out simply out of respect for them; they can easily tell me to fuck off but they're paying partly for my education, if I'm feeding off them I gotta abide by their rules. 

But shit, not having them find out is gonna be fucking impossible. I'm gonna be home all the time: can't go back to my job, I hardly have friends here anymore, I just went through a recent break up, I'm taking online classes at home, I HAVE TO STUDY HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE for my actuarial exam, I'm addicted to coffee, cigs, oh and fuck my anxiety too. I'm gonna have to abuse my adderall prescription all summer to study since I have no idea how else to ween the hunger during my class and study sessions, but then again I cant do that cause I chain smoke on addy and that's not happening this summer. The fuck am I gonna do for a whole month.

Writing this eased my panic attack so there's that. I know my situation isn't as bad as many of you, so fuck it, let's all vent out why we fucking hate Ramadan."

I guess I'm basically asking if I've chosen the wrong degree or if there's other types of jobs out there that a CS degree would be relevant for? Thanks.

edit: also wondering if anyone has any advice on what I should do throughout my degree (internships, work experience, personal projects etc.) that would help me to get a good job when I graduate"

37h42w,24,2015-05-27,"I have a terrible problem with buying material things I do not need, I think I know the underlying causes, what's next?",[deleted],selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/37h42w/i_have_a_terrible_problem_with_buying_material/,"Hello,

It has been hard for me to come to grips but I have finally accepted I have a spending problem. Fortunately, it is not too severe to the point where I am in thousands of dollars of consumer debt, but it is affecting my ability to save money. 

Background: I am 23 years old, male, live on my own and have a steady job. I have a very significant amount of student loans, but I have never had a problem paying my rent, loan payments, and food (all what I consider to be my fixed expenses). In addition to my job, I do some freelance work to earn extra money. But all of this money goes to my credit card payments (which are always on time). Sometimes I have to do so much freelance work to satisfy my shopping habits that it is affecting my day job.

My problem began as far back as I can remember having an income stream (junior year of college when I started a part time paid internship), I could never **save money**. I always had to buy something new; a pair of shoes, a kitchen appliance, new bed sheets - *things I did not and do no need*. 

Interestingly, the only things I seem to waste my money on are material possessions - mostly through online shopping (amazon) or buying new clothes at stores. An example is last night I bought a decorative airtight canister to store my coffee grounds in. I paid 10 dollars for it as well as an additional 5 dollars for shipping. Now, I see what a stupid decision that was, but at the time I felt a strong need to have it, and justified that it would keep my coffee fresher for longer. I know this all sounds stupid and whiney - but the amount of money I spend really adds up.

___________________________________


I have been thinking long and hard about this, and I have identified some potential reasons for my problem:

* **Anxiety** - I am stressed out a lot, mostly due to thinking of how I will pay off my credit card and my freelance work. The ironic thing is that once I make enough money to payoff my card, I justify another spending splurge. It's a never-ending cycle. I guess buying things gives me temporary relief from my stress.
* **Trying to impress others** - I hate to admit it, but I believe the reason I want nice, new clothes is to impress my friends and other people.
* **Jealousy** - as mentioned, I have significant student debt. Most of my friends had their college paid for by their parents and come from wealthier backgrounds. Perhaps my jealousy of them makes me want to impress them with that new shirt, watch, or gadget I bought.
* **Depression?** - I think all of this contributes to me just not being happy. I feel stressed, anxious, jealous, so I buy things for temporary relief. Then I realize I have to play fast catch up to pay for it all, so I work very hard and again feel stressed and anxious. It is a vicious cycle.

________________________________

Some of you may ask or comment that if I am paying all of my fixed expenses on time, and not carrying a credit card balance, why is this a problem? 

1) As said, I am struggling to create a long term savings

2) My freelance work (which is used to buy these things) is becoming a burden on my day job

______________________________________

I have found a couple of remedies that help, but do not cure the problem:

* I opened a separate savings account, with no debit card. A portion of my day-job paychecks go to this account. The problem with this is that sometimes I do have to pull from my savings, making the past two months of saving useless
* Smoking weed. (*edit: I very rarely do this, i am not addicted in any way. i have smoked since high school and do not find it fun or a hobby, just a refreshing break from things once in a while*) This has helped me take my mind off everything and enjoy a movie or something. During these instances I do not *care* about ""what to buy next"". The problem with this remedy is that I lose motivation and clarity to be productive.

____________________________________

I don't blame you for rolling your eyes and blowing this off, but this is a problem I want to control and change. I do not know how - and I would prefer to try everything at my disposal before seeing a therapist. If anyone has advice, I would appreciate it."

I love this girl to death, and we are similar in so many ways. Even when I was living closer to her last semester (~1 hr), we only got to see each other every other weekend or so. This went on for about two months, so we were very much still in the getting to know each other phase of the relationship. Since I was to leave back to my state at the end of the semester, we agreed to try to make a long distance work. I've never done this before but I know this girl is worth it.

Recently I've become very emotional and a bit clingy. Last night for example, I got very worried when she didn't reply to my good night text. I couldn't sleep because I figured I either did something to upset her or something was wrong. So after she hadn't replied for three hours, I thought it was a good idea to call her at 2 in the morning to see if everything was alright (I felt batshit crazy afterward). I don't want to be that clingy person in the relationship and I can tell she doesn't want it either. I've noticed lately she just isn't as excited as she used to be when talking to me. She gets short and doesn't return my texts within the usual time. I don't want to push her away but her not being here just allows my brain to go off and over think things.

I just don't know if its too late already. I don't know if I can reverse how clingy I've been and revert back to how things were a month ago. I've kinda talked to her about it but I know she's to nice to tell me if she's not as excited anymore and that I have turned her off of me."

----------

Like all young dragon hatchlings, Darco was forced to find a job almost immediately after his hatching. This was part of an effort amongst the United Kingdoms to keep dragons from resorting to their primal behavior of hoarding and kidnapping princesses, or other such young, virgin maidens. This law came about much to the dismay of said young, virgin maidens who were hoping to take the easy way out for finding a husband (Salvage Laws were very clear on this fact). 

Dragons were also none too fond of this law, as now their hoards could be taxed, but many accepted it with the grace and dignity of their noble breed: by burning down several outlying villages and eating more than their fair share of sheep. After the Farmers and Merchants Unions became involved, the dragons were forced even further into a corner and ultimately accepted their fate. Jobs began slowly creeping up, mainly in security and banking, but eventually more menial jobs came available and dragons were tucked away neatly into the working class.

That was how Darco came to be a lamppost. He was very fire adept at his early age, and much to his chagrin, lost out on a bid for an internship at the kings forge. While he was top of his class on fire duration and consistency, he was lacking in heat intensity and could not get his flames hot enough to melt iron with any regularity. However, he soon came to appreciate his position as a lamppost as, being on a main road, he was privy to a large part of town gossip.

This culminated in Darco’s lamppost being dubbed the Water Cooler. Darco was freely available with his gossip, if the price was right. He had initially given away the gossip for free, something to pass the time, but once, on a whim, he asked for a copper piece for a menial piece of trivia. When the customer willingly paid, he started setting up a simple barter system: a simple copper could lead you to a small profit on a horse race, while a gold piece could grant you the name of the king’s newest mistress. Therefore, it was with much surprise when Darco saw a man approach his post and drop three gold pieces into his gossip box at the base.

Darco eyed the man for a moment, but saw nothing outside of the ordinary for a merchant. He had on a red shirt, with a singe of purple bordering the cuffs of the sleeves, showing him as one of the upper crust of the merchant class. His pants were pants, nothing special about them other than they were well tailored. Keeping silent, Darco patiently waited for the man to make the first move. He was the employer, not the employee, and sometimes people grew scared and left before they got the gossip they wanted.

The man coughed and Darco raised an eyebrow, while insuring that he kept his breathing steady. No point in getting fired for inappropriate light, even if it was over three gold pieces. However, he still remained quiet, waiting for the man to speak first.

“I need some information,” the man said quietly as he leaned back against the pole, keeping his face obscured. 

Smart, thought Darco, he knows about how I run business and doesn’t want his questions passed on to curious onlookers for a few coppers. Lifting his head slightly he said, “I figured.”

The man coughed again, covering his mouth. “I am looking for someone.”

Darco smiled to himself, making sure not to show the expression on his face. Most people could easily be tracked by the Register of Persons department. Since the man was asking him for news about someone, that could only mean this person was on the run. This was getting very interesting. “To get to the Register of Person’s go three blocks south, turn right on Baker Street and it’ll be on your left after six more blocks.”

The man almost whirled on Darco then, and when he spoke again the frustration was very evident in his voice. Obviously, he had never dealt with a gossip before, and had instead gotten all his information about town gossips from pulp magazines.  “I was hoping to keep the search discrete.”

Darco was practically rolling in laughter by this point, it was just too much. This man was practically flashing a neon sign over his head that he was upper crust society, if not by his clothes than by the way he was acting. If he had just walked up, asked his questions, and moved on, Darco would’ve barely given him another thought. However, with the cloak and dagger routine, Darco was desperately trying to figure out who his shadowy customer was. 

“Look, Sir,” he finally said after another minute’s silence, “I am sure we’re both very busy people. I recommend either getting to the point, or taking the loss and finding another snitch.”

The man moved his hand up to his face and seemed to be pinching the bridge of his nose, “Fine. I am looking for a thief. This thief stole something very precious to me.”

“What am I listening for?” Darco said, starting to feel bored. If this was going to continue like this, he was going to be here all night. Already he could see a few of his more regular customers hiding in the shadows of the alley, waiting for this stranger to finish.

“A magic crystal,” the man said quietly, causing Darco to actually sit up. He carefully eyed the stranger with a newfound interest. Only a few human men could afford the steep cost the dwarves and goblins placed on magic crystals. It also didn’t help that the crown wasn’t friendly to the use, or idea, of magic. An upper crust man like this would have a lot to lose if this got out. 

Darco smiled, “Yellow? Green?” He hesitated and said more quietly, “Blue?” He had heard about a blue crystal showing up suddenly in a small town to the west of the Capital, but until now was certain they were merely rumors.

“A blue one,” the man said after a moment’s hesitation. 

Darco whistled quietly to himself before he snorted, causing his flames to flare for a moment. He was right, which was wonderful, but also blue crystals were rare, and expensive. If a human had gotten their hands on one, finding it would be worth several fortunes. He had heard several different rumors but wanted to make sure he only gossiped about the appropriate interest. There was no point in giving away free gossip. “Any keywords,” he asked.

“I heard a rumor of a fight over magic in a coffee shop in Aspen between a dragon and a breadmaker,” the man said slowly. He turned his face up towards Darco for just a moment, causing Darco to catch sight of a long, hooked nose. Unknown to the man, he had just given himself away.

Darco smiled, “Yea, I heard about that. A breadmaker in Aspen trashed his shop and ran off after making a fuss at Pot O’ Gold Coffee. A merchant class orc disappeared a few days afterwards, and since she was seen leaving the coffee shop with the party of interest on the day in question, I assume the two are connected.”

The man straightened a small amount, “An orc? Are you sure?”

Darco scratched under his chin for a moment, and then nodded, “Yea I’m sure; Luna, or Linea, or something like that. Apparently she had been friends with him for a while.”

“A merchant orc and a breadmaker, quite the interesting combo,” the man said quietly to himself as he rubbed his hands. 

“One would think they would stand out, what with orc fashion and all,” Darco added helpfully.

“Yes,” the man said, then he turned back to Darco, “Anything else?”

Darco couldn’t help but feel a sense of glee coming over himself as he slowly shook his head, “A magic crystal goes missing from your estate, Your Lordship, and you only pay 3 gold pieces for information? A few more and I’ll sing like an opera house any time you’re around, and stay silent as a grave when you're not.”

The man chuckled to himself, pulled out five more gold pieces and placed them quietly into Darco’s gossip box. Then he looked up and Darco saw that he had been right. Duke Hearthstone, whose lands bordered the Dwarven Empire, was obviously very interested in getting his magic crystal back. His son had spent several summers abroad in Stone Mountain, the Dwarven capital, and Darco now suspected he knew why. A secret mage could be very beneficial to future interests.

Darco smiled, “His name is Morgan. Morgan Waterfront.”

Remember to let your muscles cool down a bit between work outs, you can easily replace one for the other! **Remember that rest is important!**

And don't forget that your diet is also *really* important! In addition to the exercise you do, the food you eat can make a big impact on your health: if you eat more than you exercise, you'll gain weight (whether by muscle build-up or pure fat gain), and if you eat less than you exercise, you can lose weight (whether by muscle loss or fat loss).

[](/sp) Hello, everyone! How was/is your day today? Mine was pretty good! A bit sick, but I'm alright. c:

Anyway, time for the topic! :D What is something you have recently obsessed over? Could be a book that you can't stop from bleeding over to other parts of your life; or it could be a certain part of a rap that you find yourself using in your everyday speech; or it could even be an idea cooking in your head for so long that you can see it very, very clearly.

For me, the most recent thing I've obsessed over was making a portfolio to send to a company that was offering an internship (still is, but I haven't heard from them in about a week and a half). I couldn't help but think about what coding projects to include in the portfolio, even when I was talking to my brother about video games and even when I was talking to my father about the weather. The only other thing that has had this much impact in my manner of speech has been MLP:FiM, but that was long ago.

[](/crazytwi) Whether or not you have obsessed over something recently, keep up those exercises and being generally healthy, everyone! :D"

----------

Like all young dragon hatchlings, Darco was forced to find a job almost immediately after his hatching. This was part of an effort amongst the United Kingdoms to keep dragons from resorting to their primal behavior of hoarding and kidnapping princesses, or other such young, virgin maidens. This law came about much to the dismay of said young, virgin maidens who were hoping to take the easy way out for finding a husband (Salvage Laws were very clear on this fact). 

Dragons were also none too fond of this law, as now their hoards could be taxed, but many accepted it with the grace and dignity of their noble breed: by burning down several outlying villages and eating more than their fair share of sheep. After the Farmers and Merchants Unions became involved, the dragons were forced even further into a corner and ultimately accepted their fate. Jobs began slowly creeping up, mainly in security and banking, but eventually more menial jobs came available and dragons were tucked away neatly into the working class.

That was how Darco came to be a lamppost. He was very fire adept at his early age, and much to his chagrin, lost out on a bid for an internship at the kings forge. While he was top of his class on fire duration and consistency, he was lacking in heat intensity and could not get his flames hot enough to melt iron with any regularity. However, he soon came to appreciate his position as a lamppost as, being on a main road, he was privy to a large part of town gossip.

This culminated in Darco’s lamppost being dubbed the Water Cooler. Darco was freely available with his gossip, if the price was right. He had initially given away the gossip for free, something to pass the time, but once, on a whim, he asked for a copper piece for a menial piece of trivia. When the customer willingly paid, he started setting up a simple barter system: a simple copper could lead you to a small profit on a horse race, while a gold piece could grant you the name of the king’s newest mistress. Therefore, it was with much surprise when Darco saw a man approach his post and drop three gold pieces into his gossip box at the base.

Darco eyed the man for a moment, but saw nothing outside of the ordinary for a merchant. He had on a red shirt, with a singe of purple bordering the cuffs of the sleeves, showing him as one of the upper crust of the merchant class. His pants were pants, nothing special about them other than they were well tailored. Keeping silent, Darco patiently waited for the man to make the first move. He was the employer, not the employee, and sometimes people grew scared and left before they got the gossip they wanted.

The man coughed and Darco raised an eyebrow, while insuring that he kept his breathing steady. No point in getting fired for inappropriate light, even if it was over three gold pieces. However, he still remained quiet, waiting for the man to speak first.

“I need some information,” the man said quietly as he leaned back against the pole, keeping his face obscured. 

Smart, thought Darco, he knows about how I run business and doesn’t want his questions passed on to curious onlookers for a few coppers. Lifting his head slightly he said, “I figured.”

The man coughed again, covering his mouth. “I am looking for someone.”

Darco smiled to himself, making sure not to show the expression on his face. Most people could easily be tracked by the Register of Persons department. Since the man was asking him for news about someone, that could only mean this person was on the run. This was getting very interesting. “To get to the Register of Person’s go three blocks south, turn right on Baker Street and it’ll be on your left after six more blocks.”

The man almost whirled on Darco then, and when he spoke again the frustration was very evident in his voice. Obviously, he had never dealt with a gossip before, and had instead gotten all his information about town gossips from pulp magazines.  “I was hoping to keep the search discrete.”

Darco was practically rolling in laughter by this point, it was just too much. This man was practically flashing a neon sign over his head that he was upper crust society, if not by his clothes than by the way he was acting. If he had just walked up, asked his questions, and moved on, Darco would’ve barely given him another thought. However, with the cloak and dagger routine, Darco was desperately trying to figure out who his shadowy customer was. 

“Look, Sir,” he finally said after another minute’s silence, “I am sure we’re both very busy people. I recommend either getting to the point, or taking the loss and finding another snitch.”

The man moved his hand up to his face and seemed to be pinching the bridge of his nose, “Fine. I am looking for a thief. This thief stole something very precious to me.”

“What am I listening for?” Darco said, starting to feel bored. If this was going to continue like this, he was going to be here all night. Already he could see a few of his more regular customers hiding in the shadows of the alley, waiting for this stranger to finish.

“A magic crystal,” the man said quietly, causing Darco to actually sit up. He carefully eyed the stranger with a newfound interest. Only a few human men could afford the steep cost the dwarves and goblins placed on magic crystals. It also didn’t help that the crown wasn’t friendly to the use, or idea, of magic. An upper crust man like this would have a lot to lose if this got out. 

Darco smiled, “Yellow? Green?” He hesitated and said more quietly, “Blue?” He had heard about a blue crystal showing up suddenly in a small town to the west of the Capital, but until now was certain they were merely rumors.

“A blue one,” the man said after a moment’s hesitation. 

Darco whistled quietly to himself before he snorted, causing his flames to flare for a moment. He was right, which was wonderful, but also blue crystals were rare, and expensive. If a human had gotten their hands on one, finding it would be worth several fortunes. He had heard several different rumors but wanted to make sure he only gossiped about the appropriate interest. There was no point in giving away free gossip. “Any keywords,” he asked.

“I heard a rumor of a fight over magic in a coffee shop in Aspen between a dragon and a breadmaker,” the man said slowly. He turned his face up towards Darco for just a moment, causing Darco to catch sight of a long, hooked nose. Unknown to the man, he had just given himself away.

Darco smiled, “Yea, I heard about that. A breadmaker in Aspen trashed his shop and ran off after making a fuss at Pot O’ Gold Coffee. A merchant class orc disappeared a few days afterwards, and since she was seen leaving the coffee shop with the party of interest on the day in question, I assume the two are connected.”

The man straightened a small amount, “An orc? Are you sure?”

Darco scratched under his chin for a moment, and then nodded, “Yea I’m sure; Luna, or Linea, or something like that. Apparently she had been friends with him for a while.”

“A merchant orc and a breadmaker, quite the interesting combo,” the man said quietly to himself as he rubbed his hands. 

“One would think they would stand out, what with orc fashion and all,” Darco added helpfully.

“Yes,” the man said, then he turned back to Darco, “Anything else?”

Darco couldn’t help but feel a sense of glee coming over himself as he slowly shook his head, “A magic crystal goes missing from your estate, Your Lordship, and you only pay 3 gold pieces for information? A few more and I’ll sing like an opera house any time you’re around, and stay silent as a grave when you're not.”

The man chuckled to himself, pulled out five more gold pieces and placed them quietly into Darco’s gossip box. Then he looked up and Darco saw that he had been right. Duke Hearthstone, whose lands bordered the Dwarven Empire, was obviously very interested in getting his magic crystal back. His son had spent several summers abroad in Stone Mountain, the Dwarven capital, and Darco now suspected he knew why. A secret mage could be very beneficial to future interests.

Darco smiled, “His name is Morgan. Morgan Waterfront.”

So far I've been able to change the intensity of a heat source over time (but not space), and to change the intensity with respect to space (but not time). I can make an object to use as a radiative heat source and then use that object in a motion sim, but not transfer the motion over to the thermal simulation.

Not sure what schools to apply to!,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/37hppr/help_not_sure_what_schools_to_apply_to/,"So I'm looking for some advice on what schools to apply to, I have a fairly long list of potentials that I'll list below and I'm trying to narrow it down to about 12/13 schools but I am open to new suggests. 

I graduate in May 2016 with a B.S. in Psychology with a concentration in Behavioral Neuroscience. I go to a small private university in Southwest Michigan with a strong psychology research program and a strong pre-med program (~99% acceptance rate some years). 

cGPA: 3.83; I have gotten A's in most of my PreMed classes except OChem (B and B+), BioChem (B+), and Physics (B+ and A-), A's in all other science classes. 

MCAT: Registered for 7/17 exam

State of Residence: Pennsylvania

Research: &gt;2 years of Psychology research, 8 weeks of Biomedical research (internship). In psych I've presented 3 posters, 2 at a major conference, and one of my projects is in the works to be published in the Journal of Personality Research. In Biomedical research I did a summer research internship with a medical school, I worked with a professor and presented a poster at a research symposium. 


Shadowing: 20+ hours with two physicians, I know this is a major weak spot. I hope to fix it after I take my MCAT and get to at least 50 hours. 


Volunteering: Worked as a ACT/College prep Tutor as part of a local First Tee program, this was paid/volunteer (we were reimbursed for travel and supplies with a stipend). 


Extracurriculars:

* Psychology Club: I helped to start a Psychology club on campus, I was the treasurer for 2 years, we work to eliminate the stigma and labeling that comes with common mood disorders that affect college age students. We have put on mental health fairs, depression screenings, forums, etc. This coming year am the president, I have begun organizing a ""Mind, Body, Soul"" campaign with our nutrition and fitness club and religious clubs. 

* Praise and Worship: I am part of a praise and worship band that travels to different churches putting on concerts and worship services.

* I also volunteer as an prospective student host for my university. As part of this job I give tours, eat dinners, take part in forums, etc. for prospective students and their families. 


Work:

* I work for a Cognitive Psychology professor in my program as his TA and research assistant. I've had this job for 2 years so far. 

* I am also an academic tutor for my university, I provide one-on-one tutoring in Biology, GChem, and OChem through our university's tutoring department. 


If I missed something major I can answer any questions. I will be submitting my AMCAS (without an MCAT score) on June 2nd so I hope that the MCAT won't be too much of a problem...nothing I can do now....


This is my list so far:

**""Reach schools""**

Boston University

Columbia

Perelman

Stanford

U of Colorado



**""Good fits""**

Drexel University


Loma Linda University


Loyola University


Medical College of Wisconsin


Michigan State


Northwestern University


Penn State


Jefferson University


Temple


UC - Davis


U of Illinois


U of Washington


Commonwealth Medical College


U of New Mexico


UCLA - Drew



Like I said, I'm open to suggestions. Since I'm going to college in Michigan I have a lot of the schools from the Chicago area since I am familiar with the area. I am a PA resident and I live in the suburbs of Philly. I have family in SoCal so that's why I'm looking at some schools in that area. 


**TL;DR**: 3.83 GPA, strong work and leadership roles, strong research experience. Not a lot of shadowing. Where do I apply?

I'm going to be living in Oakland very soon for an internship and I was hoping to use my bike as my primary form of transportation.

37hs1m,2,2015-05-27,I (21F) think I'm falling for my best friend (21M),Totoro143,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37hs1m/i_21f_think_im_falling_for_my_best_friend_21m/,"He's from my class in university so we've been close friends for 3 years. We've always been good friends and we share a lot of good and funny moments but this year we've been having several internships together during six months, just the two of us, so we became even closer. It reached a point everyone thought we were dating or involved somehow, and I mean everyone from friends to family and even coworkers from the places where we had internships. Everyone commented and we'd laugh and say we were just really close friends. I think it's important to mention that since I started university and until a little over two months ago I was dating someone. 

We have a lot of complicity, we are always laughing about everything, we really understand the way each other thinks  we already have some actions that are usually associated with couples. Some weeks ago I started thinking about him in a different way and even started to think that he was more attractive than I used to think before. I tried to brush those thoughts off because I know he's been talking with another friend from university who is on erasmus. But now we started another internship and the people who work there are really cool and since day one they've been asking us about what we feel for each other, if we're sure we're not dating, why are we not dating, what don't we like about each other... They're always pointing out how inseparable and close we are, how we act like a couple, the way he looks at me being really sweet and caring. This is making everything worst because we're more conscious that we really act like a close couple and also because trying to answer their questions makes me realise that there really is no reason for me not to like him (when they ask me what is it that makes me not like him I just have no answer.. And to be fair, he never knows what to answer either and it's not like we have problems insulting each other, if it was needed). Since we're working there I've been feeling deeper feeling.. In front of everyone I always say I couldn't date him, there's nothing romantic going on, he's not the man for me or I'm out of hours league (in a joking environment) but with him I feel jealous when he mentions the other girl he's talking with (if he wasn't taking with her I'd be 100% sure he liked me as well), we've been having more sexual related talks and personal jokes, I feel more physically and sexually attracted to him, feel like I need physical intimacy (not sex). And no, I'm not feeling lonely from my break up, I was feeling great being alone, actually!And even though I have these feelings, the back of my mind tells me that we wouldn't work out as a couple, for some reason. 

4 weeks from now I'll have another internship in another town and we'll be separated. We love to imagine we would end up working together one day but it's probably never going to happen, so we'll probably separate forever.  My question here is, despite what he might feel or not, should I tell him how I feel? Or somehow let him now I'd be open to try something with him? Should I just keep this to myself forever and save the friendship? It might just be a passing feeling that will go away, but I think it's becoming more real to me.


TL;DR:  Getting closer with my best friend, probably starting to have real feelings, don't know if I should tell him something or keep this to myself."
37htv9,1,2015-05-27,Taking the next step into the rest of my life,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/37htv9/taking_the_next_step_into_the_rest_of_my_life/,"After only a year and a half, I've decided to commit to stop smoking. I know that's a minuscule amount of time relative to some of you, but here is my story. 

I can barely remember why I started smoking, but it had something to do with my friend group in high school, and just plain curiosity. But unlike a lot of stoners who are introduced to weed by their friend circles, I started for the opposite reason. I ran in the high-academic achieving circles, and for some of those kids, the idea of smoking weed was basically abhorrent. A few texts later, I had my first dime bag, and a few failed attempts at smoking later, I got high for the first time. 

For me, weed was kind of love at first sight. At first, it was so innocent and pure. I was always an intelligent and introspective kid, and I felt that weed enhanced the depth of my thinking, writing, and creativity. Senior year, I wrote some of my best college application essays while high. The real turn for the worse was when I used my Christmas money from last year to buy a vaporizer. Now, I could get high quickly and discreetly pretty much anywhere, anytime. No longer did I have to worry about papers, smell, parents, or anything like that. 

I tend to have an obsessive, or even addictive personality, and weed reeled me in right away. Though I don't want to rant about the underlying psychology too much, weed complemented a lot of my natural negative tendencies. In other words, it just made it so much easier and so much more acceptable to accomplish nothing and fill my time with video games, compulsive masturbation, and mindless internet surfing. I was never a social person, and weed just amplified my typical antisocial behavior even more. I mean, why struggle to interact with people when you can smoke a bowl and play video games for hours?

Much like everyone else, I began to smoke/vape more and more over time, and 2-3 times a week eventually became 2-3 times a day. 

Perhaps the worst aspect of this is the fact that unlike my friends, I am not in college, but also not accomplishing much of anything. Miraculously, I managed to get into a top-10 university, but my acceptance with them stipulated that I would be taking a gap year before attending. 

On paper, that gap year represented potential to travel, learn new things unrelated to school, and grow as a person before stepping into a highly competitive and rigorous academic environment. For a short while, I was really committed to self-improvement, and getting girls for the first time in my life. 

But in reality, I've burned this precious year away. I have no motivation to study, to learn, or pretty much do anything that requires concentration or effort. Pretty much the only thing I have consistently done is Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, which often feels like the only thing I'm living for or looking forward to these days. 

Though I had an internship with a start-up, I squandered that opportunity. I didn't enjoy the menial work that I was assigned, but weed made me so complacent, that I made no effort to change anything. Eventually I started to ""work from home"" more, and I'm sure you know where that leads. As it stands, I haven't been in the office for over a month, I straight up disappeared.  

Worst of all, I have this hazy feeling that I've been sleepwalking through life. Whole chunks of time came and went without my knowing, as well as all the feelings and emotions associated with them. Weed truly is just a band-aid, one that just prevents you from digging down into your thoughts, emotions, and feelings. 

It was yesterday when I realized how the commitment I made to self-improvement a year ago has seen virtually zero progress. As fate would have it, I soon stumbled upon this sub. I've made so many excuses to myself, told myself I'd cut down or quit, or tried to justify my weed habits, but to no avail. 

Now however, I'm done being controlled my my virtual addiction. I'm sorry that this was terribly long-winded, but it's been far too long since I've gotten all of this out. Hell there's probably so much more to say. Still, thanks for the support and the read. I'm so glad I found this community. Now however, I am confident that I can take the next step into the rest of my life.

37hwyz,221,2015-05-27,The Frenchman,acatnamedcharlie,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/37hwyz/the_frenchman/,"I'm one of those people that's had the misfortune to have a few creepy encounters in my life. I've been fortunate enough to come away unscathed from each of them. So there's that. 

I decided to make this the primary and first post I've ever made because I think this was as close to being hurt as I'd ever been, and I am eternally grateful that it turned out okay. 

This was a few years ago when I was an undergrad and I lived in an apartment just a few blocks from University. A trolley would come round to pick up students from our apartment complex. I first noticed him at my stop. I had never noticed him before, but I noticed that he was very attractive; sort of ""rocker"" style with tattoos and shoulder length hair.

I didn't think much more of it, just boarded the trolley, and put in my earbuds listening to music as I drifted off into thoughts about class. I was staring out the window but when I turned my head back, I saw him sitting across from me and he was looking at me with a smile. I politely smiled back and quickly looked back out the window. He was very attractive and I got bashful.

I kept my eyes out the window the rest of the ride which wasn't very far, they way he had looked at me just gave me butterflies. I got up to get off at my stop and he got up as well. I started walking to class but he walked right up next to me and tapped me on the shoulder. I sort of jumped, turned and he was smiling. I could see his lips moving; I took my earbuds out. ""I'm sorry, my music."" He just grinned. In a thick French accent, he said. ""Hello. I saw you on the trolley. I find you exceptionally beautiful."" My cheeks caught fire as I stuttered out a thank you. He told me he would like to take me on a date. I agreed and we decided on drinks that next night downtown, which was walking distance from my apartment. He asked for my phone number, which I gave to him.

He texted me only a couple hours later telling me he was thinking of how beautiful I was and couldn't stop thinking about me. He said this in various ways a few times the rest of the day. I found it flattering, but it was a little intense looking back. I dunno, I just assumed it was his culture. Either way, I didn't find it that weird.

At 3 am he texted again, ""can't wait for our date"". I did find this a little weird being three in the morning, but again gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

I didn't have school or work the next day so I got up early to take a morning run down by the river. I should mention here that I lived right near the trolley stop, I mean literally 50 feet from it, in a ground floor apartment. My patio door opened right out onto the lawn and where the river runs, so as I stepped out I could see the trolley stop just diagonal to me. Before you think I'm too much of an idiot, I had requested a second or third level apartment being that I lived alone as a female, but they did not have any available, and I was on a waiting list for the first one.

Anyway, as I stepped out I saw him and a couple other people standing at the trolley stop. He also saw me and I waved back at him. He waved me over. As I walked up, he said something a little weird, ""now I know where my muse lives"". I just smiled awkwardly. He then offered to walk by and pick me up for our date, since he lived in the apartment complex. I agreed. I told him I was headed off for a run, said goodbye. I was still not getting any real weird vibes at this point. He watched me run off.

That night I got the knock on my door. I opened the door, and he immediately tried to push his way in, but I just stepped out on the porch before he could get through. He gave me a weird look, but then smiled and pecked my cheeks. I immediately noticed liquor on his breath, but brushed it off thinking he might have been nervous. We walked the short distance into town, and he asked what I was majoring in. I thought I heard him scoff when I answered ""biology"", but when I looked at him, he was smiling. 

At the wine bar, he ordered for us, which I didn't mind, him being most likely better versed in the subject. He started asking me a lot of questions but would interrupt as I answered, which again I just found slightly rude  and chalked it up to cultural differences. Looking back now, I think he was probably tipsy. I found out that he wrote for the arts and culture section of the local newspaper. I recognized his name. He was a writer, and attending University for a Masters degree in journalism. We had some of this in common. I am also a writer; mostly poetry and short stories, but I was also an intern writer for the arts section of the University paper.

As the date went on, I noticed a lot of strange behavior. For one, he gulped his wine, rather than sipped. He would have about three glasses to my one. This was a red flag. As I said, he was already drinking when he arrived, so I immediately noticed that there could be an alcohol abuse problem here, which I'm fairly sensitive to since both of my parents are recovering alcoholics. I don't want none of that, so despite how attractive I found him, and how serendipitous our commonalities, I was really starting to get turned off.

Also, he kept checking his text messages almost every two minutes, which I found extremely rude. About 45 minutes into the date, his tone changed a bit too, and he started, sort of, mocking me and the major that I had chose, saying things like, ""why would an artist like you go into something as mundane as biology?"" (which isn't the degree I ended up getting anyway, but I digress). This wasn't said at all in, like, a flattering tone, it was very scoffing and mocking. I was pretty much over the date at this point, but not totally ready to throw in the towel, figuring it might just be the subjects we were on, and, ugh, please don't judge me, but he was so hot.  :/

I got up to go to the bathroom and texted my friend from there. ""At wine bar with the Frenchman, may need exit strategy. Will be in touch with update in a few"". She 10-4'd and I headed back, and from the hall, I could see him at the table CHUGGING down another glass of wine. 

When I got back, he asked if I'd like to go to another place ""with better atmosphere"". I okayed, against my better judgement, and we headed out. We walked 2 blocks to a place called the Red Feather which was pretty much a martini bar.  I wasn't really into drinking anymore, but I knew they had some good food so I figured I could get a snack. There was a line at the door, so we were waiting for a little bit. He kept checking his phone and when he would look up from his phone he would lean in for a kiss and I would kind of back off for a couple of reasons: 1., I don't make out on a first date, and 2., I was not into his clumsy advance. He would just laugh and say sorry, but kept trying to do it, which was really starting to piss me off a bit. 

When we got in, I told him I didn't want to order any more drinks but was just going to order a snack. He insisted on ordering two martinis despite this. By the time my appetizer arrived he had finished both of them. I decided it was time to dip out, so while he was texting somebody, again, I texted my friend to give her the update that I would be walking home and to meet me at my apartment in in 25 minutes (she also lives in my complex).
 
She asked if I was okay, and I told her yeah, just grossed out. She said ok, that she and her boyfriend were watching a movie and would be over afterwards. No problem. 

At this point, I decided to just ask the rude Frenchman who he has been texting the entire night and that I found it very rude. Again, he just laughed. Then he gave me a very strange look, one that gave me chills. He got very serious, and said, ""what I think is rude is your asking my into my business."" I apologized. Then he said, ""but since you want to know, it's a girl that I fucked last night, and she's mad I'm out with you."" No smile, no laugh, he was straightforward serious. I sat shocked for a few seconds, half expecting him to laugh. I told him I didn't know what to say. He said, ""Don't ask if you cant handle the answer. Besides, obviously I like you better."" I was utterly disgusted. I got up and told him that he can tell her that she doesn't have to be jealous because I was leaving. 
 
I walked in a fury all the way home (only about 3 blocks). I couldn't believe what a fucking creep I had wasted my last 2 hours on. I got home and slammed the door. In my rage, I ran into my bedroom typing out my text of disgust to my friend. She texted back that she was so sorry and would be over soon.

I changed into my oversized shirt, and got on my laptop. About twenty minutes later, I heard someone on my porch at the back door. I figured it was my friend and her boyfriend, since she lives on that side and always comes to that door. A knock on the door. I yelled out, ""just a sec"" as I went to throw on some sweatpants. I hadn't done any laundry so I had to dig through a big pile to find any clean sweatpants, so it was taking a minute. A harder banging on the door. ""Oh my god girl, give me one sec, I can't find my pants!"" I said laughing.

I heard the door click open and I realized that I must have forgotten to lock it in my rage. I still wasn't alarmed, I just thought my friend figured it out. That is, until I stood up out of my closet and the Frenchman was standing at my bedroom door. In absolute horror, I let out shocked screech. He did that creepy thing you see in horror movies where a stalker or killer puts his finger up to his mouth and makes a shushing sound. 

""What the fuck are you doing in my house?!"" I screamed, my eyes darting back and forth around the room for my phone or a weapon of defense. I could see neither. Panic swept over me. He calmly replied, putting his hands up, “I just want to apologize, please don’t yell.” I told him to get the eff out again. He was about 10 feet from me, standing where he was blocking both my exits, the window and the door. I had no idea what to do, but in that moment, my fight or flight response was necessarily both. I decided to bum-rush him and run. 

It didn’t work out as planned. He was very muscular, and I was tiny (5’2”). Even with all the momentum I could muster up in 10 feet, it barely moved him and he ended up just putting me in a bear hug. I tried to scream but he cupped his hand over my mouth and nose, so that I couldn’t breathe.

“SHHHHHH” he kept saying. “I just want to say sorry to you.” I kept wriggling, but he was just way too strong. I could barely move, even though I was using every ounce of force in my body to try and wriggle out. This went on for about 2 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. I was weakening. He took his hand off my mouth and shoved his tongue into it. I recoiled violently, so he grabbed my head and stuck his tongue into my ear. I was trying to pull away as hard as I could and yelled stop, but he kept going. I tried kneeing him in the balls, but I missed, and this just made him angrier. He sort of let out a growl, and I winced thinking he was going to hit me.

Then something surprising happened.

Instead of hitting me, he let me go by shoving me backward toward my bed and closet. I fell backward onto my knees. He started to cry. “Why are you so cold?” he was asking, almost whining. “I love you, but you are just so cold”. 

I was in absolute terror, but I was also totally confused by this. I had literally just met him. I just stared up at him, frantically trying to decided what to do next. My couch was right by my bedroom door, and he stepped back and sat on the armrest and just stared at me with tears in his eyes. I decided I was going to try and book it past him. 

Just as I flinched to jump up, there was a knock on my back door. “HELLLLLP!!!” I screamed as loud as I have ever screamed in my life.  My friend and her boyfriend burst in, looking totally confused. The Frenchman was already booking it out my front door. 

I was screaming frantically and my friends boyfriend went booking after him. My friend was freaking out, asking me what the hell was going on. I was so frantic I was just grabbing her and crying and screaming. She just dialed the police and told them she thought I was raped. Her boyfriend came back but said the Frenchman had run into the wooded area of the park and he had lost him.

When the police arrived, I told them that I had not been raped, but was definitely assaulted. I did not know what apartment he was in, but gave them his name and what I knew. 

Turns out, he had a couple DUI’s and he was charged with assault. I didn’t ever see him again, though I had this terrible fear that I would run into him, even though he was evicted. I never felt safe in that apartment, and I moved out 2 weeks later to a whole different complex. My friend stayed the night every night until I moved. 

I am so amazingly grateful that I had texted my friend to come over. I shudder to think about what may have happened if she and her boyfriend had not shown up right when they did. It almost makes me sick to contemplate. 

Frenchman, let's not meet ever again.

TL;DR I had the date from hell. Might've turned worse after he broke in and assaulted me, but saved by friends. The End."

As of now I think I am able to get a discount on HP laptops through my internship, so im going with HP for cost reasons. I am heading to school in the Fall and want something that will be good for schoolwork, but I also want to be able to play some games (mainly league). I've been looking at the HP Envy 15t. The stock version of this laptop comes with 4th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4720HQ Quad Core Processor + Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600. Wanting to run games close to high or on high settings (mainly league) I was wondering if it was worth 140$ to upgrade to 5th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U Dual Core Processor + NVIDIA GeForce GTX 850M 4GB Discrete Graphics instead of the stock processor. With the 140$ upgrade im looking at 750$ or so without discount. Is this worthwhile or should I keep looking?

i'm making this as short as possible and leaving out a lot of info. i was not a christian going into college. someone invited me to a campus ministry weekly meeting. i went every week for the whole semester. i was not ready to be vulnerable and be in a small bible study (i had just gone through something rough and was not willing to talk about it). during the summer i prepared myself for very not fun conversations about things i never talked about. the next semester i went to the bible study every week learning cool stuff and was starting to let god into my heart.

i was convinced to go to a winter conference sponsored by the campus ministry. it was very scary because these people are all about opening up, confessing sins, even the very embarrassing ones, you know...being a christian. but these people at the conference (around 5k total) were really living their lives for christ. they didn't and don't care about what other people think of them, and i really admire that. eventually the conference had an alter call, and i surrendered my life to christ.

it has now been a couple years after that conference and i am still living (trying) to live the christian life. 

i'm a video production major and i was accepted to intern for this conference this summer. that's so cool that i get to help build the conference that helped my make my decision to follow christ. i am so sure that this is where god wants me this summer. i'm excited to help lead people to christ through the thing that helped lead me to christ. very very cool.

****i didn't use capital letters because i like the casual feel of all lower case. 

i could also use prayer, because i leave in a few days and have not raised all of my support. raising support has been a lot harder than i thought it would. asking people for money is kind of a tough thing. i ask you to pray for my willingness to ask people i'm not comfortable asking and ask people to give a lot of money (heh)."

It's not great news, obviously.

Bit of background; I had stomach cramps on and off for about 2 years, and had been in and out of the doctors office every couple of months to try and see if I could get it sorted (I always thought it was just IBS). Most doctors thought it was IBS, but I finally had some blood tests and a colonoscopy, which led to a diagnosis of Crohn's. I'm on steroids (prednisolone) at the moment (80mg/day for a week, tapering to 60mg/day after a week, then again to 40mg/day for 4 weeks) to try and reduce some of the inflammation / go back into remission. I'm not having much fun on the prednisone - I barely sleep, I pee all the time, I'm always hungry and it's giving me a little anxiety and a few mood swings.

But that's not really my biggest worry - I'm supposed to be going to Switzerland for 3 months for an internship at the end of June and I'm pretty nervous that the doctors will say that I won't be able to go or will need surgery. The last year of my degree is coming up soon as well, and I'm not sure how this diagnosis is going to affect my life (and my grades!). I'm not sure how severe my Crohn's is, either - I'm supposed to be going for an MRI in a couple of weeks to get looked at and then hopefully I'll know more. I'm just kind of hanging in this no man's land at the moment waiting for more information taking this medicine with no real aim and yeah. Just kinda not sure what to do with myself.

Aaaaargh! This sucks.

Sorry for the rant :P"

I would like to get a car in order to get a better job off campus, get an internship next summer, and be able to move myself in and out of college and live other places without completely relying on my parents help to move me around.

I have had two credit cards for about 6 months now, have a good credit score, and perfect payment record. Clearly I have poor history however. Plus I only work 20 hours a week max, at my two on campus jobs. I am budgeting for a 4k to 8k car. I would have a down payment of 1500 ready this summer. I would finance the rest with my credit union. Unless there are any better ideas?

My question, is this a decision I will regret later? Is there something I am not doing right? Is a car going to break my limited income and send me into a hole?

Besides the inconsistency itself, there was a clear accepted ""correct way to do it"" in this case (it was Python which has the official PEP8 coding style guidelines).

I realized that I've always taken this kind of sloppiness as a reasonably strong negative signal for hiring. That somehow it means the person doesn't have a strong sense of ""taste"" in coding nor good attention to detail.

Ive been roughly unemployed since before Thanksgiving. I had enough funds/sold enough to scrape by pretty much until now. I had an internship with a company through my college for about two weeks before they decided I wasn't what they wanted qualification wise. I haven't been able to find a job since. I even applied for a student employment job, which I was hired to, they waited on me for three weeks. I even passed by another job that would have interfered with the scheduling between my classes and the student job. Now I find out today the school revoked my employment eligibility due to the fact I live with family. I clearly have not made enough to live on my own or pay rent, and paying 'rent' to family even with proof is apparently fraud so they'll refuse that. 

I live in a town with really shitty job prospects and the industry I worked in is horribly toxic to my mental health (PTSD/Bipolar). I've even struggled trying to find a minimum wage job at this point. 

Add to all of that I've got an ex gf that I still care about who has decided she is now transgender and trying to reconcile how I feel about her and watching her start to transition I feel like I'm overloading. 

I've had a few friends out of state offer me places to live, help me find a job, etc. A large part of me really wants to take them up on it but I'm so afraid of moving and being stuck as a failure that I start to drag them down. I know I'm just tired of feeling like the walls are closing in and not feeling like I have any way to escape."

Particularly I'd like to talk about ASP.NET.

What I currently have is a simple webpage made using ASP.NET in visual studio. My general task is to access a database, get the info from the database, turn the data into JSON, and send that data to a python script which will then parse the JSON and do stuff with it, etc.

I am able to get as far as making the JSON object. I can get the user to download the json object as a file, but what I really want to do is just pass it through the network by accessing my web site from the python script using urllib2. This is where I have become completely lost. There are so many terms I've never heard of before, things like services, web APIs, controllers, routing and all these things I've spent hours digging around in and following basic tutorials but still cannot find a firm grasp on the concepts let alone how to accomplish it in a practical manner.

To be completely clear here are my goals:

1) Send 5 parameters using urllib2 in python to my asp.net site

2) use these parameters to query the database and get a json object (COMPLETE)

3) return the json to the python script

Now I know Barstool is mainly a comedy blog but there are some sports being posted weekly. Only problem is it's teams from Boston, NYC, Chicago etc.. Not everyone wants to read about what's going on with the Orioles or the Bears. I think having more teams available to the readers would help grow Barstool and eventually lead to other cities forming on the site. Plus more T-Shirt designs = more money.

I am thinking of taking out my first car loan and I am a little overwhelmed. I have lurked on here for a long time but figured its finally time I asked for advice. 

Some Background:
I am going to be graduating from college this December, with $32000 in loan repayments starting June 2016.
My monthly income right now is $1500 a month working as an intern. After I graduate, there is decent chance I could get offered a position but nothing is guaranteed, and I have nothing else lined up yet. Right now my only monthly expenses are $300 for rent, $50 for car insurance, and $30 for phone with food/entertainment being around $200 (and thats me not living a frugal style life). 

I am looking at buying a used 2013 Nissan Altima for $9990 with 25,000 miles on it. The loan I can get calls for 0 down, 3.9% interest and monthly payments of $129. This will be a 84 month loan. I have figured out that my car insurance will go up from $50 to $80 a month (Yes I know it is more, but I get assistance with my car insurance payments so this is all I have to pay). 

I am just nervous about having such a long loan, is this a bad thing? My expenses really won't go up much at least in the next 2 years outside of student loan payments. I just really want to reward myself for using my beater for 4 years in college and finally getting a nice one, but not having a job for sure lined up after graduation makes me a little weary. "

**2nd Place - Amtrekker - $411M ($39M)         -      $80 -           5.1**

Eight straight. Andrew has maintained his grasp on first place for nearly two months now, gamely holding off *Age of Ultron*-led Amtrekker longer than anyone--save, perhaps, the Guy From Queens himself--believed possible. By the time you read this, Amtrekker may have finally reeled GFQ in, but with twice Amtrekker's remaining budget, odds are good that GFQ wrestles back the advantage.

Amtrekker will certainly extend their lead when they go head to head in two weeks: GFQ's *Entourage* vs Amtrekker's *Insidious 3* and *Spy*. While we expect each of John and Brett's offerings--particularly *Spy*--to out-perform its purchase price, that will exhaust Amtrekker's ammunition. GFQ will still have *Max* (the non-Mad variety), *Magic Mike XL*, and *Paper Towns* (this year's candidate for *Fault in Our Stars* dollars) on deck. 

**3rd Place - Frogpants - $279M ($132M) - $72 - 3.8**

Brian and Scott must be liars, because Frogpants is on fire! They've taken real advantage of releasing three of the league's four movies over the last two weeks, earning $248M in that short time. After just those two weeks, *Pitch Perfect 2* is the second-best buy of the season with a 7.0X multiplier, *Mad Max: Fury Road* is on the verge of cresting $100M, and each seems destined to take in significant dollars for weeks to come. The reboot of *Poltergeist* made $26M, and while--

Should this event actually come to pass, we will do our best to make you aware of exactly what form the impending apocalypse has taken.^1 We now return you to coverage of the (possibly abbreviated) Summer Movie League.*]


**4th Place - Night Attack - $73M ($49M) - $37 - 2.0**

""So *Hot Pursuit* bombed. Big deal. It was our lowest budgeted movie; we can make that up easy. Hell, *Tomorrowland* should do it by itself--Brad Bird, Clooney, Disney--a lot lesser combos have hit $200M-plus. If it opens at $70M, on a long holiday weekend, we'll be fine.""

""Hey, we've been in deeper holes than this. $43M from *Tomorrowland* isn't what we hoped, but it's not chicken feed. What's next? *Aloha*? Well, say hello to our comeback. A Bradley Cooper summer movie? If this thing does half of what *The Hangover* did, we're right back in it.""^2



**5th Place - Cordkillers - $37M ($1M) - $16 - 2.3**

So, Kristi... Mulango... how's it going? You guys good? Another million dollars, huh? That's... nice. Using the ol' tortoise strategy, right? Cool. Okay, you guys hang in there.

^1  A recent survey shows that 97% of Cleveland sports fans would take this deal.

I'll start with some background: I'm 25, my mom is 49 and we've had a sexual relationship since I was 19.  

My mother and I had always been very close, my father traveled a lot for work when I was younger and would sometimes be gone for over a week to up to a month at a time.  We both knew that it was the nature of his job, so we kind of came to expect it and it meant a lot of time just my mom and I.  Nothing sexual ever happened when I was younger or anything like that, we were just very close.  My mom was upset when I graduated from high school and went away to college because she was losing such a constant in her life.

It was around that time that my mom started to become annoyed with my dad.  He had always traveled a lot and it was understood that he would have to miss certain things and that plans that were made in advance might have to be changed, but more and more frequently he was canceling on her at the last second and missing more and more.  We even had to postpone a family vacation when I was on break my first year of college.  I could tell by her voice when we talked she was getting annoyed and frustrated with him.  The straw that broke the camel's back however was a visit he and my mom had been planning to come and see me.  I had stayed at school the summer between my freshman and sophomore year because of an internship I had gotten and hadn't seen my parents in awhile.  They were all set to come visit and my dad had to cancel last minute.  I'm told there was an argument and my mom said she would come anyway on her own.

She was very excited to see me when she got there, but I could tell she was upset with my dad.  We went out to dinner and came back to my dorm to just spend some time together.  She was snooping around and found some alcohol, which she yelled at me for having, then proceeded to pour herself a drink because 'she needed it'.  Then she started to vent about my dad, which isn't totally new to me.  She complained about the usual things, how he makes a mess, how he saves so much junk, how he buys so many unnecessary things, etc..., but this seemed to go on for longer.  She started getting more personal, talking about their relationship, the frustration of him always leaving, canceling plans, things like that. I validated a lot of what she was saying, I could tell it had been bothering her for awhile.  I guess she felt pretty comfortable, because she started venting about their intimacy and eventually their sex life.  I was a bit uncomfortable that she was telling me all of that, and she could tell.  She apologized, but didn't know who else she could talk about it with, so I told her it was okay.

She let out a big sigh and said that she wished my father could be more like me, that I got all of his good qualities and seemed to be missing the bad.  She proudly made a comment that it was how she raised me and wished she had a man like that.  She started prodding me about my relationships and said if she were my age she would be after a guy like me.  It was both flattering, embarrassing and awkward, but she was laughing and having a good time, so I joked around with her.  We played with hypotheticals and that if we had met each other on the street we wondered if we would make a good couple.  Then she asked if I thought she was still attractive.  I told her of course, I've always thought my mother was beautiful.  Then she dropped the big one, she asked if I wasn't her son, if I would sleep with her.  The question caught me off guard and I was hoping she would follow it up with a ""just kidding!"", but she was serious.  I settled everything down in my head and said ""of course"", trying to both not hurt her feelings but also trying to avoid the awkwardness of the situation.  She smiled, and gave another hypothetical of, what if no one knew?  I knew at that point things had taken a turn and the line between hypothetical and possible were blurring.  I smiled and tried to laugh it off, and she giggled as well, trying to make it seem like a joke as well.  She then 'joked' that we should 'try it out', but I could tell she was serious.  We went on like this for another few minutes until we got to the point where we both said ""alright, lets try this"".

We locked the door and headed for the bed, my mom taking off her clothes, saying she felt so naughty and giddy, but was excited.  I followed after.  Things happened quickly, it was amazing how fast we started touching each others genitals once we were in our underwear, and once those came off how quickly everything seemed to happen.  We tried to avoid eye contact at first, it was very awkward.  As strange as it was, we both actually ended up really enjoying it.  Once we had a rhythm, things just felt good and we kind of went with the flow.  We actually surprised ourselves with how much we liked it.  

We felt a bit strange about it afterwards and things were obviously different, but 6 years later we are still doing it.  We thought it would be fun to come here, post a short version of our story (there's obviously a lot more to it), and answer anyone's questions.  It's so nice to know there are others out there like us!"
37jli9,1,2015-05-27,[22/m] My girlfriend (21/f) suddenly broke up with me so she can find out who she is again.,AceMike493,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/37jli9/22m_my_girlfriend_21f_suddenly_broke_up_with_me/,"**Backstory** We started dating two years ago (May 26th) and she broke up with me 2 weeks ago on May 18th. We started our relationship doing long distance because I was doing an internship and she was working in her hometown four hours away. When we reunited in September we hit our first major relationship bump: two of her ""friends"" she met over the summer at her job invited her over to a house party when she had to return for a weekend family outing. These no-longer ""friends"" of her's pretty much got her really drunk to take advantage of her. When she returned to school after the weekend she told me what happened I said nothing will change between us, I trusted her, and she had my support.

Then, a couple weeks later my mother passed away. We were both extremely hurt by both of our unexpected, tragic events and did our best to keep the relationship going. She seeked counseling at the University's counseling center in addition to the support I provided her and I leaned on her for the support I needed. The relationship remained strong and we were both extremely happy with the progress we were making going into the new year.

The next year, 2014, she started to make more guy friends which made me jealous, but I trusted her. Except, there was this one friend of hers that I had a hunch about and didn't like him. We got into several arguments (no yelling) about this guy. She saw him as just a friend but I thought he was looking for more. This past spring he eventually texted her a dick pic and she finally realized what he was after. She told me the second she got the pic and then felt extremely bad for starting so many arguments with me over him (she was even suspicious about him a couple of times). Naturally, from this I started feeling more suspicious about every guy that tried being friends with her, but I trusted her.

This past school year was extremely stressful for the both of us, I was taking two, very time consuming, year-long capstones courses for my majors and she ended up taking 5 courses her fall semester, 6 her spring semester, on top of 3 school office jobs she had and a scholarship program. From this, our relationship took a hit. Whenever he hung out we usually just did work, but we did our best to keep the relationship alive with romantic and cute stuff. 

This past January, with the stress of everything happening around us I thought we should take a week long break to get a breather, problem was, we were so madly in love that the break only lasted a day and a half before we ran into each others arms again. 

In March, I reached my peak in stress again we started to bicker about the simplest of things, like who will sweep, doing laundry, keeping my room clean instead of throwing stuff everywhere (she essentially lived with me even though she had her own dorm room), me driving her to the store or an appointment since she has no car, or picking her up at the bar when we should go out to dance with her friends. I tried to distance myself to learn what I wanted from her but on her end she saw it as me rejecting her love and just neglecting her. After several weeks, when one of my capstone projects came to an end I realized what I wanted and it was her!

April was amazing, except for one small issue, her first love started messaging her again. She never dated this guy because he ditched her before something ever happened (she told me about him and what happened between them before we started dating), but I knew it wasn't good. She told me about how she felt because I didn't have a good feeling about this guy and so I asked her about him, I said to try to leave her past behind her and focus on the now, but I didn't want to be controlling and tell her to delete him from her phone, facebook, etc. At this point I had never been so in love with her and she was still in love with me. She left to go back home on May 15th and when I saw her before she left we talked and decided that we were extremely happy at, where we were in regards to our relationship, and where we were going. Then, when she returned home, her first love wanted to get lunch with her so she did. The next day I was messaging her but she was short with me, something was up. She said she was trying to stay off her phone because she needed to get into the habit of going technology free since she has an internship at a nature camp this summer and are only allowed an hour per day (roughly) for phone, internet, etc. 

Then, May 18th, I Skype'd her to chat about her weekend. After a couple of seconds of silence while talking for several minutes she said ""I want to break up. I need space to grow and find myself again"" I said ""Ok."" and hung up. I was furious. This completely blindsided me. In the next few days she texted me back after several very, long, heart felt messages I sent her. She said, ""I don't want you to wait for me and try to grow into who I want you to be. I want you to grow into who you want to be. We are not on a break, we are broken up. I don't want to give you the wrong impression that I plan on coming back after summer. All I plan is to become someone I am happy with and learn to be okay leaning on myself. I am not as peachy keen as you may think, but I need this so I'm sticking by it until I am happy with myself. This is difficult enough to have you hurt and I wish I could take away the hurt, but I would be failing myself and what will make me happy. I love you and will always love you.""

Over the next few days she told me that seeing her first love again for lunch made her uncertain about what she wants in life. After a weekend of no contact I had a dream about her and messaged her. She told me to come down to her for our would've been two year anniversary, so I did.  I brought her the gifts I made for our two year while we were still together (scrapbook of everything we saved, roses, chocolate, hand written note apologizing for the stress I had and promising I would make it up to her, etc). She cried and hugged me tight after reading and seeing everything I made. We hung out all day and really enjoyed each other. I had several breakdowns but she helped comfort me. I felt bad that I was the only one crying but she said the only reason she wasn't was that she just suppressed all her emotions. When I got to my car to go back home to hugged me and cried again. 

During my day down there we agreed that we would go on a date come August/September and see where we were at and then decide where to go next: either try the relationship again with our new, turned over leaf or stay broken up. Which made me feel a LOT better, but it still hurts knowing that there is probably a coin-flip chance of not getting back together.  

**Summary**

* Had an amazing two years with large bumps and small arguments about simple things when we were both extremely stressed near the actual breakup

* Sudden breakup by her so she can learn to be independent, learn to manage her jealously and insecurity, and love herself again

* She tells me not to wait for her

* She's uncertain if it'll take just the summer or years to find herself again. She mentioned ""maybe I just need the summer"" at one point

* She won't be anywhere near her first love for the summer since she'll be a camp counselor 7 hours away from him, and then back at school 2 minutes away from me in August to do her scholarship research work 

* She wants us to go on a date after the summer to see where we're at

* She loves me incredibly, but not in love with me at the moment

* She chose to breakup because she doesn't want to hurt me in the process of finding what she wants, who she is, and figuring out how to control her jealously and insecurity 

* She wants to be friends if we never start the relationship again but I told her it'll hurt me a lot (at least right now I think this) if I become just her friend since I want to be her boyfriend

* When we started two years ago I promised to her that I wouldn't give up on her, but most importantly, us. She hasn't forgotten that promise.

* She can't/hasn't said anything bad or wrong I did because there isn't anything to say. (Sources: herself and family members that seen and talked with her during the relationship and after the breakup)

I'm still deeply in love with her and want what's best for her. I want to see her happy and I really hope we can start again in a few months, but I'm just very torn on how I should feel right now because she told me not to wait for her while she figures out who she is. She said, for my benefit, it would wise not to contact her this summer, but I should try contacting her if I must/need someone to listen. I can't just give up on her, that's why I decided to see her on our would've been two year, to fight for her and show how much I love her. 

With all that said, i'm just conflicted on how I should feel.

Any advice on how I should feel, what to do (she isn't changing her mind right now or considering other options, I've tried), or how another woman mind might perceive her thinking/logic and what everything could mean from a different perspective is greatly appreciated. 

**tl;dr** Girlfriend broke up with me to have space and time to grow to find out who she is again but never explicitly ruled out us not happening again in the near future.

Also, How tough are the classes, say compare to ME or EE classes? I'm good at math, also like business to an extent. Will I find IE classes enjoyable?

To see your beautiful face that I hadn't seen since February. It had been 10 awful months of working to try save up for the trip to see you. It had been 10 awful months of missing your face because we were long distance. I miss you and god know's how much I love you. I still do. I hate you didn't let me see you, I was getting on that plane, I was about to get on that plane to see you after having worked so much to see you. You broke my heart as I was packing stuff, as I was ready to get on that long waited trip to kiss you.

I've missed you since we broke up and I've missed talking to you every single day. Some days are better, some days it hurts less. You log in every day into that chat we met and I miss you. I miss how you'd talk to me and how we'd laugh but instead you log in now and talk about your new guy, talk about how happy you are, how proud of him you are. You never made me feel that special. You began dating him 10 days after leaving me. You met him while we were together. I never was that special, you never spoke of me like you do towards him. The way you speak of him and act towards him are much different than you were towards me. You talk about what you're getting him for his birthday, and how excited you are for his gifts and you seem extremely excited. You were different towards my birthdays, you usually broke up with me right before it and got back with me on it. That was your gift for my bday, our relationship. It was always the same though, you don't think I wanted something from you? Or the thought that you actually came up with something for my birthday? I guess you never did. 

For your birthdays, I flew across the country to see you. To spend that day together to shower you with love and show you how much you meant to me. You on the other hand broke up with me leading towards my birthday, and every year for 4 years we got back together on my bday. Incredible present.

I dated someone after we broke up but I know she was just a rebound. Sex with her was repulsive as I wish it was you, I waited 4 years sexually with you because you wanted to wait till marriage. I genuinely loved you and thought why not. You seem to have no issue sleeping with him. You look forward to it. I guess I was just never good enough. I lost my virginity to a girl, that I dated for a while and not to the girl that I wanted to marry, I lost it to someone that wasn't you. You lost it to someone that wasn't me. Amazing, how quickly you forgot about marriage right after you let me. 

You treat him so well, and treat him as a gem when with me you treated me as garbage. I cry over you here and then. I miss hearing about your family, people that I never met and we dated for so long. I miss your little sister, your dad and mother. You say it's weird that I love them, that i'm a creep. I saw your sister grow up from pictures, videos, she's my little sisters age. I love her. I dreamt about meeting her. I hate someone will meet your family before me, that he will meet them. That I never will. I was hidden as I was some bad guy. All I ever really did was love you. 

I lost a lot of weight after we broke up, I got in the best shape of my life because I wanted to surprise you that hey I look good now! At the end, it doesn't even matter. It's for me. I'm healthier now and I guess I thank you for that motivation. Everyday, I hate seeing you login into the chat we met and see you talk about him, see you talk about sex and about how happy you are and how great he is and this and that. It crushes me. Yet I never say anything bad.

You said how proud of him you are for what he has done to get an internship in his own fathers company. You never really sounded proud of me even though. You knew I didn't have a mother. So it was all on my shoulders. No matter how much I worked or how proud i was that I got a new job offer or a better pay or increased sales in my dads business. It didn't matter. All you ever said was ""meh."" 

I don't know how I love you. I don't know why i'm crying as I write this or why I'm writing this. I used to be a hopeless romantic, now I don't believe in love. Thanks for showing me the cruel reality.

[Advice],RedStarburstsAreBest,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/37jtkr/first_job_advice_which_is_a_better_choice_for_me/,"Hi guys! I'm hoping to get my first job this summer, but unfortunately, being in a small rural town leaves me with few options. So far, I've found two that seem viable, but which seems like a better choice? (Warning: this might be kind of lengthy. If you take the time to read the whole thing, thank you)

1. A guy who goes to my church runs a small t-shirt business and is offering me a summer internship. One pro of this is that I could possibly use the experience. I'm not sure exactly what I'd be doing (going to talk to him this Sunday about it), but since I'm working towards a career in visual arts/illustration, having experience designing t-shirts might be a good thing to put on a college application. Additionally, I would only be working 2-3 days per week, leaving me with a lot of free time to tie up some loose ends before my senior year and spend time with my friends. However, the cons are that it is located about an hour from where I live, and since it's an internship, I probably would not be getting paid. I don't have a lot of money of my own right now, so I'd be having to borrow my parents' money for gas. Also, I won't even have my license till the end of this summer (yes, I  know that I shouldn't have put off getting my permit, but that's a long story). My mom is willing to drive me, and even though she's encouraging me to do it, I feel like it'd be a burden for her to drive 4-6 hours a week and for me not to be able to pay her back. Also, I'm not entirely sure how much t-shirt-designing experience I'd get. For all I know, I might just be taking inventory, sweeping the floors, etc. (as I said, I'm hopefully going to get clarification on that soon). Unfortunately, I don't think that I'd be designing t-shirts to sell because they already have paid, professional artists. However, the reason that he offered is because he knows that art is my passion, so I figure that I'd be doing something beneficial. My top school of choice is a pretty competitive art college, so I could use all the experience I can get.

2. A friends' parents own a small cafe that's just a couple of minutes away from my neighborhood. If I worked there, I'd probably either be waiting tables or running the ice cream bar. The pros are that they like me and know that I'm pretty responsible so I have a good shot at being hired, and the atmosphere in the cafe is just great all around. I'd be in as stress-free of an environment as possible, and everyone who works there is extremely friendly and easygoing. Transportation wouldn't be an issue because either my parents could drive me, or I could get a ride with my friend if we had similar shifts (he currently washes the dishes). I know that I wouldn't be getting paid very much, but it's better than what I'm making right now (aka nothing), and everyone has to start somewhere. I really want to make some money on my own because I'm tired of being broke aside from the money that I'm saving up for later. The only major cons that I can think of are busy hours (it's one of the only restaurants in my town, so it's really popular) and that if I turn down the internship offer, I might be missing out on a huge opportunity.

There is pretty much no way for me to do both things because I already have a lot of summer projects and other things on my plate. Does anybody here work for a t-shirt company and have a good idea of what it'd be like for a newcomer? Would I be getting valuable artistic experience or just doing busy work? Would the cafe be the best place for me to start, or would I end up missing out on a greater opportunity? If any of you are applying to/got accepted into art colleges, what are some other worthwhile experiences to be involved in over the summer? I'm just really kind of stuck right now and need to make up my mind as soon as possible.

Edit: Clarified a couple of things. Also, grammar."
37jvf5,1,2015-05-27,Hi CS Career Questions! I'm a recent college grad and I would like to share my story and experience,tismythrowaway21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37jvf5/hi_cs_career_questions_im_a_recent_college_grad/,"Hi Reddit. I'm graduating from UCI in two weeks, and I would like to share my experience in hopes of encouraging other hopeful computer science prospects and those who are worried about software development jobs in general.

2 years ago, I started UCI having transferred from community college. Having only 1 year experience of programming (Java to be specific) under my belt, I was nervous and felt out of place. I signed up for one of the early hack-a-thons in the year, but was severely discouraged when I realized I was little help on the development side. However, I knew that I wanted to leave school the best programmer I could. I spent my entire Junior year taking curriculum classes; Data Structures, C\C++ courses, **AS WELL AS** software development courses. I emphasize the softare development courses because I believe these ones were the most applicable to my education. During the end of the Spring quarter, I attended my school's Career Fair, and ended up receiving a callback from a small startup company regarding a QA intern position.

Here's where the fun starts.

I BLEW THE FIRST ROUND INTERVIEW. However, I was called back for the second round interview (to this day, I'm not sure how). During the second interview, I maintained my lack of confidence in my computer programming knowledge behind my extrovert personality, constantly chatting away with interviewer to come across as someone they could work with. And I was offered the job.

During the summer and throughout my senior year, I worked as a QA engineer intern at this startup, sitting in on development meetings, learning the company's product in and out, learning extensive testing methods, and becoming familiar with how software development works on a real-life software product (as compared to school projects). All the while, finishing up my senior year classes; Operating Systems, Compilers, Databases, Networks, etc....

I finally mustered up the courage and pushed my company to interview me for their Associate Software Engineering position, and was offered the job title of my dreams, utilizing the language I wanted to be working with (C\C++).

So, here are my best advice tips for prospective students, or others who claim to experience the ""Impostor Syndrome"" on countless occasions:

* Try to score an internship, especially QA work. THIS WILL GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR, and I promise you, will generally build up your knowledge as a software developer/engineer much better than school will

* Pick a field of development (web development, embedded systems, systems engineering, database work....) and learn the languages surrounding it. Do I know Javascript, PHP, HTML, Ruby, Python, or any of the fad languages? No. I was generally not interested in web programming. I was more interested in (I'll tread lightly here....) lower-level programming languages like C\C++\Java because I enjoyed that style of programming more.

* Be your-personable-self. For real. No one wants to work with a stuck in the mud, or a jerk, or a slacker. It is not hard to train someone (who knows the fundamentals) to code at a company. It is, however, almost impossible to train someone to be personable and to be a good co-worker

* Don't sweat the small things. Really. Someone once wrote on this subreddit, ""People are never amazed when someone who is amazing at guitar says they've been playing for 20 years. But you know, the same goes with programming. No one is going to be a master programmer in 3/4 years. There are exceptions, but you cannot live your life comparing yourself to these exceptions...Give it time.""

To wrap it up, here are my statistics as I end school:

**TOTAL TIME SPENT @ COLLEGE** - 5 years

**GPA ON EXIT** - 3.01 (woo)

**SALARY** - $62,000 (living in socal)

**JOB TITLE** - Associate Software Engineer

**LOANS** - $20,000
I hope I have encouraged even one of you to keep on keeping on. Feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to answer. Thanks for reading. "
37jwvu,13,2015-05-28,I did a job interview for a software internship today. Definitely not as confident going out as I was coming in,Velovix,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/37jwvu/i_did_a_job_interview_for_a_software_internship/,"So I did a second interview for an internship position today. The first one was online and went great, but this one was in person. Most of it was comprised of an employee telling me their process there (code reviews, version control, etc) which went fine. All I needed to do was listen to him and it was very interesting.

Then he gave me some tests on subjects I claimed to be familiar with, and that's where things kind of went downhill. I didn't know most of the terminology being used, and so while I tended to be familiar with the concepts when I was told what a term means, I was mostly in the dark beforehand.

Specifically on a Java test, I'd never done any concurrent Java work, so I was unfamiliar with the synchronized keyword, so I had to ask about it. I admitted up front that, as he could probably tell, I had not worked with this corner of Java before. In response, he said that he thinks I hadn't done much Java work at all. That kind of stung.

I catch myself feeling like a coding hotshot sometimes, which is really silly of me and goes to show that I know so little, I don't know what I don't know. As someone who just finished their freshman year in college, I really am in no position to feel learned. I love programming and really enjoy learning about it, but I think I bit off a lot more than I could chew here and I obviously had not learned as much as I thought. Reality checks are tough!

Anybody else had disheartening experiences like this?"

My SO is at the apartment we leases, paying the rent and has been there for the past 2 weeks, I need to get up there and stop working - I don't have any income currently (college student) and was relying on this job for it. I feel like a dick.

My car won't he fixed in the next few weeks because the company has a 'queue' they go by. Honestly, it's bullshit because they didn't even fix the issue and it cost me a grand to get these non-repairs.

I have about $150 left, I feel like I need to do something - I feel useless... But what can I do? Am I just being a moron and overreacting, or is my stress valid... I'm wigging out."

I'm gay. Is that a problem in Delhi?

In dlls, how much you spend on an apartment? From the cheapest to the most expensive.

This could sound stupid but how Indians see us Mexicans? Is a positive thing? 

How safe is Delhi? I mean, walking in the night alone is a thing?

Please don't mock about my questions,I'm so interested into traveling and would love if you help me.

Have a nice day guys!

EDIT:
I dont know where I'll be, I just know its in Delhi. My salary will be like 400-500dlls, I don't know if this could be enough to live there.

I'm no effeminate at all, but I'm a little worried that could be uncomfortable having no one to have fun with, I mean, gays sometimes need other gays to just chill around.

My female friend who just recently found out, was willing to make something work out between us since the girl was kinda reserved/shy. Everyone's noticed she gets picked up from work every night and we recently did some speculating as to who it was and tonight when I walked out of my workplace I just had to drop the question. And the bomb she dropped on me consisted of two words in conjunction that make up the worst phrase that no man ever wants to hear ""my boyfriend"". Her FB indicated no such man and none of me or my numerous co-workers ever suspected she had one, since she's never ever brought him up. 

I'm more shaken up than I'd like to admit, not really at her, but just my whole pattern of attracting and being attracted to taken girls. I've had a few chances to get some p**** but it was because of that reason, being insecure/fearful, or not willing to compromise, that I haven't gotten any yet. Throughout college I abstained from dating because of laziness, anxiety and confidence issues and now that I've graduated and have done self improvement and situated myself into a workplace with tons of co-workers enough to build a social circle/foundation yet again, I've learned how harsh it can be in the dating world. Like shit, I've always been convinced there were no cute single girls and now I'm SURE of it. 

I'm sick of being the only person in my social group that doesn't get any action and that shit needs to change now. I'm 22 years old and SO FAR behind in this game that I can't help but feel inept and hopeless. I've made progress socially these past 6 months and I'm more confident now than ever before due to: a consistent weight lifting program, meditation(1-2 months so far), and I guess nofap recently. I've been forced to interact more and as I result I've been more social and have garnered new friends who I can vibe with as a result of that and really down to earth friends at that. I can't control who I'm attracted to but I do REGRET not having taken action sooner and being more open and friendly with my peers. Being a homebody has set my life back so much and I'm not letting it get the best of me again.

Funny thing is, I don't even feel like relapsing right now on my 12 day streak and I probably won't feel like it tomorrow either. I'm so done with this shit and I got WAY too much shit on my plate to be wasting time and energy on that. As much as I like the people at work, it's not stable and there's way too much labor for the pay we get. Many of my close coworkers have left as a result so  I applied to a job my friend recommended, got a call back for an interview and GOT THE JOB, all in just TWO DAYS. I've yet to put in my leave but I will probably do so once I find an internship of some sort to fill up my hours. 

I try my best to look ahead but I can't help but feel like I'm on some time constraint when it comes to dating, social life, self improvement, career furthering, ESPECIALLY dating. I'm less hopeful about it than any of the other 3. "

""What? After we ate all that food? But... it was *so much*.""

""I get hungry after every 4 hours."" 

He just said it like it was a normal fact. 

We went out to all you can eat Korean bbq for lunch last weekend because, after screwing up my undergrad career and spending more years in school, I finally got lucky and now have a paid internship lined up. We were celebrating. We skipped breakfast and lifted weights beforehand. I ate so much that I didn't feel hungry until the next afternoon, but it was like... business as usual for my bf?

 To be fair I don't remember him eating any more meals that day but he always snacks. I hate it. We're 5'7"". We're the same height but he weighs 60 POUNDS more than I do at 195. There's no way you can write that off as muscle, he has an obvious belly. 


Like WTF?? If the amount of food you eat doesn't actually have any bearing on how hungry you are, then are you *really* hungry in the first place? Or is it just a mindless habit to eat every 4 hours? I really don't understand. Are his hormones really so shot as to keep him this way? I don't doubt that he feels *something* but it's like his body isn't mobilizing food properly. 

Another thing that really depresses me is that I'm probably the reason why he's gained weight. He was 150lbs when we met and ballooned up after just a year. I'm down 10 lbs, because I've finally overcome my eating disorder. I've suffered, agonized, hurt myself, and *learned from my mistakes* for the past 5 years to get to the point where I am now. To eat whatever I want, enjoy it, and maintain a healthy weight. I've earned that shit. He hasn't. But I can't say that, because he stressed from work, and still lives at home where his mom is diabetic and literally hoards coupons and food (seriously they have no space on the island). I try to help by cooking stuff and working out together but I'm tired and it's not enough."
37kq3o,7,2015-05-28,Where did all the good interns go? Anyone finding entry level talent to be slightly underwhelming these days?,wanttoshreddit,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/37kq3o/where_did_all_the_good_interns_go_anyone_finding/,"Essentially I've noticed a trend recently that there's just a massive quality drop in interns now from how they were 5-6 years ago here in London. 

I only ever work with companies willing to pay at least min wage (Here we pay £15k for an intern and over three months if they show promise/talent we take them on with £18k + £3500 in expenses). and it used to be that would be a good stepping point for anyone fresh with a degree. 

But those that are applying or working alongside us now just don't seem to have the drive. They don't know much about Reddit, barely use Tumblr, and have little if anything by way of personal projects.

Methods and strategies are outdated, understanding of the consumer is limited, and honesty I'm really tempted to just start targeting instagram influencers and seeing if they want to come on and get on board experience or not as they do show they understand how to maintain an audience. 

I've been chatting with a fair few people around my work circles (Silicon roundabout, London) and we're generally in agreement. I find it rewarding to mentor those that have this promise however this last year is proving fruitless. 

Anyone else seeing this or is this just a UK issue?

37l9pb,6,2015-05-28,Skydiving Is The New Mortgage: Changing Rites of Passage,Biz_Innovations,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/37l9pb/skydiving_is_the_new_mortgage_changing_rites_of/,"This is my first Thought Leadership/Content Marketing piece as a college Intern and I wanted to share it with Reddit and ask for y'all for some feedback and constructive criticism on the topic!

If you were born before 1980, was buying a car, a house, or finally being able to pay off your student loans a first milestone of your adulthood?

Not for Millennials. The “experience economy” is on the rise. According to a study conducted by EventBrite, 78% of Millennials report that they would rather spend money on a desirable experience over a similar desirable physical product.

Millennials’ purchasing habits are not aligned with accumulating all the seasons of “Seinfeld” on DVD like their parents. They’d more likely pay top dollar to attend a live taping of the hit TV show “Big Bang Theory.” (So if you were holding onto those DVDs to auction off later, let me save you the time: Millennials don’t want them.)

Experiences are what intrigue Millennials. They don’t want physical objects (other than their shiny new iPhones). With Millennials expected to overtake Baby Boomers by the end of this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is vital to take their purchasing decisions within the marketplace into account.

Roughly 55% of Millennials surveyed reported that they are spending more on live entertainment and experiences than ever before in their lifetimes. That said, it is no surprise that 72% say they would like to increase their spending on experiences rather than physical things in the next year, according to EventBrite. “’The good life’…may be better lived by doing things than by having things,” echoed Cornell professor Thomas Gilovich.

He has a point. The rites of passage for Millennials and previous generations are changing. Owning a home with a white picket fence, porch, and two-car garage housing the typical suburban minivan and trusty sedan used to be enviable. Those days are seemingly in the metaphorical rear window — which is not to say that sipping iced tea with friends on the porch on summer nights, with only the fireflies to keep you company, is dead. That experience is still alive and well.

While previous generations bought homes to showcase that they had arrived as fully independent adults in the world, consumption patterns now are starting to make that goal a distant memory. With the rise of spending on experiences, the traditional milestones that would have marked important life moments are being pushed back and become less relevant.

Millennials may continue to buy homes, but their reason for buying is purely functional: They need a place to live. It is not to plant their flag on the metaphorical new island of adulthood, like generations past.

How does this help your business?

You’re probably wondering: Why do I care that Millennials think experiences are more valuable than products? You should care, because understanding this can help your business’s Millennial employees and customers now and in the future.

Here are some practical ways your business can complement the experience economy by rethinking the employee experience:

Rather than giving cash bonuses for exemplary performance, firms can offer excursions to Southeast Asia, for example, providing the opportunity to visit places employees might otherwise never get to experience.
Instead of marketing jobs as requiring travel for two weeks a month, market the opportunity to explore  different countries and cultures.
According to EventBrite, 69% of Millennials experience FOMO (fear of missing out). Focus on this by marketing jobs as unique experiences rather than opportunities to make money.
Skydiving is one way the new generation showcases their arrival to adulthood. Instead of saving for a down payment on a house, many younger Millennials skip school on their 18th birthday to jump from a prop plane.



Approximately half of all skydivers are between the ages of 16 and 39, according to the United States Parachute Association. Compare that to the number of Millennial homeowners: “The home-owning decline for young Americans was led by those in the 25-29 age group, for which ownership was 33.3 percent; and those in the 30-34 age group, for which ownership was 47.5 percent,” according to an article in U.S. News.

The age-old aspiration of home ownership seems to be fading, while for Millennials, jumping through puffy white clouds is the new symbol of adulthood and independence.

Hope they don’t land on your house.

In the winter I'll have graduated with an **associates degree**. As of now the only programming classes in my major have been **a C class, an html5 class, and a java class I am taking this semester along with database management. Next semester I'm taking advanced java, scripting languages, and will be doing a for credit internship.** I'm taking five classes this summer semester and the java class and the computer maintenance class I have to take both allow me to take a test at the end where I can get a certificate. 
I've dabbled in C for that class and I am just stepping into Java. I feel like everything is so soon and the two years after the associates are very important because thats when you specialize and when I would learn basically everything I need to know. However, **the money I had to go to school with is running low and I think I can only make it until this winter until I get a job and can afford to go back to college for my Bachelors.** This is really scary for me because I feel like I wont be able to stand on any leg at a company with how inexperienced and unknowledgeable I am compared to everyone else. **Would people hire me with such little experience? Am I behind where I am and so I shouldn't be expected to get a job at this time or should I have done more myself?**

I would only need a job that paid about 22k a year to go to school and take care of myself, although I would have to save to be able to handle a job and go to college unless it was part time.

I've tried to teach myself and had no idea about anything I was reading until I learned a bit in college to help me be able to learn on my own. I'm ahead in my Java class because I really do want to learn and am passionate about it, but I just always had trouble with guidance. There's no one giant book I can read that will answer all of my questions and teach me what I need to know. (If there is please direct me to it) I haven't really been able to find a place online for support besides IRC's where people tend to mock the way I choose to practice. Besides doing the interest rate problems that the school has given me, I take time to find out how to do small game dev stuff. I do not want to do it as a career nor does it really impact anything. It was just the only thing that piqued my interest that I could think of to do on my own for practice. **Is there a better way to practice other than the basic bank math in the books?** That is the way these teachers are teaching. Sending us home with a book to copy the examples. Although I am learning, I need more. **I'm 21 and would like to find others who are learning and maybe work on small projects with them to get better or even if there are other ways I could practice I am all ears! Also what kind of projects should I make for my portfolio? I have no idea what to make that would be impressive**
I wrote a lot, if anyone needs anything expanded on just ask! I am very grateful for anyone who reads this I know it's a lot, but I'm just pretty scared and hope that someone can shine a light on a few things for me.

**edit: are there any places that like to mold their employees in a specific way anymore? can i truly intern somewhere where they teach me the ropes? or are there any other options for me?** "

37ldt9,4,2015-05-28,"3 years in the real world, thinking of pivoting back to software development, need some advice",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37ldt9/3_years_in_the_real_world_thinking_of_pivoting/,"Hi, I'll try to keep this short but I'll probably fail, anyway, here I go:


So, apparently it's been 3 years since I graduated from a top state school with a software engineering degree. I made a few key mistakes: I did not do an internship, and I decided not to take the OOP/design patters class. When I was interviewing during my senior year, not taking that class really bit me in the ass. This threw me into a bit of a panic, and I pretty much stopped applying because I couldn't handle technical interviews. (I'm not one of those people that graduated but can't code, I swear!) 


Tldr on my job history: 1st job data, reporting, process improvement, programming used as an additional tool. 2nd job, mostly database development. Very small amounts of actual software development. If you want more detail look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/33lbvn/for_hire_relocate_anywhere_databusiness_analyst/


So going forward, I see two options: 1, I could try and stay the course with the data type stuff I was doing. Main problem is I have zero statistics background, and I don't really know if I would like to get into that type of analytics. Finding jobs that match my criteria has been very difficult. (I found one at Google, was a perfect fit, I actually made it to on site but I guess I flubbed it. Sigh.) I'm also not the best speaker (unless I'm either extremely comfortable with the topic or the people, and even them I can be a bit shaky. Doesn't help much with interviews, either) so that knocks off most of the more business analysty type roles. I also expect the salary cap to be somewhat low. 


Or 2, what I'm currently exploring; pivot back to full on software development. 


My main concerns, and what I would like to get advice on:


I've been out in the real world for 3 years, and I don't really have much to show for it. My work has been somewhat relevant, thankfully, but I don't think it's enough. I would actually compare most of my professional programming to coding personal projects. 


I don't feel confident or qualified enough for mid level roles, and I feel at a huge disadvantage on junior roles. I really don't want to take a pay cut, either. (making 60k in a mid sized city.)


And that's not even taking the technical interviews into account. I've done a few so far in the past few months, and what usually happens is that they ask me some concept questions, and I know the answer, except that I don't know that I know it. Working by myself for three years I touch on a lot, and know a decent amount, but not necessarily the terms and stuff. I suck at memorizing facts. Every time I would go back to Google a question, I would just facepalm and go ""oh, THAT'S what he was referring to."" (At least this stuff I can work on and improve with relative ease.)


So I guess I'm just looking for some general advice,
or motivation, or anything that could help. 

My current plan is to throw some of my ruby scripts on my empty github, and then come up with a few things I want to do (probably c#) and throw those up on there as well. I'm contemplating taking one of those data structure courses on corsera or similar, to help brush up on terminology. I'll also probably pick up ctci (or maybe just use one of those coding challenge sites) just to help exercise my mind a bit on random problem solving. 


Thoughts? Suggestions? Am I a lost cause? My plan is a bit overwhelming, and finding the time to do it all is going to be a challenge in of itself."
37li9y,0,2015-05-28,Tips for a Swedish student temporarily living in Seattle this fall,OkayRedditHereWeGo,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/37li9y/tips_for_a_swedish_student_temporarily_living_in/,"Hi! 

Im a Swedish student moving to Seattle this fall and i am looking for some tips and advice. Where to live, which events i have to attend, places/restaurants that i need to visit. 

So here is the situation:
I will be working (as an intern) in Auburn so I will need a car. I have never bought a car before, my plan so far is pretty much search for a car with a reasonable price (3-4k$) by a dealer on craigslists. I feel buying from a dealer probably limits the risks of getting scammed. Is there anything else I should think about when purchasing a car?

I am really easygoing and have lived in different setups of people before and I guess the easiest way for me to find a place to stay is to again search on craigslists for rooms to share. I have thought about putting up an ad myself in ""rooms wanted"". Is that useful and if so when would you put it up, 1-2 months before you will need the room? Most ads in rooms wanted is really close to move in date, which i find quite strange. I've been a ""victim"" for two scam attempts when moving to new places already, and I assure you I will not send any money before I get to meet the person(s) IRL. 

Any tips on areas where to share a room (or even my own apartment) for maximum $1000 (ofcourse i'd prefer $600) which has relatively easy access to the highway to Auburn, and possibility to find parking? Back in Sweden I like to go to restaurants and go out for a couple of beers with my friends, and thus like to live near the city centre. However I plan to work a lot during the weeks and I do not have any friends in Seattle. Which leads me into the next thing, where do I hang out? I'm not very sporty, although i love to snowboard and go out for a run from time to time. Otherwise sports a quite good way to meet new people. 

Some questions that are probably impossible to answer as they vary from person to person, but shoot I'm all ears for any tips or advice.

37llo4,1,2015-05-28,Finding StoredProcedures and Views in an RDL (might be vague),Ruple,SQLServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQLServer/comments/37llo4/finding_storedprocedures_and_views_in_an_rdl/,"I've been on-again-off-again working with the software engineer and the database admin at the company I intern at on putting together a parser for .rdl's that pulls things like the Data Set Name, Query Parameters, etc. from an .rdl and exports it to a .csv, but we recently realized that the parser also needs to grab functions, stored procedures, and views. However, in order to get it to do that I need to know the .rdl tags for those things. 

I guess the biggest problem with finding the tags is that while pretty much everything else we're pulling from the .rdl shows up in just about every single report, only some reports use views, functions, and/or stored procs and that complicates things. 

The other day we lucked out and found a report that calls a function just by picking one at random, but we've got way too many .rdls to try and dig through them one-by-one. The best we can do is narrow it down from every single report to a few folders of reports.

so

37lpmp,5,2015-05-28,Astral projecting during sleep paralysis?,strangechic,Sleepparalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/37lpmp/astral_projecting_during_sleep_paralysis/,"The first time I ever experienced sleep paralysis was easily the most terrifying. Since it had never happened to me before, I had no idea what was going on and was convinced an evil entity was after my soul. I was taking a midday nap after coming home from working an early morning internship and vividly remember the dream I was having before the SP occurred. 

I was walking in an attic, not sure if it was my attic but it very well could have been. I was holding a lantern up to read some intricate markings on the wall, most of which were based off of zodiac signs. I stopped on a marking of my zodiac sign (Scorpio). And that’s when I saw myself staring back into my eyes, only it wasn’t me, it was my evil doppelganger trying to steal my soul. She(me?) leaned over to kiss me in an attempt to suck out my soul, and that’s where the sleep paralysis began.

I opened my eyes and I could see that I was in my bed. I could still hear this evil being speaking to me like she was right in front of me, it was a more sinister version of my own voice which royally freaked my out. She was saying things like “You can’t get away strangechic, I’m taking you”. I tried to move and scream, but I couldn’t even breathe, let alone speak. In my feeble attempt to scream I tried my hardest to move myself out of my room, this is where I believe I may have astral projected out of my body. My bed is a few feet away from my bedroom door which was closed at the time. I remember being on the floor and doing an army crawl type move to my door. As I reached up to open the door handle, I was suddenly back in my bed, in my body. 

I was extremely shaken up for the majority of the day and had trouble sleeping that night because I was afraid of it happening again, but I have only had one more case of SP happen to me since then which was not as scary because I knew what to expect and I now know that fighting it will only make it worse. Does anyone else believe they have astral projected during SP?"
37lrbp,1,2015-05-28,"Me [27 M] with my wife [28 F] 7 years, Wife venting to friend about things she doesn't like about me",mcdoogle87,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37lrbp/me_27_m_with_my_wife_28_f_7_years_wife_venting_to/,"Where should a SO draw the line with what she vents to a friend?

TL;DR first:  After getting the cold shoulder for a long period of time, I snooped and found out that she is really unattracted to me and has been venting all of her bitterness to a friend instead of communicating these issues with me

Quick backstory:  Wife and I have been married 7 years, have one daughter.  I’ve gone through periods of deep depression, and recently was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Basically since the first year the spark we once had disappeared.  I found during this time she was messaging her friend:

•	how unattracted she is to me
•	sex is a chore
•	I physically look like shit (I would say I’ve been generally healthy throughout our entire relationship),
•	Instantly annoyed whenever I let her know when I’m facing some external stresses (not graduating college on time, not having an internship)
•	She’s uncompassionate when I’m depressed because “I honestly don’t care”
•	She sees no reason to be proud of me
•	She loves me like a good friend, forgets she’s still looking 
•	No physicaly attracted to me
•	Afraid of being alone, so wants to stick it out
•	She doesn’t picture a family with me (We have a 2 year old daughter now)
•	She’s afraid if we have kids they will be like him and she’ll resent them too
•	She doesn’t want to carry me the rest of my life
•	Doesn’t find anything attractive
o	My attitude
o	The way I carry myself
o	What I do with my time
o	My priorities
o	My goals
•	Felt like she was raising a son with huge emotional problems at time
•	She wishes I would cheat or do drugs so she wouldn’t look like the bad guy for leaving
•	Loves me like a sibling, not a husband
•	I’m afraid of starting over if I leave
When I approached her about what I found she claims this is how she felt 6 years ago and no longer applies.  But recently she sent similar messages to her friend saying similar things.
Also, I have not been the best husband our whole marriage.  I often stormed out and slam doors during arguments in the beginning.  I would raise my voice.  But I feel like I have been making an effort to be the person she can rely on…but I feel like she still feels the same way about me.
What upsets me is that she’s venting all of this to her friend rather than to me.  I don’t want her to lose an outlet to vent out frustrations, but I’m hurt that none of this was communicated to me and that her friend now knows all the things I’d rather not be sharing outside of our marriage.  I’m afraid of opening up to my wife now.

Tonight we have our second counseling session together and these are some things I am planning on discussing since I haven’t been able to before.  She typically stone-walls me and rolls her eyes and is just downright disrespectful to me when I try to communicate how I feel to her.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Am I crazy for not wanting her to share personal things about me?  Am I crazy to want her to just talk to me (Maybe I’m not approachable or she fears hurting me)?

Should I be at fault for creating these feelings in her?  
Thank you,

37lzgq,0,2015-05-28,Is this the best investment plan for a Student with regular internships? And is using People's Trust TFSA HISA as primary account a bad idea?,bradtank44,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/37lzgq/is_this_the_best_investment_plan_for_a_student/,"I've done my best to read up on best practices for people in my situation. Here is what I've gathered so far from reading this subreddit and its recommended material, along with my questions.

**Currently** 

* 21 year old computer science student.

* No debt.

* Parents have $6000 in a SunLife mutual fund I can take whenever I want.

* Own a car ('06 Honda Civic. Plan to drive it till it dies).

* Started a 4 month (paid) internship.

* Banking through President's Choice Financial (Chequing account and 2 High Interest Savings Accounts).

* No 'real' investments.

**Plan**

* Open Peoples Trust HISA TFSA. Use TFSA to hold short term goal investments and emergency fund.

* Open Tangerine investment fund (Also under TFSA? Can I have 2 TFSA's as long as I don't over contribute?) for mid and long term investments.

* Read *Wealthy Barber Returns* and *Millionaire Teacher*.

* Follow Canadian Couch Potato guide for Tangerine investments.

* Maybe take ownership of the SunLife fund? I don't know much about it, but I think when I started school 3 years ago it was valued at about $3k. From what I know this was largely just the principal my parents put into it. I don't trust it much, and feel like I should take it now while it is worth more than they put in. 

* Graduate spring 2017

* Start putting money into an RRSP when I get into higher tax brackets.

**Goals**

* [Short Term] Trip to Europe in Summer 2016 or 2017

* [Mid Term] Probably a new (to me) car in 7-10 years?

* [Mid Term] Probably wedding and a house in 10-15?

* [Long term] Early-ish retirement / semi-retirement maybe? 25-35 years.

**Other Questions**

* How easy would it be to keep all of my money (up to my contribution limit) in the PT HISA TFSA and transfer money to my PCF to pay bills? Since I won't be near my limit for some time, I feel like it makes sense to put as much of it here because of its high interest rate. Is there a downside to this? It is a short term plan for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years, since while I'm in school I won't be putting in more than my contribution limit. 

I *feel* like this is the best possible plan for someone in my situation, but I'm sure there are a few glaring holes I've missed!

37m194,15,2015-05-28,New to Santa Barbara and California and looking for friends...,impossible_geometry,SantaBarbara,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/37m194/new_to_santa_barbara_and_california_and_looking/,"Hey, I hope this isn't weird but I'm here in Santa Barbara for a summer internship and I've never been here before! I come from New England, so I'm a fish out of water in a totally different culture from the North East.
I've had the opportunity to check out Santa Barbara and Isla Vista on my own, I'm getting familiar with the bus schedule and have seen some lovely places to visit as well, but it doesn't really fix the loneliness of leaving my friends in NE behind and coming here knowing legitimately no one.
So, I'm wondering if anyone would like to meet up downtown and make friends?
I'll try to sell myself a bit here: I'm a 24 year old female Computer Science student, pretty nerdy, into music and movies and video games. I love beer and am interested in checking out the local breweries and bars. Ahhh...we can all get to know each other over Google Hangouts or Facebook so we can be sure we're not creepers, I know this can be a pretty dangerous thing to initiate if one isn't careful.
I don't know what else! Desperate for friendship and to dispell the loneliness and anxiety of moving across country to a place I've never been!"
37m4b0,10,2015-05-28,Gaming is limiting my true potential.,SirV0mitsalot,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/37m4b0/gaming_is_limiting_my_true_potential/,"Hello, my name is SirVomitsalot. I’m 20 years old and I’m probably about to quit video games to a large degree. I am here to share my story for anyone that can relate and gain a little perspective. 

Going through school I have always been a high achiever when it comes to academics, music and sport. I have always enjoyed all kinds of video games, but I was time-limited by my parents through most of school until I was aged around 16. As my restrictions decreased, I very quickly began to play them for around a couple of hours each day. I somehow got along just fine even through high school exams, and all of my other commitments whilst having a part-time job to pay for anything I needed.

My life began to change as I began my engineering degree at my university, which is around 1.5 hours commuting each way. I was not aware at the time, but I no longer had enough time to keep at all the activities I really wanted to do. Furthermore (in hindsight), I was somewhat oblivious to the aspects of my life that I was giving up through maintaining time studying and time spent playing video games. I didn’t feel like I play video games that much, but I’m sure that’s what many others think too. 

Move forward to now, my life is largely consumed by studying for university, going to the gym and playing DOTA 2. I feel healthy on the outside, but I do not feel healthy on the inside. I completed a 10 week internship where my life was consumed by 10 hours of full time work per day and DOTA in whatever free time I had. My academic, musical and sporting prowess began to fade away as I prioritised video games to the point where it consumed every inch of my spare time. I began to feel like a boring person around my friends, who were beginning to drift away. I see how some old friends of mine have grown since high school and I feel like I have nothing to show for what I have done in the meantime.

I have big aspirations inside, but I don’t want to see myself grow into the type of person that commits so much time to a game, such as the streamers, commentators and professional players who I admired and watched regularly. 

Giving up computer games, gaming youtube channels and gaming subreddits will create a large void in my life that I plan on consuming with more time at the gym, socialising with old friends and organising my personal life accordingly.  Let's see how it goes :)

My badge begins today, I’ll check back soon. Thank you all so much for your support

37m6jb,41,2015-05-28,Unemployed for nearly 6 years. Need some advice.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37m6jb/unemployed_for_nearly_6_years_need_some_advice/,"Out of college I worked at one of the big 4 companies. I got in by being an intern there. But I quit after a few years. Its been almost 6 years since then. To explain I was depressed over a friend's death and did something stupid like quitting my job. And then doing nothing for years being depressed living with my parents. They've been very understanding. And now I've just now gotten over the depression.

I have high gpas in both cs from a university known for a top notch CS department and I live in Seattle. I've programmed in C++ and Java, but outside of that I don't have any specialist skills. The job I did for a few years at the big tech company was rather mundane and I don't feel like I grew substantially in skill.

I've been practicing programming but from what little interviewing I've done so far and I've read it seems like interviews have become very brutal difficult compared to 5 years ago or at least the expectation or bar is much higher. This being the case despite the so called talent shortage in Seattle. I already failed to get back into the company I worked for.

And moreover, for other companies I've been having a hard time getting even to a onsite interview. Some companies I've applied the recruiter tell me they will get back to me and then I get filtered out without a phone screen. I'm guessing the engineering hiring manager gets my resume from the recruiter and then filters me. Others see my employment at one of the Big 4 tech companies and even though I've been unemployed since then they don't immediately filter me out but after the phone screen I get filtered out. My guess is that in this case the engineering hiring manager doesn't see my resume until after the phone screen and so only then filters me out or the engineer doing the phone screen filters me out anyway even if I do fine on the phone screen. To the recruiters I explain that I left the company I worked for for personal reasons. And then make up how I did some volunteering for good social causes and I'm looking for meaning in my life in software engineering now.

I've been thinking of maybe applying to small startups and just straight out tell them that I'm recovering from depression over the death of a friend with the hope that maybe the small startups will be more sympathetic to depression and willing to give me a chance. I honestly don't know how big companies would react to hearing that I've been depressed. I've just been assuming that they would instantly filter me out.

I've already failed at getting into the top well known tech companies. I need advice on what I should do. Again it feels like interviews have gotten brutally difficult with ridiculous expectations even despite the so called talent shortage. I don't know what to do.

Ideally I thought that contract-to-hire would be great if I could get it since it is probably the case that no big tech company would take a risk on hiring full-time someone who hasn't been employed for nearly 6 years. Contracting with conversion possibility would give me a chance to prove myself. But alas it seems that no big tech company does contact-to-hire.

So I'm here asking for advice on what to do. Will I even be able to get a contract job let alone a contract-to-hire job. How will I get back a full-time position. Again I live in Seattle. What are my options realistically? I keep reading about the talent shortage. But it feels like no one is willing to put up with the ramp up time of me relearning a whole bunch and then learning everything that is new in the last 5 years. Tech changes fast and I don't have any experience with the typical open source databases and technologies that are in fashion now as the project I worked on at  the big tech company didn't involve any such things. I've been thinking about applying to small startups in the Seattle area. But honestly I don't even know anything about where is start looking. I should be applying to tier 2 and tier 3 companies. But I don't even know what counts as those. I am not deeply familiar with the tech space in Seattle. I am really in a clueless situation and I don't know what to do now so I am turning to all of you on reddit here for help if you are familiar with the Seattle tech scene and have any contacts or know what I can do."
37m9kn,1,2015-05-28,I purposely left a previous job off my resume am I screwed?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/37m9kn/i_purposely_left_a_previous_job_off_my_resume_am/,"To give some background on how I ended up in this situation. 

I worked at company A for a few years including internships and full time work. Left to go to company B for a change. I wanted to try and grow my skills. Company B was not what I expected. Company B let me down on the expectations I had for it. The company lost a lot of business and downsized. I lost my job and Company A was willing to take me back. 

It sounds like a happy ending, but there is a catch. Company A is relocating and I have no interest in moving. Company A is aware of this. 

I was told by a co-worker to just not mention Company B on my resume. I avoided adding it because I did not gain anything from Company be and was there for only 6 months. 

Now I have been contacted by Company C for a potential interview. During my conversation with Company C, I was telling them about myself and Company B was never mentioned.

What will happen if a reference mentions Company B, or the find out about company B somehow? I have nothing to hide. It doesn't seem relevant to the job I'm applying for. I was just a title at Company B. Should I mention Company B to Company C before they find out another way?"
37mbmd,1,2015-05-28,Immediately pursue MBA or defer grad school for a year?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/37mbmd/immediately_pursue_mba_or_defer_grad_school_for_a/,"Hey all,

Long time lurker and subscriber, first time posting.  I'm an undergrad about to enter his final semester this Fall, and recently discovered that I have the option to defer my grad school start until one year from when I graduate.

More context -- my school has a program that allows undergrads to declare their intent to enter graduate school and if a certain GPA is maintained, automatic acceptance w/out testing is guranteed.  I am on track to graduate with all conditions met and have decided to pursue a 13-course MBA degree which should consist of about a year to a year-and-a-half's studies.  My undergraduate degree will be in Accounting.

To make the story shorter, I am also able to take two graduate courses this Fall while completing my remaining three for my undergrad degree, reducing the amount of courses to 11 for my MBA.

I recently found out that upon officially completing the application for graduate school (I will be required to do this by September), that I may defer the official start of my graduate studies for up to one year.  My two options essentially are to immediate pursue the MBA in Spring 2016 or defer and wait another year to begin.

I currently have an internship and guarantee that an offer for a full time position will be made.  I do not know what salary I would be making, and my employer does not know about my MBA intentions as of now.

I stand at approx. $37,000 in federal student loan debt, before graduate school.  The total cost of the MBA is approx. $55,000.  I am fortunate enough to receive undergraduate grants of $38,500 annually and my family fronts the rest of the bill.  I do not know how much in grant money I would continue to receive for grad school (there is need-based aid available).  The maximum federal aid available for graduate school in the form of unsubsidized Stafford loans is $20,500 annually.  For conservative purposes, I assume that I will be taking on the entirety of this debt to fund my MBA degree.  However, depending on how much/how little aid I receive will certainly be a significant factor in how much additional debt I would be taking on.

By taking a year off and working for the company I am interning at full-time, I could live at home and save as much as I can to pay down the undergrad debt PRIOR to beginning grad school.

The salary I would be receiving is purely an estimate, but the budget is conservative and expenses are consistent with what I am currently spending.  Moreover, I do not anticipate much of a change in lifestyle since I would be living at home and have much of my food expense provided by my parents.

Here's a financial breakdown:

**Option A - no deferment**

* Current Debts $37,070 
* Anticipated Future Debts 		
* Final Undergrad Semester 2,750 	
* Graduate School 20,500 	  
* Total Debts 60,320 
		
* **Estimated Monthly Payments $580**

**Option B - Deferment**

* Current Debts $37,070 
* Anticipated Future Debts 		
* Final Undergrad Semester 2,750 
* Graduate School - (deferred)
* Anticipated Savings from Gap Year 27,744 (based on gross income of 50,000)
* Debts Prior to Graduate School 12,076 
* Add: Anticipated Grad. Debt 20,500 
* Total Debts $32,576 
		 
* **Estimated Monthly Payment $346**

As you can see, my estimated payments would be greatly reduced, as would my total debt owed.  Calculations were performed via the Estimated Repayment calculator at studentloans.gov and the deferment option did not take into account the likely increase in salary due to having an MBA.

My parents are pushing for me to continue with school and to ""get it done,"" but I wanted to consider my options.  The possibility of reducing my debt significantly is enticing to say the least.  What say you PF?

37mc6n,1,2015-05-28,My BF [24M] and I [23 F] (of 2 years) invited his brother [22M] to move in with us and it threw off our couple dynamic and is causing serious stress.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37mc6n/my_bf_24m_and_i_23_f_of_2_years_invited_his/,"Hey guys! I am a frequent relationships lurker who finally has an issue I need some help with. 

About two months ago my boyfriend, Mitch, and I moved to a new city. Before this move we discussed taking on another roommate because we wanted to be able to afford a bigger place in a decent part of town. (We're originally from small towns and are afraid of living in a crime ridden area.) We discussed potential people we knew were also moving and weren't able to find a good roommate match. That was when Mitch suggested we live with his brother, George. I was a bit worried because I hadn't met him in person, but Mitch assured me that George was a good guy. Mitch explained that the two of them fantasized about living together when they were kids (they grew up in an abusive home and I think this was a part of their escape.) I said before I felt comfortable with living with someone I need to get to know them first. Mitch agreed and we set up a time for George to stay with us in our old apartment. I initially didn't have reservations about his brother because I have met the rest of Mitch's family and thoroughly enjoy all of them. 


George's visit was... awkward. George sat in the apartment most of the week, doing nothing. At first, I was understanding of the situation; Mitch and I were working full-time, which left George to entertain himself most of the day. He had never been to our town before and didn't know what was there. George didn't have a car, so he would have to walk if he wanted to go somewhere. All understandable. 


When I was at the apartment with George, I tried to be polite and get to know him. I am a pretty friendly person and can usually sustain a conversation, but talking to him was like talking to a cartoon. He doesn't converse, he just makes really awkward jokes that don't make much sense. This in turn, made me feel very uncomfortable. I have some social anxiety, stemming from a background of emotional neglect and extreme manipulation. I go to therapy and have been working extremely hard to change and have made some great progress. This will be relevant in a minute. 


I tried to invite George to go hiking with my friends, but he declined to watch more Netflix. I don't understand why you'd go to a place that's new to you and just watch fucking Netflix all day. Oh wellll...... 


One night Mitch convinced George to go out to the bars with him. I didn't go because I had to work in the morning. When they got back, I woke up to them getting into a fight. It was because George thought ISIS was going to cause WWIII and Mitch was berating him for being so ignorant (Mitch was an international studies major.) I thought Mitch was being really hard on George, but I stayed out of it because George isn't my brother. After George left a few days later, I asked Mitch about their fight. Mitch normally doesn't yell or get angry and I was very surprised he was arguing so intensely with George. I found out that Mitch was actually angry at George because when they had gone out, George told Mitch got a ""crazy vibe"" off of me. Mitch was furious and gave George a verbal smackdown. I was heartbroken because I have been dealing with insecurities about how other people perceive me. After I heard this, I went on a huge rant about George. 


Let me give you some background on George: He's 22 and doesn't even have a GED. He didn't graduate from high school because he refused to read a fucking book. One. fucking. book. How lazy can you be??? He has no forward thinking abilities. He lives day to day without recognizing his future at all. I don't trust him and I don't think he's responsible. 


That was what I said to Mitch. Mitch agreed. He was super pissed at George for what he said about me. At this point in the story, you may be asking yourself, why in the fucking hell did you live with this guy after that happened? Money problems. That's why. I was so distracted and stressed by temporary poorness (because of saving up for our move), that I completely let my reservations about George go. The ironic thing is that after job searching for a year, I finally found a full-time, salaried position. I start June 8th and I am seriously kicking myself for not just sticking it out. UUGGGHHGHGHGGH At the time, Mitch and I didn't have a better option and Mitch really wanted to live with George. I love Mitch with everything in me, so I agreed to give it a go. 


We've been living with him for about two months and I'm miserable (who would have guessed haha.) George pays rent and the bills on time and in full. After he made the ""crazy"" comment about me, he felt bad and tried in his own way to be nice. After I've gotten to know him, he's a giving guy who just wants to belong somewhere. 


Those are the only nice things I can say. He's lazy. LAZY AS FUCK. All he does is play video games and watch Netflix and Hulu plus. He doesn't have his own interests and never leaves the fucking apartment. It is frustrating because I never get to have any time to myself. The only time he helps out in the apartment when Mitch and I are doing some cleaning; he rarely takes the initiative to do it himself. Until recently, all George was spending his money on was video games and weed. He’s free to spend as he wants, but when you’re bed is a shower curtain and you have to ask for rides everywhere because you won’t even buy a bike, it’s really frustrating for outside parties to watch. 

I feel like Mitch and I can't get our couple space because George is always in the apartment. We used to be much closer than we are now. I can feel a new distance between us, which makes me very upset. All of our activities were us planning as a pair and hanging out as a pair. I loved living with Mitch alone.  

An example: about a week ago, Mitch and I celebrated our two year anniversary. We went to a concert and came home to make a romantic dinner together. While we were eating dinner, George sat and loudly played Halo in the living room and completely ruined the mood. 

I have expressed to Mitch that I really don't like living with George. We have gotten into arguments because I want to go back to just living with Mitch and Mitch says that we can’t just tell George to leave. George moved from a town that is three hours away to live with us, so he would either have to go back there or find a place to live in alone in our big city. He’s not on our lease, so he would be able to leave without any sort of contractual issue. I keep telling Mitch that we have two different views because George is his brother and he’s not mine. Mitch was pissed because he thinks I’m judging George. It's hard not to judge someone who is a year younger than me and is incompetent. (I didn’t say that to Mitch because I have a heart.) 


Mitch wants George to stay because he thinks he wants to help George get back on his feet. George has had a hard life and tells Mitch that he wants to change. Mitch is a good person and wants to help him. I, on the other hand, really don't want to live with someone who doesn't have their life together. We have lived with George for two months and I haven't seen any evidence of George putting in effort to change. I wanted to have a roommate who would be my friend, not someone I feel like I have to babysit.  

We never used to fight and we have now gotten into three huge arguments. It’s been about two weeks since our last fight and I really don’t know what to do. I can’t keep going on like this. I feel like I have to keep a secret from Mitch how much I hate living with George. I also haven’t said to Mitch that I feel that living with George is putting distance between us – I know that I should say this to him and will say it, I haven’t yet because I hate conflict and have been upset with all of our fighting. I am not someone who keeps things inside me very well (that’s what she said.) George is already hinting at living with us again next year and Mitch wholeheartedly agrees. I do not agree. 

I am currently pushing myself to the brink professionally. I graduated from college last year, worked my ass off to find an entry level job. Outside of this new job, I blog for a wine website (which is a lot of fun), am doing a virtual internship and freelance for a local magazine. I cannot handle this unnecessary stress. 


Guys, I really don't know what to do. Should I suck it up and live with George for this year and learn my lesson? Should I convince Mitch that George should leave? 

P.S. Happy cakeday to meeee
   
tl;dr: My boyfriend’s brother moved in with us and it's causing serious stress between my boyfriend and me. Please help me.

37mddk,14,2015-05-28,"Me [23F] with my MIL [50+] and BIL [Mid 20s], having some issues because of their discriminatory remarks regarding my nationality.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37mddk/me_23f_with_my_mil_50_and_bil_mid_20s_having_some/,"Beware, it's very long.

###Background

I first moved to America from Mexico a couple of years ago to live with my then boyfriend (now husband!) His brother was living in the same house as well. Before moving, I paid attention to the dynamics between them and they seemed just fine, except for BIL’s girlfriend (20? 21?) who was non-pleasant from the very beginning. BIL’s girlfriend acts like she’s still a teenager and likes to be edgy and outlandish with her attitude; which gets pretty bad. I was wary of her from the very beginning because she has criminal charges that are somewhat serious and that I thought should be taken into account when dealing with her since she has a tendency to get physically violent.  

When I used to talk to my now husband on the phone or on a videocall, I could hear her making noise, comments and purposefully barging in his room from time to time. Later on, my husband let me know that she used to make inappropriate comments to him such as: “Tee hee I can see your dick through your pants!” “Here, I found your lube” and then went as far as showing him her ass under the excuse that she had tanned. Brother in law was there for these occurrences; he said nothing to her and just face-palmed whenever it happened. My husband is kind of awkward and doesn’t know what to do in some situations, so I encouraged him  to set up some rules because of her behavior; and so he did and she was only allowed once a week over the house and she was to not bother him. 

Not too long after, I moved there and everything was fine and dandy until the BIL’s girlfriend came back to stay for 6 days on a row when the rules my husband set were different. She would steal my supplies, toiletries and rummage through my stuff in the bathroom, so I had to take everything in and out with me like it was a college dorm; and we had to put a lock on our door to prevent her from rummaging through the stuff in our room as well. 

Eventually, things got pretty tense between BIL, his girlfriend and us and we had a fight where she claimed she was pregnant and that she had to be in the house with him because the house was his and they had to be together for the baby (NOT!) We saw through it, told her we didn’t care, that the house wasn’t his and we paid all the bills, and that they should leave, so they left. After the week of the fight she claimed she aborted due to the stress of our fight with her and that she even went to the emergency room, which is not true. She would leave constantly “vomit” (it looked like blended food and it never reeked of puke) in the toilet for us to see… She started doing this a week or so before our fight.

They ended up moving out of the house, but not without a price. My Mother In Law caught a whiff of everything (they told her), talked to them, talked to us too and she was on our side back then and understood why things happened the way they happened and why we decided upon the rules. 
After this ordeal we would rarely see my BIL and his girlfriend, and whenever we did they would be pretty hostile but we just ignored them and continued doing our thing. Eventually BIL distanced himself from MIL. She blamed me for it; claiming that if we hadn’t kicked them out of the house he wouldn’t be resentful towards her or anyone. 

*As a side note regarding MIL: She likes to blame people for whatever happens to her in situations of stress, she doesn’t handle personal relationships well and has a hard time understanding how to treat others without yelling at them or demanding them to do stuff her way.*

Within this arguments of her, she made sure to include that I was a backstabber (according to her) and that maybe I should go back to my country and, in her words, “hand a potato around your neck and be a Mexican dictator down there.” The comments themselves didn’t offend me, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with my nationality (or potatoes;) it was the intention behind her words that bothered me the most. She said it as if being Mexican (or non-American, for those matters) was something bad or to be ashamed of, and tried to use where I am and my immigrant status from to offend me. 

We distanced ourselves from everyone after this for a couple of months, but eventually came back to visit my MIL.  When we came back to visit, she would try to purposefully set us up to meet with BIL and his girlfriend at her house; for example, she would call us and tell us to go over to have dinner with them and BIL and company would be there by the time we arrived. Once we all went on a family trip and she said we would carpool with her; but when we got there she made us carpool with them so (in her words) “we would get along together.” We sucked it up and acted like adults; but we noticed what she was doing and became more careful and asked more questions before agreeing to going over to her house or “carpooling.”

She eventually got the message and stopped trying to force us to befriend them or be alright with them after how they behaved and, again, whenever we met them, things were not precisely smooth but they weren’t hostile either. I tried my best to be polite, but I mostly ignored them for the most part because nothing pleasant could come out of me to say to them and viceversa.

###The problem

The problematic here will be shorter than the background; I promise.

Nowadays, my husband is soon to finish his career and he already has pretty successful opportunities opening up for him and he’s doing fantastic in regards to his current internship. I am still a year or so from graduating with honors and I was invited to an Honors Society; it’s not much but I’m happy and proud of both of us for our hard work and dedication. My husband’s career opportunities include moving to one of the states down south that border with Mexico, which is perfectly fine by both of us. 

My husband, being excited about the good things going on in our life, has kept his mother up to date in what’s happening with us and how we are doing. He told her in detail about his career, his opportunities and his internship and of course he also mentioned that we might have to move. She was happy for him, so happy that she told everyone, like mothers usually do.

A couple of days ago when my husband went to visit his mom by himself, she told him that she had told BIL about his opportunities and moving; she said that he scoffed and said bad stuff about it. My husband asked her what did he say and she didn’t want to tell him, until he preyed it out of her mouth and she admitted to my BIL making discriminatory remarks about my nationality as well. She mentioned to my husband that he was saying how it was good that we were moving down south, because that way I could go back to my country because I’m a filthy Mexican, in a few words. My husband laughed at it because that was the only thing they could say about me, made jokes about how maybe he should go back to the country where his genetic pool origins from and then changed the topic. He did mention that his mother seemed uncomfortable/ashamed when she was telling him about what BIL said about me.

When he told me about this events; I mentioned that his mom was instigating because why mention that someone said something bad about you if you’re not going to say what? I also told him that it was “funny” how of all the bad things that his brother said, those were the only ones she mentioned when she could’ve said about anything else. I also suggested for him to be careful with what he said to his mom because she acted like a telephone between him and his brother, and whatever he said to her, his brother would know as well.  He agreed with me and said he would be careful.

We go back to square one again, these people are trying to use my place of birth and nationality as a weapon to insult me; and again I’m not offended by it but it does bother me that they behave that way. I have tried to cut all ties with MIL and BIL (my father in law is badass, thank God,) but I really can’t because after all, my husband loves his mother and wants to be in touch with his family. What I was successful doing was cutting all communication; whenever I see her I just tell her the necessary and end up inquiring about her and her day in order to not talk about me; and I have managed to have her not text me often asking me personal things. 

Now… How can I deal with these people in a more mature way? What can I do to make these dumb remarks not make me mad? How can I manage to have a less toxic relationship (for the sake of my husband) with this toxic people? In general, what would be my best course of action here?

Please, any advice, comment or insights are uttermost welcome and I will be the happiest to hear what you folks have to say about this whole mess.

**TL;DR:** BIL, his girlfriend and my husband had a quarrel years ago because of their very inappropriate behavior. They hold grudges, make discriminatory/racist comments about my nationality to his mother, and mother in law decides that telling my husband what they said about me is the best course of action. 

*Apologies if my English is not the best, as you may have inferred from my post, I am not a native speaker.*

37mgjw,1,2015-05-28,Am I supposed to feel this lost?,epitone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37mgjw/am_i_supposed_to_feel_this_lost/,"So I started my first internship ever this week as a rising junior and honestly I feel completely out of my depth.  My first day of work was yesterday - in which I spent all day trying to set up my machine and getting connected to the network and all that. In between that I spent most of my time getting caught up by talking to my mentor about our project and what my role(s) would be.

After we finished talking and he asked if I had any questions, I honestly laughed.  I'm so confused about everything that's going on with the project and I've spent the last two days doing nothing but twiddling my proverbial thumbs and trying to look busy (because I can't do any actual work until I'm granted permissions, which I understand is going to take about a week)

Along with this feeling of confusion, I'm also feeling a bit bad about not actually doing any work - I come from a background of retail jobs prior to this where you're literally given things to do every second of every day, and then I switch to a tech internship and I just come in, talk with my mentor, sit at my desk, and look pretty - I just feel like I'm supposed to be doing *something* but on the other hand, I can't do anything.  

I know you all get this question a lot but I'm just wondering if there's any point in your career where this feeling goes away? I can't imagine having to go through this internal struggle every time I start a new job..."

No big names recruit at my school(even though for instance, google Irvine is a 30 minute drive from our campus), and I worry that big name companies, given the choice will always high the Cal Poly or the USC grad over the CSU graduate.

I really want to work for a big name tech company one day, and I'm working nonstop to hone my skills, I'm just worried that my college name may make it harder to get hired by reputable companies.

Include some kind of mechanism or device that connects the two seemingly different stories.,Zaphodsauheart,zaphodsauheart,https://www.reddit.com/r/zaphodsauheart/comments/37mixo/write_a_story_of_two_people_falling_in_love_that/,"“Please run the sequence again Dr. Arroyo.”   Dr. Matilda Pershing glanced back at Dr. Arroyo; she had aged well since they had first met twenty five years prior. 

Dr. Angela Arroyo punched the keys into the computer and watched as the robotic arm manipulated the vials behind the glass; she did not notice Dr. Pershing’s gaze. She had met Dr. Arroyo twenty-five years prior, as young medical intern while she was an undergrad, both of their minds still filled with fantasies of changing the world. It had been an exciting summer filled with smiles and flirting, but Fall, the great executor of young love, arrived and Angela returned to school and Matilda to her lab. Their love, as young love is often wont to do, faded, at least for Angela. Matilda pressed herself into her work, but never forgot the carefree dark haired intern who had made her feel alive for one memorable summer. 
Angela Arroyo had gone on to medical school and had married an oncologist. They had two children before a car accident in Poughkeepsie had left her widowed at forty-five.  She did not remember the young doctor from her internship, her college memories had been slowly replaced by new ones, filled with children and marriage and finally grief, so when she took a job in the research lab with Dr. Matilda Pershing she did not remember her.  


“Dr. Pershing, you look a familiar, have we ever met before?”  
Dr. Pershing had been too heartbroken to respond. She had had two loves in her life, her work, and the young intern from twenty-five years prior. And now, in a instant she had learned the hard way that hope does not spring eternal, like some carefully stored virus, it has a shelf life.   
“No Dr. Arroyo, I don’t think we have.”  


Dr. Pershing’s coldness struck Angela as odd, but she found they worked well together, and over the years they made great progress in their research, but she never broke the icy professional barrier. Sometimes she caught Dr. Pershing looking at her with a distant look in her eyes, but she ignored it and focused on her work. 


It was torture for Dr. Pershing at first. Working with Angela reminded her every day of what she had forsaken all these years to focus on her research. Angela was still the funny, smart, and beautiful woman she had fallen in love with, but she had moved on, had a life. Eventually Matilda was able to suppress the memories until they became just two colleagues who happened to share lab space. They made a good team, and made breakthrough after breakthrough in the fight against wide spectrum prion-diseases.  


Dr. Pershing died when she was sixty-five, breast cancer. She left everything she owned to Dr. Arroyo along with a handwritten note telling her about her love. Somewhere along the line the note was misplaced and Dr. Arroyo never got the note. She died twenty years later still wondering why her icy colleague had left all of her belongings to her.  

------------------------------------------------------------

“Um...she has Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.” The young doctor was obviously new at this, telling patients their loved ones were dying. 

“Will she be alright?”  

“I’m sorry, but Creutzfeldt–Jakob is fatal in all cases.”   

“What? Like is she going to die tomorrow?” Adam was floored, she had come in with a seizure just a few days ago, and now she was dying?   

“We don’t really know Adam, sometimes it takes weeks, months, sometimes years.”
   
“Will she have any more seizures?”
   
“I’ve printed out some reading on the disease for you. Here, I’ll answer any questions you have”
   
“But there must be research, something…” Adam was pleading with the doctor; tears welled up in his eyes.
   
“I checked the literature, and the most promising research was done more than ten years ago by two doctors in Boston. One died a few years ago and the other retired recently, and without them not much progress has been made.”
   
“Can we do, like chemo or something?”
   
“Chemotherapy is for cancer, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is a prion disease. I’m sorry Adam.” The doctor placed his hand on Adam’s upper arm, squeezed and walked away.  

Adam turned to Miriam; she was sleeping, resting after the grueling strain of the most recent seizure. She had been depressed lately, and seemed more forgetful, but they had never suspected anything other than just stress or a lack of sleep. They had come to the hospital when she had collapsed in Adams kitchen, shaking violently. That seemed like years ago now. 

He had met Miriam online, they had only been dating for six months, and yet here he was, crying in her hospital room. 


New York could be the loneliest city in the world. He had moved here for work a year ago and he had never felt more alone than when he was surrounded by people ignoring him. His brother had created an online dating account for him without his knowledge and before long he found himself going terrible date after terrible date. They had joked over the phone about which was worse, surprise psycho first dates, or playing video-games and drinking cheap beer alone every night. Then he’d met Miriam. She had message him first, asking him about his favorite place in central park. He replied that he hadn't been to the park. That was all it took, she’d told him to meet her at Columbus circle the next afternoon on the west side of the fountain. He’d work his work shoes, leather soled dress shoes that hurt to sit in, so he spent the whole date grimacing and finding benches to sit down on, and eventually he just gave up and took off his shoes, walking around the park in his socks. Miriam had found a field for them to walk around. They had spent the entire afternoon and into the evening chatting, they had hot dogs for dinner and laughed about the mystery meat.   

He thought back to their first date as he looked at her face. He sat heavily into the chair by the window and stared out at the Manhattan skyline, he wasn't sure if it was the rain or his tears, but the whole city was blurred, as if it no longer mattered. Almost nine million people and she had to be the one who was dying.

37moe3,3,2015-05-28,I [22 M] don't miss my girlfriend [26 F] very much. Am I falling out of love with her?,RedNeveren,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37moe3/i_22_m_dont_miss_my_girlfriend_26_f_very_much_am/,"I'll try to be as succinct as possible. My girlfriend and I met in grad school and have been dating for about 6 months and in a relationship for the latter 3 months. The first month after we started dating, she went home (6-7 hours away) for a month-long internship and we kept in pretty good contact with each other and let each other know how we were doing and what we were up to. Once she came back things got a lot more serious, and we started a relationship with the idea that it'll last for a while. 

She just graduated with her Master's degree, and instead of working to start her career, she was recently forced to move back home because her mother is very sick (dying of lung cancer, not much time left) and she is the only person who can take care of her. She's living in an apartment with her dad and in her hometown and feels very trapped and stressed out. She is trying to simultaneously take care of her mother while also working part-time jobs and trying to start her career but it is incredibly difficult for her. She has a tendency to over-stress herself and at this point it is reaching an apex.

When we are together, she feels very comforted by me and I put her happiness above mine and I try to do all I can to help her. This lies at the expense of me not spending a lot of time on myself, which is something I greatly value but tend to dismiss  when I'm in a relationship with someone. Since we are apart now, she is feeling the distance much more substantially than me. She is at a point where she really needs me and I'm not there, so she greatly misses me and counts the days until we see each other again.

Me, on the other hand, I'm enjoying having time back to myself and making a lot of progress on my own work/ambitions. I realized that if I were to spend my time away from her pining to see her again, it would delay my happiness and make me depressed, so instead I'm making the best out of my situation and doing what I can with my free time. Because of this, it makes me miss her to a lesser extent than she does, and I know she senses it and it gets to her. This was brought to the forefront when I recently said to her over Skype something along the lines of ""It's okay, you'll see me in like a month"" when in reality we are seeing each other in 2 weeks and I just didn't realize it was so close already. She said something along the lines of ""you don't even care when you'll see me again"", etc. and I explained to her that I am enjoying my time alone but will also greatly enjoy time with her when she visits.

In some ways, my not greatly missing her makes me question if this relationship won't last as long as I thought. I think that I need to see her again to feel her presence within me, but I guess since I've been more focused on myself I don't feel as attached to her or that I need her in my life to be happy. She, on the other hand, is in an extremely emotional state and really needs someone to be there for her. I am here for her, but I'm not highly anticipating seeing her again nor am I dreading it. I just feel kind of normal about it. I know it will be nice to spend time with her again, but I also know that my attention will shift away from me and back to her, and it can be a lot of work/effort sometimes.

She also told me early on in the relationship that my neediness was unattractive (which I tend to do when I fall for someone), so I have worked to not be as needy towards her. This is me not being needy, but it seems like now she wishes it were the other way. 

I've read a few posts online about people with this issue and them also wondering if it means they are falling out of love with their partner. That is what I'm concerned about, and I just wonder if anyone has any personal experience or insights into the situation.

Thanks in advance.

   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend and I are apart, she heavily misses me and I don't miss her all that much. Am I falling out of love with her?"

I sent follow up thank you emails to each of them the day after the interview and received a nice reply from the HR person but not from either people in the actual department.

My question is, should I call or email someone? If so, who? I think I've made it clear that I am very interested but I don't want to annoy them. I'm a third year college student and have so far only worked on-campus jobs that are much less intimidating. This is a competitive tech writing internship at a large company.

37mpx9,1,2015-05-28,Anna Hoffman,Galihan,Galihan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Galihan/comments/37mpx9/anna_hoffman/,"**Name/Alias:** Anna Weiss-Hoffman

**Species:** Human

**Age:**  24

**Physical Description:** A bit of a broad jaw, thick eyebrows, nose slighty on the more bulbous end, enough that is someone were to hear her last name they might suspect being at least partially Jewish. She's not too tall or short, standing at an even five feet, with broad shoulders and weighing around 130 lbs, a little bit on the heavier side for her height, but she is slightly big boned, and is in miraculous shape for someone who is always snacking on something. Her hair is done back into a ponytail with punk-like frontal fringe and a buzzed a bit on the sides, with lots of piercings in her ear that generally have to be removed at work. Its not uncommon to see her wearing thick safety goggles over her stylish glasses, and a bulletproof vest under her labcoat when at work at Deva Corp.

[A drawing is fine for now if I drew it myself right? Right?](http://img13.deviantart.net/9231/i/2015/157/0/f/anna_weiss_hoffman_by_galihan-d8wbjjd.jpg)

**Personality:** 

She has a very down-to-Earth, yet head-in-the-clouds approach to life, firmly believing that metahuman individuals, despite having their exceptional talents, are no different than any other people and that people's choices are what make anyone ""super."" That said, she is fascinated with metahumans and the supernatural as a matter of personal interest and dedicates most of her time researching the pseudoscientific and dabbling in the occult to better understand people with extraordinary powers. 

While an incredible scientist, having invented a phenomenally advanced Superpower Suppression device at a young age, she did not do so for profit, instead licensing the device to law enforcement agencies for the purposes of maintaining public safety - wishing for the safety of both police and metahumans alike instead of having to encourage lethal force when incidents occur.  Almost always seen habitually drinking tea or nibbling on some sort of sweet snack when she doesn't have to abide by lab procedures. She is conscious of how much she does snack, however, and makes an effort to be active when she can to make up the difference, usually through yoga or practicing the hover board prototype she built in order to not have to own a car.  

She does not make friends that easily, being noticeably introverted and tends to keep to herself, most comfortable while in a lab, or at home while surrounded with scientific equipment or occult trinkets, and with access to snack foods. She enjoys the company of Verassi, the homunculus that her grandfather passed down to her, which highlights that she has odd tastes of what is or isn't repulsive or obnoxious. 

**Backstory:**  

Anna's family emigrated from Austria to Cruxehn in the late 1930s, in an effort to avoid the Nazis, the Weiss-Hoffmans being a known family of alchemists, sorcerers, and philosophers of the occult who had been openly opposed the ideas of the Nazis when they were just a small club of angry antisemites who nobody suspected would grow popular enough to someday take the German chancellery. Ultimately, what Anna's great-grandfather  believed was that the rare, extraordinary  power of the legendary persons of old myths was not something attached to lost Aryan blood, but a hidden gift that could be found through all of humanity, and while he himself was unable to escape being captured by the Germans, he was able to smuggle out his family and his research. 

After the second world war, Anna's grandparents moved to America with their kids and their family's work to live peaceful lives and keep the research into superhumans a secret. Two generations later, Anna and her twin sister were born in Totenburg. Anna's sister happened to be born with superhuman powers, at a time where that city very strongly hated those who did. Anti metahuman riots were frequent, and violent, and cost Anna her sister when they were 8 years old, but this did not make Anna hate the world, instead it inspired her to find a way for people to get along. By the age of 11, while her family had moved to Millennium City, Anna wanted to someday move west where she could be a part of New Cascadia, which ha been rebuilt and was recovering from the total devestation that was a city-leveling earthquake and was a beacon of positive relations between metabeings and the regular populace. In the time being, she had to focus her efforts to make a difference in Millennium.  

When she was only 15, Anna had used her great-grandfather's research and the advice of the homunculus he passed onto her, to invent a device that would help change law enforcement and place her in the eyes of the world: a fifteen year old girl had invented a machine that could temporarily take away a metabeing's superpowers. Anna licensed this Superpower Suppression Device under the strict terms that it be not for profit, and only for the sake of not-harmful law enforcement so that incidents like the ones that killed her sister would not repeat themselves. 

Suffice to say, while she passed the chance to become a billionaire overnight, she had gotten the attention of Deva Corp who offered her many scholarship  and internship deals to pay her way through university at the Cascadia Institute of Technology. Anna accepted these offers and has since been attending school and doing research at Deva Corp's west coast laboratories. 

**Primary Residence:** 

A sizable  flathouse in Promenade, a short  commute to New Cascadia thanks to the train systems. 

**Personal Assets:**

 Lives rather comfortably with a steady income from her paid internship at Deva Corp. Numerous scholarships and government research grants are icing on the cake, but for the money she has, she still needs to work pretty long weeks to get her job done and keep her job. She has access to more of Deva Corp's research facility in New Cascadia than other interns would be expected to have, primarily thanks to her personal research requiring specialized resources and effectively earning her her own small office and personal lab access. She also has her own private lab at her own home where she can secretly research things off the record, as well as practice basic occult exercises. 

 She's published the patents for her Superpower Suppression device under not-for-profit copyleft for law enforcement use, even though she could have made millions if she'd just sold the thing to Deva Corp outright.  

**Equipment:** 

* Her laptop/tablet/PDA are highly advanced pieces of technology that have been designed to help detect and to some limited degree identify supernatural or metahuman powers. 

* She has a small, crystal pendant around her neck that helps serve as a focus to channel magic, but isn't anything especially powerful. More like something you'd pick up at a flea market or ""New Age Wiccan"" store that just actually happens to be vaguely mystical as advertised by coincidence despite the seller assuming it's just a rock. 

* Her primary means of defense is a handheld prototype version of her Superpower Suppressor device, effectively an energy pistol that can stun and neutralize metahuman threats without causing lasting harm except against targets whose health depends on superpowered aid. Still hurts very much for anyone to get shot. Vs endurance 4 to resist the stunning effects, willpower 5 to resist power suppression. Its batteries require recharging after three shoots, which takes an entire day to do so. 

* She is armed with a biometric-locked handgun that requires her fingerprints to fire, low caliber and only for self-defense as a very last resort. Danger 4. 

* For physical protection, Bulletproof vest, just in case, sometimes. Also, a helmet for when she's using her hover board.

* Speaking of which, she also built a hover board. It can cruise around 18 inches off the ground and about 20 mph. It has a battery life of around 2 hours, and takes about ten minutes to recharge its batteries. 

**Special Skills:**

* A talented researcher and scientist focusing on studying and inventing machines that involve metahuman abilities and the effects of supernatural forces on living beings. To this end, she is highly knowledgeable of things both scientific and, to a lesser degree, occult.

* Anna is fairly lingual, thanks to her family, personal interests, or having decided that learning the languages of the ethnic groups who make up a large amount of the population of her home city is useful. 
 * Fluent in German, acceptably literate enough to understand some bits of the common minority languages in New Cascadia and Promenade (Mandarin, Spanish, Japanese, etc.)  
 * Can read some ancient languages to a limited degree such as select phrases of Latin, ancient Greek, and Hebrew. Slightly more learned of Low German and Old Norse texts. She decided to pick these up since most genuinely occult texts tend to predate modern languages. 


**Powers:**

[Superpower Science](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Scientific_Prowess)

* [Superpower Research](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_Intuition)

*  This is not that she can copy powers herself, but rather only used in the sense that she can learn about supowerpowers through research and observation in order to help aid those who are trying to become superheroes or to help find ways to fight supervillainy.  

 * Emphasis on Enhanced Inventing and research into the science of Metahuman powers.  

 * Ultra-limited, highly specific Superpower Manipulation  through controlled plot-developments - sick boy's life is saved through experimental medicine becomes metahuman, supervillain is arrested and has had his powers suppressed for a few weeks so he wont be able to break out right away, etc.

[Magic Empowerment](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Empowerment)

* It's not really that she is any sort of spellcaster, but in the presence of the supernatural and occult she does ever so slightly feel slightly more healthy and physically fit. She believes this to simply being the positive influence of mystical things in general. Any possible magical abilities herself are and on the extreme end of low, from being able to slightly flicker the flame of a candle, or causing the water in a cup to ripple, or an old window to rattle, all after extreme focus and concentration. Subject to improve with time and practice.

Hopefully I can enter in another college to do a IT Security masters course.

Although a lot of people would say that I'm doing alright, I don't think I am. And these thoughts are accentuating my depression, that is running its long course (~10 years, maybe more). They are diminishing my performance in life, and that's why I've been falling behind since I got into college.

I still don't have confidence on my working ability and my technical skills. 
I'm feeling dumber (haven't done an IQ test in 10 years: did one today and I went from a score of 129 to 104) and losing interest in things very quickly due to my decreasing attention span (and I tend to procrastinate, even when I've blocked almost every single piece of media (I always had a very high digital media consumption, due to the fact of being lonely all the time)).

I don't have any friends nor anyone to talk to despite my best efforts and I don't have a supporting family. They say that I should make friends, but they limit my mobility even at this age. I'm always going to be treated as a 10 year old, if I stay living in my parents house.
That's a problem because lacking money to do IT certifications, to have mobility and to even have a proper meal, is something that is halting my life progressing. And stopping me from leaving this place. Maybe when I find a proper job in my field of study, I can get enough money to leave on my own.
And it adds to the depression, just seeing everyone else having a blast and feeling independent when I'm not.

Due to this frustration, I'm also becoming a very violent and aggressive person, often imagining situations where I break someones leg from the past, or avenge somehow, that suffering I had to endure during school.
I never had any kind of intimate contact with girls (so I'm still a virgin), and the problem aren't looks really... That is the biggest mark I still carry 'til this date and that it really depresses me.

With all these problems, I don't know what to focus on (to better improve myself)... I guess this is just another post from a person describing their shitty first world life and their sadness, sorrow and unfulfillment. I just needed to vent or post somewhere because I don't have, in the moment, another place to ""talk"" to someone.

I'm about to start grad school and would like to purchase my first car to commute to and from school as well as for future possible internships. My main requirements are reliability, decent mpg and safety. Price wise I'm open to spending more if it means getting a newer/lower mileage car and vice versa for older cars.

&amp;nbsp;

I have been looking at civics, corollas, mazda3s and elantras but have trouble knowing what model years/mileages are good for my budget and needs. I recently cam upon a 2003 manual rav4 with 127k miles for 5k. Carfax and Autocheck both were very good and in person the car seemed to be in good condition (though I lack any mechanical knowledge the interior and exterior seemed well cared for). Perhaps it's just my desire to own a small manual suv which I don't absolutely need that's making me think this is a good deal. Any advice on this car or recommendations for others would be much appreciated! Thank you guys.

Truth be told, I never really was one and in the past few years, I have decided to stop faking it, though I never admitted it to my parents. I even went to a very conservative Christian college.

I graduated earlier this month, but because of a fuck-up with a required internship, I cannot start working yet because I am doing an internship this summer to fulfill my requirements and get my diploma. In the meantime, I am working a couple of part-time jobs as well and living at home. My parents have been allowing me to live there rent-free for the time-being, but I have to be launched by January.

Like many (all) guys, I jerk off to porn pretty consistently. I don't go overboard, usually no more than once a day, and I have never been caught in the act. My parents have found my history several times in the past when I was a teenager and I feigned remorse since I was supposed to be a Christian with a ""problem"" in their eyes. Of course, in my advanced age I see nothing abnormal or inherently wrong with watching porn, but my parents are staunchly opposed to it. 

Last night, we got sent a letter from our internet provider alerting my parents to torrenting of a specific porn video. I don't torrent that often, but one of the few times I did, Comcast objected and so my parents are now aware that, indeed, I still watch porn, and are learning for the first time that I do it without remorse. 

This led to a discussion about my faith during which I revealed that I am not, and never really have been, religious. Upon hearing this, my mother cried, told me that my habits and views are going to send me down a dark path, destroy my life, keep me from finding a good woman, alienate people, etc. 

Then she told me that as long as I hold the values I do, I will not be permitted to live in their house. 

Now I would love to move out and start my (finally unsheltered) life, but I am nowhere near being able to afford my own place, and every single one of my local friends are either still living at home, too or are getting married in the next couple of months. At best, I could afford a shithole studio apartment for two or three months, and hope I can survive until my internship ends and I can get a real job.

I told my mom I can hold off my porn-watching until I move out, but she still seems unswayed, so I think it has more to do with just the porn; I don't think she can handle her son not being a Christian. Since I'm not going to change my religious beliefs in order to have a place to live, I'm more than a little stuck.

TL;DR: Parents discovered I like porn, not Jesus and may kick me out."

I've built up plenty of savings through my internships in the past couple years, and I've decided the hassle of owning my own car is now worth it.  I've been trying to look for any Mustang GT or Cobra (non-Terminator) from 1999-2005, and recently came across one that really grabs my attention.

It's a regular 2005 GT, with ~140,000 for a little more than 6k.  According to the seller, it needs replacement synchros, which would just require a transmission/clutch/flywheel replacement, and I can do that easily.  It's a pretty built car, long tube headers, Brembo 4 piston calipers, carbon fiber drive shaft, front/rear sway bars, and lots of other quality goodies.  It surprises me that he'd be letting it go for this price, especially if it just needs a new tranny.  I've yet to go check it out, but I will definitely do my research and search high and low for other common problems if I do.

What concerns me is the miles on it, and the fact that it's probably had the shit whipped out of it.  I've heard a lot of Mustangs kicking the bucket past the 100,000 range, but nowadays on the market, especially in my area, low miles can hike the price up way too much for my liking.

So it's fast, it's fun, it's practical for my needs, it needs some work, but would it be advisable?  I personally don't have very much Mustang knowledge, but have a few friends who practically specialize in them.  They say it's a great deal (probably because they know how much the mods add) but I just want a few other opinions without a huge bias towards Mustangs.

So I applied for a Google Summer Internship this year, had my interview a few weeks ago. Interviewers said how excellent i did in the interview. However I was rejected because ""I'm not that experienced"". Am I not good enough? 

I've got some app development, good general CS knowledge, and know a couple of programming languages well. I've just completed a year out working in an amazing investment bank in a front office role where i developed my own frameworks, my own processes, wrote my own tests, even re-wrote entire legacy systems to be more solid etc. With all my own code running in live for the bank every day and no issues since, my code is pretty solid. 

For some reason it has really really really put me down. I though i had pretty good experiences for an undergrad, but it turns out i don't. I've really wanted to work for Google, to be fair probably more than any of its applicants. I've followed android since just when google acquired the firm and then heavily followed Google and all their ventures/products since. They wanted someone who had knowledge in another mobile environment, which i dont have. 

Its hard for one person to have done literally everything. I'm pretty sure if i didn't use my year out to work in a bank i would have had all the skills they wanted. Have a wasted my year out and subsequently wasted my only opportunity? It feels like I have.

I had originally asked her to meet me halfway but she couldn't because she ""has a baby and it's his nap time"".

When I confronted her about it I discovered that the reason she treated me like this is because I don't have children. She told me that I don't understand anything because I don't have a baby, and treated me as less than a person because I don't understand the responsibilities of being a mother.

Not only this, but she said that my asking her to meet me halfway was ""highly unacceptable and inconsiderate"" because she is a mother. Literally no other reason than the fact she is a mother.

This post is specific to internships, but a lot of the tips apply to ""proper"" jobs as well...
  
I've been working at Company A on a 12-month placement (July 2014 - July 2015) before my final year of university, and I received a placement-extension offer (July - September) in April.  I asked for a raise with the extension, but it was denied.  When the raise was denied, I interviewed at 3 places for summer internships, and ended up with an offer from a company that I liked at 25% more than my current salary.  I then went back to Company A and said I'd really like to stay, but have a good offer from Company B.  They asked me how much I'd want in order to stay and I gave them a number 75% above my current salary.  They came back with 50% above my current salary, and I asked for a 55% increase and some miscellaneous benefits (£250 contract extension bonus, extra holidays, and 1-day/wk remote work).  I ended up with 55% more than my current salary and all the benefits I asked for.  
  
So all of this sounds pretty straight forward, right?  Well it is, but there are a few things that I did and some others things that I got lucky with that made the process a lot smoother, and ultimately better for me:   
   
1. I had a few days to think about how much I wanted to ask for from Company A.  In the end, I asked for an amount significantly higher than what I would have accepted.  I actually expected for my boss to just laugh at me when I told him how much I wanted.  As such, I expected him to come back with something lower, and spent some time working out what benefits would make the deal sweeter for me.  The point here is that I went into each negotiation completely prepared.  Don't go and ask for a raise without having a number in mind.  Know how much you'll walk away from, and have an idea of some extra benefits that could sweeten the deal for you if they come back with a number under what you asked for (higher pension match, a month of unpaid leave, remote work, etc.).
2. I got a bit lucky with people leaving Company A throughout my time here, and ended up with a lot of responsibility (live deployments, architecting systems, interviewing, etc.).  I was unintentionally in a position where it would have been difficult to replace me.  Don't get me wrong, the company wouldn't have been screwed if I left, but they wouldn't have been comfortable either.
3. I had the backing of all of my coworkers.  ""How was your weekend"", ""How was that thing you said you were going to?"", etc. goes a LONG way to keeping you in good standing with your colleagues.  You don't have to kiss people's asses', but just generally make an effort to be nice.  When your coworker is stressed out over some code, ask them if they wanna go on a coffee break and let them vent.  If someone comes in and is tired because their kid was up all night sick, offer pick up some of their work.  If you're doing a code review, don't be a fucking dick about it - offer suggestions, not harsh critiques.  
4. I can't stress enough how important networking is.  I didn't go out of my way to make connections, but I also didn't let any opportunities that arose pass by.  I had references from people I used to work with, which ultimately got me the offer at Company B after only a 30-minute phone interview and 60-minute face-to-face chat.  The reference was from a guy in one of my old teams that I used to eat lunch with every day.  I also play cricket with a dozen or so coworkers which helped me meet people in other departments.  I'm also in a group that goes on nights out every two or three weeks, and one girl in the group works in HR.  I was drunkenly discussing how much I should ask for when I graduate, which helped me settle on a number a few months later during the raise situation.  She basically said, ""We actually really struggle to hire for your position.  You could probably get double your internship salary if you pushed for it.""  I wouldn't have known that if she hadn't told me.  I would've settled for 150% of my placement salary before she told me that.
5. I genuinely care about our products and want them to succeed.  I'm not some super-suck-up company man, but I think what we make is really cool.  I'll bitch about shit my company does all day long, but the stuff my team works on is our baby.
6. I've picked up a thorough understanding of Company A's architecture, processes, and communication channels.  80% of our systems are really simple, but the remaining 20% have some complicated shit that just makes sense to me now.  That's not because I'm some super smart guy, but because I've bashed my head against the wall for weeks trying to figure it out.  Company A could replace me with someone that has years of experience, but their lack of domain knowledge means they'll be slower than me for the first month or two.
7. I applied for summer internships at places I had direct experience with.  This is a double-edged sword, because the point of an internship is generally to gain experience, not to make lots of money.  I got lucky in that I like what I'm currently doing and want to continue doing it after I graduate.  I got an offer from Company C that I declined because the start date was too soon and they couldn't move it, and declined an onsite with Company D because I didn't like the culture of the company from the phone interview.  I'm not at all a fan of spamming out applications everywhere.  I only applied to places that I could give answers to, ""Why do you want to work here?"" and, ""How can you help us?"" without bullshitting them.  
8. I got pretty decent at interviews by giving real interviews in my current job, being a mock interviewer and mock interview candidate with people from here, and reading up on lots of tips from this subreddit.  Take the time to do a few mock interviews, and practice being both the interviewee and interviewer.  Being the interviewer showed me how much they really try to help candidates.  Interviewers want you to do well!  
9. I was totally willing to fail.  I've been saving 30% of my take-home pay during my placement, so I've got more than enough to last me the summer.  Not having to worry about Company A getting rid of me for looking elsewhere, or whether Companies B, C, or D didn't give me offers, helped loads subconsciously.  Even if they all said no, I'd still have gained lots of valuable interviewing experience.  If I came across as needy to any of the companies, I don't think I would have been successful.
  
I suppose I'll leave it at that for now.  I'm off to bed, so if you have any questions, I'll answer them tomorrow, although I'm sure lots of other people (probably with more experience) will be willing to help you out sooner :-).  Don't be shy, it's a great community here!  
  
Edit: I started at £14,000-£17500 and am now at £22,000-£27,000."

37o34u,0,2015-05-28,[23/m] Girlfriend (21/f) is traveling and won't make an effort to maintain communication,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/37o34u/23m_girlfriend_21f_is_traveling_and_wont_make_an/,"My (USA) girlfriend of 10 months is going away to do an internship in Europe this summer for 3 months. On the way to her internship, she stopped off in Ireland to see an old friend of hers for a few days. I totally support this. However, 3 months of our relationship has been long-distance as I went away to grad school, and this was tough. She isn't a big fan of technology, and after strain between us, she really put forth an extra effort to be sure to skype every two days at minimum. This was really good, and after this period of long distance, she followed me to my new city, and lived here with me for 3 months more. She intends to return after her internship. 

I made it clear that I fully support her internship abroad, and that I am sure it'll be awesome for her and us, in the long run. However, I really tried to stress the importance of her not falling into her old pattern of sometimes dropping off of the map for 3-4 days when she got busy with school and life. I was very clear that I was not willing to have a long-distance relationship for 3 months where we only talk twice a week, and if we are going to follow through with it, then she should be careful with communication. (Is this reasonable?)


So, she leaves her hometown, arrives in Ireland, meets up with her friend. 

Day 1, she tells me she has arrived, and told me I'd love it there. I sent her some pictures of what I was doing, she sent me some of what she was doing, she goes to a museum and tells me how psyched she was about it. 

Day 2, She meets her old friend today. I tried to back off and give her space. She texted me at 9:40AM her time basically telling me goodnight (12:36 AM my time). I replied some stuff, and said maybe we could skype soon. She replied 30 mins later saying ""yes, we should, tomorrow"", or something. The replied ""sorry, scrambling here"". This 30 min gap made me kind-of angry, because I was sleepy and I stayed up waiting for her reply. However, I understand if she was busy. Turns out she was switching a hostel reservation around. I said some stuff that indicated I wasn't happy with this, then she spent the whole day being stressed. That night, she skyped me, I apologized, and I encouraged her to go out with her friend like she had originally intended before she got upset. I feel really bad about this. It was just a misunderstanding, but it was caused lack of communication-- the problem I was trying to guard against. I was really happy we made up. 

Day 3, Gets on a bus with wifi around 10AM her time. Sends me a few texts. It was very nice. Everything is going good. We make plans to skype later. That night, when it's time to skype, she sends me a message ""can't skype now, sorry"". She was in a small apartment with a few people sleeping and didn't want to wake them, she said. She asked if I was mad, and I said no. I was actually a little upset, but I understood. I mostly wondered why she couldn't have typed a few things at me about how her day went or something, or wondered about mine, but I guess she was just preoccupied. 

Day 4, She had a busy-busy day of hopping from town to town. She told me where she was going before she left, and sent me a few photos. This was nice. She got home late, and told me when she got home, but said she was too tired to skype. We had a text conversation, but I could tell she was talking to her friends and only occasionally looking at her phone to reply. She missed major details and didn't really respond to my cues. This was o.k. with me. She had a long day, and she did make an effort to keep me updated. 

Day 5- I sent her a text at about 9:00 AM her time. This is a big day for her. She is traveling from a small town in Ireland to London by car, bus, and plane. I started a new job today and that made me quite nervous. I was kind of reaching out with my 9AM text for support. She's really supportive in person, but not so much long-distance. I saw that she looked at it about 5 hours later. She didn't reply. After I got off of my first day of work a few hours later, I sent her a text telling her everything went well, and I hoped she was well, too. I mentioned it would have been nice if she had had time to reply to me earlier. She didn't reply -- traveling, no WiFi. Replies to me hours later ""I am having a slight crisis right now, I read earlier but couldn't respond, safe, not hurt, but can't talk. sorry you're upset, sorry you feel that way"" OK, this seems fine. She had a hard day. I sent her some stuff in reply, but she didn't reply back. I stressed myself out real hard checking my phone every minute for a few hours to see if I got a reply. She should be in London by now. Eventually, I give up and take a nap to calm down. Right before I do this, I delete my facebook on impulse so I'll quit checking facebook chat and let myself relax. 

She tries to facebook message me at 10:30PM her time. She thinks I blocked her on facebook. She FREAKS out, and in skype chat, I wake up to ""I'm sorry I'm sorry!"", tells me she's having a panic attack, ""please don't do this"", ""I'm so sorry, I'm crying in the airport and I can't stop, please don't!"" She says she only had internet for one hour, and she's all stressed out. Something happened during her travels. She said it was ""an emergency"", but she is fine now. She was meeting a friend in London; she said she couldn't find the friend. I replied, but it was too late; she wasn't on skype anymore. 


At this point, I'm freaking out. She thinks I broke off communication with her because I was frustrated, and the last phrases I heard from her involved ""can't stop crying"", ""panic attack"", ""an emergency"", ""not hurt"", ""crisis"", etc. etc. 

At this point upon waking up, my heart was racing and I was on the verge of an anxiety attack myself. I was losing my shit, so I messaged the friend she was staying with in Ireland asking her if my GF was okay, and if everything was cool, and if she knew if my GF had found her friend in London, etc. My GF's friend said things like ""That's something she needs to tell you about herself"", and she told me my GF made it to London and found her friend, however I don't think she actually knows. Her friend clearly dislikes me, because all she sees is that my GF was stressed about communicating with me while she was in Ireland. 

So, my girlfriend had a tough day, I'm sure. Her friend won't tell me in what way. My GF told me she'd contact me as soon as she could. 

It's four hours later now. If she found her friend, she's now at her house. If she didn't, she's probably either at the airport or settled in at a hostel. She has WIFI everywhere but the airport (she's probably too cheap to pay for the airport WIFI at London-- it's only free for an hour). She could contact me, but she hasn't. Her friend said ""she'll tell you what happened you when she's ready"". I'm afraid she's really really upset with me and is purposely not contacting me at this point. Or she's stranded in the airport. 

Long-distance GF thinks I'm mad, but I'm just worried and anxious. 

**How should I behave when we talk again?**

tl;dr
*feels, worries, over-attachment, miscommunication, and loneliness*

Edit: The title probably isn't right. She IS trying. I think I'm just not satisfied still. Long-distance is hard for me.

Upon being hired by the company (which works with a variety of technologies) and getting assigned to the mobile team, I was upfront with my manager about not knowing Android beyond tinkering around with a basic ""Hello World"" app. He said that was no problem, and they only expected that I was eager to learn, could do something like Fizz Buzz, and was familiar with the concepts of data structures and objected oriented programming (I was).

When I came in to begin my internship this week, the manager had a list of improvements they wanted to make to the Android application and told me I could have my pick of what I wanted to do. I asked the two-man team how they picked up Android development themselves, hoping for tips on where to begin, and they just said that they just kind of figured it out as they went along.

I'm not really the ""figure it out as I go along"" type, and prefer to learn with a bit of structure and learn good habits and an understanding of what I'm doing first, rather than just trying to insert lines and hope they do what I'm intending. I have the Android Programming Big Nerd Ranch guide from the library and think it would greatly enhance my understanding to work through it a few hours a day. Would it be improper to study it and its tutorials at work? Should I work on it at home after work, or is that just a recipe for burning myself out (I really love the outdoors and don't feel like sitting at the computer after doing it all day)? Or how else could I optimally learn this unfamiliar platform while at work?

The manager also appears very nice and chill, so I'm open to communicating with him to ask what he expects, but I also want to be careful about the right way to approach it."

I made a few posts about how my backup plan was to go live with my bf for the summer to get away from my parents. I guess that won't happen now since he broke up with me. I don't know what to think or do, I'm just totally heartbroken. I didn't really see this happening. Everything else seemed to be going so well. 

Evidently about a week ago he decided that things were just too hard and he was waiting for finals to be over so he could tell me. I'm just reeling from the shock and the pain of it all. I feel like I ruined everything, like maybe I sabotaged it, but he said that it was just incompatibility and he felt like we couldn't meet each other's needs. I just wanted to chug through it so we could be together and make sure things would work out, but I guess he didn't feel the same. He couldn't take the distance anymore.

Now I'm stuck at home without an internship to speak of, and I don't know how I'm going to get past this. I'm hurt and lost. I want him to love me again, but he won't, and there's nothing I can do. He was my biggest supporter. He understood how my Nmom was. Now I'm back at square 1.

37p721,237,2015-05-29,"TIFU by responding to a fuck offer with ""That'd be good, yeah""",tossthisbitchout,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/37p721/tifu_by_responding_to_a_fuck_offer_with_thatd_be/,"This fuck up transpired in December, right before my school let out for winter break, but my dickhead friends are just now starting to make me realize how badly I fucked up. 

So I had been chatting up this girl I worked with for about a month or so. Things were going well, we got off at the same time after work, and would typically sit and eat dinner afterwards, and she had been over to my place a couple times to cuddle and watch movies. 

As you may have guessed by now, I'm not exactly a fast operator, lets-go-back-to-my-place kind of guy when it comes to the ladies. I liked this girl a lot, and I didn't want to fuck up by being too direct or forward, which is why I was so surprised when she was both direct and forward. 

So there I was texting her on the night before I was to fly back home for winter break, and it seems like a typical conversation for us. Then, out of the clear blue sky, she sends a text inquiring, ""Do u want to fuck?"". 

Now, keep in mind that the texts we had been sending to each other would look like pure lunacy to any normal human. I would say that i was hanging out with my roommates, and she would ask if we were all having a circle jerk together, and i would respond that she was just jealous because all she has for company is her roommate's dildo. The best way to describe those conversations would be a series of affectionate and graphic insults.
 
So when she said ""Do u want to fuck"", I stared at my phone for a full five minutes, waiting for the punchline. I mean, i hadnt even kissed this girl yet, it seemed like a pretty gigantic leap from being cuddle buddies to offering sex over text. 

Well, no punchline came. And so, I responded with the brilliant line that conveyed my willingness while not making me sound overly eager: ""That'd be good, yeah"". SEND. Five minutes pass. BUZZ. Her response reads, ""Are u serious?"". ""Well shit, were you?"" ""Idk"". Now reddit, there are two versions of what might have happened here. 

One: the version that i have been going with in my mind. The rest of the conversation involved me telling her that i was surprised at her directness, but that i definitely liked her a lot and believed the feeling was mutual. Her response was that i was not wrong, but she had just gotten out of a relationship and things were still weird for her and that we should wait and see what happens til after break. She had basically said ""Do u want to fuck"" to gauge my response and see if i was indeed into her. 

Two, the option that my dickhead friends are adamantly arguing for: in a moment of post-breakup weakness, this girl wanted my dick, and told me so. My response was so offensive to her that she immediately was turned off, and said to me ""Are u serious"" to convey her incredulity. As the dickheads put it, ""That'd be good yeah"" is something you say at the drive thru when offered ketchup, or extra napkins, not when offered sex by a girl youve been talking to. So anyway, what does reddit think? Which version is accurate? Just how bad did I fuck up?

TL;DR My crush sends a text asking ""Do u want to fuck?"". I respond with ""Thatd be good, yeah"". We do not fuck.

Edit: Well the general consensus so far appears to be that, yes, I fucked up, but not irreversibly so. I think now would be a good time to inform you guys what has happened since then.

We texted and kept up contact all throughout winter break, but nothing really happened when we returned. At least, not until we saw each other at a bar and ended up dancing and making out. Things got interesting after that. 

A few days before spring break, she comes over to my place, and we start making out on the bed while School of Rock is playing on the computer. I get her top off and start sucking her tits. She's into it. Her hand is making its way up my leg, things are getting hot and heavy. 

Then the phone rings, it is a call I can't ignore about an internship I have lined up. She leaves as I'm talking, saying she has to go pack. I figure it's all good, we made progress, things will pick up after break.

Well, reddit, long story short, she got back with her ex after break, and that was the furthest I ever got. BUT. They have since broken up again so...eh???

37pglh,5,2015-05-29,"GF[23F] dumped me because of a coworker, I[24M] had a small history with. I don't feel guilty at all.",whatdidjusthappen101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37pglh/gf23f_dumped_me_because_of_a_coworker_i24m_had_a/,"Hi 
Let me start with the small history with my coworker (let me call her Sheila): Two years ago we were just about to gradute from university. We were looking for internships, me being lucky, found a good one. They were still looking for further interns so I've posted it to our university group. Sheila PM'd me,  she'd like to apply for the position. They hired her soon, she was really grateful to me so we became really close friends and colleagues, you know the typical two young fellas at a huge multinational organisation almost 100% surrounded with elder coworkers . After the internship (1,5 y ago) both of us got a premanent contract, our relationship became even more stronger. 
Things became a bit more complicated last summer. Sheila became single a couple of months before and I was the closest to her when she needed the help of getting over her ex, for 6 months only as a friend. During the summer it escalated to friends-with-benefits. Both of us knew we shouldn't go further (ex. to a serious relationship), still colleagues, which is unacceptable for both of us hence we agreed on the first night it shouldn't last longer than the summer. Despite the previous, during that period we were pretty much acting like one outside of the office. It was fun... none of us were seeking for anyone else to go on a date... really, just enjoying life. During this period I met my (now ex)GF, I will call her Naomi. Summer ended, we (Sheila and I) both applied to universities again (different courses), but we were (and are) still working meanwhile, this practicly consumed up all our time, we ended the benefit part. 

Story with [N]: Above mentioned, I met her while I wasn't looking for any dates. Due to a summer festival we kind of spent a week together (Sheila wasn't there and Naomi was the girlfriend of a distant friend of mine by that time). During this week, Naomi noticed I'm getting calls from a girl Sheila, me not wanting to explain in too much details, I casually answerd she's my GF.
Long story short, Naomi broke up with that guy, and myself taking a breath (at least)from uni, during christmas holidays, allowed myself to look for someone more serious.That was when I met Naomi again at a party. We started chatting, than dating, than early this year we started our relationship. 

At first all went smooth, we had a lot of fun together. Even after 2 months we went on a ski trip with the friends of her. During that week, when I had the chance i messaged to my friends, parents and to Sheila as well, she was curious how the trip is going. On that day Naomi noticed I am chatting with her. Naomi immediately bursted out in anger questioning me, why I am still chatting with my ex (she remembered the name of Sheila from summer). I spent that night explaining her my summer with Sheila, that it wasn't a classical relationship, we just had fun etcetc., and that our relationship just sunk back to the previous stage, coworkers and friends. Naomi was raging so much, the only thing calmed her down, that I promised her, I will stop talking with Sheila about my private life, but told Naomi there is no one else I can talk about work, so I really must discuss it with her.

Months spent together, we had arguments, but not about Sheila since I clearly wasn't talking with her about my private life and never when I was out of office. Everything went fine untill last weekend, when Naomi was at my place. She looked through my messages while I took a shower (It was not for the first time, but ok since I've felt I have nothing to hide). She told me, I was still talking to her (totally work related if i did), I might even possibly cheated on her (never with no one, I think she knew it though) and she wants to break up. At this point I felt so tired of her argues, her attitude towards me, her attitude towards any conflict (when there was any, she always wanted to break up immediately and I had to change my behaviour/convince her i love her etc.). I was really out of arguments, I told her I love her, she is my girlfriend, but besides that I'm still working with Sheila, nothing has happened. 

My point is I'm not sure if I had act right when I just gave up on her. I do not feel guilty about this topic, so I just didn't feel to argue about it, but she dumped me due to this. Im not looking for redemption, I just need some objective opinions, some critics if I was wrong somewhere or I act right by let her end it.

TL;DR; Ex-GF[23F] broke up with me[24M] when she found out I was still in contact with a coworker/close friend and for a short period friends-with-benefits of mine. I never cheated on my ex-GF, If I talked to my coworker, it was only work related, still she had dumped me. I don't feel guilty letting her go. Still I need objective opinons. "

My first character was a crime boss gnome wizard who clashed far too much with the lawful good dwarf until i met my untimely demise at the hand of a troll. my second character was a warlock and professor which i thought was fine until my group brought OOC bias into the game and didnt give my character a chance to the point where they attacked me and wasted 5 hours of a night.

I decided not to give up on my friends so im making my professor leave the party and approaching my new character with a more upbeat comical theme. The new character is a young wizard (age 20) named Jeffrey (mainly called Jeff) who works as an intern at Renfield's Ragin' Resurrections, a 'life insurance' agency where people pay this company so when they die, their on hand Necromancers come out and bring them back to life. Jeff is still new to the ropes and a bit of a goof but meets the group trying to find my first character who had taken out insurance. Once jeff realises that my first character died a couple weeks ago and that he was alerted too late (glitch in the system) he offers the group a party package which gives them an onhand necromancer to join them for their first campaign (Which im going to sell like one of those tv shopping adverts)

If this new approach to a character for the party too comical and should i just choose a standard character or will it be fine?\
Also will the Necromancy be an issue with the lawful good person even if its not undead raising?"

Hello again Sysadmins

I am a student intern for a small IT company that provides Dealer Management systems to small Auto dealers and general IT support for there users and infrastructure.

I have been tasked in unison by  the company and my school to research moving the infrastructure ownd by the company and the infrastructure owned by its clients to a data center.

Large customers have there own server on site however we are looking in to providing them with VPS instead that we will host on Infrastructure we are going to rent (IaaS) or maybe if the price is better buy and collocate it  into a data center our selves.

Right now the average spec for customer servers are 32Gig ram and 400Gig DISK space (I have no clue about CPU but from what I gather the power of these is mostly in line with the amount of RAM). Every server has on average 30 remote desktop sessions running during business hours.

My question to u guys is if you could point me In the right direction to how I can determine the specs these VPS should have. How Do I measure the usage of the current servers resources? Preferably in such a way that I can pour it in a report for my boss, the ceo and my school.

Or maybe I should just copy the physical specs to the VPS’ses but oversubscribe the Host servers they run on ? Idk I want to know I want to learn. Many thanks for any replies you might give.

PS: from being in contact with local IaaS providers I have been getting the feeling they find the current specs of the VM’s I wanted virtualized the are ‘32Gig ram and 400Gig DISK’ to be  rather big that’s why I’m wondering if I should down size it in someway.

I recently graduated with a BFA in English with a concentration in professional writing. My skill set is tailored to technical writing in the IT field. I am leaving college with approximately 10k in loan debt and 4k in credit card debt.

Upon graduation I was offered a job working for Verizon tech support making between 32-35k a year with full benefits. I accepted the offer. However, last week I was offered a paid internship with strong promise of turning into a full-time, salaried job doing technical writing for a software company that develops for banks. This internship lasts this Summer and would pay $10 an hour. If it were to become a full-time job I would guess my pay to be closer to 50k with benefits starting.

The internship starts June 1. Verizon starts June 25th. I now have to choose between something I already have in the bag and something relevant to my studies that *could* pay out much better.

Neither job would be too permanent, I plan on moving to D.C. this coming Spring with my partner. He leaves the Marine Corps this September and plans on moving in with me. He will pick up some part time work in the meantime and the rest of our financial burden will be on my shoulders.

Which route should I take? I'm pretty torn between the two."
37qhq7,0,2015-05-29,"As a 21 y/o college student working part-time, I'm having trouble with parents allowing me financial independence.",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/37qhq7/as_a_21_yo_college_student_working_parttime_im/,"First post here, spent a lot of time learning financial life hacks from y'all's witty posts...thanks!  Was hoping I could get some advice on how to ease into financial independence in college. How have others managed sharing the financial burden of college with their parents?  Who handled what, and at what point did they start cutting ties?

Some background: I'm a junior in engineering at an out-of-state university where I'm on a full tuition scholarship.  My father owns his own engineering business and does alright, but they've racked up some $40,000 of credit card debt and owe the state an assload of money from years of taxes.  (This doesn't count the thousands and thousands of dollars they've borrowed from their parents and never repaid.)  Their finances are in shambles, but they won't divulge the details of the situation to me--they are trying to maintain status in a social class they simply can't keep up with, and they don't like to discuss it with me.  (Small southern town stuff.) Regardless, my parents and I individually have taken out roughly $30k in loans to help cover living expenses, about half is in my name and half in theirs.  (I have asked, repeatedly, exactly how much debt I have incurred in MY name, and their answer is always ""we can't remember exactly, but don't worry about it, when we start making more money we'll help you pay them off."") I am currently working my second internship, and have always held summer jobs, but I intend to work part-time during the school year for the first time this upcoming semester.  My credit score is in the mid-600s, drained the last of my savings just before this job began, and have used about 50% of the $2500 limit on my only credit card.  

Now, I'm looking to financially distance myself from my parents.  I don't want to be tied to their problems.  Additionally, my dad's views of money are very different from mine: he refuses to help me with my living expenses if it means I am able to save money, i.e. he thinks it's better for me to graduate with not a cent in savings rather than him continue to help pay for my living expenses, which he CAN do, and allow me to work and put some money into savings so I can graduate and hit the real world on the right foot...and eventually, try to help him.  

Friends are encouraging me to cut ties completely and be financially independent, but I am not sure I can stay afloat.  My engineering classes are a priority, and I'm worried about making the grades while working enough hours to pay rent.  My mom freaks every time I mention financially supporting myself; I think it's from a desire to have ""succeeded and provided for her daughter"" and because she's afraid to me to grow up and be gone. (Forgot to mention, she does not have a job.  And I can't stand it.) 

My father, on the other hand, wants me to pay for everything myself and yet still claims me on taxes and won't let me see a cent of my return.  (Obviously, he can't do this if I pay for more than 50% of my living expenses, which I haven't quite done in the past.)  And when I tell him I need to pay rent or buy tires, I don't see the money for weeks.  Just recently, he owed me $1000 and took months to pay me back.  He tells me he ""doesn't trust me with money"" and thinks I'm wasting what he gives me and buying toys. (?) He's more open about money discussions than my mom, but we get in huge arguments every time I have to ask for a dime.  I just want to be done with them, but on one hand, if I can keep getting some help and put money in the bank on my end, why not?  Then again, I feel trapped as long as we have connected finances.  My dad says, ""As long as you're in school, our finances are linked.  My problems are your problems, and you will do everything you can to help this family.""  We just disagree on how to go about doing that.  

Any suggestions?  Thanks for reading. "

37qjl4,1,2015-05-29,TIFU by squandering my potential,TotalHavoc,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/37qjl4/tifu_by_squandering_my_potential/,"So all occurred over the past 2 years or so, and honestly has it's roots in what I've been doing since I started my undergrad about 6 years ago. I'll try to make things as brief as possible, and probably fail at that too (Update: I did, this thing is way too long -_-).

I attended School A and got my BS in Chemical Engineering. To give some background, I coasted through my entire education before college. I never really learned study skills because I had never needed them. Got accepted into the honors program at School A, full scholarship, program I wanted, everything was great.

However, I proceeded to operate in college as I did in HS. I overslept or slept through classes, half assed my assignments, etc. I needed to maintain a 3.5 GPA to stay as part of the program and keep my scholarship. These habits eventually caught up with me. I now have a number of course retakes on my transcript because I needed them to keep my GPA up. I did eventually learn how to have a good work ethic and some decent study skills, so I managed to squeak by. I did a lot of undergraduate research in labs, but put the absolute minimum effort in. So none of the professors really cared much for me, but I did add to my resume. I have a TON of lab experience (including an REU program, google it if you want), but no publications or accolades to show for it. To cap things off, I got SUPER lazy in my last semester (surprise, right?) and ended up oversleeping my final presentation in one of my classes. My grade came back and we're bad enough to drop me just below a 3.5 GP to a 3.49. So I don't graduate as part of the Honors Program; I still feel like shit about this FU, even two years or so later.

I also applied to PhD schools at that time, because I want to do research science in any of a number of fields (alternative fuels, oil/gas, materials science, molecular simulations, process engineering, etc). I only got into one school, the worst of the bunch I applied for, School B. So I go there and despite a professor wanting me to work in his group on a project I was genuinely interested in, I stall because I was expecting other PhD offers which never came. So he grabs another incoming student for the spot instead, and I'm SOL.

So now I have to find a new PhD adviser and project. I go through my first year, do decent in my courses, and work for another professor for a few months in the middle of the year. I didn't show up enough or put as much work in because I didn't manage my time efficiently between classes, finding a social life/support network in a new place, leisure time, and the aforementioned lab work. So he told me there was no place for me in his lab.

I resume the search and find another lab for me to work in. I received a formal GAship offer to fund me for the next year (what i desperately needed to stay in school/on track for my PhD). Things are looking up again. I like the position, the place seems to be one that leads to a number of career opportunities, and I'm good to go.The professor does make it clear, however, that he's aware of what happened with previous professor and how much I slacked off. He says I need to prove myself and work hard to earn his trust. So I start working there for the summer.

Then comes a real FU. I had never had a true full time job in my life before this. I also had chronic issues with waking up on time, and came in late/missed a few of our lab meetings. The professor definitely took note of this. On top of that, I spent a lot of time in the lab slacking off on websites such as this, or on blogs, or even watching the World Cup that summer since the games were on during work hours. The worst two things I did though were not keeping my lab notebook neat, accurate, and in the proper format (an entry every day detailing your work), and not being precise in reporting what time I came in and left the lab. I rounded to the nearest half an hour usually, rounding to add more hours more often than not. I got a warning about some of these things sometime in mid-July

All of this stemmed from the fact I didn't understand what it meant to actually work, or the attitude you have to have to succeed. You need to be willing to work hard and earn your own success; just coasting and doing the minimum that is assigned to you will never lead to success, only to barely getting by at best. So August rolls around, and this professor sets up a meeting where he and a few of his subordinates tell me that my performance is subpar, I haven't made enough improvement, and based on how poorly my lab notebook is set up and the fact that there are hours I cannot justify on my timecard, he will be filing to revoke my GAship. He offers me the chance to resign if I do it before the end of the day. Now I know how bad my lab notebook is, and this thing is considered a legal document for anyone who isn't aware. So I cave and sign my resignation. He agrees to make it seem like I left voluntarily, so I won't have issues finding something new.

The upshot of this is that I no longer have funding within the PhD program. I look around for other professors who need PhD students: nothing. Come November, I found an internship and started working at a big company (let's call them company A). The pay is good for an internship, but it's an office job where I manage people and product launches, not anything engineering or sciencey. Come the end of first semester (Nov/Dec/Jan), I officially reduce to a Masters which I have just finished this May. I start a job search and apply to other PhD programs. I didn't find anything full time immediately, didn't get into any PhD schools, but have continued with my internship up until currently.

The last part concerns a job just recently that I thought I had in the bag. The HR department from this government organization (let's call them organization N) sent me an informal offer for a materials science position that I absolutely loved. Good pay, great benefits, great work culture, tons of all but guaranteed advancement potential. But the funding/certificate to hire doesn't come from them, because it is a government job. It comes from the central branch of organization N, which just looks at all of the candidates resumes and questionnaires and decides who the hiring branch can choose from to hire. And as you might guess, I just recently heard back that I wasn't chosen.

The hiring branch of organization A is still looking around for another source of funding/certificates to be able to hire me, as they really liked my interview and have told me they really want me. But I'm not overly optimistic... so it's back to the drawing board.

Sorry for the long story, but I needed some sort of catharsis. I feel like my life has gone from having a plan for how to get where I want to be in the future, to repeated setbacks, to changing that plan, to then having this plan destroyed, leaving me with no idea where to go or what to do. So I'm resuming my job search while working in a temporary internship which I hate. At this point, I have little hope that I can escape my past mistakes; they were necessary mistakes so that I could learn to fix my bad work habits. But I can't help but think that in doing so, I have been set back so far that it is very difficult to recover. I used to feel like when it mattered, things that I couldn't control would usually break right for me. It had all through my life up until graduate school. But now I feel like the script has completely flipped -_-

Thanks for reading if you got through all that. I know I'm not completely screwed, but I feel like I've squandered the fantastic opportunities I was given because I didn't understand what I had, or what I needed to do to succeed.

TL;DR: Had scholarship, was lazy and didn't how to work and fucked it up. Got into PhD program, was lazy and didn't know how to work and FU again, this time on three different occasions with three different possible advisers. Got great job offer, didn't work out because central branch of company didn't rate me as ""among most highly qualified"". Now hiring branch needs another source of funding/certificate to hire me. Frustrated with life."

It doesn't matter who I'm with or how much I love them.  Without fail, my mind races between everybody but the person I'm with.  If I'm dating Girl A, I'm thinking about Girl B.  If I'm dating Girl B, I'm thinking about Girl A.

Usually it swings back and forth between various people.  In an hour of sex my mind usually bounces back and forth between:

* old loves
* the barista at the coffee shop that morning
* the weirdly erotic midget I saw on TLC the other day
* something I've seen in porn
* the really skinny girl at the gym
* the really fat girl at the gym
* my best friend's girlfriend
* my ex girlfriend's bitchy best friend
* that one girl who tried to get me to help her cheat but I said no
* the trailer-trash intern who worked at my company for a week
* and then usually the really ugly girl in high school who had a crush on me but always wore Spongebob pajama pants.

I love my SO, and have loved everybody I've ever been in a sexual relationship with.  But without fail, they end up being the last thing on my mind when I'm giving them sweet sweet dickings.

If I stop and focus on the person I'm with, I can go for a long time but never reach orgasm.  It always takes mental gymnastics and a lot of fantasy to cum.

I feel like I'm a bad boyfriend because of this."
37qqld,1,2015-05-29,"My university is going down the toilet. Should I take a year in industry, or try to get out ASAP?",bearjuani,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37qqld/my_university_is_going_down_the_toilet_should_i/,"Hi /r/advice, first time poster here so sorry if I break a rule.

I'm currently studying Physics and Computer Science at Aberystwyth university, which is pretty low in the league tables and falling quickly(in 2011 we were 49th in the Guardian's league tables and for 2016 we're 110th - it only goes up to 119). 

I'm understandably annoyed at this since when I applied here, the university was showing up as pretty average and now we're in the bottom 10%, but I'm not sure what to do in order to limit the damage the crapness of the university can do to my future. 

On my course there's an option to take a year out to work in industry as a paid intern- it doesn't affect the degree I get at the end, but it'd give me a year's experience working full time in the kinds of sector I would like to go into, while letting me save a bit of money for the future. On the other hand it would mean staying here for another year, which is time in which more and more employers are going to notice that this is one of the lowest ranked universities in the country.

___

If you're a recruiter for a physics/compsci related field, would you prefer a candidate from an unknown university with no experience or one from a uni that's known for being badly ranked, with a year of it?


If you're a graduate who was in my position, any advice at all on whether employers actually noticed your uni wasn't as prestigious as a Russell group, and whether they valued candidates who took a year in industry, would be appreciated too. Thanks in advance. 


___
**tldr:**University have fallen in league tables pretty significantly and show no signs of stopping. Should I stay around for a year long internship, or bail before the uni can fall even lower?

I still remember taking a French final last year when I turned 15 and coincidentally I just finished my French final now. School is finally out and I'm going to China for 2.5 weeks on Tuesday. I am excited yet anxious. 

In this year, I've made some changes. I've become more social and went from that freshman nobody knows to the sophomore everyone is acquainted with and is friendly with. I feel less lonely, although I still am pretty lonely. 

Another change I made is changing my entire body. I was always the smallest kid in the room and wasn't over 100 lbs until last year (freshman year), where I was about 104 lbs and wrestled in the 106 lbs weight class. I was extremely skinny and decided it was time for a change. While everyone was out drinking and partying throughout the summer, I was doing an internship in biochemistry and working out to get bigger. I bulked up to 140 lbs and cut back down to 128 lbs. I gained a lot of lean mass and people didn't even recognize me.

Finally, I can now consent in my state, but I won't get some any time soon
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This year has probably been the year where I've changed the most. Still not happy with my social situation, but this year was a step closer to fixing it."

37r2xl,4,2015-05-29,Confusion,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/37r2xl/confusion/,"Background: I met this woman in college through an acquaintance and initially viewed her as only a friend until we exchanged numbers. Long story short, we texted each other 24/7 for at least a month and a half straight (big mistake). She used to say that I lived so far and wished I lived closer (2 hours away) so we can see each other more. She also stated that she will have more time to see me once her internship finishes. We have many things in common, including the same career path. We went on a few dates but never thoroughly explained our intentions with each other, but agreed that going with the flow was the best thing to do. She's timid and very closed off, but I told her that everytime we're together, it will be an adventure. So far our dates have been something she has never experienced (baseball games, sushi, hiking, etc..). We both previously had shitty relationships, with hers being the more recent and she stated that her ex never brought her anywhere.

Last few weeks: Up until 2 weeks ago, I noticed she became a bit cold and distant after a date. The date was great, and we spoke about relationships in general. She was amazed by how much I knew about how to treat women, which she always acknowledged when we were together. But after that day, I noticed her text messages were less responsive and lacked substance. I didn't think nothing of it and understood that we both have busy lives. I gave her space when it was necessary, but we still conversed about school. 

Graduation: During and after finals, we spoke to each other a few times up until our department graduation ceremony. We walked the stage together and planned on meeting up later that night, but a family matter came up. She acknowledged the matter and I promised to make it up to her next weekend. I texted her the next day with no response. I didn't text her again until last Thursday to see if she wanted to go shooting at a spot I was going to checkout in her hometown the following week. No response. Friday night I get a text message from her regarding our 2nd graduation ceremony (class of 2015 ceremony). I was set on not attending, but realized that it may be the last time I may see anyone from school again. Her text messages were more enthusiastic and as alive as before. I picked her up the next morning before heading to the ceremony, and realized she went to the ceremony for us. I have a lot of friends and didn't mind not sitting with her, but she made sure that we were together. During the ceremony, she wanted to take me to a huge Frat party which she bought two tickets for, but I already made plans and was going to see her later that night. I noticed she became a bit sad. Up until we met up at the bars with a few friends, she texted me about how excited she was to meet all of my friends and sister. I even surprised her with a bottle of her favorite liquor, and refused to  drink with my friends until she was with me. She was flattered and I noticed her demeanor transform from excitement to pure happiness.  My friends like her a lot, she likes my friends, and we all had a great time. In between bars, I'd hold her close to me since I knew she was cold and treated her with respect, even though I can get a bit crazy when I'm drunk. Upon departure, we gave each other a big hug and she stated she will see me next time.

This week: The next day, Sunday, she immediately texted me in the morning stating how much fun she had, and even asked if I was feeling okay from drinking too much. She talked about how she wants to see me again, she wanted to hang out more often, and even made plans to see each other again. She even got in trouble for texting me while she was at work. Then out of nowhere, she completely stopped. I knew she was off at a certain time, which was around the time I got off so I couldn't reply until then. Knowing her daily routine, she usually texts me right after she gets out, drives home, showers, then texts me until she sleeps, but no text. The next day, I asked her when she was free this week to go shooting, and I also texted her a few pictures we took together. No response. Two days later, I informed her that our professors posted our final grades. No response. I know it's only been a few days since Sunday, but it's weird how she just ignored these text messages when she used to reply at least by the time she's off work. WTF is going on? I really don't want to fuck up with her. I am a patient and persistent man, but my biggest fear has always been losing someone.

Questions: 

- Did she catch feelings so quick that she's trying to back off by giving herself space?

- Is she keeping her guard up, due to her previous relationships?

- If she's so busy, why does she instantly reply to her best friend's messages, and ignores mine?

- Is she playing hard to get or giving me a shit test?

- Am I overanalyzing shit? If so, should I contact her again?

- Should I be persistent (chase) or patient (space)?

Any help is great. I've never been so hung up on a woman. I think I've finally met my match."

A few weeks ago, the HR person sent out an email saying that they were finalizing the start dates and we all (the interns) would know soon. 

However, it's been about three weeks and I still haven't heard anything. I sent an email on Tuesday morning first thing asking if there were any updates, and the HR person said that they would let me know by the end of the week. It's Friday now at 3:30 and I still don't know when I'm starting. This is a large company so I'm really surprised that they haven't let us know yet. 

I'm getting kind of anxious. Originally, the offer letter said I'm starting in June. It's almost June and I have to make arrangements seemingly for a week from now, but I have no idea when I'm starting. 

I want to call the HR person and ask what's going on. However, I don't want to be annoying since I already emailed them earlier this week. 

Any advice?"

37rmd8,2,2015-05-29,Quitting College Early for Job Offer?,bakedbenny,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37rmd8/quitting_college_early_for_job_offer/,"Background: I just became a junior at a 4 year university, and I am studying computer science. The summer after freshman year, I interned at a well known tech company for 4 months. Now it's summer after sophomore year, and I've been working a 6 month internship at a different tech company, which will be done at the end of the summer (started after spring break, got permission from school to take a term off)

A couple managers have hinted already that they would like to hire me after the internship is over, but they also said they understand if I want to finish school first. Here's the catch - a few higher-up positions, both management and engineering, will be opening in the next few years because some employees in my department are getting ready to retire. I've been getting good reviews from my managers, and I feel I could put myself into a position to grab a very well paying job at a young age.

My questions: 
What are the pros and cons of finishing my degree online if the company offered me a job when the internship is over?

Would I be able to negotiate pay to be higher than entry level? I'd already have 10 months experience of legit work at tech companies, very little time would be required to train me since I'm already familiar with how things work here, and my managers will be giving me good reviews.

I should also probably note that my parents are paying for about 90% of my schooling, and would really like me to finish the degree. I'm EXTREMELY thankful for their generosity, but I'd be making more money if I was to take a job offer at level 1 on the pay scale than if I took a 3rd internship the summer after my junior year even if I start paying for school myself (in-state tuition!).

I have been enjoying the work I do A LOT more than schoolwork, which is why I'm leaning on the side of just finishing the degree online. Thanks for reading, and any advice is appreciated! It's be nice to hear if someone had a similar experience!"

37s193,5,2015-05-29,Feeling hopeless.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/37s193/feeling_hopeless/,"Well, just broke up with the 3rd bf of the year since moving to the DMV. First one was emotionally unavailable, second was never around, and this one lied (to himself and me) about being over his ex. Hello, I'm 25 and never had a relationship last longer than a year! What's wrong with me- please diagnose! Answer: You're crazy! 


I don't regret breaking up with any of these guys... they weren't right for me. But I feel like no one will be... I am just too demanding and insecure. I like to text throughout the day, I don't want to compete with exes, I like to spend a ton of time together and do things and projects and so on... basically I want a partner to live life with, and I feel like very few men want that. Maybe very few women do, too, and I'm just fucked up. But I know that dating down here has also been a distraction for me... to take away from the loneliness, from feeling trapped by my own mediocrity and failures, for someone to rely on for emotional support. 


That's what upsets me about this one, I think. No one to help or comfort me any more. My parents just aren't capable. I spoke with my mother today and when I said I felt she didn't have the emotional capacity to help me, she just said, ""You're right, I don't."" She never really bonded with me as a baby and she's never really cared all that much. I once spent 3 months abroad and never heard from her or my dad, so, you get the picture. PPD happens, I guess. But now I know I feel drawn to people who just can't be there for me... like, 'this time, I'll make it work!' It's wrong of me to rely on someone else to fix that, I know I need a therapist. But I can't afford one. I have no medical insurance except for emergency.


My life is kind of disaster right now. I have an MA in a relevant political field and I'm stuck with a part time social media job and a part time unpaid internship which have lead to nothing. I've done plenty of interviews, hundreds of job apps... nothing. Something is wrong with me, something defective I don't understand. I fear people and rarely trust them. Girls tormented me as a kid and boys assaulted, harassed, raped, and abused me as an adult. I stare at my feet when I walk because if I make eye contact with men, they sometimes follow me or cat call me, and I get so afraid. It happens a lot down here. I am very quiet with girls in social settings because until I can feel it out, I expect them to hate me and see me as competition. 


I don't know where I'll be living in August as my roomies are leaving their lease (I sublet) and I can't afford to move. I have huge amounts in student loans, so I can't just fade into nothing. My car keeps breaking down and wiping out my meager savings (I now owe $600 in credit). I am depressed and don't spend wisely because of it: I cave and eat out constantly because I am just too mentally exhausted to face cooking anything or shopping. I have dermatillomania and OCD, so most of my day is spent extremely anxious and uncomfortable because my face looks constantly broken out. 


When I first moved down here a guy date raped me and I couldn't press charges because again, lack of money. I couldn't tell my family either, because I knew the response would be: 'What did you do to deserve it?' And my most recent ex wonders why I get so 'angry' about these issues.


With my second boyfriend, who I loved, I went on birth control and suffered a severe reaction (hallucinations and wild mood swings) and broke up in a very haphazard way (cold to conciliatory and cold again) which wasn't fair to him. I feel so bad for hurting him.


These days I cry a lot, and increasingly want to just never wake up. I fantasize a lot about killing myself. I dream about driving up to New York and weighting myself with stones and just walking into a river, or going to the ocean and swimming out until I'm too tired to get back. I don't want to die painfully, I just want to go to sleep and I don't want someone to be traumatized by finding me. I just want to sink away somewhere and rot into nothing. I feel like not that many people would really mind. My parents are 'over' having kids, my siblings are distant, my friends are nice but we're not very close. I don't have a close family or any mentors. 


I can't afford a doctor or a therapist. I can't move home- there's even less work there, and it's rural... no one there can treat my problems effectively. If I section myself it will affect my ability to get employed later as I will lose my part time job and internship. 


My grandpa killed himself in his 40s and his mother was sent to an insane asylum at 25. I feel sometimes like it is inescapable, that I was born wrong like they were, just fundamentally not built right in my brain. I will, like my mom says, always need MORE and MORE and MORE affection, and always be 'a black hole of neediness' and loneliness and pain. "
37s44k,3,2015-05-29,Sepp Blatter interview after being reelected,Goldavenger,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/37s44k/sepp_blatter_interview_after_being_reelected/,"There was an [interview](http://www.srf.ch/news/international/so-schlecht-kann-ich-ja-nicht-gewesen-sein) with Sepp Blatter in Swiss Television after being reelected this Friday. This is the translation of it, if you're interested. Funny how he avoids answering any question by giving anecdotes. What a slick, corrupt, lying piece of ...

It took a while until we finally new who would be the elected president of Fifa. Now we know: The new president is the previous president. Congratulations to being reelected Sepp Blatter. How relieved are you after being reelected?

SB: The relieve was huge, there was a lot of pressure this day, in this congress. I took it away and lead this congress and we even solved problems which we did not for years, that with Israel and Palestine and after the election everything fell off and I'm very happy and content that it went that way.

Was there a moment when you were doubting being reelected today?

SB: No, I didn't doubt being reelected but the result, that it went to the 2nd ballot, that had me a moment - well, I thought: that can't be for real? If the difference is that big, the other candidate can't participate, right? That wouldn't have been good. But he then retreaded in a very sportmanslike manner. Yet how it looked, how the UEFA President and the media said during two days: ""Blatter has to go"", I have to say I'm on this path for four years now.

You are adressing it. There are critical voices that have been getting louder lately. Important organisations like UEFA who obviously were not on your side and nevertheless you are the president of them...

SB: Of them. Yes.

...How do you want to get their love back?

SB: I do not want to love them.

But you said: ""I like you all"", after being reelected.

SB: Good, ""but I have not said I love you all"" *chuckles*
No, I like everyone and I'm the president of everyone and they have to work with me and two of those Europeans are now new in the excecutive commitee of the Vispa, of Vispa, of Fifa...

Long day

SB:... That would be David Gill who is vice president of Manchester United and Wolfgang Niersbach the president of DFB. They are now sitting with me in the executive commitee and Niersbach came back later and said: ""I will work with you"".

There were almost threats that UEFA might pull out of WC 2018 and not provide any teams. Does this bother you?

SB: No, these threats are only there in the run-up to elections of the president. As soon as the president is elected, even Michele (Platini) came and said: ""Congrats"". At least the executive committee of UEFA, they tried to postpone the election or boycott it. Boycott does not bring anything. Now everyone came, and the representatives of UEFA were very polite and disciplined. Nobody intervened in a ""touchy problem"". There were not many of those but I congratulate the whole congress. They wanted to elect a president, they chose and elected one.

Nevertheless the image of FIFA and yours as well is a bit battered. What do you plan to change this?

SB: Tomorrow we will have a conference of the new executive committee with the new members. There will be a different tone, this is the government of FIFA and I'm its head. These governments are not elected by the same people, only I am elected by the congress. FIFA's name is battered - I mean that's exaggerated

Is it really? Is the image of FIFA good?

SB: No, but it's exaggerated because it's a problem of the media. Then there are these NGO's, any joes (?) that join in. If you go to Africa, Asia, to the Carribean or South America. Football plays, it is good and FIFA is good. That (bad Image) you can reduce. There are methods to reduce it. And about my personal Image: If I'm elected for the 5th time, it can't have been all that bad because they would not have elected me if it was.

That, I do understand out of your personal view. Can you give me insight in what your next steps are?

SB: Tomorrow we start. I talked to the president of the executive committee and disciplinary committee, how is by the way a former football player called Claudio Sulzer. We will have to more fiercly pick up what is up. We will have see that the disciplinary committee and everything else that we have in FIFA will be shared with other confederations. Imagine: The UEFA as the largest most important confederation do not have an independent ethic committee. How do you want to expect this of the others? They say they don't need it, that doesn't work. We have to do this. We argued for a long time. Now the argument is over, it's an intern argument, it's UEFA against FIFA, since 1998 when I lined up against the great Johanson, i was general secretary and I was not wanted. I arrived, it was a huge risk for me: ""but who never takes a risk, will never have a chance. I did it."" I was elected. In 2002 we had again a huge thing in Seoul where we had a 2 days meeting. Then it was quiet and now it started over again. One day I will quit. However I said today that my goal is to bring the FIFA in shape so that at the end of my term, if god gives me life but I'm well at the moment, that I can hand FIFA over to somebody, in a way FIFA should be today.

You want to quit. Do you know when?

SB: I have to do these 4 years. I can't simply say after 2 years: ""I'm tired"". Over these 4 years I want to build somebody up, try to build somebody up. Because actually a president has to build himself up like a political president. And I work on improving the reputation of FIFA. A good reputation in the medias who shoot against somebody might never be the case. Maybe they stop because I'm still here and say the everlasting Blatter. He is gonna stay either way."
37s4ov,105,2015-05-29,3rd year CS major here and I know almost nothing about software engineering in the real world. Where do I start?,Call_Me_Salamander,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/37s4ov/3rd_year_cs_major_here_and_i_know_almost_nothing/,"In a week I'll have completed my third year as a CS major at UC Davis. I've done well in my classes and have a good knowledge of the CS major fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, OOP, operating systems, and more. However, I know almost nothing about software engineering in the real world. Most of the CS majors at our campus go on to be software engineers, and it sucks that we experience very little of what software engineers do on campus.

I'll be starting my first real software engineering internship in 2 weeks and I have no idea what to expect, but I am excited to finally get some experience.

Anyway, I will have a lot of time to kill this summer since I'll be interning instead of going to school. I'll be bored as hell when I get home unless I find something to do. So my plan is to get some decent experience learning about what I can do with my degree. I know almost nothing about web development, iOS/Android development, and building applications in general. I code a lot in C/C++ in school and Python on my free time. I consider myself an above average C/C++ when compared to most students.

So where would you guys recommend I start looking to get some decent knowledge on what exactly I can do with my CS degree? I'll probably spend some time playing around with Android Studio this summer to see what exactly app development is like but I wouldn't know where to start for web development. Other than that I have no clues on what things I should be looking into. I would love some input!"
37s58p,1,2015-05-29,My Story,[deleted],NoFapChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/37s58p/my_story/,"I don't know what writing this here will accomplish, but here it goes...I am 22 years old and am currently working at a Baptist church as an intern. I have worked there the past 2 summers, so this is my 3rd year. No one knows that I struggle with PMO, and I am basically like a Pharisee who appears religious but whose heart is far from God. Nobody knows. I can go three or four days without PMO, but then I'm back to what I most hate. I think the longest I've ever gone is just under 2 weeks. But it has been the same cycle over and over again for the past seven years. 

I do not doubt that I am a Christian, for I truly do hate my sin and love Jesus Christ, but I just cannot shake this addiction. I have read book after book, heard sermon after sermon, done program after program, and here I am looking at NSWF gifs on the same website that I am sharing my story of how much I hate it! Isn't that kind of ironic? 

So I don't know, maybe you are like me and are tired of this endless cycle of sin, confess, repent, sin, confess...and so on. I hardly read my Bible anymore, or pray for that long, and hey...BINGO, there's my answer! Yeah I know that, but its like I can't even force myself to read or pray. I'm too filled up with things of this world to be hungry for God. 

Sorry, this is turning more into a journal than a post, but it has helped me to at least get some of these thoughts out there. There is much more that I could say, am I'm sure some of your stories are very similar. Thanks for reading, and I guess I'm not really asking for anything but prayer, and maybe an accountability partner if anyone feels like they are in a similar situation as I am. I guess the only thing I am worried about with an accountability partner is that I am going to become prideful because I was able to tell my accountability partner I was free for a month or something. But anyways, God bless and may He help us all fight through this struggle. "

So I met this girl two years ago at my college.  Always thought she was super cool and she was interested in the same things as me, but she was in a committed relationship, so I didn't bother.  Fast-forward to this year and we're in the fall and meet up at some events/parties.  Turns out she's single, and we totally hit it off without trying (neither of us were looking for a relationship at the time whatsoever).  We ended up hooking up one night and it progressed from there, over a rocky few months, into a great relationship.  She loves the same things as me - music, outdoor activities, travel, you name it.  We're both smart, but she's a creative type free spirit go with the flow, while I'm your typical plan things out nerd that doesn't take a lot of chances.  We eventually developed to a full-blown relationship a few months afterwards and everything has been amazing up to this point - she's everything I could've dreamed of and more.


Until now.  Shes from a different continent, and is there now - followed by moving to yet another one for an internship coming up.  So we committed to the summer, but knew it would be difficult.  Going from talking to and seeing each other every day turned into constant texting/snapchatting and daily skype calls.  Everything went well, but the constant chat inevitably developed from 'i miss you' to discussing what we wanted to do after college.  Our plans align almost totally.  We're both in fields that could get a job almost anywhere - I'm in business while she's in design.  We both want to move to some larger, forward thinking type cities, get a studio apartment and a husky puppy, and live together and develop our lives.


It started today while I talked to her that she told me she needed to talk to me about something, and my heart totally dropped.  She's thinking about how we can possibly make it work together, and worried that at least one of us is going to sacrifice.  What it ultimately came down to was that she knew that she wasn't willing to compromise on her job for me, but that I would definitely for her - which is only partly true.  I'm more focused on building my life outside of my career, but she knows exactly what type of job she wants and will go get it.  I KNOW that we can make it work together, but it's hard to convince her that we can make it happen.

**TLDR;** college relationship, about to graduate after next year and just became long distance for the summer.  This lead to us talking a bunch about our future, and while we would easily be able to make it work together successfully she thinks that at least one of us will have to sacrifice, and doesn't want to let that happen.

37sckf,2,2015-05-29,I feel like I need to cut off my best friend,123557487643,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/37sckf/i_feel_like_i_need_to_cut_off_my_best_friend/,"I don't even know where to start with this. We've been friends for years now. Almost a decade now by this point. First just as acquaintances but as the years went on we've become closer and closer to the point where we talked every single day despite my moving across the country first and then to the other side of the world. We've talked about everything and nothing, the stuff that we never bring up to anyone else, like fears and family drama we always share with each other. But a couple of years I began to fall for her. Until that point, aside from going to a school dance together, our friendship was entirely of the platonic sort but after awhile, I started thinking of her more and more romantically. Maybe it's because at the time I was struggling through an engineering university and went from constantly hanging out with about even amounts of guys and girls to being around a bunch of guys who always complained about the lack of girls. And she was always there. I would message her during class, on my way back from class, go to work, have texts waiting for me from her when I finished, talk to her before sleeping, and I'd wake up to messages updating me on her struggles in the morning or other events, and it would start back up again for the day.

Anyway, we rarely get to see each other. Basically just on spring break where I'd go back to visit. But we recently went to my friend's wedding together. I invited her as my plus one about a month ago and it was a couple of states over from where she lives so she'd need to fly in and it's a wedding where she would know no one except me, aside from one time she briefly met my friend that was getting married through skype because he was getting drunk in our dorm in the background. And at this point I feel like I need to specify, I invited her 90% because she's my best friend and I legitimately wanted to see her because I never get the chance to, and maybe 10% with the intent to actually try to escalate things. But she agreed and seemed excited about it. But at the wedding I feel like it all just went to hell. I didn't do anything but maybe that was the problem. A friend of mine was asking me about her once we got there and when he asked me if there was anything between us I panicked because my instinct is to deny deny deny. So naturally he's hearing that I'm saying I'm not interested, so the rest of the night he's buying her drinks and shit and hanging around her and I'm just sitting there pissed off at myself. On the way back from the bars after, a friend was driving us and I was sitting in the back with her and he kept trying to hint that maybe we should switch seats but I just pretended I was tired and didn't hear him. Next day we hung out with the married couple all day, and she seemed pretty quiet and distant. Next day she left, I saw her off to the taxi, we hugged said we had fun, it'd been too long, whatever. But everything feels different now. I just feel sick about it. Not necessarily that she might not feel the same way about me that I feel about her but just the fact that I can't collect the testicular fortitude to tell her about it. I'm not mad about being friendzoned or resenting her for not feeling the same way towards me because I don't fucking know. I don't even know if I want to know. I hate the fact that I feel like this because I can't help but feel like it's going to tank our friendship. Or maybe I'm just putting it off because I can't handle the thought of rejection from her.

I mean take this for instance. Instead of actually doing anything about it I'm sitting here complaining about it on reddit. Maybe kind of hoping that it gets around to her and she realizes it's me without me actually having to do it myself. I've never felt so...nonfunctional, I guess when it comes to something like this. Even in my most awkward phase in high school I was still able to formulate a sentence delivering the message ""hey I like you as more than a friend"" in an adequate manner. But I get back to thinking about where I've been in my life the last couple of years and just get more confused. A couple of years ago I was doing poorly in school, had finished an internship at a good company that I hated, and had gone a couple of years without dating anyone. I felt too far into my studies to change my degree, not that I even knew what I wanted to change it to, and I became more and more reliant on this girl for my female interaction. But I graduated in December, left the country, wallowed in self-pity for awhile because I hated the jobs I was applying to, had no friends where I live, and kind of put a beacon of light on this event. But in the last couple of weeks I've talked to my parents about changing my career, I've gotten off my ass and started to leave the house and do things, and I generally have the clearest idea of what I actually want to do with my life in the medium term that I've had since I graduated high school half a decade ago. I've basically let go of all that was weighing me down in the past couple of years, but one of the biggest parts of my life remains. For so long I kind of kept the illusion that maybe this could work out with us without actually confronting the reality of it, and when I actually think about it it's absurd. Even if she did feel the same, what would happen? I'd move to a different country for her? Hell no, that's poorly thought out at best. And if I didn't, then what basically changes? Nothing, our relationship remains one conducted through messaging each other with maybe more phone calls thrown in but not likely since neither of us particularly likes talking on phones. So I just need to stop feeling about her this way, but I can't do that just continuing on like we've been doing all these years. We talked a bit after she left but over the last couple of days I've just let the conversation die out and we haven't really had any contact in that time, which for us is almost an eternity. But I just feel like to finally move on from this past chapter of my life that I hated so much, I need to move on from her, and as shitty as it is, that'll never happen by continuing contact with her. Every time we say something stupid or complain about one of our usual things or accidentally say the same thing at the same time, it just brings me back to square one. I just need to get my mind off of her and move on with the rest of my life. And then hopefully, eventually, we can go back to being friends like we were before because honestly, I can say that I love her as a friend. We've been so close for so long and I don't want to just throw that away but I don't really see another way.

tl;dr: i need to fucking grow a pair."

Let me explain. I find myself or I am given a goal. I dedicate myself to it, reach it or give up. Then I focus on another goal. This is how I can function properly. Otherwise, I'm kinda depressed. Maybe this is how I was raised. 

I've just finished my 3rd year of BS in CS. I was lost in the first 3 years so I didn't care about GPA, courses, internships etc. but my situation is not so bad either. Now I'd like to set a goal for myself but I'm having trouble picking a goal in CS. Can you share some thoughts that would help ? "

I know there are a lot of ""what is the best book/MOOC/course/way to learn python"" threads - but, as a beginner myself, I'm wondering what your progression/path actually looked like. I'm particularly interested in those who maybe started somewhere from scratch (i.e. did not major in CS or anything), and have gotten an experienced position as a programmer. 

Seeing the actual timelines would be cool too, just to see how much time was put in as well.

For example:

1. Read through LPTHW (2 months)

2. Took course A and B at Coursera (3 months)

3. Worked on my own projects like ____ and ____ (6 months)

4. Internship (1 year)

5. Software Engineer at (current)


Something along those lines. Just interested in seeing how much these intro MOOC/books helped, seeing how long and how much work it takes to really learn python until you are competent enough to do stuff.

Hope this thread isn't too repetitive! "
37so4z,0,2015-05-29,"My bf [m,21] and I [f, 22] are long distance and I am not sure if I should push aside my feelings of jealousy when he continues to pick his best friend [m,21] of fifteen years over me. Other issues too...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37so4z/my_bf_m21_and_i_f_22_are_long_distance_and_i_am/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for six months now, long distance the whole time. Met online and have fallen in love. We plan to move in next spring and we both want to marry each other. We talk about our futures and having kids all the time. We have both had one previous relationship on both our ends that we never wanted a future with. With each other, we both know and talk about how we are meant to be together and we can't imagine not being together. So the distance will end soon.


We see each other for two weeks every month, but right now we are apart. Lately my boyfriend has been spending all of his time outside his summer job with his best friend, we will call this guy Max. Max and my boyfriend met when they were little kids and have been best friends ever since.

When I first met Max, it was online of course too, and things didn't sit right with me about him. He would make jokes about my boyfriend being a womanizer who met models (I happen to have modeling under my belt, I used to get paid for it, and my bf said this was a joke Max made because he felt awkward around me, but I dont know why he wanted me to think my bf had met other models). Max also tried to convince me that this porn star I didn't know about (I really am not educated on who is a porn star and who is not, but she's apparently pretty big) was going into the same field in school that I am in college (she is not a student). When I Googled her, I felt kind of insulted and confused by the ""joke"". He pasted a link into our skype call and my bf could tell I was offended because I got quiet. He said he would talk to Max but I don't think he ever did. He said he would ask him to stop joining us online when we hung out but it didn't stop for a while.


So on our last visit together, on our next to last day together, Max sends snapchats to my bf saying ""So excited my bro is coming back!"" I was in a sad mood and I think my bf could tell. He snapped back in front of my saying ""I'm not coming back"" as a joke. Max sent an angry snap face saying ""I will fly down and kidnap you"".

Also, side note here, my boyfriend has started calling me his ""best friend"", and Max calls him his best friend. One time I mentioned Max as his best friend and my bf blinked at me and said, ""YOU are my best friend!""


So my boyfriend told me before he left that Max and one of his other close friends want to hang out the night he gets home, drinking beer and getting high. My boyfriend told me he didn't think getting high was that fun because it was a waste of money and he didn't want to do it. He said, ""if you ever told me you didn't want me to get high, I wouldn't"". I told him I honestly don't want to tell him what to do. I've gotten high (once in my life, my bf used to smoke a lot in high school, every week) so I can't really be a hypocrite and tell him not to. Plus I don't really have an issue with it.


So ever since we got together, my bf and I have always at least talked on the phone every night, or Skyped. It's usually always Skype, with a few exceptions when he was out of town away from his computer. Well that night he got back in to his home state, he spent the night at Max's house. They drank beer (didn't smoke though) and my boyfriend told me later he got a bit drunk. He was texting me happily throughout the night every few hours. I kept waiting for him to call me because he had promised numerous times at the airport that he would. I didn't even suggest it, but it is kind of our thing anyway.


It's getting late and I finally realize he is never calling. So I send my usual sweet goodnight text. It was taking him 30 minutes + to respond that night but to this text he immediately said, ""OH do you want to call you, it's really no problem, sorry..."" etc. 


Did I want him to call? YES. But I did not want to be THAT girlfriend. The girlfriend who makes her boyfriend call her when he is with his best friends and clearly doesn't want to call.

He told me he would call me before he actually went there, and it was understood he would. I didn't want to force him to when he obviously was having too much fun. So I acted like all was fine. He thought I was mad but I convinced him I wasn't. I went to bed with tears in my eyes. I wasn't mad, I was really sad because that was the first night in our entire relationship that i didn't get to hear him on the phone. 


So another thing is, my boyfriend said he wants to work out to ""Look good"" for me. For me, not for him. I insisted his body is amazing to me, it really turns me on. But he said he really wanted to work on it for me. He tells me I  am out of his league. So this summer he has been working out with Max. Which is all fine and good but it is breaking into our nightly routine of Skype/games/hanging out, because Max always changes his mind about when they will go. One day my bf literally texted me three times saying, ""We are going in an hour"" then ""max wants to go after dinner"" then ""oh wait we are going right now! bye!""


Max strikes me as totally selfish. My bf said ever since they were kids, whenever he sleeps over at Max's house, he always takes the floor. Max never offered his bed. And when Max comes over to my bf's house, even when they were CHILDREN, he claimed he needed my bf's bed because of his bad back.


""What kind of middle schooler has a bad back?"" my bf told me once with a few laughs. I couldn't tell if he actually found it funny or not by the way he acted.

Also the first day my bf went to the gym (Max supposedly works out there a lot, so it wasn't his first time), Max was showing him this special room with a huge movie screen in front of the treadmills. He then takes the last one before my bf can take it. So my bf has to go to workout. By himself.


Max has tried to invite himself over to my apartment, in an entirely different state miles away, when my bf and I plan our intimate trips. Luckily he has never come. I honestly probably would have invited him by now if he hadn't been trying to crash on my couch the first month my bf and I got together as a couple, when all I knew about Max was that he liked to post porn star links into our skype sessions... Now I am kind of wary of him.


So flash forward to tonight. It has not even been a week since my bf flew back home, and I feel a shift in things. It's summer so I guess it makes sense things are different now. No set school schedules which make nightly Skype easier. However, this past Sunday was the FIRST night in our ENTIRE relationship that we did not talk on the phone at night and it really shook me. Now tonight, our first weekend apart since our trip, and he said he will be gone until 10 pm at Max's house with their other guy friend. 


I did what I would normally do...played games, but with his brother and some other mutual friends we have online, people he knows in real life but I met online when I got with him. My bf actually came into the room when we were playing, said hi to his brother, and because he knew I was there, called out a hello to me. Then he left for Max's house. I felt really crushed.


He then texted me asking if he was being a bad boyfriend, he felt like he should be with me, he felt terrible, etc. Before I could respond he said, ""I promise that next Friday I am all yours.""


He said he would play and Skype with me all night, until 4 in the morning if I wanted to. But now I don't even know.


What bothers me is that a month ago, he did the same thing - went to Max's house, said he might be out late. But he actually came home early because MAX of all people had ended their hangout session early to be with a girl he was talking to at the time (no longer interested in him though). 


I know we are long distance but why can't my boyfriend leave his friends a little early for his girlfriend? Max can ditch my bf for a girl he is just TALKING TO for a few weeks.


Am I being petty? Maybe I just need to make friends here. I transferred colleges this semester and I don't really have close friends. The few friends I do have have moved home for summer, gone abroad, or are working in different states on internships. Even if I did have anyone here to hang with, I feel like I am the kind of girl who would just want to be with her boyfriend all the time.


What confuses me is that my boyfriend always says, ""I am hanging out with the guys tonight...but I would rather be with you."" Or if I ask how it was, ""Eh, it was alright...I wish I was with you instead"". Today he texted me saying, ""I am hurting and missing you so much right now. I'm sad because I will be hanging out with Max a little late tonight but I wish I could see you :(""


If my boyfriend REALLY just wanted to see me, why does he still spend all his time with them?



   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend claims he would rather hang out with me (I don't prompt or ask this, he just says it) but still picks his friends over me. Also I am unsure if I should push my distaste for his best friend aside or tell him, thus causing an issue."
37sq4y,0,2015-05-29,Reposting this question since no one saw it last night: what software engineering opportunities are there in the financial services sector?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37sq4y/reposting_this_question_since_no_one_saw_it_last/,"I also asked on /r/financialcareers without much success.

&gt; What do financial companies look for in software engineer candidates? Is financial experience preferred, or can you get by with just programming/SE experience and a passion for finance? 

&gt; Can undergrads do quantitative programming, or is that reserved for those with a master's or higher? That is, will I be working on internal software only?

&gt; How do salaries compare to top American tech companies? Is it not as lucrative as people think it is, especially compared to investment banking analyst/associate salaries?

&gt; When I think ""finance"", I think ""investment bank"". Obviously there are other fields like wealth management, private banking, etc. What kind of opportunities are available within ""finance"" for software engineering?

&gt; Here are the areas that are of interest to me:

&gt; * San Francisco. I hear that the city is the ""Wall Street of the West"", Montgomery Street (or maybe California Street) being the eponymous street. This would be the easiest market for me to break into, because it's in a country just to my south. Dem 6:30am market opens, tho.

&gt; * The Middle East. I don't think I would like working anywhere other than Dubai, but there's also Abu Dhabi, Doha, or even Riyadh if the salary is right. Still, 50 degree celsius summers and Islamic theocracy are going to suck, but I may be able to overlook that for a high enough salary.

&gt; * The Asia-Pacific region. I'm going to skip southeast Asia because that's not my jam. I would look more towards (in China) Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wenzhou, Hong Kong; (in Korea) Seoul; or (in Japan) Tokyo. I am especially interested with Wenzhou, the private lending capital of China, but me not knowing Wenzhounese may limit my social life. Korea also sounds interesting, but since I'm a person of colour I'm afraid I'll run afoul of nationalistic Koreans who see any other race as inferior, especially darker-skinned races. That leaves Japan. And unfortunately from my lurking on /r/japan and /r/japanlife, it looks like the financial programming job market in Tokyo is bleak, even for foreign investment banks like Goldman Sachs. Starting salaries can be as low as 5.5 million yen and subject to outsourcing to Bangalore. And for Japanese-style banks, like Mitsubishi UFJ-Morgan Stanley, or Mizhuo Securities? That's basically a zaibatsu salaryman work environment.

&gt; I might be wrong, though. Can anyone wax poetic on the financial software engineering opportunities in SF, the ME, and China/Korea/Japan?

/u/stoxastic did give share some insights:

* Most software engineering done at financial institutions is internal software, also known as ""back-office"" in financial parlance.

* Some companies, like Bloomberg, license out proprietary software developed in-house.

* For financial-heavy programming, there is quantitative finance, which is more mathematical/numerical programming much like machine learning. 

I still am looking for answers for the following questions:

* What kind of opportunities are available for software engineers in the ""financial services"" industry umbrella that don't pay a crappy salary.

* What the financial software engineering career landscape looks like in San Francisco, in Dubai/the rest of the ME, in Singapore, in Beijing, in the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong), in the Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Wenzhou), in Seoul and in Tokyo.

* Whether the idea that earning potential in finance is greater than in traditional tech companies has merit, or is BS.

* Whether I shouldn't bother unless I speak the language (Arabic, Mandarin/Canto/Wenzhounese, Korean or Japanese) or am at least bilingual. That is, how much my employment prospects will shrink if I speak English but not the language of the region. Singapore is an exception.

* How susceptible financial software engineering outside the US is to outsourcing. (i.e. I've heard many of the ibanks in Tokyo have outsourced their software engineering work to Bangalore, Singapore and HK.)

* If, in Japan, I should only stick to foreign multinationals/gaishikei like Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Japan/GSAM Japan, J.P. Morgan Securities Japan, Barclays Securities Japan, etc., or I would be okay in a traditional Japanese corporation like Nomura, Daiwa, Mizhuo, Mitsubishi-UFJ Morgan Stanley, Sumitomo-Mitsui (SMBC Nikko Securities).

* Whether the way to get a job in financial software engineering overseas is similar to getting a job with the ""Big 4"": Know your data structures, study CTCI, have internships under your belt, personal projects and a passion for the field. Or will I need financial experience or even an MBA?

One final note about quantitative finance: Ever since the May 2010 ""Crash of 2:45"", and especially since the Occupy movement, I have associated (perhaps wrongfully) quantitative analysts, algorithmic trading and HFT as part of the problem, not the solution, for America's economic woes. I would hate to be the guy who executed a sell order and wiped out a couple's retirement fund, just so I could make $200,000 a year instead of $150,000 a year. When I was younger, I promised myself that I would try to use a career in software to contribute to society, instead of just making rich people richer at the expense of everyone else. Which is hypocritical of me, considering that if I were to work in finance I would be writing the software that facilitated traders to do just that. That said, I have moderated my views and understand that investment banks and the financial services industry as a whole have an important role to play--allowing companies to access credit, so they can grow and hire new workers, and help keep the economy chugging. M&amp;A's, however, can burn in hell, and I'm still on the fence on being a quant."
37sr9q,3,2015-05-29,[QUESTION] Size comparison question - Seiko 5 vs Hamilton Jazzmaster,HectorPro,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/37sr9q/question_size_comparison_question_seiko_5_vs/,"Hi everyone,

I own a little Seiko 5 (SNK355) that I got to wear to my first office job internships for university this year.  Just recently got my first permanent job and am looking at the Hamilton Jazzmaster Day Date Auto White face Gold Hands (H32505511).

Although the specs say there's only 3mm difference in the sizes (37mm vs 40mm) the few wrist pics I've seen through google of the Hamilton make it seem WAYYY larger than the Seiko (obviously with not perspective on whether those wrists may be men or children).

I was wondering by chance whether someone may own both those and be willing to upload some reference wrists shots - or anyone with similar size watches or comments from experience in this area.  I live in Australia and we don't have the Hamilton's in stores anywhere as far as I can tell so I'll be spending what is a decent chunk of money to me buying blind off the internet.

[The two watches - size not to scale.](http://i.imgur.com/dBk8ap9.jpg)

Thanks for any help or advice anyone can offer, I really appreciate it.

Sincerely, Jason."

I haven't gotten any internship yet so I am actively seeking for one. My GPA is decent and is above 3.0. I had applied for several co-op positions but gotten no response. I recently applied for an internship with a company that is responsible for a rail project in my state. I got a phone interview about 3 weeks ago. The interview was only about 15 minutes. To me, that interview was rather like a small talk. The interviewee didn't ask me a lot of question to get to know me better. He mainly asked me questions about the projects I did in school and my experiences related to those. He said that my cover letter had good writing, good resume, good GPA, etc. He also told me that he will have to contact other candidates first and give me a call back or something for an in-person interview so be aware. I was kinda happy because I thought I could have gotten an engineering internship for real this time. I talked to one of my friends who was a junior and he applied for the same internship too. His GPA was lower than mine and his phone interview was only around 6 minutes. I'm sure he has done less engineering projects than I did as well. Three weeks after the phone call, I have yet to receive an email or a call. I even sent an email to follow up with the situation but got no response. The interviewee responded to my email almost instantly before the phone interview. Therefore, I think he did not choose me mainly due the fact that I am graduating soon, or the other candidates are better than I am. i was really sad and disappointed. Even if he rejected me he should have told me so. Anyway, I don't know what to do now. "

Truth be told, I was never the more active member of Reddit Black. I joined during mid-Ghosts and I remember how ECSTATIC I was to finally find a group of people who loved Call of Duty just as much, and definitely even more for the lot of you, as me.

I joined during my senior year of college while I was concurrently working full time (internship I had during the summer turned into a direct hire) and studying full time at Rutgers University. My free time that I could have dedicated to gaming quickly disappeared and I was online less and less.

When Advanced Warfare rolled around, I told myself that I'd try to be more active and to get to know the members more. I definitely felt the close bonds that more active members have formed over time and it was something that I wanted as well. Unfortunately, AW just decided not to cooperate with me and my 50/50 connection at home; I was always in the red latency despite the multiple patches that were rolled out. The frustration of not being able to play the game without stuttering every 5 seconds eventually lead to me pretty much going off the radar besides a couple of comments on this sub here and there.

Anyways, I just want to tell you guys that even though I'm rarely on nowadays to play, I appreciate all of you and the relatively few times I did play during Clan Wars are some of the best gaming memories I have. Destiny raids were loads of fun as well. 

Reddit Black is incredible. The friendships that develop within this community never cease to amaze me. This clan is truly a one-of-a-kind and I am extremely proud to say that I used to regularly play with you guys.

I start a new job as a HR Business Partner for a 3 year old startup in Manhattan in a couple of weeks. The job is going to suck up a lot of hours and I've pretty much accepted the fact that I will not be gaming much at all anymore for the time being. However, I'll definitely lurk and creep around the sub.

Seriously, thank you guys for showing me what gaming should be all about. It's a damn shame that I was not able to show myself and to contribute as much as I should have.

See ya guys around and thanks again!

37t6xh,1,2015-05-30,[TASK] Need a professional IT resume. You can teach me how to or make one. ($10 or more depending on the result).,unwiseTree,slavelabour,https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/37t6xh/task_need_a_professional_it_resume_you_can_teach/,"I am a recent graduate in the Information Systems field, but I didn't force myself to do a lot of internships. So now my resume looks rather too plain and lacks a lot of things, especially experience. 

I will be paying through pay-pal and here are my requirements:

· I need someone with good IT knowledge, especially SQL things. It would be a plus if you know project management as well.

· I will need you to SKYPE or find some way to communicate with me. IT IS NECESSARY. This way, I sorta have it tailored my way and you can ask me things.

· I need a patient person, because well, I am sorta working at the moment so I might not respond right away. THIS isn't a quick money task. This is why I said it might be more than ten dollars depending on the outcome of the resume.

· YOU might not even have to do a resume, but this would mean you need to give me a lot of insight on my resume.

This is my first time doing something like this and if I'm doing something wrong, please let me know. I could be doing this on my own, but like I said, I have work and things happen through out the day where I hardly even have time to touch the computer. It's NOT great work, this is why I really need a good resume to apply for a different position. I consider myself pretty generous; if I can get an interview with your help/resume. I will pay you more, depending on my salary/wages."
37t8a0,1,2015-05-30,Bionic,BionicZ,WritingHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingHub/comments/37t8a0/bionic/,"It was a groggy June morning.  I had just left my house to go to work.  Something felt off about today, but I had dismissed the feeling quickly.  I arrived at the old laboratory I worked at.  I sighed, grabbed my briefcase, and made my way into the boring white building.

""Morning."" I called to my co-workers. They nodded in unison. Vincent, an intern, had greeted me with coffee. Vincent had been an intern for a few months now.  He has dark brown hair, bright emerald eyes, and looks like he is in his 20's.  Most of the workers here didn't seem to like him and thought he was strange.  I took the coffee and got to work.

We went about our day trying to improve the robots we were working on.  All-of-a-sudden a worker started shouting at Vincent.
""If you can't do it right, let me do it!"" He shouted from afar.  
""I can fix it."" Vincent said calmly.  The co-worker that had yelled noticed everyone else had stopped working and stared. His face turned into an ugly wrinkle. 
""What the hell are you guys looking at?"" The rest of the lab workers hurriedly got back to what they were doing.  

It was lunch break and the guy who had been yelling at Vincent was mumbling about ""getting even"" with him. 

""What did you say?"" I asked him.

""I said 'I'll get my revenge on that punk for making me look like a fool.'""

""So what are you going to do?"" 

""Just a harmless prank,"" he replied with a smug grin.  I though nothing about it and went to go get my lunch.  As everyone was leaving to get lunch, I couldn't help but to notice Vincent was eating alone on the catwalk.  I went to go throw away my trash.

The worker from before was sneaking up behind Vincent with something in his hands.  He sat something small on the floor and pulled out a lighter.  

""Firecrackers?"" I thought. ""What would he do with firecrackers?""  Loud popping noises soon followed.  Vincent was startled and leaped up in fear.  The worker started laughing hysterically. 
""You should've seen your face! Never make me look like a fool again Vincent.""   The co-worker said with a sardonic smile.  Vincent face had grown dark.  Vincent threw a quick punch at the worker, instantly breaking his nose.

""What the hell man? It was a joke."" The worker tried to return a punch, but missed.  He then shoved Vincent.  Vincent lost balance and fell backwards off the catwalk.  Vincent fell into the green, bubbling acid pit.  I couldn't feel my legs move, it didn't seem real. I had knocked the co-worker out of the way and was reaching for Vincent. 

""Vincent grab on!"" I yelled holding out a metal pole. Vincent grabbed it with the one arm he had.  The other arm had been too badly burned.  I pulled Vincent's body out of the pit and ran over to the emergency button. I locked him in the emergency shower then let him out.  He would need a new eye and a new arm.  A black, bloody socket replaced his once green eye. His arm had dissolved off at the shoulder.  It smelled of rotting flesh.  A few minutes passed and off in the distance I heard a faint siren. ""Don't worry,"" I said reassuring Vincent ""They'll be here soon.""

It's been about 8 months since Vincent's accident.  Nobody had spoke a word about it.  I walked down my stairs and turned the T.V. on to the news. 

""BREAKING NEWS: A man who had a tragic accident at the Wilson Robotic Center has disappeared from the Keller Memorial Hospital early this morning.  The man is believed to be Vincent Grayson, an intern working there.""  

""Strange."" I thought to myself.  

""If anyone has seen him, please contact the police."" I shut the TV off and made my way to work.  The roads and sidewalks were strangely empty. I pulled into the parking lot of the Robotic Center.  I walked up to the old building and entered to start my day.  There was no one in sight. Had they canceled today without calling me?

""Hello?"" I called out.  No answer.  Suddenly, someone screamed from the supply closet.  I sprinted over to the supply closet and made my ways through the shelves. ""Is anyone in here? Are you okay?""

""Get out! He's coming!"" 

""Who is coming?"" After that I heard a strange gurgling noise and decided to hide under a shelf with an old tarp.  Someone was walking past where I was hiding.

His steel-toed boots shuffled against the old oak floors.  He hasn't notice where I was hiding; yet.  I took short, shallow breaths in fear of being discovered.  I saw the green glow of his eye dart back and forth around the room.  I had accidentally shifted my shoe which caused a loud squeaking noise.  The squeak sounded like the only think in the universe.  My eyes started to water and my throat closed up. 

""What have I done?"" I thought to myself.

""There you are,"" The man whispered as he approached. It was Vincent!  His eye was replaced with a new robotic eye.  His right arm looked like a robotic arm  and half of his jaw was replaced with metal.  He grabbed my arm as I struggled to get loose from his grip. I felt a small sharp pain on my bicep.  Suddenly, everything started to get darker until there was total darkness.

I woke up in a damp cellar.  A putrid odor had been coming from the far corner of the room and I could make out a pile of lumps, but I couldn't tell what it was.  The smell was nauseating, I instantly vomited. I was dangling upside-down from what I could tell.  The only light was a beam from the crack in the old door.  I heard a familiar shuffle from outside the door.  The door opened and filled the room with creaks and light.  Dead bodies of the other workers laid about the room.  The older man hanging next to me started coughing and finally vomited.  Bionic tilted his head in curiosity and made his way over to him.

""No, please no!"" The man cried out. Vincent chuckled and grabbed the mans face.  He dug his metallic arm into the mans right eye.  The man flooded the room with his screaming.  Vincent removed his claw and warm blood splattered everywhere.  Next he pried open the mans mouth and ripped his tongue out.  He then threw the eye and tongue into the pile in the corner.  He took his claw and cut open the mans stomach, revealing his intestines.  I couldn't help but to watch in fear, knowing I would be next.  Vincent ripped the mans intestines out and shoved them back into the mans throat.  The man had surprisingly still been alive, but only for a few more seconds.  Gurgling noises came out as he chocked on the intestines.  Vincent plunged his fist into the chest out the old man and ripped out the heart.  He forced open my mouth and shoved bits of the heart into it.  I vomited up the chunks of the mans body.

""Vincent please,"" I begged.

""There isn't a 'Vincent' anymore.  Only Bionic."" Vincent replied with a scratchy, raspy voice. 

The last thing I saw was Vincent's green glowing eye and sardonic smile slowly approaching me.

  Though general advice is desired, I’ll provide specifics so that it could tailored. 

* **Research Topic:** general learning algorithms (and general learning through self-modifying programs like Gödel Machine) - frankly, I realize this is a far-fetched thing but I don’t care if I spend fruitless years here - what else am I going to do with my life?
* 1 IEEE conference paper, first author and presenter (non-AI conference)
* 3.9 GPA and Top Computer Science Undergrad award at my (no-name) university
* 1 technical internship (unpublished research) at top company
* graduated undergrad in 3 years
* full academic undergraduate scholarship
* 2 years software engineer at different, top company

37ttlv,177,2015-05-30,[Ridealong] I had the pleasure of assisting in the arrest of a prowling child predator on Halloween night in 2014.,[deleted],TalesFromTheSquadCar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/37ttlv/ridealong_i_had_the_pleasure_of_assisting_in_the/,"Around the tail end of the spring in 2014, I began the process of discharging from the United States Army after serving since 2011. My ambitions post-transition were to become a sworn full time law enforcement officer in the state of Tennessee. I had the pleasure of meeting a Recruiting Sergeant from a local PD at a career fair sponsored by the U.S. Army and we hit it off. 2 months later, I was offered an internship that I took while transitioning out of the military. It was a great experience, and it took me on roughly 10 ride-alongs with the same FTO who confirmed my ambitions about becoming a law enforcement officer.


I asked and was allowed to ride with FTO A* for a 3rd shift patrol (1800-0600) on Halloween night. I enjoyed riding with FTO A because he was also prior service military, serving 10 years as a Military Policeman before medically discharging to become a Police Officer. He treated me like an adult and allowed some lee-way once he was confident that I was not a reckless individual. I would step out on traffic stops, step out on unruly juvenile calls, etc. I had made fairly decent friends with most of the Patrolman on the 3rd shift roster, and I felt very comfortable around them. I have since moved from Tennessee so sadly, I was not able to be employed by the Department. 


FTO A had noted that his wife had split their candy supply down the middle and rationed him off half so that we could hit the local neighborhoods and chat with some of the trick or treaters, but our night started off with an immediate Code 3 cover within seconds of us calling 10-8. Officer B* had recently announced a traffic stop on a silver Honda Accord traveling west bound after he observed the vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. When he stepped out on the vehicle to make his initial approach, he observed a red, late model (2000 - 2004) Chevrolet Silverado full size pick up truck brandish a firearm out the window, at a passing motorist, then speed off. It was believed by Officer B that the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado did not observe Officer B, as his front light bar lights were off, and his forward facing take-down lights were only illuminated at the silver Honda Accord.


Officer B retreated to his vehicle after releasing the Honda Accord and sped off in an attempt to intercept the Chevrolet Silverado, he had announced on the radio that he would need units going enroute Code 3 and a TAC channel, as he'd be conducting a felony stop on the Silverado if the intercept was successful. 


FTO A and I called our cover and began our commute to Officer B's location, but upon arrival, Officer B announced over the air that the vehicle was lost, and issued a BOLO via Teletype. We did not see the Chevrolet Silverado for the remainder of our shift.


Going 10-8 from our location, Officer B proceeded back to his zone and FTO A and I proceeded north to the interstate, as it was the quickest, most direct route back to our zone. Upon entering the on-ramp onto the highway, FTO A noted to me that the driver (newer model Ford Explorer, white) in front of us was having a difficult time maintaining a lane. After transitioning onto the interstate and continuing for roughly a mile, FTO A noted that his suspicion was unfounded and that the driver was most likely driving distracted. FTO A and I exited the interstate and transitioned back into our zone and continued our patrol. 


Roughly 15 minutes after re-entering our zone, FTO A and I were called to an unruly juvenile at a foster home and began our commute to the location. FTO A noted that he was familiar with this foster home in particular, and expressed his lack of trust for the employees working at the foster home. We arrived at the address around 10 minutes later, and stepped out to make contact.


Upon entering the residence I noted the smell of feces and possibly urine, as well as significant property damage done inside the residence (broken book shelves, broken chair, two visible holes in an exterior wall, a yellow liquid on the kitchen floor that was later determined to be urine). The on-shift employee at the foster home informed FTO A and I that a 10 year old juvenile whose guardianship is maintained by the foster home became enraged when the on-shift employee refused to allow the foster home to go trick or treating. While most of the other juveniles simply accepted this decision, the one 10 year old juvenile in particular began arguing with the on-shift employee and eventually began stomping his foot and yelling. The on-shift employee informed FTO A and I that once he told the 10 year old juvenile that his decision was final, the juvenile began enraged and began throwing books, pushed a book shelf over on top of a chair, punched a wall several times, and in the process of this rage had soiled himself as well as urinated on the kitchen floor. FTO A took a report from the on-shift employee, and the on-shift employee noted that he would like FTO A to take the juvenile into custody on an ""unruly juvenile"" charge. FTO A informed the juvenile to place his hands behind his back, and handcuffed him, before searching him and informing him that he was going to be placed in our custody under an ""unruly juvenile"" charge. The 10 year old juvenile was transported from the foster home, to the local jail where he was seen by a Court Magistrate, and placed in a juvenile holding cell pending an arrival of Child Protective Services.


Released from the Court Magistrate, FTO A and I announced our 10-8 and commuted roughly 10 minutes back into our zone before pulling into a local parking lot. FTO A shorthanded some notes that I inputted into the MDT and we submitted the report to the Patrol Sergeant after a careful review by FTO A. At that point, it was roughly 2030 hours and FTO A began coordinating with another officer, Officer C* about passing out candy in the local neighborhoods. 


FTO A and I departed the parking lot and proceeded south, into a small neighborhood where we began to pull alongside trick or treaters and converse casually with them and their parents. Candy was passed out, and the process repeated itself up and down the block. Roughly 10 minutes into a conversation that FTO A was having with a parent, I observed a beige, late model Buick Century with no operating head lights, driving slowly down the street in my side-view mirror. I alerted FTO A about the suspicious vehicle, and he leaned over my seat and sternly said out of the window as the Buick passed us: ""Turn your lights on.""


The driver of the vehicle quickly turned his head to the side and seemed shocked by the presence of a police officer, and immediately stated: ""I'm sorry!"" in a very anxious tone. FTO A and I both observed that the driver of the vehicle was acting suspicious, and pulled out behind him and initiated a traffic stop. FTO A and I exited the vehicle, while FTO A approached the driver side of the Buick and I maintained an observation from the rear, passenger side door. FTO A and the driver conversed for roughly 3 minutes before he returned to the unit with the driver's information. FTO A noted that the driver did not emit any odor of alcohol which he found strange, but that the driver was very anxious and his hands were visibly shaking. 


FTO A began relaying to Control and Wants &amp;amp;amp;amp; Warrants, with the dispatcher returning a highlight announcing that the individual we had pulled over was indeed a registered sex offender, with past charges including aggravated sexual abuse of a child and that he lived in a city roughly 40 miles away from our city. FTO A informed Control that he would need another unit to our location for cover, and we waited inside our unit for Officer C to arrive.


Upon Officer C's arrival, FTO A and Officer C approached the vehicle and told the driver to step out. They immediately detained him and brought him to the front of our vehicle for questioning. Control came back with another highlight for the driver, alerting FTO A and Officer C that the sex offender had been put on a curfew for Halloween night by his parole agent, and that he was not supposed to be out past 1900 hours. I wrote down the pertinent information, including the specifics of his sex offender registry, and passed them off to FTO A so he could cross check them during his on-scene questioning.


When asked why he was out, in a residential neighborhood, in a city nowhere near his residence, on Halloween night, as a sex offender, the driver of the vehicle informed FTO A that he was simply out to ""clear his head"". FTO A seemed disgusted, and asked Officer C to watch on him while he conducted a brief vehicle search. 


The search of the vehicle revealed several bags of candy, as well as an assisted open knife, and a pack of condoms. A small bag of marijuana (2-3 grams) was also found as FTO A was concluding his search. When confronted by FTO A with the fact that the sex offender was driving around in a neighborhood, nowhere near his residence, on Halloween night, as a sex offender, with a pack of condoms, a knife, candy, and marijuana, the sex offender shut down completely and refused to cooperate from that point. He was placed under arrest for violation of a sex offender registry, simple possession of marijuana, and other charges I'm sure that I'm not aware of. He was transported by Officer C to the local Sheriff's detention center.


Tried to write it almost like a report, so it probably seems a bit black &amp;amp;amp;amp; white. Was definitely one of the more interesting but screwed up things I've been out on. Was very rewarding knowing that he didn't get a chance to do anything terrible to those children.

For the last three years I've been gaming on a console with my poor AMD A8 laptop being pushed to the limit trying to run PC only games like KSP, Skylines and indies I pick up on steam. I'm about to start an internship and I'll finally have some money, so I've decided to build a PC that will give me more than 15fps at lowest settings :). 

I do most of my AAA gaming on my PS4. I like consoles and its what my freinds have got, so I'm not looking for something to play GTAV @ max. I'm going budget performance here, which is why I want to stick to the FX processors.  

I've never really looked at PC parts before, so input is very welcome, especially on things like PSU/Case/RAM."
37u2f6,0,2015-05-30,Summer courses or internship?,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/37u2f6/summer_courses_or_internship/,"First of all, I wanna get into ucb in the computer science program . My first sat, which I studied for only a few weeks, was 1600. I'm confident that if I study over the summer I can get a 2000.

 This summer I have a choice to either go to a 2 month course at Ucb or get a 1 month internship at a company in San Francisco for a month. 

What do you guys think is the better choice? 2 month course and probably a lower sat score or 1 month internship and much more time for studying and volunteer work?

Ps; I live 16 hours in flight time away from the US."
37u31f,2,2015-05-30,Master of none trade.,[deleted],INTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/37u31f/master_of_none_trade/,"I know that this is the INTP clichee, but I am serious ... I personally like being that way, but I don't know how this will hold up for my future, especially financially.

The only thing that I am truly ""good at"" is anything related to computers. But the problem is, that I never specialized in any way. To give you some examples ..

- The display on my MacBook died a year ago, I knew enough about the electronics to pin down the defect to a specific component, find out which one was built into my device and read the corresponding data sheet and what was causing the defect. Learned a lot of stuff about displays in the process.

- My girlfriend wanted to make a memory game for her mother as a motherday's gift. Instead of painfully arranging the images by hand, I knew that there was something like ImageMagick - wrote a small script and the whole process was done in maybe 20 minutes.

- During school I had an internship at a software agency. They had some kind of SQL-code that we were asked to write into an Excel-table because of human readability. Google-fu, fiddling around with phpmyAdmin and the whole process was done in maybe 30 minutes. 

That's the thing. I am no programmer, but I know enough stuff to automize certain mundane processes. No server admin, but enough knowledge to find an effective way to install a disk image via network. No electronics guy, but knew enough about soldering, that I built a Fastboot cable to revive a bricked Android tablet. 

The problem is, that this whole thing isn't just limited to computer stuff. Throughout the years my interests fluctuated from one topic to another, I have changed my major twice (from English/Economy/Psychology to Biology to Geography), have worked at a social media agency, as a modern art tour guide ...

Now what? I seriously don't know, where I fit. To give you an idea of the topics that have interested me the most over time:

- Trains (what's not to like about trains?)
- Pokémon (a perfect, rewarding world)
- Computer Science
- Physics/Engineering (fascinated but too lazy/dumb to actually do something in that sector)
- Geography (especially map-making and integration with geolocation-stuff)
- Sweden (probably my country of choice)
- Journalism (although I am somewhat disappointed in the current state of it)
- ""Sound Design"" (creating interesting soundscapes by editing and sampling everyday sounds)
- Video Editing
- Photography (everything from analogue to glitching images by editing the raw data in a text editor or using SSTV-transmissions spammed with noise)
- Skepticism
- Asia (North Korea and Japan in particular)
- Basically ... researching and acquiring knowledge. 

Currently studying Geography. Don't know how to find something, that will pay the rent and allow my girlfriend and me to settle down in Sweden, at least for some time. I do GTD to structure my daily life at least a bit, but yeah. Pretty clueless about my future.

37u6em,3,2015-05-30,Feeling homesick,Jweller9,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37u6em/feeling_homesick/,"I've recently moved to Colorado from Pennsylvania for a summer internship. Upon receiving this opportunity I was beyond excited! After making the trip out here with my father, we both realized it might have been a mistake. I get extremely homesick nearly everyday. I know that this is only temporary, but just the feeling of not being with my friends or family is killing me. I get nervous that at some point my depression from this is going to get worse and I'm going to do something stupid. What can I do to help cope with being so far away? I literally only have 10 more weeks of this job, but to me it feels like an eternity.
PS- it also doesn't help that my mother was diagnosed with cancer and she is undergoing treatments right now. I feel like I am abandoning her and I need to be home to take care of her."

37uanp,2,2015-05-30,Linked in newbie: What to add and what not?,just__another__loser,linkedin,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/37uanp/linked_in_newbie_what_to_add_and_what_not/,"I'm new to Linked in and the ""grownup"" World in general, thus I'm not sure what's good to add to my profile and what not. I'll tell you a little about me, and then ask my questions, just so you have a bit of background.

I'm a college student in my final year, and if all goes well, I'll graduate at the end of the year. I'm doing a 4-year bachelors in 3 years. I've received a scholarship in September last year, but in a field that I'm not studying in. I did a kind of internship thing at a company and they offered me the scholarship, which includes part-time work, and 6 months full-time work after completing my studies. I've also been working since age 14, working with my father that does contract work for a company. I've worked my way into the structures of said company, and have been asked to travel around for them. As a final note, I'm not in the US at the moment, but have spent time there over the last few years, and I'd like to permanently relocate there.

So here's my questions:

1. I added the work I did for the company my father does contract work for, since the work I do is in the field of my studies; would you say that's a good idea?

2. I'm in a band, recording our first album next month: Should I add that to my profile?

3. Should I add my CV to my profile?

4. I've done volunteering work. This has been mostly at my Church, performing at old-age-homes with my band, or lending a hand whenever I see someone can use one. There's no structure to it, and I don't keep track of hours volunteered or anything like that. I feel it should be something spontaneous. Should I add volunteering to my profile? I saw the section for it, but don't really know how to go about it.

5. I've received National Colors in something called ""Land Service"". I don't really know how to describe it, but it's basically doing work to preserve the natural beauty of our country. Picking up trash, removing trees and plants that endanger the indigenous plant species, building reinforcements for natural streams, things like that. Would this be something to add to my profile?

6. What exactly is the deal with the ""Skills"" section. When does something start qualifying as a ""Skill"", and when is it just something you can do or have knowledge of? Simple example: I had IT Programming in school, and did Java for three years. I have a basic understanding of it, and I can remember most of it, but I wouldn't volunteer to write large programs that can be deployed in a company. Is Java something I can add as a skill?

7. What qualifies as ""Projects"" and what doesn't? I'll explain with another simple example: I helped someone build a deck a year ago. It took most of my summer vacation, but by the end I had an nice tan and we built a cool looking deck by his(engineer) pool. This doesn't have much to do with what I'm studying or the work I'm doing, does this count as a project? Another one: As part of my IT class in school I had to do a project. The project took the whole year to complete, and took hours and hours, and thousands of lines, of coding. Does that count as a project?

8. Is it okay to add things to your profile that doesn't have much to do with your field of work or study? Like sporting achievements for instance?

9. And finally, what can I do to improve my chances to be seen by companies abroad? As I said, I'd like to relocate to the US, so what can I do to increase my chances of international companies discovering me? (I currently have no location set on my profile.)

Thank you for taking the time to answer all these questions. It's much appreciated!"
37uzg3,3,2015-05-30,Very Confused,[deleted],dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/37uzg3/very_confused/,"Background: I met this woman in college through an acquaintance and initially viewed her as only a friend until we exchanged numbers. Long story short, we texted each other 24/7 for at least a month and a half straight (big mistake). She used to say that I lived so far and wished I lived closer (2 hours away) so we can see each other more. She also stated that she will have more time to see me once her internship finishes. We have many things in common, including the same career path. We went on a few dates but never thoroughly explained our intentions with each other, but agreed that going with the flow was the best thing to do. She's timid and very closed off, but I told her that everytime we're together, it will be an adventure. So far our dates have been something she has never experienced (baseball games, sushi, hiking, etc..). We both previously had shitty relationships, with hers being the more recent and she stated that her ex never brought her anywhere.

Last few weeks: Up until 2 weeks ago, I noticed she became a bit cold and distant after a date. The date was great, and we spoke about relationships in general. She was amazed by how much I knew about how to treat women, which she always acknowledged when we were together. But after that day, I noticed her text messages were less responsive and lacked substance. I didn't think nothing of it and understood that we both have busy lives. I gave her space when it was necessary, but we still conversed about school. 

Graduation: During and after finals, we spoke to each other a few times up until our department graduation ceremony. We walked the stage together and planned on meeting up later that night, but a family matter came up. She acknowledged the matter and I promised to make it up to her next weekend. I texted her the next day with no response. I didn't text her again until last Thursday to see if she wanted to go shooting at a spot I was going to checkout in her hometown the following week. No response. Friday night I get a text message from her regarding our 2nd graduation ceremony (class of 2015 ceremony). I was set on not attending, but realized that it may be the last time I may see anyone from school again. Her text messages were more enthusiastic and as alive as before. I picked her up the next morning before heading to the ceremony, and realized she went to the ceremony for us. I have a lot of friends and didn't mind not sitting with her, but she made sure that we were together. During the ceremony, she wanted to take me to a huge Frat party which she bought two tickets for, but I already made plans and was going to see her later that night. I noticed she became a bit sad. Up until we met up at the bars with a few friends, she texted me about how excited she was to meet all of my friends and sister. I even surprised her with a bottle of her favorite liquor, and refused to  drink with my friends until she was with me. She was flattered and I noticed her demeanor transform from excitement to pure happiness.  My friends like her a lot, she likes my friends, and we all had a great time. In between bars, I held her close to me and gave her my jacket since I knew she was cold. I treated her with respect, even though I can get a bit crazy when I'm drunk. Upon departure, we gave each other a big hug and she stated she will see me next time.

This week: The next day, Sunday, she immediately texted me in the morning stating how much fun she had, and even asked if I was feeling okay from drinking too much. She talked about how she wants to see me again, she wanted to hang out more often, and even made plans to see each other again. She even got in trouble for texting me while she was at work. Then out of nowhere, she completely stopped. I knew she got off at a certain time, which was around the time I got off so I couldn't reply until then. Knowing her daily routine, she usually texts me right after she gets out, drives home, showers, then texts me until she sleeps, but no text. The next day, I asked her when she was free this week to go shooting, and I also texted her a few pictures we took together. No response. Two days later, I informed her that our professors posted our final grades. No response. I know it's only been a few days since Sunday, but it's weird how she just ignored these text messages when she used to reply at least by the time she's off work. WTF is going on? I really don't want to fuck up with her. I am a patient and persistent man, but my biggest fear has always been losing someone so nexting her isn't really an option.

Questions/Theories: 

- Did she catch feelings so quick that she's trying to back off by giving herself space?

- Is she keeping her guard up, due to her previous relationships?

- If she's so busy, why does she instantly reply to her best friend's messages, and ignores mine?

- Is she playing hard to get or giving me a shit test?

- Am I overanalyzing shit? If so, should I contact her again?

- Should I be persistent (chase) or patient (space)?

Any help is great. I've never been so hung up on a woman. I think I've finally met my match."
37v0sa,0,2015-05-30,Need advice for dealing with Asian parents on topic of leaving for a summer,[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/37v0sa/need_advice_for_dealing_with_asian_parents_on/,"I am an Asian kid currently living with two abusive and controlling ""Tiger"" parents. Most specifically, my father gets extremely violent and is almost constantly yelling and blaming things. He started yelling threateningly because my mom wanted to change her phone wallpaper, tried to beat me up while spitting in my face because I looked at him disappointingly, attacked my mom and injured her because she wanted to get an X-ray, ""for her safety"".

This being said, my mom is still an enabler and while less violent and less consistently angry like my ndad, she is no freedom-lover. 

As some other people have mentioned on this reddit, they are likely envious, and want to cannibalize my childhood, in a way. 

Anyhow, with my ndad's extreme resistance to my independence, change, success, and general ideas, I am planning to do an internship in Boston this summer and already have housing booked and everything. However, I am still under 18 so my ndad can still abuse me. The internship is not a simple office internship, it is an engineering internship, one that would probably help my future quite a lot. Despite all of this (or maybe because of this), my ndad is extremely violent and obsessively tries to do everything in his power to stop me from doing this, the same way he has tried to stop me from doing a whole load of other things for my own future. He's doing things from inventing ""laws"" that prevent me from going to calling the place where I am staying to make them dislike me and reject me from staying there. He also has this self-centered ""no one cares about you except for me"" and ""everyone is out to get you"" attitude. 

What do I do?"

I really need the advice of people who've been in the industry a few years.
I did a 12 month MSc CS conversion course. I was offered a 3 month internship at a small start-up, that ended up being more cheap labour, but they offered me a job. I've now worked there 18 months. 
Basically, I've not learnt much at all for 18 months of employment, and it's been totally unstructured, incomplete learning. (""just get it done asap"" style..). There's no training, development, personal projects, mentoring, spare time.. nothing.
Also, the company is a complete circus. The only senior dev works remotely, the guys running it aren't technical at all, and absolutely nothing is written down. Our briefs are verbal, maybe a couple of sentences, and they continually change, making working there hugely stressful when you throw in the deadlines.

He did a couple internships, research, and all that
normal stuff so he could get a great job. He interviewed a lot, and finally got his dream offer from a large company. Up until now, as far as he told us, him and his girlfriend
of 3 1/2 years have been planning and packing for his move to the west coast for work and for her to continue her grad studies there. 

He was supposed to leave today on the drive there in
the UHaul, but he called me, said he had told the company he was no longer interested, gave up the relocation package they were supposed to give him, and had enlisted in the military. 

I was dumbstruck. I had no idea that this was happening and when I called his girlfriend she said she had no idea either. She also told me that he broke up with her yesterday night and had
given her all her stuff back that was in his apartment(they were living together). I guess she's staying with her friends until she finds her own way to move out west, but I suppose that's not really my issue anymore, but I feel very bad for her that my son did this out of the blue. He said he wanted to do something bigger with his life and have responsibilities more then he would working engineering like normal. 

I have no idea how to process this. I talked to his father and I guess my son had been questioning for apparently, almost the last 2 years, what he was doing with his life, and I guess a couple of weeks
after he got his offer, that he could no longer do it and used it as a guise to help pack up his life up neatly. He told my husband apparently 4 days ago that he was enlisting and to not tell me before he could
do it himself. I can probably shoulder some of the blame on my husband for this, he's always encouraged my son with his interest in the military and used some of his friends to help get him one of his internships with a
company that works for the navy or something like that. His brothers have no idea for now, and I don't think he told them.(He was never close with them)

My son also had a military phase in high school where he wanted to enlist, but I, and not really his father, talked him out of it and said that he should go to university instead and get a degree. I made it clear that I really did not want him to do this at that time or really ever, and I thought it had stuck, but I guess I was wrong. 

I really have no idea what to do about this. Do I just let him do what he wants to do? Should I? I feel mad that he didn't tell me sooner and that he dumped his girlfriend(I really liked her and was
hoping they'd get married soon and have kids.) I definitely feel mad at my husband for keeping this from me, but I guess he probably knew how I would react and I don't blame him for trying to keep the trust of our son. 

tl;dr - my son enlisted in the military, throwing away a really, really great job, his girlfriend and his life, I don't know how to respond or what to do"

37vtou,88,2015-05-30,[UPDATE 4] Me [19M] with my parents who have made the last 4 months shit.,JohnYo55,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37vtou/update_4_me_19m_with_my_parents_who_have_made_the/,"Hi,

It's been a while since I posted here and I'm not sure if people still care about this whole drama, but I'm going to post about it anyway. So yah, here you go.

I start my internship on Monday, I just flew 3 hours to get to my destination and I'm somewhat settled in (no grocery stores nearby though, so that's a problem). Anyways, some of you may remember me but if not, you can read the previous posts here:

 Update 3- http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xtell/update_3_me_19_m_with_my_parents_still_insane/

Original Post - http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tgxkh/me_19_m_with_my_mom_60s_f_i_received_an/


So not much after update 3, I withdrew all the money from (our joint account) that was technically mostly my money. She put a little less than half in while I was in high school, but I didn't know that (I worked through HS, didn't really pay attention to money at the time). Parents were angry and called me a liar, deceitful, all of that because I technically took some of their money. I offered to give it back, but they said the only way they would take it would be if I restarted a joint account with them. Odd, because they said they were cutting me off and were done with me.

Anyways, shortly after that, I started going to therapy sessions at my university. It was helpful in a way, except..during my first session, I walk in, begin discussing the problems I have been having with my parents, and the therapist immediately comes around and tells me that my parents emailed her. What the fuck? They just said that they cared about my health (odd, because they started all this bullshit), and thought I shouldn't even need to see someone. The therapist couldn't confirm or deny to my mom that I was seeing her, so I guess I had that going for me. I continued going to sessions, but I only got through about 2 or 3 before classes ended.

After I posted on r/personalfinance, I submitted the FAFSA alone, without my parental information because they simply would not provide any tax information for me to get any sort of loans. They thought it ""wasn't safe"" and that ""loans are stupid"". Except the only way I could continue to go to college was through loans, because they said they refused to pay. Odd, yet again.

Either way, I went to my FA office many times and discussed my options. I would be allowed to get 7.5k a year which might be enough if I continue to work more hours/ take a semester off. Easy. I went in again before I left for my internship and my parents ALSO EMAILED FINANCIAL AID. And said ""Do not grant him loans, we will pay for his education"".

So, to put things clearly, they are emailing every adult I am in contact with. Some of you may remember my girlfriend who was also (harassed) by my mother via email. It's just so fucked up. I feel like they are fucking me over every way possible, and the uncertainty that they might pay for my college and may not is just too much to deal with. It's hard planning for both outcomes when I can't even get loans or talk to a therapist without hearing about my parents.

My brother invited me to his baby's confirmation (religious event for those who don't know, which, for the record, he only became a christian for his wife, but I digress) and told me it would be a ""good step to making things better with everyone"", implying that it was all my fault in the first place. I haven't been apologized to, I haven't heard anything that would indicate remorse on my parents end. For those who think my parents didn't do anything to me, please just leave this thread and/or read my older posts. They ruined this semester for me, I was somewhat lucky to pass my classes. I've been dealing with too much - finances, finding a new job, working, classes, interviews, etc..

I posted this in another thread but at one point my mom said to me: Yesterday my mom texted me ""I bet your asian friends wouldn't dare act like this to their parents"". And I'm just sitting here like, what the fuck am I listening to. It's not really that big of a thing, but she's done things like that before. So fuck her. It just angers me to no end. My SO is asian and when my parents didn't wake me up for Thanksgiving dinner I went to my asians friend's house and ate with his adorable family. They were fucking awesome.


There is definitely more that has happened, but I can't think of it. Maybe i'll add more later. I just want advice. Stories. How can things get better? I can afford like, my first semester of school with loans/current bank, but after that, I have 1.5 years left. I've been researching internship opportunities for the fall or winter, but to no avail as of yet.

I'm going to be working on myself a lot during my internship, getting my health back and spending time with (hopefully) some good people.

If anyone has any advice for me moving forward about how to deal with my parents or any of that, it would be great. Hopefully this doesn't sound like a bunch of ranting.

TL;DR parents emailed every adult I was in contact with without my knowledge, are wishy-washy about paying for my education even after they said they were done, and it's too much to deal with. I just want to go no contact. Advice moving forward?

im not exactly sure on how this works really, but i saw someone posting an INTRO and decided to do one my self since i enjoy rambling about myself.
My name is alsar, people usually call me Alyy (kinda stuck), Im 22 and i work as activity director for my campus residence (i live there too). Im finishing my fourth year of engineering study and then im off to work on my internship before coming back to finish my final year project. 
that basically skimps the surface about me. I work on electronics alot, which is what im majoring in. i enjoy building hardware and working with live power and hoping that becomes my path of work. 
In my spare time i help students who require assistance with computers which mostly comes to ""i cant install this"" or ""my mouse stopped working"".minimal stuff but i enjoy helping. I also do alot of running, and lately quit smoking and have started running again (i try to squeeze 30 minutes a day for running in the morning). 
As for my work, i organize activities for student to meet each other, such as movie nights, world food lunch (different foods from around the world), or outdoor group walks and such. we all know how hard it is to meet new people when living somewhere new, but we dont realize that everyone else is just like us, scared (more like ""shy"") to start talking and introduce them self. its like AA meetings but helping people over come their anxiety. and you get to meet alot of people, each one as unique as a book. all those activities are sponsored by the university. 
I don't know what else to say, just ask me any questions you may have and I'll try to answer them :)"

37wq2h,33,2015-05-30,A Minimalist's rant about a Saturday family project.,ANewCreation,minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/37wq2h/a_minimalists_rant_about_a_saturday_family_project/,"This morning my dad told me that we had a project to accomplish. He has been talking about putting lattice on the back of our deck for a while. He is always talking about how we have a lot of *stuff* down under our deck and it makes us look bad because all of our *stuff* is down there and it looks messy. I agree.

So anyway, we start on this project. It is clear that he doesn't really have any idea what exactly needs to be done. There really isn't a game plan which is besides the point of this post but annoyed me nonetheless. Anyway, he starts sorting through all of our *stuff* in the garage in order to find a few tools that we will need. As he's doing this I look at all the wood he has bought for this project and I think, ""dang, this is probably a lot more than we will actually need."" Then I keep looking around our garage and on the side of the house. I come to realize that there is wood around our property from all the other finished projects that we are always keeping ""to use it another time."" Guess what? ""Another time"" never seems to come up.

As we are putting the lattice on the deck, I start thinking about the root of this problem - all of our *stuff* underneath the deck that is an eye sore. ""Maybe we should clean it all up and throw most of it away and just have this be a nice empty space,"" I think. But, no - this doesn't happen.

About a quarter of the way through the day, it is realized that we need a converter - one of those things which takes a two prong outlet into a three prong one. So the search begins. We look through all of our *stuff* in the garage to no end. We then look through all of our *stuff* in the basement. We eventually find it but not before my dad remarking ""dang, I've probably bought 4 or 5 of those things and keep losing them."" After this, I gave the ground a blank stare.

By the middle of the day we had very little accomplished. Much of the time was used looking through our *stuff* to find the tools and things we needed and transporting our *stuff* to where we were working. During this whole time of managing our *stuff*, the working atmosphere was not good at all. This happens all the time with these family projects. People get annoyed with each other and some people don't like how others do things and everything ends badly with a lot of hurt feelings and harsh words said.

At this point I started thinking about all the other things I could have done with this time today. Early this morning I woke up and went for a run which was great - it's one of my hobbies. Runs always make me feel good (afterwards at least) and they are a great start to my day. I was looking forward to working on some investment ideas (another one of my hobbies), prepare for my internship that is coming up next week and do a few other things with my day but none of this happened.

Instead, I spent the whole day looking through our *stuff* to find the *stuff* we needed to hide our *stuff* from other people.

Lessons from the day:

* ""Another time"" never ends up coming. Throw it away.

* You don't realize how much time you spend managing your *stuff*.

* Managing your *stuff* takes time away from doing productive things with your life.

* Stop accumulating stuff. Start living.

37wqa2,1,2015-05-30,Commercial Banking career path/resume advice!,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/37wqa2/commercial_banking_career_pathresume_advice/,"Hello all, 

From what I can gather, correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the best ways to break into commercial banking out of your undergrad is credit analysis. All the opening I'm finding online require 3-5  years credit analyst experience! (Cool how do you get those 3-5 years though if everyone is requiring it!) I've had three internships but none in credit analysis. I played baseball and was studying engineering for my first two years, and switched to a double in accounting and finance when I was cut from the baseball team. My cummulative thanks to engineering is a 3.1, but I have a business  GPA of 3.7 and a Finance GPA of 3.9 will that cumulative stop me from getting into the field??

I'll also be completely alone, I know no one in Ottawa and won't be able to get help, long drive to visit family, etc.
The only advantage Ottawa has is co-op. Of course, it's not going to be like Waterloo's co-op, but how good is it? Is it worth? Mostly talking about ECE/BME jobs of course."
37wx6h,114,2015-05-30,Am I [22/F] a terrible person having an ego trip or is it time to reevaluate the relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years [23/M],ThrowawayCastaway27,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37wx6h/am_i_22f_a_terrible_person_having_an_ego_trip_or/,"This is probably gonna feel more like a confession than a question. Because I feel really terrible about my feelings and behaviors.

I've been with my current bf for almost 4 years. It's been a mostly happy relationship and I always imagined myself being with him in the long run until recently. We went to the same college and it was really easy to see each other on campus. It became a little complicated later when he graduated and I was still in school but we coasted by. He lives close to downtown while I live in the suburbs with my parents, but I often visit him after school or work.

This last year has been incredibly difficult and busy for me, I was trying to manage a job, an internship and full time school after basically having a shit GPA and resume for 3 years. He's been... mostly supportive through it, often complaining that he didn't see me enough.

These past few months I've felt a little bit cold about the relationship, I still loved him and I tried my best to visit him as much as possible but sometimes it was just exhausting for me. He would come tired, moody and grumpy from work whilst I was just excited to see him. 

We fell into a routine of me or him cooking, watching netflix and sex. And honestly I wasn't enjoying it that much, sometimes sex felt like a chore (even with me being such high libido and us having sex 2-3 times a day before) and I often felt to guilty because I thought about other people instead of him and he didn't really satisfy me anymore. But I kept all of those thoughts in the back of my head because ""he was a good guy that didn't really do anything wrong""

I guess I started thinking about things when I graduated a couple of weeks ago. I finally had some free time and in addition to spending it with him, I also went out with friends. One day, I was with my bf and my sister and we decided to go to one of my bf's friends party. My bf didn't want to go but I really just wanted to celebrate and unwind.

In the party/reunion there were several of my bf's friends, and I ran into some acquaintances. I ended up having one of the most interesting conversations I've had in a really long time. I talked to this guy (let's call him Sam) about so many things that the time flew by and it was the early morning when we realized the party was over and we were basically the last ones there. It was not romantic or anything at all but I was really really flattered because it had been a really long time since anybody had told me that I was ""interesting, truly amazing and your boyfriend is a very lucky guy to have you in his life""  I also realized, it had been a really long time since I had truly socialized without him in years. For a moment I felt really flattered and went home with my sister who had a great time at the party too.

The morning after, my bf was pissed. He was complaining that I usually have a curfew when I'm with him but apparently I don't when I'm on my own (I come from a rather traditional family and live with my parents, and I can't really sleep over at his place or stay out too late). I tried to explain to him that my mom was being permissive cause I was with my little sister anyway (we're barely a year apart) and that's different when it comes to ""staying at my boyfriends place"" for my parents.

In any case, he wouldn't listen to any of those things and was very angry at me, he texted me things like he's tired of my bullsh*t, my excuses and that he's done dealing with it. I tried to call him down and explain myself (because I didn't really do anything wrong, his friends were at the party!) also because we had a group trip planned to a friend's beach house that both me and my little sister had been looking forward for weeks. The worst for me was, that when he texted me he was tired of dealing with me I almost just wanted to tell him: ""ok, we're done, you don't have to deal with me anymore"" just so that I could be ""free"" and go out on a date with Sam. I felt so so guilty for even thinking about that. I thought about our plans, my sister and well, our relationship and just decided to calm him down. 

We went to the beach house and almost the whole time my BF was distant and moody, I'm usually very touchy feely but it seemed like he just was annoyed by it. He may have mistreated me but from the perspective of him just being dismissive towards me. It got to the point, that several of his friends came to me to ask me what was wrong and other friends even told him that ""I was an amazing girlfriend and if he didn't appreciate that, there is plenty of guys who would"" he took it jokingly and told everybody that they didn't know the whole story and that they shouldn't say anything about it.

All of that got me thinking, yes, those people don't know the whole relationship, but so many people and so many of HIS friends coming forward to say things like that made me reevaluate our relationship. Do I really want to be with a person who's gonna go on an angry text tirade because I went out until late? Does he really appreciate me?

He usually calls me cute, sexy, beautiful, hot, etc. But I can't recall the last time he's complimented me for my accomplishments (research, good job offers, success in school), or shown interest in my work, my interests or hobbies. I usually pick what we're watching or what takeout we're having, but whenever I suggest an activity, he just brushes it off and we often end up doing what he wants. For example, I love dancing and even though I'm not the biggest fan of clubs (haven't been in years) or anything, sometimes I wish he would actually dance with me. I can count with one hand the times he's actually danced with me (weddings and events like that). And you know, there's nothing wrong with not wanting to do certain things, but he could at least try, since I also try things I don't like so much but I do because of him...

So right now I feel very guilty. He's out of town for a couple of weeks and I've been hanging out friends and I decided to join Sam and his friends on a social even in my city that he invited me to. I felt really guilty about it but I had been wanting to go to that event anyway and I went with a friend (let's call her Sofia) and met with Sam's friends later. After the event was done, we joined Sam for a party at his house. It was really laid back and my Sofia and I had a lot of fun. I kept feeling guilty because I was having just so much fun with Sam, Sofia and his friends and I wasn't with my bf. I even rode a motorcycle with one of Sam's friends and it was honestly the most fun and excitement I had in years. I eventually left the party because Sofia left and I didn't want to be weird and stay until super late just to hang out with Sam.

Now, here's the thing. Sofia honestly told me, you're obviously into Sam, are you sure of what you're doing? And I told her I would never cheat on my bf. But then she asked me, so, you wouldn't make a move, but would you want for Sam to make a move on you? And the honest answer was yes.

Honestly, I doubt Sam likes me at all, plus he knows my bf, but I would be lying if I didn't say I was very flattered by his compliments and I probably have a tiny crush on him.

So now, I feel stupidly guilty, because I don't really feel that happy in the relationship, but it's not bad, and my bf is not a bad person and it feels like ""It just doesn't feel like old times"" is a shitty reason to break up. I also don't know if my feelings or judgement are being clouded by Sam or if he's just a catalyst next to other people to make me realize I'm not appreciated.

I'm a very social, open, cheery, happy, empathetic and bubbly person, but I feel that lately my bf has turned me into the complete opposite. And I do not want to become cynical or jaded like he is.

Now that we're gonna be together for 4 years and I'm about to start my professional career, I'm not sure if I can be with a person who's so dominant, always gets his way and doesn't respect me or my interests. I'm not sure if at this point of our relationship I care for making him understand that I want to go out dancing, I wanna travel to the places I wanna go, I wanna socialize with other groups of people, I want to have free time to go out with my friends, have interests and hobbies and not feel guilty that I am not spending it with him. But also, there's nothing ""wrong"" with him or our relationship. He's loyal, faithful, hard working, smart, funny and great company when he wants to be. But he can be very possessive and dominant, and I have allowed it.
   
**tl;dr**: Lately not feeling so happy with BF of almost 4 years, his friends tell me he doesn't appreciate me. I'm not sure if I want to stay on this relationship or try to work through our issues. My judgement may be however clouded because if a recent crush (even though it's not going anywhere). "

37x0nt,6,2015-05-30,"Got accepted into the best (probably) marine biology program in my state for undergraduate, should I go through with this?",5aywhatagain,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/37x0nt/got_accepted_into_the_best_probably_marine/,"I got accepted (I'm transferring from a community college) into the best marine biology program in my state. In the title for this post I said ""probably"" because it's incredibly hard to find any good rankings for marine biology specifically. The university is one of three R1 schools in my state (only two of these are public, including the one I was accepted into). The school itself is ranked 30ish in biology, although all three of the R1 universities are ranked 30ish in biology as well, so it's really the best for biology as well. The school itself is actually a satellite campus located on the coast. It hosts all of the marine science programs for the university. It's the only school that has the entirety of their undergraduate program located on the coast and is also the only one with a degree specifically in marine biology, as opposed to just a concentration in marine biology. It is the combination of these factors which has lead me to conclude it's the best option for an undergraduate degree in marine biology within my state.


Now onto the real question: should I do this? I ask this question because there is no going back after this point. If I pursue a degree in marine biology, I want to go for a PhD and conduct research. So this is going to be a commitment to academia as a career also. I've heard that biology has the worst academic career prospects out of most science disciplines, mainly because of the recent flood of molecular biology graduates. However, I was talking to my biology professor and he said doing something more niche, such as marine biology, actually doesn't have such a horrible outlook. That aspect coupled with actually getting into the ""top program"" for this in my state actually makes me think maybe I have a chance at making it in academia. Not making it and ending up with no job after spending 10 years in school is what scares me. All one has to do is ask the internet to see how horrible doing anything academia related is in today's job market.


Also, just to show how I am as a student. I have a 3.84 GPA and a 4.0 Science GPA, as well as a small summer internship under my belt. (5 weeks paid in a biology lab at a smaller university)


On a final note, I want to point out how much I truly love the subject. I actually started college with the intent of becoming a marine biologist. I absolutely love biology and did great in those classes. I've looked at the courses I would be taking and I literally get butterflies the classes seem so awesome, and this really isn't the case for my alternative non-academia related major (computer science). Honestly, if I could teach and do research on marine life for the rest of my life, I wouldn't really mind it if I only made like 50k a year. Hell, I suppose community college teaching wouldn't be horrible either, all though I really want to do research.


So /r/academia should I do this? Should I take the leap and just say ""fuck it."" Should I go big and make this my hopeful career? Or is it just too risky? I want some advice, so please feel free to share your opinions on any aspect of my situation!

37x3hg,3,2015-05-30,Intern for 7 years (same company) despite company's policy of 1 year maximum [CT],7yr_intern_throwaway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/37x3hg/intern_for_7_years_same_company_despite_companys/,"

I've been working for a 9.7 billion dollar company for seven years (beginning summer 2008). I was hired on part time as an intern/co-op directly by the company under their co-op program (intern hourly base pay, no benefits, and no PTO). In the summer of 2010, my role changed from working part time to full time (40 hour weeks), however my job status of intern remained the same. When this change occurred I went from general warehouse labor to account shipping lead while still fulfilling my warehouse labor role (pay rate remained the same). Shortly after I graduated from account shipping lead to desktop technician requiring me to transfer to a different location to work one on one with the customer (summer 2013). Taking on this new role significantly increased the workload on my plate, including special projects that required me to work over 15 hour days every week for an entire month (peak was 147 hours in two weeks). Overtime was granted, however my pay rate was still that of an intern compared to my co-workers who were performing the same tasks but being paid at least an additional $8/hr. In the Fall of 2014 I took over a position that was currently being fulfilled by a full-time employee (higher pay rate, benefits, PTO, official job title). I am currently still fulfilling this position with my same intern status. In January of 2015 my company realized that I have been working for them so long that they are required by law to offer me medical benefits (due to health law changes?). My company still has not changed my intern status and I do not accrue any sick time, vacation time, holiday pay, or personal time. Any day that I don't work I don't get paid, including national holidays such as Memorial Day and July 4th. Per company policy, an individual can only remain in ""intern status"" for a maximum of 1 year before they must make a decision either to dismiss them or hire them on as a full time employee (including ALL benefits). 

 

Can anyone please advise if I can pursue any legal action against the company since they are in violation of their own company policy by keeping me in ""intern status"" for this extended period of time in addition to prohibiting me from obtaining all the benefits of a full time employee (annual raises, PTO, all health benefits, and official job titles)? 

 

Does this tie into equal opportunity issues since I am performing the same tasks and fulfilling the same responsibilities as my co-workers but for a much lower rate?

 

**tl;dr**

**Seven year intern status has not changed despite role changes and increased responsibilities. Per company policy, an individual can only remain in ""intern status"" for a maximum of 1 year before they must make a decision either to dismiss them or hire them on full time. Please see questions above.**"

37xdks,20,2015-05-31,The older woman I fell in love with.,Richard_Pace,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/37xdks/the_older_woman_i_fell_in_love_with/,"When I was 21 I took a psychology lecture taught by a woman who was undeniably gorgeous. When I remember her the image of fine china with a crack in the side always come to mind. She was advancing into her thirties and had acquired a few wrinkles that weren't there the decade before, but that only increased my feelings for her. 

I went for her office for any mild question I had, under the guise of innocence. An email wouldn't do with the explanation that I was simply nearby, and could stop and get my question answered immediately instead of waiting for a reply. 

A few times the questions had to do with the curriculum material. The second time this happened my professor leaned forward and told me, ""You know, you can just come by my office regularly if you need tutoring."" 

I thanked her for this, and said I would consider it if I needed help. Afterwards we sat for half an hour and talked about her job, my plans for after college, and what was going on in her life. I returned to her office on a weekly occurrence afterwards, and our conversations evolved into two hour ordeals. I learned later that her office hours typically ended at 4:00 PM. Despite this, she would stay past if we were in the middle of a conversation. 

I learned many things about her. She was divorced, for one, and she told me the intricacies of her previous marriage and why she had chosen to divorce her first husband.

She had also studied abroad in Paris after college, but a cancer diagnosis for her brother had brought her back. Her own personal fairytale had come to a screeching halt, and she'd been brought back to the same Midwest place she'd grown up in and wanted to escape for the longest time. 

These conversations continued to happen regularly, lasting the same lengths of time. Other professors held their office hours nearby, and I began to see a lot of the same faces. Looking back I know how I must have looked to a few of the other faculty members, stopping by her office regularly like that. I was a somewhat awkward, isolated college kid. Or at least I felt that way. And it was obvious to anyone who looked at her why any young man in one of her classes would continue to keep talking to her like that. 

I could have tried to get her number, or ask her for the opportunity to talk outside of school, but I didn't. Something about making my intentions even clearer filled me with a sense of dread, like if I jiggled the door handle this woman would turn the lock on the other end and leave it slammed shut. 

Every so often in class I would other guys in the class make comments about her, punctuating their remarks with a laugh or two with their friends. Hearing every comment like this made my heart sink in my chest. For me it was like overhearing the locker room banter amongst guys, laughing about how attractive a girl was or even making light of the girl that rejected them. For them it was amusing because they had others who would care about them, or had. There was nothing to laugh about in the face of rejection. It was the pain of not being good enough, and it cut deep. 

It was much more serious than that for me. Part of the reason I skirted around the idea of a direct advance was because I had no prior experience being happy. I'd spent most of high school with severe cystic acne. At the age of fourteen or fifteen I'd simply cemented the fact in my head that I was never going to be wanted or given affection by any girl I ever cared about. Back then I would imagine myself trying to do things other guys did, making jokes or laughing, and in my mind's eye the girl would always look at me with veiled disgust or pity. It wasn't a possibility for me. 

By the time I'd made it to college, my acne had cleared up and I had filled out a bit. When I got the sensation that girls were hitting on me, or paying me positive attention, the idea filled me with confusion. Sometimes even anger. I felt like I was being pitied all over again. A few times I would cut a girl out of my life altogether if she paid me positive attention, because I was convinced it couldn't be genuine romantic affection. 

I wasn't a virgin by this point, though, it was true. Once before I'd decided to kill my doubts and hesitations, and dated a girl for a few months who claimed to care about me. We visited another city together to see her family and that's where she decided to break up with me, saying she had kept it hidden that she had been having doubts for weeks now. She left me at the bus stop with an empty wallet, the last of my pocket money I'd spent on a gift for her earlier that day. I had no money in my direct account at the time from the hotel room fees, and that left me stranded in another city with no way back. I had to beg for money to take the bus back to my hotel room, where I spent a day wallowing in self-pity before taking the return flight back to where we lived. She eventually moved to that city to be closer to her family there. 

All of these thoughts danced in my head day after day, moment after moment. I realized I had fallen into some sense of limerence with this older woman, where I counted down the days until we could hold another conversation. Every second of our time spent together was afterwards analyzed by me neurotically to the point of exhaustion, looking for subtle indicators where perhaps this woman secretly detested me. I was determined not to be pitied by anyone ever again, and to be tolerated merely for the sake of the woman trying to be polite was unacceptable to me. If I came to any evidence that showed this was happening, I would disappear from her life and never interact with her outside of the class again. 

This didn't happen, or perhaps I didn't want it to and I ignored warning signs in my head. Looking back a few years later, I don't feel like this aspect is particularly important. It was my own insecurity that led me to such pedantic behavior, and nothing good would have resulted from it one way or the other. 

After so long I bit the bullet and stopped by her office as usual. I immediately asked her if she wanted to go out this weekend for coffee. She said yes, and gave me her number as we settled on a time and place. 

We went on two more dates after that, where I learned more about her. She told me about how she wanted to settle down and have children eventually, maybe even after traveling somewhere else after her family health issues could be laid to rest. We didn't get physical, or really that intimate. We just talked, and talked, and talked. Sometimes she just talked and I just listened. 

After those three dates I had never felt more strongly about her, and I began to see myself as someone who could warrant genuine affection from someone else. That's when I saw another guy in my class approach her after lecture one day and strike up a conversation. He was better looking than me, easily, and looked like he could have been a male model. Half a foot taller than me, with broad shoulders and a complexion that looked almost airbrushed. Jaw like an anvil. I looked at them for a moment, feeling that old sinking of the heart into the chest like a stone, and I gathered my things and walked out. 

The next few weeks, any time I attempted to talk to her was met with early dismissal. After the semester ended I called her once, and she didn't return the call or voicemail after three weeks. I forced myself, through all the willpower I could muster, not to call her again. 

School was out on summer break by this point, and I had just finished my sophomore year of college feeling no less lonely than I had at the start of moving to this place where I knew no one. It had been a long, depressing two years, and I had pushed myself and never allowed myself any excuses. 

My behavior changed that summer. My drinking took a turn for the worse, from a social pasttime to a daily means of escape. I switched my major from Chemistry to English and began writing daily, applying the same rigor I had to my studies to crafting fiction. Living in the worlds and minds of the characters I created offered some solace, but not enough for me. I sometimes woke up and sat in the bathroom with the lights off for hours. Cross-legged on the floor, my head resting against the wall, staring into the darkness ahead of me. 

Everyday I woke up with the sole intention of being alone. My phone remained turned off for weeks at a time, and I sometimes would refuse to even leave the apartment as I lived alone. When I did, it was to go to the park or to a nearby bar when I ran out of alcohol. I would then drink and sit quietly, not speaking to anyone and refusing anyone who spoke to me. 

When cashiers at retail outlets told me to have a good day, I glared at them bitterly before going back home alone to sit and drink. And write. On days I didn't have off I worked long hours. I'd left my internship to apply for a minimum wage job that involved a ton of manual labor. Frequent night shifts. Oftentimes at 1:00 AM I would keep myself busy loading the trucks I was paid to load, thinking to myself that the older woman and that young man my age were in bed at this very moment. Enjoying each other's company. It filled me with bitterness and emotional pain, to the point I thought many days that I couldn't handle it for much longer. 

I considered suicide, but opted for a happy medium of self-destruction and mediocrity. Even still, something inside me knew that I would never branch out to achieve direct self-harm. I was feeling a continuation of the pain and unrest I'd felt ever since my unhappy childhood, leading all the way up through my unhappy adolescence and into my unhappy adulthood. Despite this, I could never shake the sense of self-loathing I regarded for myself. That this was all it took to break me as a person. 

I saw that weakness in me and I hated myself for it. It's what made me continue to write, to work a shit job with a boss that hated me, to lift weights and swim laps first thing at the gym every morning when I woke up. I wasn't allowed to lay in bed and give up, because I knew no one was going to come and help me get up. 

My coping mechanisms persisted. I continued to drink. I checked out random books from the library on my days off and read them start to finish, looking for glimpses into the past pain of authors that had somehow mirrored what I was currently feeling, and what I'd felt my entire life. I committed poem stanzas and lines from literature to heart, where I would repeat them to myself as mantras on the days where I felt like giving up or losing it. 

A month into my summer break I began a relationship with a girl I met at a coffeeshop. My neurosis regarding dating had now dissipated, but something uglier had emerged. After sex I would sometimes get up, put my clothes back on, and leave the girl's apartment without a word while she sat there on the bed in disbelief, looking forlorn and miserable. Every step she took to grow closer to me and tear down my walls made me more detached and apathetic. She told me she loved me one day, and I didn't return the favor. 

When she left me for another guy, I felt no jealousy or remorse. I saw them weeks later at the coffeeshop I'd originally met her at. I didn't hate her, or feel betrayed. I felt happy for her, because I knew he was better for her than me. She would be happier, and more loved and appreciated. She had shown me people in the world were capable of feeling enduring, lasting affection for me. She'd shown me I could be accepted, and I had paid her back by being a detached, cold and emotionless asshole. 

Feeling happy for someone like that made me feel more free, to an extent. Less tied down and shackled to some ongoing angst that had felt like a burden I couldn't escape. I freed myself more with feeling empathy for the characters I read about in novels. At that time I read GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire series, and spent sometimes up to eight hours a day slogging through them. For that reason, at that time in my life, I will always hold the series dear to me. 

After that summer I returned to school and worked as the older woman's TA. I had applied for the job halfway through the previous semester, in the midst of our long conversations, and it was something I'd decided to stick with. 

The older woman was a few months pregnant, and sported a new ring on her wedding finger. I learned later that she'd married the student I saw talking to her that one day after class, that made my heart sink so low. I learned then that despite all of my soul-searching over the summer, I still felt dismal at the prospect that I had been right all along. She had abandoned me to pursue a relationship with him. 

I still felt miserable. But that was okay. 

I worked a semester for her as a TA and resigned. I decided I'd proven some useless, meager thing to myself that never had to be proven in the first place. At least the pay for the job had helped me with gas money to and from campus. 

The second semester of my junior year I had moved on. While I remained single and lonely, I no longer thought about her quite as much. The times I did run into her, she bore a look of stress and fatigue I hadn't previously noticed. I attributed it to being busy with the new marriage and their new kid. I worked as a TA for another professor in the same department and minded my own business. I heard snatches of gossip here and there, since college professors were worse than middle school students when it came to that. Her new husband had moved out almost as quickly as they'd moved in together. One day sitting with her and another professor I heard her wax on length about how much she hated her teaching position here, and how miserable she felt living here in general. 

The last time I heard her speak before graduating, she was losing her temper and raising her voice in some quiet hallway about some issue with her class. People were stopping and looking at her with a mixture of pity and disbelief, and I felt no joy at what I was witnessing. I'd felt so much anger and bitterness over being rejected, and being her second choice just as I had been so many others' second choices in my life. Or so I thought. But now I was realizing that this woman was no stranger to her own form of pain and misery in her life. She'd just done what anyone else would have done and pursued what made her the happiest. I don't know what happened to her, but I've hoped even in my lower moments since then that she felt okay with where she was in life. "

Essentially… I’m 22 years old and attending college for media studies. I landed a ton of internships (ex. films, freelance photography, television, news) my freshman and sophomore year…since I didn’t receive as much aid this year, I had to take-on a part-time job.

In order to keep me in the “loop”, Philip (age: 40ish?) has been giving me oddball jobs to do. Since the beginning, Phil has always had my back. He was watching out for me before I even knew who he was. I’ve never had to ask him for anything. I’m his only go-to person. Several months ago he pitched an idea for a script to me. I asked him if he wanted to collaborate, he said yes. I told him then, and many countless times, that writing like that is a bit of an intimate process. Writing a good story involves connecting on a personal level; writing from the inside out. In order for the project to be successful, we would have to be very open/comfortable with eachother. He’s never told me, but I could tell that he was uncomfortable with the idea. . I started us off with exercises to help us better understand our story, ourselves, and eachother. He would always talk about subjects that were off topic, but he’d never talk about himself… A very frustrating process, but he's never done anything like this before. We were able to hammer out notes, but neither of us was very passionate about the story.

A couple of weeks ago, Phil landed a very big opportunity on a major news station… and ofcourse, he worked me in. To show my gratitude, I decided that I would do something nice for him. I knew that I couldn’t ask him what he’d like because he’s modest and would refuse. So I decided that since he likes movies, I’d take him to the theater to go see one. He was ecstatic, he hadn't been to the movies in alittle less than a year.

My average work attire is a comfortable top with long pants. I wear long pants in order to protect my legs from hazards (broken objects, hot equipment, sharp long grass, scraps, falls…etc). On the day I treated Philip to the movies, I wore shorts with an average top. My thoughts: no work today, it’s hot out, it’s just a movie…why the hell not. What I gathered from his thoughts from the expression on his face when I showed up to the theater: OH MY. It then dawned on me, he’s never seen me in shorts before. He thinks I’m showing off. We watched the movie, he gave me a hug, and afterwards we went our separate ways. Now I’m thinking: Okay, it was no big deal.

As I stated before, I shoot a lot of freelance photography, Phil is the one who got me hooked up. We travel together a lot, sometimes to different states. He’s not comfortable with silence. He will talk about bullshit for hours just to avoid a moment of quiet. On one particular trip, Phil had run out of things to say… After a long pause, he then brought up the script. I once again reminded him that writing is very personal. I then revealed a major secret to him, a rough experience with my ex, and that is practically what I used to connect with a character. He took what I told him to heart and he told me a lot about his past/current life. We shared similar experiences, so we were both empathic towards eachother. It was the first time he’d really opened up. Even after our long talk, he let me know subtly that he doesn’t completely trust me…”I would tell you (about a certain topic) but I have to get to know you more”. I didn’t really care because we had made major progress.

We talked more after that, I’d sometimes message him randomly during the week “I’m interested to know how your day went”… He’d call and we’d talk for a bit. What made our talks so great is that he revealed to me a lot of his character/wants… it became easier for me to understand his abstract ideas. I was able to understand his vision. One night I sat myself down at my computer and the words just flowed. I finished with a nice fat wad of script. Real progress at last! I decided that I’d surprise him by delivering the finished pages to his door step with a cup of coffee…

Me (Text): What time do you usually eat breakfast?

Phil (Text): 11:30 or noon

Me (Text): Ha that’s lunch! What time are you due to get up tomorrow?

Phil (Text): Early, I’m working. If you want to grab breakfast next week is good

Me (Text): Okay, just tell me when… How early is early?

Phil (Text): 9:30 is about the earliest... I actually don't know my call time yet.

Me (Text): Okay, I might call you in the morning.

Phil (Voicemail): Hey…uh uh um… yeah, I’m not sure when I need to leave in the morning exactly. Try to give me a call if you want… yeah, um… you’re just a friend… I appreciate ya. You don’t have to do anything special for me. I’m good. I appreciate the friendship… No need to buy me breakfast but if you want to hang out, that’s okay.

Me (Call): Ha, don’t worry. I don’t want anything for you. You’re the one who suggested breakfast. I just wanted to drop something off.

Phil (Call): I didn’t think you wanted anything from me. Just didn’t want you to go out of your way. I appreciate your friendship!

Me (Call): I have to work in the morning but I’m spending tonight nearby. Depending on the circumstances, I was going to try to drop something off in the morning. I didn’t want to tell you because you’d expect it. It was suppose to be a bit of a surprise. As for me buying things, it’s no big deal, I enjoy treating my friends… Besides, it’s the least I could do. I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable.

Phil (Call): That’s sweet of you. I appreciate it. Not too often does anybody go out of their way to do something nice for me. I just uh… you’re not making me feel uncomfortable… I was thinking about you… You know, money is hard to come by these days and uh… you know, spend it on somebody that…uh, is probably more worthy of it than a old sack of potatoes like me. I’d rather just try to look out for you. I’m good, I don’t need anything… but I do appreciate you thinking about me and taking the time. That’s very nice. So if you feel compelled, it’s not necessary. I appreciate your friendship. I enjoy your friendship, so if you want to drop something off, go ahead.

**6:30 turned out to be his call time... too early for me. I told him that I'd wait until next week.

Oh my. I've caught myself in a bit of a predicament... I'm embarrassed. Obviously he's felt that I've been hitting on him for a while. If I tell him the truth, he might just think that I'm making up excuses to save face. Not cool. 
Getting rejected by him really hurt. I don't believe that I have hidden feelings for him... It's as if he told me randomly...""Hey, I know you kinda well and I think your nice.... but just so you know, I wouldn't fuck you"". Ouch.  
What do I make of this? 
Did I do something wrong? 
Did I accidently damage the relationship I had with this guy? 
If he does assume I'm lying. Is there any way I could use this to our advantage? If he believed his twenty-something-year-old friend has a crush on him, would it give him more confidence in himself? 
Would he trust me more? Is there a possiblity that he would open up more from this? 
I don't have a ""gift""!"
37xl17,1,2015-05-31,I feel like I'm trapped because I boomerang'ed,Kreos642,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/37xl17/i_feel_like_im_trapped_because_i_boomeranged/,"Sorry for the wall of text - but I really just want to say all of this.

So, I recently graduated from my 4-year undergraduate program in dietetics. In the US, if you want to be a dietitan you need to land an internship before you do the rest of the roadwork to get those credentials. I busted my ass for good grades and a good internship application, and did a ton of work for my resume. But I didn't get one in the end. Sure, I was upset, but I wasn't *too* upset because I didn't want to actually be one by the time I graduated anyway -  It was something that I was interested in, but not extremely passionate about, yet I know that the pay and benefits are killer and could help me get my life started. I thought that if I didn't have the heart to do it, I shouldn't do this at all. People always say ""do what you love"" so I kind of took it as ""don't do what you know you'll hate"" in a way.

So I graduated and came home, like many other college kids do. ....Many do come home, right...?

I settled in, unpacked, and decided that because I don't really want to be a dietitian, I could go for something close and more up my alley: becoming a DTR (That's ""Diet Technician, Registered""). I have to take a test, so I just finished sending in my eligibility requirements to be checked and now I'm playing the waiting game. I hope I can get eligibility to take the test and get those credentials... that way some job doors will open... I think. I like databases anyway, so I think that despite the pay difference I'll be happier compared to being a dietitian.

But I feel like I'm watching everyone around me do so many more amazing things than me.

I feel like I am trapped because I boomerang'ed home. Maybe it's my own fault?

Maybe I think this way because people say that social media displays only the good part of peoples' lives and not the bad?

I know a girl who is studying abroad while she completes her degree. She's going to Japan. I'm envious, no, jealous, because my major wouldn't let me do that and graduate on time (my parents paid for my college fund if I kept my GPA high and graduated on time, so... there's that. More later.). I am a huge fan of Japanese culture, cooking, and the language which I do study and know an intermediate amount. I've wanted to go to Japan since I was 12. But we're friends, so regardless of my feelings I *am* still happy for her - she worked hard to get accepted! Meanwhile, 2 other people I know who graduated have gotten internships there. Cool, good for them. I bet they worked hard, too. Or at least I want to think that. I want feel like they've pushed themselves to the limit, that they got what they wanted by working their ass off - but instead I *know* it's because their parents are forking over the dough for them to go abroad and they only got the internship because their parents' friend gave it to them (one told me that this is how they got the internship, and the other got it through their professor recommending them). 

Another friend is moving to her apartment next week and I'm very excited for her. But her parents are paying her rent *for the first 14 months* while she works and saves more money to do it herself. A logical progression of things, but still, *that's a lot of money* where we're from and where she's living... and she has a buffer of a year to still live by herself.

But I'm here, at home, not pleased with myself for being jealous at all, and feeling like I've accomplished nothing. I have a part-time job, a boyfriend, my parents, and that's it. I work between 20-28 hours per week and no higher, because of the company's insurance thing or something like that, I don't own a car and have to use my parents' car (I still pay for gas and insurance), I have a not-smart flip-phone because I can't afford the data plan, I can't go traveling across the state like my friends because of the tolls and gas will just cripple me. I mean FFS I don't even have a credit card yet and that's nobody's fault but mine (I am afraid of getting myself into debt, to be honest). So no taking road trips for me. Just work. My sisters (two) both have moved out so I am usually the only one home... I have to rely on texts and emails with them to talk...

I feel like I did this to myself somehow. It's not my boyfriend's fault that I don't have the money to do anything. It's not my parents' fault that they decided to save for my college fund so I can start fresh without debt as opposed to having me start with debt but travel the world instead. It's not my friends' fault that they worked hard and got what they wanted. 

I know I am feeling jealousy, and I pretty much feel ashamed for doing so. It's a shitty feeling. I don't want to feel this way.

I try to be proactive, so it's not like I'm sitting here doing nothing all day. I went to the career development center at my school and they didn't help me at all (In all honesty, too. I tried really hard). I've applied for at least 10 jobs in the past 20 days, and no dice. Many jobs need 2+ years of experience and the only experience I have is 2+ years in a registrar's office, 2+ years in a movie theatre, and 3+ years of leadership positions. I do have the support from my family. My sisters help me with resumes and things like that. I know my parents support me with doing my best - they know I want more encouragement than handouts (which they can't give anyway). I know my boyfriend is working hard, too, since we want to move out together or travel together (but shit, guys, he just got a 2015 car for fucking free from his grandmother as a graduation gift. All he has to do is pay insurance. SHIT is he lucky!)

Am I doing something wrong? Am I forgetting something? Does this normally happen to other people in their early 20's after undergraduate degrees? I heard of a Linked-In or something... what is that?
What should I do... How does one network? How did you guys get off of your feet after college?

Am I just not motivated? Or is that something I have to answer myself? (It probably is... but where do I start?)

TL;DR = I feel trapped being at home after getting my undergraduate degree while I see many of my friends accomplishing their goals or getting a lot of help from their folks, while I am not. Am I doing something wrong? Is there anything I could possibly do to get myself going? Or is a part-time job *actually* good enough to have right now while I look for full time work? I""m just a scared, confused, post-undergraduate kid who is hating the jealousy harbored towards friends deep inside."

I finished off my freshman year with a 2.5 GPA in CS and a 3.06 overall. Right now, I have to submit an appeal by midnight Sunday. If this doesn't go through I won't be studying CS anymore.

I dont know what do, guys. I can't imagine my future doing anything else besides CS. I already have a well paying internship this summer and I've won hackathons along with a bunch of charity work in the CS community. Do you think I can play my cards right and get this appeal? If not what are my options, because I absolutely love CS and computing and couldn't imagine studying anything else.

37xywc,1,2015-05-31,"Looking for a job in IT, just not sure what to look for.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/37xywc/looking_for_a_job_in_it_just_not_sure_what_to/,"I've been looking for a job for a while now, but haven't seen much of anything that fits yet.  
I just turned 18 a week ago. I've been meaning to get a job for a while now, but haven't had much luck.

One of my limiting problems is transportation. I don't yet have a car, nor a license. I always wanted to get a learners permit, but I have no one I could practice with, as my mom does not drive nor have a car. So I'm limited to what I can quickly get to on foot, my bike, or the bus/train. 

Another limiting factor is school. I don't yet have my high school diploma, although I plan to be graduating early next school year. I am also interested in eventually taking some courses at a community college. I wonder how hard it is to get a job without a  high school diploma.

One thing I am worried about is current living situations and my mom. My mom does not work and receives a lot of financial assistance. She gets social security disability income, food stamps, housing assistance, energy assistance, etc. What will having a job do to those? Will they go up so much she won't be able to afford the cost of living anymore? What about if I move out?

Also there is the problem of my current ""job"". I've been placed as a CTO of a small online startup company. I know the owner in real life. We've been trying to launch for years, but constantly hitting setback after setback. I'm not even getting paid yet. I started out as one of the ""community members"" who helped out from time to time. The CTO at that time became ""unreliable"". He started saying he was frequently busy running his computer shop. He told the owner he could get computers for the employees and servers for the company, he just needed money. Not seeing any reason not to trust him, he sent him the money. As you've probably guessed by now, he disappeared as soon as he thought he had squeezed as much money out as he could. We no longer had access to make changes on the servers, all the work was gone. The owner turned to me, and told me he knew I was capable of doing everything he needed. So I quickly got to work, getting everything set up as he needed it, and learning a few new things along the way (like how parallels Plesk Panel sometimes decides to create a 300GB log file when it updates). So with all that, we're still stuck in the ""launching to the public"" stage. The waiting for more investors stage. So I'm still broke. Got some experience, but still broke.

And then there's the matter of finding a job I both qualify for and want. I'm looking for something in IT, but not sure what is the best fit for me. I guess my best skill would be a repair technician. I'm good at the problem solving and skilled with computers. But I'm also interested and skilled in things like networking, virtualization, and security. The only qualifications I have are the five IT certifications I have and the years of helping the IT department at my high school.

I actually tried to get a job once a little over two years ago. My IT/CS instructor contacted me and a few other students about a local internship opportunity he had been told about. The job was titled Associate IT Consultant - Bench Technician. $10/hour, part time, flexible hours - it almost seemed perfect for me. So I sent in an email. A few weeks go by. Nothing. I go to ask my teacher about it, and he says he would try to call them. About a week later we give up. Neither of us were able to get them to tell us anything. A simple ""no"" would have sufficed instead of just waiting around wondering if they are ever going to get back to me. I'm almost tempted to try signing up again.

I've considered going somewhere like Best Buy's Geek Squad, but from what others have told me it's not the best of options.


&amp;nbsp;

So it looks like I've created a giant ugly wall of text, but maybe someone can give me advice."
37yg4k,31,2015-05-31,Female Engineering PhD Student Having Advisor Issues,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/37yg4k/female_engineering_phd_student_having_advisor/,"This is long, but I'll try to keep it to the point.

I had an important conference that I needed to present at, and I couldn't seem to get my advisor to give me feedback at my presenations (x2) and poster that I wrote. I ended up having to submit the presentation with him only taking a glance at it, and the poster without him seeing at all due to the deadline for the printing.  Well, I finally went into his office to ask for feedback directly, rather than just through email.  “Did you see my poster?”  I asked.  “No,” he shrugged.  “I hope it's good.”  I literally then specifically asked him to pull it up on his computer.  He was in a very weird sing songy mood and kept insisting that I listen to music with him, telling me it was important, rather than looking at my poster for a conference taking place the following week.  I found it quite odd, but tried to brush it off.

I asked another professor to come to our group meeting that Friday... flash forward...that Friday during our group meeting where I scheduled myself to present for a practice run...I was so excited and it a great mood because I finally got some feedback about my project.  I'm very passionate about my project and I love presenting, so anything to learn more about the project and improving presenting made me very happy.  I took careful notes and was sure to thank those who critiqued me, my lab mates, advisor, and other professor that I invited.

Flash forward again.  Tuesday, day of my presentation.  During a break from all the presentations, I walked up and started talking to my advisor.  Right away, big mistake...I'm a first year student and didn't realize that he doesn't like to talk to his students (only network with others) at conferences.  He started giving me advice about my presentation, that was at 2 p.m.  It was currently 10 a.m.  I was afraid I looked nervous...pale, shaking, sweating...or something...and so I said, “I'm not worried; do I like worried?”  He replied, “I don't want to talk about this right now.”  And he walked off.  I tried to shake it off.  I figured maybe he was just upset that I had interrupted his networking.  Or maybe that he had somehow misunderstood what I had to say.

Well, my presentation went very well and ended up being one of the top ranked presentations.  People were very responsive and I felt like things were going great.  I had a lot of people come up to me and tell me how much they enjoyed my presentation....with exception of my advisor, who seemed to be avoiding me.  It felt odd, but at the same time I just figured he was....networking.  He can talk to me anytime, why talk to me at a conference when there are people there he can only see twice a year?

Things seemed good.  That night, after dinner, my advisor suggested we go to the local bar.  So conference participants went to the bar.  He joked around with the male students, going so far as to make a joke with one about the student picking his female officemate's dirty underwear.  I tried to fit into the conversation, and I awkwardly mentioned that one of my labmates had initially thought I had a different sexual orientation than I do.  Conversation seemed to flow, and everything seemed fine.

The next morning was when I found out that something really was wrong.  My advisor almost backed into me, so I honked at him.  My car was backed into recently, and I definitely wanted to make sure that didn't happen again. T hat being said, it was a school vehicle he was driving so I didn't even know he was driving it.  I jokingly told my labmate that he almost backed into me...trying to make light out of the situation....when he actually got out of his vehicle and started yelling at me and cussing.  He swore that he had seen me and that he was backing up to make room for my car (makes so much sense right?) and that honking was disrespectful.  At first I apologized, not wanting to upset my boss.  But the more I thought about it, I'm glad I honked.  I did the right thing.

There were several awkward encounters the next day, and I just tried to avoid him.  After the conference was over, I thought that I would be able to avoid him and just let things die, but he scheduled a one-on-one meeting for the next day.

At this meeting, he proceeded to tell me how horrible I am at networking, because I scare people and that I talk too much.  (I know I talk a lot, but I figure that some people don't so it balances out).  He did apologize for yelling at me after I honked at him, but maintains that I shouldn't have honked.  He told me that my interactions with people are inappropriate (despite his comment about picking up female's dirty underwear).  (And I should just mention I was just trying to follow his lead).  He told me that during my practice run of my presentation, I had seemed unreceptive and ungrateful to his feedback (despite my constant begging for feedback) and that the other professor who had come had felt the same way (despite me specifically inviting him for that reason...his feedback).  He told me he feels like he can't mentor me, and that he avoids me because he feels I cause drama in the workplace.

Lastly, he told me that I need to make an effort to cover up more, and pointed to his chest.  I was wearing  a shirt that's collar line went up to my collar bone.  He told me he had a hard time looking at me in the face because of the way I dress.  Despite the fact we have no dress code, and that I wasn't dressed badly anyway.

I didn't know what to do.  I just took everything he said and apologized for him feeling that way about me and told him I would work on things.  I was shaken that day, but fine until I cried myself to sleep that night.  I have felt worked up and intimidated by this man since I started last year.  I love what I do, and I'm not going to change projects on his account.

I've dealt with some severe anxiety, partially due to my interactions with him.  Last October he chewed me out (no warning) and told me that the door was open if I wanted to go.  I didn't.  Like I said, I love what I do and I want to work on this project.  I started seeing a counselor, who has helped with my anxiety.  Right now, I'm seeing an intern as my counselor is out of town.  She recently found out about a support group in the diversity office for grad students with issues with their advisors.  She hinted that I should make formal complaint against him, but I definitely fear retaliation and I know that no good will come of the complaint.  He's tenured, and things haven't gotten bad enough that anybody would do anything.  And, as it's a small department that I'm in, he would even know an anonymous complaint was me.

I'm posting this here since, as a female engineering PhD student, I don't have many girl friends here to talk about these issues.  I know it's long, but I would really appreciate your thoughts on how I should handle the situation.

37yw92,3,2015-05-31,I don't have a gift!,Jazzmusiek,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37yw92/i_dont_have_a_gift/,"I wish you could be a silent third party observer, like a fly on the wall… Despite my best intentions, I feel as though I made things worse. I’ll try to be detailed. I need your help to make sense of this mess.

Essentially… I’m 22 years old and attending college for media studies. I landed a ton of internships (ex. films, freelance photography, television, news) my freshman and sophomore year…since I didn’t receive as much aid this year, I had to take-on a part-time job.

In order to keep me in the “loop”, Philip (age: 40ish?) has been giving me oddball jobs to do. Since the beginning, Phil has always had my back. He was watching out for me before I even knew who he was. I’ve never had to ask him for anything. I’m his only go-to person. Several months ago he pitched an idea for a script to me. I asked him if he wanted to collaborate, he said yes. I told him then, and many countless times, that writing like that is a bit of an intimate process. Writing a good story involves connecting on a personal level; writing from the inside out. In order for the project to be successful, we would have to be very open/comfortable with eachother. He’s never told me, but I could tell that he was uncomfortable with the idea. . I started us off with exercises to help us better understand our story, ourselves, and eachother. He would always talk about subjects that were off topic, but he’d never talk about himself… A very frustrating process, but he's never done anything like this before. We were able to hammer out notes, but neither of us was very passionate about the story.

A couple of weeks ago, Phil landed a very big opportunity on a major news station… and ofcourse, he worked me in. To show my gratitude, I decided that I would do something nice for him. I knew that I couldn’t ask him what he’d like because he’s modest and would refuse. So I decided that since he likes movies, I’d take him to the theater to go see one. He was ecstatic, he hadn't been to the movies in alittle less than a year.

My average work attire is a comfortable top with long pants. I wear long pants in order to protect my legs from hazards (broken objects, hot equipment, sharp long grass, scraps, falls…etc). On the day I treated Philip to the movies, I wore shorts with an average top. My thoughts: no work today, it’s hot out, it’s just a movie…why the hell not. What I gathered from his thoughts from the expression on his face when I showed up to the theater: OH MY. It then dawned on me, he’s never seen me in shorts before. He thinks I’m showing off. We watched the movie, he gave me a hug, and afterwards we went our separate ways. Now I’m thinking: Okay, it was no big deal.

As I stated before, I shoot a lot of freelance photography, Phil is the one who got me hooked up. We travel together a lot, sometimes to different states. He’s not comfortable with silence. He will talk about bullshit for hours just to avoid a moment of quiet. On one particular trip, Phil had run out of things to say… After a long pause, he then brought up the script. I once again reminded him that writing is very personal. I then revealed a major secret to him, a rough experience with my ex, and that is practically what I used to connect with a character. He took what I told him to heart and he told me a lot about his past/current life. We shared similar experiences, so we were both empathic towards eachother. It was the first time he’d really opened up. Even after our long talk, he let me know subtly that he doesn’t completely trust me…”I would tell you (about a certain topic) but I have to get to know you more”. I didn’t really care because we had made major progress.

We talked more after that, I’d sometimes message him randomly during the week “I’m interested to know how your day went”… He’d call and we’d talk for a bit. What made our talks so great is that he revealed to me a lot of his character/wants… it became easier for me to understand his abstract ideas. I was able to understand his vision. One night I sat myself down at my computer and the words just flowed. I finished with a nice fat wad of script. Real progress at last! I decided that I’d surprise him by delivering the finished pages to his door step with a cup of coffee…

Me (Text): What time do you usually eat breakfast?

Phil (Text): 11:30 or noon

Me (Text): Ha that’s lunch! What time are you due to get up tomorrow?

Phil (Text): Early, I’m working. If you want to grab breakfast next week is good

Me (Text): Okay, just tell me when… How early is early?

Phil (Text): 9:30 is about the earliest... I actually don't know my call time yet.

Me (Text): Okay, I might call you in the morning.

Phil (Voicemail): Hey…uh uh um… yeah, I’m not sure when I need to leave in the morning exactly. Try to give me a call if you want… yeah, um… you’re just a friend… I appreciate ya. You don’t have to do anything special for me. I’m good. I appreciate the friendship… No need to buy me breakfast but if you want to hang out, that’s okay.

Me (Call): Ha, don’t worry. I don’t want anything for you. You’re the one who suggested breakfast. I just wanted to drop something off.

Phil (Call): I didn’t think you wanted anything from me. Just didn’t want you to go out of your way. I appreciate your friendship!

Me (Call): I have to work in the morning but I’m spending tonight nearby. Depending on the circumstances, I was going to try to drop something off in the morning. I didn’t want to tell you because you’d expect it. It was suppose to be a bit of a surprise. As for me buying things, it’s no big deal, I enjoy treating my friends… Besides, it’s the least I could do. I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable.

Phil (Call): That’s sweet of you. I appreciate it. Not too often does anybody go out of their way to do something nice for me. I just uh… you’re not making me feel uncomfortable… I was thinking about you… You know, money is hard to come by these days and uh… you know, spend it on somebody that…uh, is probably more worthy of it than a old sack of potatoes like me. I’d rather just try to look out for you. I’m good, I don’t need anything… but I do appreciate you thinking about me and taking the time. That’s very nice. So if you feel compelled, it’s not necessary. I appreciate your friendship. I enjoy your friendship, so if you want to drop something off, go ahead.

**6:30 turned out to be his call time... too early for me. I told him that I'd wait until next week.

Oh my. I've caught myself in a bit of a predicament... I'm embarrassed. Obviously he's felt that I've been hitting on him for a while. If I tell him the truth, he might just think that I'm making up excuses to save face. Not cool. 
Getting rejected by him really hurt. I don't believe that I have hidden feelings for him... It's as if he told me randomly...""Hey, I know you kinda well and I think your nice.... but just so you know, I wouldn't fuck you"". Ouch.  
What do I make of this? 
Did I do something wrong? 
Did I accidently damage the relationship I had with this guy? 
If he does assume I'm lying. Is there any way I could use this to our advantage? If he believed his twenty-something-year-old friend has a crush on him, would it give him more confidence in himself? 
Would he trust me more? Is there a possiblity that he would open up more from this? 
I don't have a ""gift""!"

In my experience no C++ compilation has given my Atom tablet a run for its money but Cygwin and MinGW are not 100% reliable.

37za4w,16,2015-05-31,Indian Kitchens.,JJJHeimer_Schmidt,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/37za4w/indian_kitchens/,"Indian Kitchens are known for their strange standards. I've never actually seen or worked in a kitchen abroad, so i'm not sure how to compare.      

I have just finished 3 years of a degree in Hotel Management, with my focus in kitchen. The college could have been better, though I did learn a lot.  
Kitchen practicals were ok, the chef had limited knowledge(always said that Hamburgers got their name because ham was used in the burger, not kidding). Apart from that, sad ingredients, limited ingredients, and pretty horrid standard recipes.  
   
In my second year, we had our practicals in the quantity kitchen. It was never cleaned thoroughly, had roaches in every pot and corner. One day I was the chef on duty, I ordered a student to scrub the handles of the pot he had just used, it was greasy and had some cockroaches running in and out of the handle. He said he won't clean it 'cause they would just come back, I told him that because no one is cleaning it, they are coming back. The Mentality!   
  
As part of the degree, we had to intern in a hotel for 5 months. I saw this as my chance to work in a real kitchen with he right standards. I was partly wrong.   

I went for an interview at the- well some hotel in Mumbai. A hotel of great history and the Hotel group's flagship hotel. A 'five star' property. I got in! my hopes were up. I started my internship with 3 weeks in their Bakery, those weeks covered Christmas and new Years. We were made to mix a tub of plum pudding batter(for ~800 puddings) with our bare hands. I once gave the chef a shock by shouting out that I lost my ring, i was joking, he fucking flipped. It was pretty great, the bakery. New year's i got to work with liquid Nitrogen and all the staff got drunk after midnight(all the beverage storage would conveniently go unlocked).  
  
I was then moved to another restaurant for 2 weeks. Was made to cut fruit for the next day's breakfast buffet, clean lettuce, make potato baskets, mise-en-place etc. There were no peelers, so had to peel skins with a knife, my unskilled hand would waste lots. But the chefs didn't mind, everyone wasted, and a lot. ""This is the T**, they have the money"" they said.  

One day there was to be an inspection, so I had to cover all the old date tags with the previous day's date tag in the cold storage, sneaky.  

But I learnt a lot, patience, my hand at with the blade and the importance of speed.  
  
Then I was shifted to another Kitchen, this time a smaller one. Here I got some hands on experience! I got to actually cook! At one time during a dinner party, all the chefs left at the same time for a smoke break, leaving me alone in the kitchen. A minute they had gone and orders started pouring in, and I was on fire. Not literally. That was the best 10 minutes of my life, it was like conducting an orchestra. Well most of the food was partially cooked, but I could at least cook the prawns till perfect(the chef would overcook them to hell), and that brought me great satisfaction.  

There were a few sad things like over processing the chicken mince for the burgers till it was pasty, or that one day when a Jain Family(Jains are a religious group and cannot eat anything that grows underground, roots) ordered some 'Jain Bhel Puri' and the chef did not seem to care that there was white radish in the chutney. One time a guest asked for skimmed milk, to my protest I was made to add water to the milk and send it out.  
And again I had to tag really old ingredients with new tags.     
I even remember the service staff dipping their fingers in the guest's milkshake before it went out to see if it was sweet enough.  
  
I'm not sure whether the above is common in other kitchens. Or usual that a 5 star hotel uses McCain chips, Venkies Chicken Nuggets or Cheap; Frozen; fillets of Basa Fish(Catfish) in their kitchens.  

Forget about sanitation, the 'wash hands' bell was never heeded and hands were rarely sanitized. Cutting boards were occasionally used for both meat and veg.             

But out of any experience, you learn something, boy I did.  

TL;DR: My few experiences working in kitchens in India. Bit of a rant, but wondering if kitchens out there have similar stuff going on."
37zbrg,42,2015-05-31,Independence and money: my bitcoin story,dhruvio,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/37zbrg/independence_and_money_my_bitcoin_story/,"About a year ago, my bank (Citibank Singapore) charged a large amount to my credit card for no reason. Since then, I've been dealing with their customer service, trying to get them to reverse the charge. It's been an infuriating process, but, in some ways, a lesson in Buddhism too. In any case, I just finished lodging a complaint with the Consumer Affairs group in Singapore. Consequently, I'm in a mood to write and annoyed at banks: it seems like a good time to share why I got into Bitcoin. Here is my Bitcoin story.

I used to be in investment banking. Debt trading and sales, to be specific, in Singapore. For the longest time, I wanted to get into banking. Why? The same reason everyone else wants to: money. I grew up with my sister and mum in Australia, my dad left when I was young. Times were tough financially, but with some luck, my sister and I managed to get into private schools on scholarships. While, to our mother's delight, we received a good education, we were the poor kids. I'd say the stark socioeconomic difference between our peers and us affected me a lot more than my sister, especially as a teen. Hence, money was always on my mind, and I thought banking would be a good way “out.”

We both ended up pursuing higher education in Australia; I got a degree in Finance and my sister is still pursuing her postgrad in Medicine. In the second year of my degree, I got an internship at an investment bank in Hong Kong and Singapore. It was great, it afforded me the opportunity to work, travel and build up some capital when I eventually joined the bank full time. But, somewhere deep inside myself, I knew the work was bull shit and didn't really have any meaning, except to satisfy the lavish and greedy tastes of people in the industry.

What do I mean? Banking is what I would call a ""circular"" industry. I would say 70-90% of my clients were other banks and financial institutions. And the same applies for those clients. Which just means all banks are simply reallocating money amongst themselves in an incestuous kind of way, taking fees as each cent passes through them. The other 10-30% of clients are where the ""fresh money"" comes from, people like you and me, putting our savings into investment funds that eventually get roped into the fee-fest known as banking.

The fees taken out of the money we invest through financial services (e.g. mutual funds, savings accounts) are what constitute the billions upon billions of dollars in revenues financial institutions make each year. That's money that you and I have worked hard for. Why? The answer to that question is the same reason I left banking: because bankers only care about money. To be more specific, they only care about taking your money for themselves.

Enter Bitcoin.

I first heard about Bitcoin sometime in 2012 on a tech blog. I didn’t think much of it. But, on a different, seemingly ordinary, day in 2013 I decided to buy some. In fact, I put all of my savings into Bitcoin. It wasn’t much at the time, and I was 22 and had a well-paying job — I figured I could take the risk.

I don’t know what specifically pushed me to take the leap so quickly, but there was something ethereal that struck me about Bitcoin. It was simple, and most of all, made sense. We all deal with money everyday, its the blood that runs through our world’s economy. Why should a group of individuals profit from that without creating any value? It has given us, people, an opportunity to exist independent of banks, which I think is a phenomenal achievement.

I don’t have much more to say about Bitcoin here, mainly because most people in this subreddit are familiar with its traits. But in case you aren’t, you’re only a Google search away from enlightenment.

I left banking in 2014. I’ve been coding since I was a kid, so I subsequently built a small web app that got noticed by a few companies in the Bay Area. I’m now a software engineer here in California, building web apps for people.

Thanks for reading."

I am close to six feet tall, average but trim build, with brown hair and blue eyes. I have a youthful face that suggests there is a lot of fun under the layers of suits, oxford shirts, and ties that needs to be unpackaged. I'm sexually experienced, but am in a rut with my wife who isn't satisfying me as much as she used to.

Me and your dad were friends in college and he called me about your situation. You just turned 18 and graduated high school and are headed off to college in the fall. You wanted to go travel and have a lot of fun with your friends, but your dad is insisting that you find a job for the summer. He knew I was important in my company and that I'd be willing to help him out by lining up an internship for you during the summer. As a bonus, I was willing to let you stay in the little apartment above our garage while you worked for my firm.

You are an attractive young woman who's just not quite confident in her shoes. You have the body men want, but you don't quite know how to use it to your advantage. We can work out your exact details when you PM me.

37zme5,1,2015-05-31,My [20F] brother [24M] adopted an abandoned dog and is now expecting my parents [50's] to take care of her.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37zme5/my_20f_brother_24m_adopted_an_abandoned_dog_and/,"OK, so about an hour ago I got a text from my dad (who is on vacation with my mom) that was a picture of a puppy and a message that said ""Meet your new sister!"". Now this is pretty shocking to me and here's why: My family already has two dogs and have fostered a dog in the past. We were considering fostering again but one of our dogs is very old and its becoming obvious that she's near her end so we decided not to add stress by bringing in a new dog.

So I called my dad kind of stunned and I guess he didn't realize I could hear him when he answered the phone because I heard him say ""... take us for granted"". I asked him what was going on and he told me that my brother saw a facebook post about a dog that was abandoned in the floods and would be put down if no one claimed her. I'm pretty sure that this was not done through a shelter because obviously they didn't check to see if my brother could actually take care of her, which he can't. I don't know if his apartment doesn't allow dogs, he can't afford her, or maybe he never intended on keeping her anyway.

So now my parents are stuck with training what we think is an 8 week old dog (don't know the breed). I've told my parents to leave training to me the next time they get a dog but I am out of town for the summer for an internship. 

I would personally like to find a new home for her since I am really concerned about our older dogs health and would hate for her last days to be stressful. I am also very angry on behalf of my parents since it doesn't seem like he really considered any sort of consequences. 

I don't know if my parents have talked about finding a new home but when I talked to them they made it sound like she was ours now. Even though they weren't ecstatic. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a really long talk about it with my brother and he made a heartfelt plea for the dog to stay. I also don't think he intends on training the dog. Financially, no the dog would not be a burden but the effort it takes to bring a new puppy into the house is really not something my parents need right now and I'm kind of pissed because I wouldn't be there to help during the days either. 

So really this whole situation is confusing because I feel like this is more about my brother taking my parents for granted but now there's a dog's life (and possibly another's) wrapped up in this situation. I will be flying home on friday, what do we do?


   
**tl;dr**: Brother got a new puppy without telling us and is expecting my parents to take care of it even though we already have two, one of which is on her last legs. How do we handle this?"
37zykr,1,2015-05-31,"I'm [27M] experiencing the first ""rough patch"" with my girlfriend [26F] of 5 months and unsure how to respond or proceed",dumdumthrowawayfart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/37zykr/im_27m_experiencing_the_first_rough_patch_with_my/,"Hello reddit,


I apologize in advance for the wall of text and if this post seems unorganized - I'm trying to provide as much information as possible, so hopefully it makes sense.


First off, I have a great girlfriend.  We met on match.com and the past 5 months have been some of the best in my entire life.  She's so fun to be around and there's so much that I like about her.  One of the things I like most about her is that I'm able to be myself in her presence - something I was unable to do in previous relationships.


The past 2 weeks have been particularly difficult for me, for a number of reasons.  I just started a summer internship that is out of state 2 weeks ago, so this summer for us is a bit of a ""long term relationship.""  I'm only able to see her a few weekends throughout the summer, so at least for me, it has added some stress in my life.  Additionally, she has a very stressful job - she is an accountant in the entertainment industry and the past few weeks have been filled with her preparing for a large stadium show that was in town last night and also preparing for additional events throughout June.  Furthermore, she has the added stress of her sister coming in from overseas for a couple of weeks, her mom coming in from out of state for a couple of weeks, and also going on a trip down south this week with her sister and her boyfriend.  I also just finished moving into a new apartment the past couple of weekends and my sister just had an operation to treat her skin cancer.  Lots of things going on in our lives that have created a lot of stress for the both of us.


This is where the relationship has me confused.  We were perfect the first few months of our relationship - one minor fight and an amazing chemistry.  Recently I haven't felt as positive about things.  She seems distant, almost checked out a little bit.  She's not her normal self and I feel like she is not interested in me or the things going on in my life.  I feel like she doesn't want me around at times and it makes me feel really paranoid.  I confronted her (very poorly) about this last week, and she just said she has a lot of stress in her life right now (see above).  She also said that with this stress she sometimes doesn't have the time to think about me :(.


Additionally, our sex life has been lacking.  She's on birth control, but it started acting crazy and she had a 3-4 week long period about a month ago, and then she got a UTI 2 weeks ago.  We haven't had sex in 2+ weeks and she is now scared of sex because of the UTI - so we haven't been intimate and that makes the distance between us feel significantly larger.  Furthermore, there always seems to be something that comes up that prevents us from having sex - i.e. she has a headache, or a stomachache, or is really tired.  In the beginning months of our relationship her sex drive was really high and we had an awesome sex life.  


All of these things combined have turned me into a very different person - I'm not myself anymore.  I hardly joke with her for fear of pissing her off, I'm afraid to talk about things in my life because I feel she is not interested in them, and I'm scared to talk about our relationship because I don't want to add any further stress in her life.  It also has me unsure of how to act around her - I was really quiet Friday night when I saw her (me not being myself) and she got mad at me because she thought I was being grumpy.  I'll also add that when I talked to her she kind of diminished my feeling of uneasiness by saying that I ""stress over the little things too much.""

During all this stress that she's been going through, I've tried to be a very optimistic and supportive boyfriend.  But at times it gets exhausting trying to help someone who shuts down your advice or optimism and rejects your flirtatious advances.  



I seek your advice because I'm not sure what to do.  I'm an overly sensitive guy at times, so maybe the fact that I'm not talking to her about this and being so far away from her has me overanalyzing things.  Is this just a rough patch that I need to wait out?  Is this a non-issue and something I need to get over?  How could I talk to her without upsetting her or adding any stress?  Do I bring up our sex life and if so, how do I do it without complaining or freaking her out even more?


Oh, some useful information - she's not a confrontational person and I think she doesn't handle her stress very well...?


Also, to add into all of this, I really like this girl and am starting to feel like maybe I love her.  I don't want to lose her.  This is my first relationship in 5+ years, so maybe I'm a n00b again, but my confidence has taken a hit.


Sorry again for the length and if it is confusing.  Any advice will help and I will try to answer any questions you have.


tl;dr My relationship with my girlfriend has hit it's first rough patch (according to me) and I'm unsure how to proceed or handle the situation from afar without stressing her out even more.  Maybe I'm being a big baby, or maybe there really is something going on here.  Either way, I want our relationship to succeed."

I know I want to buy clothes that can both be worn for my internship and for just going out with friends. But primarily, I want to make sure I cover all the basics for the business casual dress requirement first. If there is any overlap, those pieces would be preferred.

I have received a $150 gift card to J. Crew, a $50 gift card to H&amp;M, $100 to use anywhere, and $50 gift card to Amazon (mostly for a new casual watch, but doesn't have to be).

Since I'm going to be attending Purdue for the next 4 years pursuing my engineering degree, I want to make sure that I'm making an investment in a computer that is worthwhile and compatible with all of the classes.  

I might as well state right out that my preferred OS is Mac, however I don't mind using Windows if it is more compatible with the software that Engineering students at Purdue use.  Price isn't really an issue, I just want to make sure software compatibility is not an issue.  On the FYE website it is stated that any modern computer will do whether it runs a Mac or Windows based OS, however I have heard that people having issues running certain engineering software on Mac.  Has anyone out there with a Mac experienced issues/avoidable complications due to software incompatibility with a Mac OS?

Also as far as internships go, if anyone has any experience, do they provide you with a company computer to do work for them with or do they expect you to be able to run any software that they utilize on your college computer?

Also this isn't meant to start a Mac vs. PC debate, I've heard enough of it and an OS is just an OS.  I simply want to know whether software compatibility has ever been an issue :)

15 influence spent (max 15)

54 cards (min 45)  
Cards up to Breaker Bay  

Deck built on [NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com).

Before I get into the deck and how it played, I just want to give a shout out and thanks to Dogs of War Gaming in Palm Bay, FL for hosting the event, and for streaming the whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR: IG goes 5-0 in Swiss, and 0-1 in Top 8 cut due to Noise milling ICE needed to secure R&amp;amp;D against Medium dig.

The inspiration for this deck came from 3 sources: the Bloodlock deck from a few months ago, Cory from the Atlanta Regional steam, and my own desire as a Jinteki player to play and understand each ID in the faction. IG ended up being relatively ignored due to how close it released compared to the Order and Chaos spoilers, as well as the fact that the ability, at first glance, is equal parts odd and somewhat replicated via other cards (i.e. Encryption Protocol). Turns out, however, making stuff harder to trash without using other cards is pretty damn good and slows runners down as they try to catch up to your board state.

Another thing to recall is that, since this is a Jinteki deck, net damage is a real threat. This deck isn't even close to being a kill deck, and yet I had 2 flatlines on the day due to enticing runners into servers they had no business going into with their current set-up (more on that later). The important thing to remember is that, when a runner takes damage, they have to draw back up to avoid that ugly ""not dying"" thing.

I swapped the influence around compared to Bloodlock to get more ETR, taxing ICE for remotes. I never really used the Archived Memories in testing with that deck, so I decided to use that influence to tax out runners further on my remote, allowing Ash to do even more work than he already does. Tollbooth wasn't even broken on the day, and taxed about 6-9 credits over the Swiss rounds.

Here's the round-by-round breakdown:

Round 1: Played against Magnum Opus Kit, who, on turn 1, installed 2 cards, played Maker's Eye into my open R&amp;amp;D, and proceeded to die to a Snare. Don't run with 2 cards against Jinteki, kids. We played a fun game with the extra time in the round, which went MUCH better for the Kit player, who made bank with Magnum, and even Escher'ed dead ICE into my scoring remote. However, thanks to Interns and Jackson (Praise be to Him), I was able to trash and re-install ICE onto the server before I could lose Caprice/Ash and score out with my piles of asset money.

Round 2: Played against Andromeda ""The Deck"". I started with a hand full of ICE, surprisingly, which I used to lock down the centrals on the first few turns. Andy wasn't able to build up an early lead thanks to that, and had no money until finding a Kati Jones in the midgame. By that time, I was sitting on 15-20 credits reliably, with most ICE rezzed. Caprice did work in the remote, and I scored out 7-2, with the runner stealing a Fetal AI. No assets were trashed except one Sundew I put into my remote for a few turns to build up stupid cash piles.

Round 3: Played against Leela with the good criminal cards. Thanks go to Tsurugi in this matchup, as this ICE forced out Faerie plays early, and a surprise Snare in a remote hit Mimic. From there, the centrals were locked down, and, despite the Runner finding 5 points early (thanks R&amp;amp;D /s), I scored 7 straight in the remote and managed to deck the runner at the same time.

Round 4: Played against Prepaid Ken Tenma, who was one of the only people on the day to frequently check the archives, and rather than lose the 1 card left in his hand, decided to keep an early Shi-Kyu (this is relevant later). We go back and forth on money, with me breaking ahead on points 5-1 with an IAA Future Perfect behind Tollbooth and Ashigaru w/ Caprice/Ash. He glory runs into R&amp;amp;D with The Maker's Eye and then Same Old Thing Maker's Eye, and finds 5 points of agendas, not winning out thanks to the Shi Kyu he took early in the game. Scored out next turn for the win. Closest game on the day by far.&lt;/p&gt;

Round 5: Ended up sitting in on one of the top tables, and was on [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=AjgeJLdz6sk#t=4848). Played against another Good Stuff Leela deck, who was digging hard for HQ pressure against my open HQ. I only had enough ICE to protect random accesses on R&amp;amp;D, as my deck was only spitting assets my way. I was making stupid money, but had nothing to spend it on, so I made a weird play: I left 4 cards in HQ, trying to entice the Legwork, and that shit somehow worked. Next turn, Leela draws with Mr Li twice, Legworks in, and hits both Snares. Flatline on stream. Awww yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

This deck ended up undefeated (5-0) in the Swiss, which I confidently took to the first round of double-elimination against Noise. I knew that, once Noise was set-up, I'd be in trouble, so I let his mills fill Archives for me, and rushed out a remote to score into. I had 5 points after about 10 turns (definitely a record for the deck), but Noise found the right tools he needed after that, blew up the ICE on R&amp;amp;D, and Medium dug for 7 points, with Hades Fragment giving it up at the end. If he had found the Snare in my deck rather than that agenda, I would have flatlined the Noise player, having stole a Fetal AI and finding 2 Shocks on the dig runs, but, alas, it wasn't meant to be. He milled most of my ICE, and so blowing up R&amp;amp;D wasn't too tough for him.

Overall, this deck plays like a combination of old school PE and RP: tax the runner out with damage, make assets too tough to trash, to the point that the runner breaks their own back keeping up with the board state. I had a player at, one point, access Caprice in HQ, and wanted to trash it until I reminded them that she was 5 Credits and 1 net damage to trash. He left it in HQ, which I then promptly put into my scoring remote.

This deck is slow, is a gross slog to play against, and completely took everyone by surprise because of the reputation that IG has as a ""gimmicky"" ID. I developed a phrase over the course of the day, and that phrase was ""Break the Meta,"" which I am naming this deck in order to tell folks that no ID is gimmicky or bad, it's just a matter of finding the cards, strategy and playstyle necessary to make it work.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to drop a line below, and I will do my best to answer and reply. Go out there, and Break the Meta!

[Product Page](http://www.redwingshoes.com/red-wing-shoe/1698-red-wing-shoes/1698-red-wing-womens-9-inch-logger-lineman-black)

Something a bit different. I’ll try my best with this review as they are not mine, they lie outside the realm of footwear that I am familiar with, and I will almost certainly never need to own a boot like this for my entire life. However, I think they’re pretty bad ass, so, onward!

**Backstory**

My SO landed a 3 month long internship in Montana doing invasive species research and fire prevention.  She needed a good boot that would hold up in extreme conditions and last her a while so I got these for her as a going away present. I have owned a pair of Red Wings before from the heritage line and knew that their work boot line was held in high regard. This will be part one of a two-part review. The second one will go up when she comes back with her nicely beat up boots for a before and after comparison. 

**Purchasing**

Fortunately, there is a Red Wings store within reasonable driving distance and she was able to go in and get sized. Before she went in I conversed with an associate about the availability of the boot and whether or not this was a good option from them based on what it was to be used for. He was immensely helpful and was patient while I ran through my list of questions I had for him. 

According to the associate I spoke with, many times women seeking this type of boot will size down accordingly from the men’s version, and not bother with getting the women’s. This is primarily because the boot either has to be made or moved from somewhere else due to the fact that the sales volume for the women’s version is significantly lower than the men’s. However when speaking to the associate he explained that even though the women’s boot has to be made or moved from somewhere else, you are not obligated to commit to it unless it fits properly. I thought this was great customer service. He further recommended that she go with the women’s as the last that the women’s version is built on has been reviewed as much more friendly to women’s feet than the men’s. Not sure in what way specifically but given that there was no real risk in getting the women’s, she decided to go with that. 

**Quality and Construction**

My first reaction was that they are pretty damn solid, sturdy throughout the toe with the tongue and shaft being nice and supple. Didn’t see any real quality issues with the leather aside from a bit of lose grain on rear quarter of the left boot.  The soles are Vibram lug fire and ice. They were oiled upon purchasing at the Redwing store and the leather felt soft but extremely durable. I hit them with a coat of heavy duty leather protector after letting them dry for 24 hrs (pictures reflect post oil, pre hdlp) for added preotection.  She said that the slightly higher heel provided good support after wearing them for extended periods of time while she was breaking them in. She said although there was some discomfort from break in brand new boots, they did feel sturdy and comfortable. 

**Sizing**

After being measured on a brannock device and their electronic measuring device they recommended she go a half size down from her brannock for the women’s version of the boot. She said there was a bit of heel slip but they were snug and comfortable everywhere else. I suspect that the heel slip was a result from the boots not being entirely broken in yet. 

**Conclusion**

After considering some higher tier options like White’s smokejumpers, I really feel that this was a good mid-range option for her that she will be able to use farther into her career until she wants to splurge on something like White’s. Red Wing’s customer service was absolutely fantastic and the construction of the boots I think speak for themselves. I am eager to see how they look after getting nice and beat up. Let me know if you have any further questions.

380n59,3,2015-05-31,"Low GPA, 2 Years Experience, No Internship? Information Tech and Support",flingthing76,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/380n59/low_gpa_2_years_experience_no_internship/,"Its the summer right now and I am looking for advice on how I can improve myself to get an internship. Current I have a 2.6 GPA and found that most companies require a 3.0. I went through a difficult time dealing with depression and have been trying since to get my GPA back up to that level. Besides that I have been working two years on campus as tech support in a team of 12 for the college and surrounding farms and extension centers. When I mention this to recruiters though I usually get shot down with a ""We want to see more extracurriculars and different experiences. "" I really haven't had time for clubs and stuff since I spend most of my time working and studying. I thought the job experience would get me a good head start though. Right now I am taking summer classes and doing some Security/White Hat experience on my own. Would anyone have any advice or guidance on how I can find more Information Tech Internships that will look past my low GPA?


Thanks!"
